suddenly anita can harness both their powers she can feel their hearts hear their thoughts know their hungers nothing can save anita from a twist of fate that draws her ever closer to the brink of humanity to finally surrender to the bloodlust the beast and the desire transforming her body and consuming her soul june had come in like its usual hot sweaty self but a freak cold front had moved in during the night and the car radio had been full of the record low temperatures it was only in the low sixties not that cold but after weeks of eighty and ninetyplus it felt downright frigid my best friend ronnie sims and i were sitting in my jeep with the windows down letting the unseasonably cool air drift in on us ronnie had turned thirty tonight we were talking about how she felt about the big and other girl talk considering that shes a private detective and i raise the dead for a living it was pretty ordinary talk sex guys turning thirty vampires werewolves you know the usual we could have gone inside the house but there is something about the intimacy of a car after dark that makes you want to linger or maybe it was the sweet smell of springlike air coming through the windows like the caress of some halfremembered lover okay so hes a werewolf no ones perfect ronnie said date him sleep with him marry him my votes for richard i know you dont like jeanclaude dont like him her hands gripped the passengerside door handle squeezing it until i could see the tension in her shoulders i think she was counting to ten if i killed as easily as you do id have killed that son of a bitch two years ago and your life would be a lot less complicated now that last was an understatement but i dont want him dead ronnie hes a vampire anita he is dead she turned and looked at me in the dark her soft gray eyes and yellow hair had turned to silver and near white in the cold light of the stars the shadows and bright reflected light left her face in bold relief like some modern painting but the look on her face was almost frightening there was a fearful determination there if it had been me with that look on my face id have warned me not to do anything stupid like kill jeanclaude but ronnie wasnt a shooter shed killed twice both times to save my life i owed her but she wasnt a person who could hunt someone down in cold blood and kill him not even a vampire i knew this about her so i didnt have to caution her i used to think i knew what dead was or wasnt ronnie i shook my head the line isnt so clearcut he seduced you she said i looked away from her angry face and stared at the foilwrapped swan in my lap deirdorfs and hart where wed had dinner got creative with their doggy bags foilwrapped animals i couldnt argue with ronnie and i was getting tired of trying finally i said every lover seduces you ronnie thats the way it works she slammed her hands so hard onto the dashboard it startled me and must have hurt her damn it anita its not the same i was starting to get angry and i didnt want to be angry not with ronnie i had taken her out to dinner to make her feel better not to fight louis fane her steady boyfriend was out of town at a conference and she was bummed about that and about turning thirty so id tried to make her feel better and she seemed determined to make me feel worse look i havent seen either jeanclaude or richard for six months im not dating either of them so we can skip the lecture on vampire ethics now thats an oxymoron she said what is i asked vampire ethics she said i frowned at her thats not fair ronnie you are a vampire executioner anita you are the one who taught me that they arent just people with fangs they are monsters id had enough i opened the car door and slid to the edge of the seat ronnie grabbed my shoulder anita im sorry im sorry please dont be mad i didnt turn around i sat there with my feet hanging out the door the cool air creeping into the closer warmth of the car then drop it ronnie i mean drop it she leaned over and gave me a quick hug from behind im sorry its none of my business who you sleep with i leaned into the hug for a moment thats right its not then i pulled away and got out of the car my high heels crunched on the gravel of my driveway ronnie had wanted us to dress up so we had it was her birthday it wasnt until after dinner that id realized her diabolical scheme shed had me wear heels and a nice little black skirt outfit the top was actually gasp a wellfitted halter top or would that be backless evening wear however pricey it was it was still a very short skirt and a halter top ronnie had helped me pick the outfit out about a week ago i should have known her innocent oh lets just both dress up was a ruse there had been other dresses that covered more skin and had longer hemlines but none that camouflaged the bellyband holster that cut across my lower waist id actually taken the holster along with us on the shopping trip just to be sure ronnie thought i was being paranoid but i dont go anywhere after dark unarmed period the skirt was just roomy enough and black enough to hide the fact that i wore the belly band and a firestar mm the top was heavy enough material what there was of it that you really couldnt see the handle of the gun under the cloth all i had to do was lift the bottom of the top and the gun was right there ready to be drawn it was the most userfriendly dressy outfit id ever owned made me wish they made it in a different color so i could have two of them ronnies plan had been to go to a club on her birthday a dance club eek i never went to clubs i did not dance but i went in with her yes she got me out on the floor mainly because her dancing alone was attracting too much unwanted male attention at least with both of us dancing together the wouldbe casanovas stayed at a distance though saying i danced was inaccurate i stood there and sort of swayed ronnie danced she danced like it was her last night on earth and she had to put every muscle to good use it was spectacular and a little frightening there was something almost desperate to it as if ronnie felt the cold hand of time creeping up faster and faster or maybe that was just me projecting my own insecurities id turned twentysix early in the year and frankly at the rate i was going i probably wouldnt have to worry about hitting thirty death cures all ills well most of them there had been one man who had attached himself to me instead of ronnie i didnt understand why she was a tall leggy blond dancing like she was having sex with the music but he offered me drinks i dont drink he tried to slow dance i refused i finally had to be rude ronnie told me to dance with him at least he was human i told her that birthday guilt only went so far and shed used hers up the last thing on gods green earth that i needed was another man in my life i didnt have a clue what to do with the two i had already the fact that they were respectively a master vampire and an ulfric werewolf king was only part of the problem that fact alone should let you know just how deep a hole i was digging or would that be already have dug yeah already dug i was about halfway to china and still throwing dirt up in the air id been celibate for six months so as far as i knew had they everyone was waiting for me to make up my mind waiting for me to choose or decide something anything id been a rock for half a year because id stayed away from them i hadnt seen them in the flesh anyway i had returned no phone calls i had run for the hills at the first hint of cologne why such drastic measures frankly because almost every time i saw them i fell off the chastity wagon they both had my libido but i was trying to decide who had my heart i still didnt know the only thing i had decided was that it was time to stop hiding i had to see them and figure out what we were all going to do id decided two weeks ago that i needed to see them it was the day that i refilled my birthcontrol pill prescription and started taking it again the very last thing i needed was a surprise pregnancy that the first thing i thought of when i thought of richard and jeanclaude was to go back on birth control tells you something about the effect they had on me you needed to be on the pill for at least a month to be safe or as safe as you ever got four more weeks five to be sure then id call maybe i heard ronnies heels running on the gravel anita anita wait dont be angry the thing was i wasnt angry with her i was angry with me angry that after all these months i still couldnt decide between the two men i stopped walking and waited for her huddled in my little black skirt outfit the little foil swan in my hands the night had turned cool enough to make me wish id worn a jacket when ronnie caught up with me i started walking again im not mad ronnie just tired tired of you my family dolph zerbrowski everyone being so damned judgmental my heels hit the sidewalk with sharp clacks jeanclaude had once said he could tell if i was angry just by the sound of my heels on the floor watch your step youre wearing higher heels than i am ronnie was five feet eight which meant with heels she was nearly six feet i was wearing twoinch heels which put me at five five i get a much better workout when ronnie and i jog together than she does the phone was ringing as i juggled the key and the foilwrapped leftovers ronnie took the leftovers and i shoved the door open with my shoulder i was running across the floor in my high heels before i remembered that i was on vacation which meant whatever emergency was calling at in the morning was not my problem not for another two weeks at least but old habits die hard and i was at the phone before i remembered i actually let the machine pick up while i stood there heart pounding i was planning on ignoring it but but i still stood ready to grab the receiver just in case loud booming music and a mans voice i didnt recognize the music but i recognized the voice anita its gregory nathaniels in trouble gregory was one of the wereleopards id inherited when i killed their alpha their leader as a human i wasnt really up to the job but until i found a replacement even i was better than nothing wereanimals without a dominant to protect them were anyones meat and if someone moved in and slaughtered them it would sort of be my fault so i acted as their protector but the job was more complicated than id ever dreamed nathaniel was the problem all the others were rebuilding their lives since their old leader had been killed but not nathaniel hed had a hard life abused raped pimped out and topped topped meant hed been someones slave as in sex and pain he was one of the few true submissives id ever met though admittedly my pool of acquaintance was limited i cursed softly and picked up the phone im here gregory whats happened now even to me my voice sounded tired and halfangry if i had anyone else to call anita id call them but youre it he sounded tired and angry too great wheres elizabeth she was supposed to be riding herd on nathaniel tonight id finally agreed that nathaniel could start going out to the dominance and submission clubs if he was accompanied by elizabeth and at least one other wereleopard tonight it had been gregory riding shotgun but without elizabeth gregory wasnt dominant enough to keep nathaniel safe a normal submissive would have been safe in one of the clubs with someone there to simply say no thanks well pass but nathaniel was one of those rare subs who are almost incapable of saying no and there had been hints made that his idea of pain and sex could be very extreme which meant that he might say yes to things that were very very bad for him wereanimals can take a lot of injury and not be permanently damaged but there is a limit a healthy bottom will say stop when hes had too much or he feels something bad happening but nathaniel wasnt that healthy so he had keepers with him to make sure no one really bad got ahold of him but it was more than that a good dominant trusts his sub to say when before the damage is too great the dom trusts the sub to know his own body and have enough selfpreservation to call out before he is in past what his body can take nathaniel did not come with that safety feature which meant a dominant with the best of intentions could end up hurting him badly before realizing nathaniel wouldnt help himself i actually had accompanied nathaniel a few times as his nimirra it was sort of my job to interview prospective keepers id gone prepared for the clubs to be one of the lower circles of hell and had been pleasantly shocked id had more trouble with sexual propositions in a normal bar on a saturday night in the clubs everyone was very careful not to impose on you or to be seen as pushy it was a small community and if you got a reputation for being obnoxious you could find yourself blacklisted with no one to play with id found the people in the scene were polite and once you made it clear you were not there to play no one bothered you except tourists tourists were posers people not really into the scene who liked to dress up and frequent the clubs they didnt know the rules and hadnt bothered to ask they probably thought a woman who would come to a place like this would do anything id persuaded them differently but id had to stop going with nathaniel the other wereleopards said i gave off so much dominant vibe that no dominant would ever approach nathaniel while i was with him though wed had offers for mйnages а trois of every description i felt like i needed a button that said no i dont want to have a bondage threeway with you thanks for asking though elizabeth had supposedly been dominant but not too much to take nathaniel out and try to pick him up a date elizabeth left gregory said without nathaniel i made it a question yes well that just fries my bacon i said what he asked im angry with elizabeth it gets better he said how much better can it be gregory you all assured me that these clubs were safe a little bondage a little light slap and tickle you all convinced me that i couldnt keep nathaniel away from it indefinitely you said that they had ways to monitor the area so no one could possibly get hurt thats what you and zane and cherry told me hell ive seen it myself there are safety monitors everywhere its safer than some dates ive had so what could have possibly gone wrong we couldnt have anticipated this he said just get to the end of the story gregory the foreplay is getting tedious there was silence for longer than there should have been just the overly loud music gregory are you still there gregory is indisposed a mans voice said who is this i am marco if that helps you though i doubt that it does his voice was cultured american but upper crusty new in town are you i asked something like that he said welcome to town make sure you go up in the arch while youre here its a nice view but what has your recent arrival in st louis got to do with me and mine we didnt realize it was your pet we had at first he wasnt the one we were hunting for but now that we have him were keeping him you cant keep him i said come down and take him away from us if you can that strangely smooth voice made the threat all the more effective there was no anger nothing personal it sounded like business and i had no clue what it was about put gregory back on i said i dont think so hes enjoying some personal time with my friends right now how do i know hes still alive my voice was as unemotional as his i wasnt feeling anything yet it was too sudden too unexpected like coming in on the middle of a movie no ones dead yet the man said how do i know that he was quiet for a second then what sort of people are you used to dealing with that you would ask if weve killed him first thing its been a rough year now put gregory on the phone because until i know hes alive and he tells me the others are this negotiation is stalled how do you know we are negotiating marco asked call it a hunch my you are direct you have no idea how direct i can be marco put gregory on the phone there was the musicfilled silence and more music but no voices gregory gregory are you there is anyone there shit i thought im afraid that your kittycat wont squawl for us a point of pride i think put the receiver to his ear and let me talk to him as you wish more of the loud music i spoke as if i was sure that gregory was listening gregory i need to know youre alive i need to know that nathaniel and everyone else is alive talk to me gregory his voice came squeezed tight as if he were gritting his teeth yesss yes what theyre all alive yess what are they doing to you he screamed into the phone and the sound raised the hairs on my neck and danced down my arms in goosebumps the sound stopped abruptly gregory gregory i was yelling against the technobeat of the music but no one was answering marco came back on the line they are all alive if not quite well the one they call nathaniel is a lovely young man all that long auburn hair and the most extraordinary violet eyes so pretty it would be a shame to spoil all that beauty of course this one is lovely too blond blueeyed someone told me that they both work as strippers is that true i wasnt numb anymore i was scared and angry and i still had not a clue to why this was happening my voice came out almost even almost calm yeah its true youre new in town marco so you dont know me but trust me you dont want to do this perhaps not but my alpha does ah shapeshifter politics i hated shapeshifter politics why the wereleopards are no threat to anyone ours is not to reason why ours is but to do and die a literate kidnapper refreshing what do you want marco my alpha wants you to come down and rescue your cats if you can what club are you at narcissus in chains and he hung up damn it whats happened ronnie asked id almost forgotten her she didnt belong in this part of my life but there she was leaning against the kitchen cabinets searching my face looking worried ill take care of it she gripped my arm you gave me this speech about wanting your friends back about not wanting to push us all away did you mean it or was it just talk i took a deep breath and let it out i told her what the other side of the conversation had been and you dont have any clue what this is about she asked no i dont thats odd usually stuff like this builds up it doesnt just drop out of the blue i nodded i know star will ring back whatever number just called you what good will that do it will let you know if theyre really at this club or whether its just a trap for you not just another pretty face are you i said she smiled im a trained detective we know about these things the humor didnt quite reach her eyes but she was trying i dialed and the phone rang for what seemed forever then another male voice answered yeah is this narcissus in chains yeah whos this i need to speak with gregory dont know any gregory he said who is this i asked this is a freaking pay phone lady i just picked up then he hung up too it seemed to be my night for it they called from a pay phone at the club i said well at least you know where they are ronnie said do you know where the club is i asked ronnie shook her head not my kind of scene mine either in fact the only cardcarrying dominance and submission players that i knew personally were all at the club waiting to be saved who did i know that might know where the club was and something about its reputation i couldnt trust what the wereleopards had told me about it being a safe place obviously theyd been wrong one name sprang to mind the only one i knew to call that might know where narcissus in chains was and what kind of trouble id be in if i went inside jeanclaude since i was dealing with shapeshifter politics it might have made sense to call richard with him being a werewolf and all but the shapeshifters were a very clannish lot one type of animal rarely crossed boundaries to help another frustrating but true the exception was the treaty between the werewolves and the wererats but everyone else was left to fend and squabble and bleed among themselves oh if some small group got out of hand and attracted too much unwanted police attention the wolves and rats would discipline them but short of that no one seemed to want to interfere with each other that was one of the reasons i was still stuck babysitting the wereleopards also richard didnt know any more about the d and s subculture than i did maybe less if youre wanting to ask questions about the sexual fringe jeanclaude is definitely your guy he may not participate but he seems to know whos doing what and to whom and where or i hoped he did if it had just been my life at stake i probably wouldnt have called either of the boys but if i got killed doing this that left no one to rescue nathaniel and the rest unacceptable ronnie had kicked off her high heels i didnt bring my gun but im sure you have a spare i shook my head youre not going anger makes her gray eyes the color of storm clouds the hell im not ronnie these are shapeshifters and youre human so are you she said because of jeanclaudes vampire marks im a little more than that i can take damage that would kill you you cant go in there alone she said her arms were crossed under her breasts her face set in angry stubborn lines i dont plan on going in alone its because im not a shooter isnt it you dont kill easily ronnie no shame in that but i cant take you into a gang of shapeshifters unless i know that youll shoot to kill if you have to i gripped her upper arms she stayed stiff and angry under my touch it would kill a piece of me to lose you ronnie it would kill a bigger piece to know that you died because of some shit of mine you cant hesitate with these people you cant treat them like theyre human if you do you die she was shaking her head call the police i stepped away from her no damn it anita damn it ronnie there are rules and one of those rules is you dont take pack or pard business to the police the main reason for that rule was that the police tended to frown on fights for dominance that ended with dead bodies on the ground but no need to tell ronnie that its a stupid rule she said maybe but its still the way business is done with the shifters no matter what flavor they are she sat down at the small twoseater breakfast table on its little raised platform whos going to be your backup then richard doesnt kill any easier than i do that was half true but i let it slide no i want someone at my back tonight who will do what needs doing no flinching her eyes were dark dark with anger jeanclaude she made his name a curse i nodded are you sure he didnt plan this to get you back into his life excuse me death he knows me too well to screw with my people he knows what id do if he hurt them puzzlement flowed through the anger softening her eyes her face i hate him but i know you love him could you really kill him could you really stare down the barrel of a gun and pull the trigger on him i just looked at her and i knew without a mirror that my eyes had grown distant cold its hard for brown eyes to be cold but id been managing it lately something very like fear slid behind her eyes i dont know if she was afraid for me or of me i preferred the first to the last you could do it jesus anita youve known jeanclaude longer than ive known louie i could never hurt louie no matter what he did i shrugged it would destroy me to do it i think its not like id live happily ever after if i survived at all theres a very real chance that the vampire marks would drag me down to the grave with him another good reason not to kill him she said if hes behind the scream that gregory gave over the phone then hell need better reasons to keep breathing than love or lust or my possible death i dont understand that anita i dont understand that at all i know i said and i thought to myself it was one of the reasons ronnie and i hadnt been seeing as much of each other as we once had i got tired of explaining myself to her no of justifying myself to her youre my friend my best friend i thought but i dont understand you anymore ronnie i cant arm wrestle shapeshifters and vampires i will lose a fair fight the only way i survive the only way my leopards survive is because the other shifters fear me they fear my threat im only as good as my threat ronnie so youll go down there and kill them i didnt say that but you will ill try to avoid it i said she tucked her knees up wrapping her arms around those long legs shed managed to get a tiny prick in one of the hose the hole was shiny with clear nail polish shed carried the polish in her purse for just such emergencies id carried a gun and hadnt even taken a purse if you get arrested call and ill bail you out i shook my head if i get caught wasting three or more people in a public area there wont be any bail tonight the police probably wont even finish questioning me until long past dawn how can you be so calm about this she asked i was beginning to remember why ronnie and i had started drifting apart id had almost the exact conversation with richard once when an assassin had come to town to kill me i gave the same answer having hysterics wont help anything ronnie but youre not angry about it oh i am angry i said she shook her head no i mean youre not outraged that this is happening you dont seem surprised not like she shrugged not like you should be you mean not like you would be i held up a hand before she could answer i dont have time to debate moral philosophy ronnie i picked up the phone im going to call jeanclaude i keep urging you to dump the vampire and marry richard but maybe theres more than one reason why you cant let him go i dialed the number for circus of the damned from memory and ronnie just kept talking to my back maybe youre not willing to give up a lover whos colder than you are the phone was ringing there are clean sheets on the guest bed ronnie sorry i wont be able to share girl talk tonight i kept my back to her i heard her stand in a crinkle of skirts and knew when she walked out i kept my back facing the room until i knew she was gone it wouldnt do either of us any good to let her see me cry jeanclaude wasnt at the circus of the damned the voice on the other end of the phone at the circus didnt recognize me and wouldnt believe i was anita blake jeanclaudes sometimes sweetie so id been reduced to calling his other businesses id tried guilty pleasures his strip club but he wasnt there i tried danse macabre his newest enterprise but i was beginning to wonder if jeanclaude had simply told everyone that he wasnt in if i called the thought bothered me a lot id worried that after so long richard might finally tell me to go to hell that hed had enough of my indecision it had never occurred to me that jeanclaude might not wait if i was so unsure how i felt about him why was my stomach squeezed tight with a growing sense of loss the feeling had nothing to do with the wereleopards and their problems it had everything to do with me and the fact that i suddenly felt lost but it turned out he was at danse macabre and he took my call i had a moment for my stomach to unclench and my breath to ease out then he was on the phone and i was struggling to keep my metaphysical shields in place i hated metaphysics preternatural biology is still biology metaphysics is magic and im still not comfortable with it for six months when i wasnt working i was meditating studying with a very wise psychic named marianne learning ritual magic so i could control my godgiven abilities and so i could block the marks that bound me to richard and jeanclaude an aura is like your personal protection your personal energy when its healthy it keeps you safe like skin but you get a hole in it and infection can get inside my aura had two holes in it one for each of the men i suspected that their auras had holes in them too which put us all at risk id blocked up my holes then only a few weeks ago id come up against a nasty creature a wouldbe god a new category even for me it had been powerful enough to strip all my careful work away leaving me raw and open again only the intervention of a local witch had saved me from being eaten from the aura down i didnt have six more months of celibacy meditation and patience in me the holes were there and the only way to fill them was with jeanclaude and richard thats what marianne said and i trusted her in a way that i trusted few others jeanclaudes voice hit me over the phone like a velvet slap my breath caught in my throat and i could do nothing but feel the flow of his voice the presence of him like something alive flowing over my skin his voice has always been one of jeanclaudes best things but this was ridiculous this was over the phone how could i possibly see him in person and maintain my shields let alone my composure i know you are there ma petite did you call merely to hear the sound of my voice that was closer to the truth than was comfortable no no i still couldnt gather my thoughts i was like an athlete who had let her training go i just couldnt lift the same amount of weight and there was weight to wading through jeanclaudes power when i still didnt say anything he spoke again ma petite to what do i owe this honor why have you deigned to call me his voice was bland but there was a hint of something in it reproach perhaps i guess i had it coming i rallied the troops and tried to sound like an intelligent human being not always one of my best things its been six months i am aware of that ma petite he was being condescending i hated that it made me a little angry the anger helped clear my head a little if youll stop interrupting ill tell you why i called my heart is all aflutter with anticipation i wanted to hang up he was being an asshole and part of me thought i might deserve the treatment which made me even angrier im always angriest when i think im in the wrong id been a coward for months and i was still a coward i was afraid to be close to him afraid of what id do damn it anita get ahold of yourself sarcasm is my department i said and what is my department im about to ask you for a favor i said really he said it as if he might not grant it please jeanclaude im asking for help i dont do that often that is certainly true what would you have of me ma petite you know that you have but to ask and it will be yours no matter how angry i may be with you i let that comment go because i didnt know what to do about it do you know a club called narcissus in chains he was quiet for a second or two oui can you give me directions and meet me there do you know what sort of a club this place is yeah are you sure its a bondage club i know unless the last six months has changed you greatly ma petite that is not one of your preferences not mine no your wereleopards are misbehaving again something like that i told him what had happened i do not know this marco i didnt figure you did but you did think that i knew where the club was i was hoping i will meet you there with some of my people or will you allow only me to ride to your rescue he sounded amused now which was better than angry i guess bring who you need you trust my judgment in this yeah but not in all things he said softly i dont trust anyone in all things jeanclaude he sighed so young to be so jaded im cynical not jaded and the difference is what ma petite youre jaded he laughed then the sound caressing me like the brush of a hand it made things low in my body clench ah he said that explains all the differences just give me directions please i added the please to speed things along they will not harm your wereleopards too greatly i think the club is run by shapeshifters and they will smell too much blood and take matters into their own hands it is one of the reasons narcissus in chains is nomansland a neutral place for the fringe of our groups your leopards were right it is usually a very safe place well gregory wasnt screaming because he felt safe perhaps not but i know the owner narcissus would be very angry if someone became overzealous in his club narcissus i dont know the name well i know the greek mythology stuff but i dont recognize it as local i would not expect you to he does not often leave his club but i will call him and he will patrol your cats for you he will not rescue them but he will make sure no further damage is done you trust narcissus to do this oui jeanclaude had his faults but if he trusted someone he was usually right okay and thank you you are most welcome he drew a breath then said quietly would you have called if you had not needed my help would you ever have called id been dreading this question from either jeanclaude or richard but i finally had an answer ill answer your question as best i can but call it a hunch it may be a long conversation i need to know my people are safe before we start dissecting our relationship relationship is that what we have his voice was very dry jeanclaude no no ma petite i will call narcissus now and save your cats but only if you promise that when i call back we will finish this conversation promise your word he said yes very well ma petite until we speak again he hung up i hung up the phone and stood there was it cowardly to want to call someone else anyone else so the phone would be busy and we wouldnt have to have our little talk yeah it was cowardly but tempting i hated talking about my personal life especially to the people most intimately involved in it i had just about enough time to change out of the skirt outfit when the phone rang i jumped and answered it with my pulse in my throat i was really dreading this conversation hello i said narcissus will see to your cats safety now where were we he was silent for a heartbeat oh yes would you ever have called if you had not needed my help the woman im studying with marianne he said yes marianne anyway she says that i cant keep blocking the holes in my aura that the only way to be safe from preternatural creepycrawlies is to fill the holes with what they were meant to hold silence on the other end of the phone silence for so long that i said jeanclaude you still there i am here you dont sound happy about this do you know what you are saying anita it was always a bad sign when he used my real name i think so i want this very clear between us ma petite i do not want you coming back to me later crying that you did not understand how tightly this would bind us if you allow richard and me to truly fill the marks upon your body we will share our auras our energy our magic were already doing that jeanclaude in part ma petite but those are side effects of the marks this will be a willing knowledgeable joining once done i do not think it can be undone without great damage to all of us it was my turn to sigh how many vampire challenges to your authority have there been while ive been off meditating a few he said voice cautious more than a few id bet because they sensed that your defenses are not complete you had trouble backing them down without killing them didnt you let us say that i am glad that there were no serious challengers over the last year youd have lost without richard and me to back you up and you couldnt shield yourself without us there to touch that worked when i was in town with you touching being with each other helped us plug in to each others power it offset the problem oui he said softly i didnt know jeanclaude im not sure it would have made a difference but i didnt know god richard must be desperate he doesnt kill like we do his bluff is all that keeps the werewolves from tearing each other apart and with two gaping holes in his most intimate defenses i let my voice trail off but i still remembered the cold horror id felt when i realized how much id endangered all of us richard has had difficulties ma petite but we each have only one chink in our armor the one that only you can heal he was driven to merge his energies with mine as you say his bluff is very important to him i didnt know and im sorry for that all ive been thinking about was how scared i was of being overwhelmed by the two of you marianne told me the truth when she thought i was ready to hear it and are you done being frightened of us ma petite his voice was careful when he asked as if he were carrying a very full cup of very hot liquid up a long and narrow staircase i shook my head realized he couldnt see it and said im not brave im pretty much terrified terrified that if i do this there is no going back that maybe im fooling myself about a choice maybe there is no choice and hasnt been for a long time but however we end up arranging the bedrooms i cant let us all go around with gaping metaphysical wounds too many things will sense the weakness and exploit it like the creature you met in new mexico he said voice still as cautious as id ever heard it yeah i said are you saying that tonight you will agree to letting us merge the marks that we will at last close these as you so colorfully put it wounds if it doesnt endanger my leopards yeah we need to do it as soon as possible id hate to make the big decision and then have one of us get killed before we could batten down the hatches i heard him sigh as if some great tension had left him you do not know how long i have waited for you to understand all this you could have told me you would not have believed me you would have thought it was another trick to bind you closer to me youre right i wouldnt have believed you will richard be meeting us at the club as well i was quiet for a heartbeat no im not going to call him why ever not it is a shapeshifter difficulty more than a vampire one you know why not you fear he will be too squeamish to allow you to do what needs doing to save your leopards yeah perhaps jeanclaude said you arent going to tell me to call him why would i ask you to invite my chief rival for your affections to this little tкteбtкte that would be foolish i am many things but foolish is not one of them that was certainly true okay give me directions and ill meet you and your people at the club first ma petite what are you wearing excuse me clothes ma petite what clothes are you wearing is this a joke because i dont have time it is not an idle question ma petite the sooner you answer the sooner we can all leave i wanted to argue but if jeanclaude said he had a point he probably did i told him what i was wearing you surprise me ma petite with a little effort it should do nicely what effort i suggest you add boots to your ensemble the ones i purchased for you would do very well i am not wearing fiveinch spikes anywhere jeanclaude id break an ankle i planned on you wearing those boots just for me ma petite i was thinking of the other boots with the milder heels that i bought when you were so very angry about the others oh why do i have to change shoes because delicate flower that you are you have the eyes of a policeman and so it would be better if you wore leather boots instead of high heels it would be better if you remember that you are trying to move through the club as quickly and smoothly as possible no one will help you find your leopards if they think you are an outsider especially a policeman nobody ever mistakes me for a cop no but they begin to mistake you for something that smells of guns and death look harmless tonight ma petite until it is time to be dangerous i thought this friend of yours this narcissus would just escort us in he is not my friend and i told you the club is neutral ground narcissus will see that no great harm comes to your cats but that is all he will not let you come barging in to his world like the proverbial bull in the china shop that he will not allow nor will he allow us to bring in a small army of our own he is the leader of the werehyenas and they are the only army allowed inside the club there is no ulfric or master of the city within its walls you have only the dominance you bring with you and your body to see you through ill have a gun i said but a gun will not get you into the upper rooms what will trust me i will find a way i didnt like the sound of that at all why is it that most of the time whenever i ask you for help its never a case where we can just run in and start shooting and why is it ma petite that when you do not invite me that it is almost always a case where you run in and shoot everything that moves point taken i said what are your priorities for the night he asked i knew what he meant i want the wereleopards safe and if they have been harmed i want vengeance more than their safety no safety first vengeance is a luxury good and if one or more is dead i dont want any of us going to jail but eventually if not tonight another night they die i listened to myself say it and knew that i meant it there is no mercy in you ma petite you say that like its a bad thing no it is merely an observation i stood there holding the phone waiting to be shocked at what i was proposing but i wasnt i said i dont want to kill anyone if i dont have to that is not true ma petite fine if theyve killed my people i want them dead but i decided in new mexico that i didnt want to be a sociopath so im trying to act as if im not so lets try to keep the body count low tonight okay as you wish he said then he added do you really think that you can change the nature of what you are merely by wishing it are you asking if i can stop being a sociopath since i already am one a moment of silence then i think that is what im asking i dont know but if i dont pull myself back from the brink soon jeanclaude there wont be any going back i hear fear in your voice ma petite yeah you do what do you fear i fear that by giving in to you and richard that ill lose myself i fear that by not giving in to you and richard ill lose one of you i fear that ill get us killed because im thinking too much i fear that im already a sociopath and there is no going back ronnie said that one of the reasons that i cant give you up and just settle down with richard is that i cant give up a boyfriend whos colder than i am i am sorry ma petite i wasnt sure exactly what he was apologizing for but i accepted it anyway me too give me directions to the club ill meet you there he gave me directions and i read them back to him we hung up neither of us said goodbye once upon a time wed have ended the conversation with je taime i love you once upon a time the club was over the river on the illinois side along with most of the other questionable clubs vampirerun businesses got a grandfather clause to operate in st louis proper but the rest of the humanrun clubs and lycanthropes still counted legally as human had to go into illinois to avoid pesky zoning problems some of the zoning problems werent even on the books werent even laws at all but it was strange how many problems the bureaucrats could find when they didnt want a club in their fair city if the vampires werent such a big draw for tourists the bureaucratsd have probably found a way to get rid of them too i finally found parking about two blocks from the club it meant a walk to the club in an area of town that most women wouldnt want to be alone in after dark of course most women wouldnt be armed a gun doesnt cure all ills but its a start i also had a knife sheath around each calf very high up so that the hilts came up on the side of my knees i wasnt really comfortable that way but i couldnt think of any other place to put knives so i could get to them easily there was a very good chance id have bruises on my knees after tonight oh well i also had a black belt in judo and was making progress in kenpo a type of karate one with fewer power moves and more moves using balance i was as prepared as i could get for the wilds of the big city of course i usually dont walk around looking like bait my skirt was so short that even with boots that came up to midthigh there was a good inch between the hem and the top of the boots id put a jacket on for the drive but had left it in the car because i didnt want to be carrying it around all night id been in just enough clubs whatever flavor they were to know that inside it would be hot so the goosebumps that traveled over my bare back and arms werent from fear but from the damp chill air i forced myself not to rub my arms as i walked and to at least look like i wasnt cold or uncomfortable actually the boots only had twoinch heels and they were comfortable to walk in not as comfortable as my nikes but then what is but for dress shoes the boots werent bad if i could have left the knives home theyd have been peachy there was one other bit of protection that id added metaphysical shields come in different varieties you can shield yourself with almost anything metal rock plants fire water wind earth etc everyone has different shields because its a very individual choice it has to work for your own personal mindset you can have two psychics both using stone but the shields wont be the same some people simply visualize rock the thought of it its essence and thats sufficient if something tries to attack them they are safe behind the thought of rock another psychic might see a stone wall like a garden wall around an old house and that would do the same thing for me the shield had to be a tower all shields are like bubbles that surround you completely just like circles of power id always understood this when i raised the dead but for shielding i needed to see it in my head so i imagined a stone tower completely enclosed no windows no chinks smooth and dark inside with only what i allowed in or out talking about shielding always made me feel like i was having a psychotic break and sharing my delusions but it worked and when i didnt shield things tried to hurt me it had only been in the last two weeks that marianne had discovered that i hadnt really understood shielding at all id thought it was just a matter of how powerful your aura was and how you could reinforce it she said the only reason id been able to get by with that for as long as i had was that i was simply that powerful but the shielding goes outside the aura like a wall around a castle an extra defense the innermost defense is a healthy aura hopefully by the end of the night id have one of those i turned the corner and found a line of people that stretched down the block great just what i needed i didnt stop at the end of the line i kept walking towards the door hoping id think of something to tell the doorperson when i got there i didnt have time to wait through all this i was about halfway up the line when a figure pushed out of the crowd and called my name it took me a second to recognize jason first hed cut his babyfine blond hair short businessman short second he was wearing a sheer silver mesh shirt and a pair of pants that seemed mostly made of the same stuff only a thin line of solid silver ran over his groin the outfit was so eyecatching that it took me a moment to realize just how sheer the cloth was what i was really seeing wasnt the silver but jasons skin through a veil of glitter the outfit which left precious little to the imagination ended in calfhigh gray boots i had to make myself look at his face because i was still shaking my head over the outfit the outfit didnt look comfortable but of course jason rarely complained about his clothes he was like jeanclaudes little dressup werewolf as well as morning snack sometimes bodyguard and sometimes a fetchandcarry boy who else could jeanclaude get to stand out in the cold nearly naked jasons eyes looked bigger bluer somehow without all the hair to distract your eye his face looked older with the shorter hair the bone structure cleaner and i realized that jason was perilously close to that line between cute and handsome hed been nineteen when we met twentytwo looked better on him but the outfit there was nothing to do but grin at the outfit he was grinning at me too i think we were both happy to see each other in leaving richard and jeanclaude id left their people behind too jason was richards pack member and jeanclaudes lap wolf you look like a pornographic space man if you were wearing street clothes you might have gotten a hug i said his smile flashed even wider i guess im dressed for punishment jeanclaude told me to wait for you and take you in my hands already got a stamp on it so we can just go straight inside a little cold for the clothes isnt it why do you think i was standing deep in the crowd he offered me his arm may i escort you inside my lady i took his arm with my left hand jason put his free hand on top of mine doing a double hold if that was the worst teasing he did tonight then hed grown up some the silver cloth was rougher than it looked scratchy where it rubbed against my arm as jason led me up the steps i had to look behind him the cloth that covered his groin was only a thin thong at the back leaving nothing but a fine glitter over his butt the shirt was not attached to the pants so as he moved i got glimpses of his stomach in fact the shirt was loose enough through the shoulders that when he took my arm the shirt pulled to one side revealing his smooth pale shoulder the music hit me at the door like a giants slap it was almost a wall we had to move through i hadnt expected narcissus in chains to be a dance club but except for the patrons clothing being more exotic and running high to leather it looked like a lot of other clubs the place was large dimly lit dark in the corners with too many people pushed into too small a space moving their bodies frantically to music that was way too loud my hand tightened just a touch on jasons arm because truthfully i always feel a little overwhelmed by places like this at least for the first few minutes its like i need a depth chamber between the outside world and the inside world a moment to breath deep and adjust but these clubs are not designed to give you time they just bombard you with sensory overload and figure youll survive speaking of sensory overload jeanclaude was standing near the wall just to one side of the dance floor his long black hair fell in soft curls around his shoulders nearly to his waist i didnt remember his hair being that long he had his head turned away from me watching the dancers so i couldnt really see his face but it gave me time to look at the rest of him he was dressed in a black vinyl shirt that looked poured on it left his arms bare and i realized id never seen him in anything that bared his arms before his skin looked unbelievably white against the shiny black vinyl almost as if it glowed with some inner light i knew it didnt though it could jeanclaude would never be so dйclassй as to show such power in a public place his pants were made of the same shiny vinyl making the long lines of his body look like they had been dipped into liquid patent leather vinyl boots came up just over his knees gleaming as if theyd been spit polished everything about him gleamed the dark glow of his clothes the shining whiteness of his skin then abruptly he turned as if he felt me gazing at him staring full into his face even from across a room made me catch my breath he was beautiful that heartrending beauty that was masculine but treaded the line between what was male and what was female not exactly androgynous but close to it but as he moved towards me the movement was utterly male graceful as if he heard music in his head that he quietly danced to but the walk the movement of his shoulders women did not move like that jason patted my hand i jumped staring at him he put his mouth close enough to my ear to whispershout above the music breathe anita remember to breathe i blushed because that was how jeanclaude affected me like i was fourteen and was having the crush of my life jason tightened his grip on me as if he thought i might make a run for it not a bad idea i looked back and saw that jeanclaude was very near the first time i saw the bluegreen roil of the caribbean i cried because it was so beautiful jeanclaude made me feel like that like i should weep at his beauty it was like being offered an original da vinci not just to hang on your wall and admire but to roll around on top of it seemed wrong yet i stood there clutching jasons arm my heart hammering so hard i almost couldnt hear the music i was scared but it wasnt knifeinthedark scared it was rabbitintheheadlights scared i was caught as i usually was with jeanclaude between two disparate instincts part of me wanted to run to him to close the distance and climb his body and pull it around me the other part wanted to run screaming into the night and pray he didnt follow he stood in front of me but made no move to touch me to close that last small space he seemed as unwilling to touch me as i was to touch him was he afraid of me or did he sense my own fear and fear he might scare me off we stood there simply staring at each other his eyes were still the same dark dark blue with a wealth of black lashes lacing them jason kissed my cheek lightly like youd kiss your sister it still made me jump im feeling like a third wheel you two play nice and he pulled away from me leaving jeanclaude and me staring at each other i dont know what we would have said because three men joined us before we could decide the shortest of the three was only about five feet seven and he was wearing more makeup on his pale triangular face than i was the makeup was well done but he wasnt trying to look like a woman his black hair was cut very short though you could tell that it would be curly if it was long he was wearing a black lace dress longsleeved fitted at the waist showing a slender but muscular chest the skirt spilled out around him almost june cleaverish and his stockings were black with a very delicate spiderweb pattern he wore opentoed sandals with spike heels and both his toenails and his fingernails were painted black he looked lovely but what made the outfit was the sense of power in him it hung around him like an expensive perfume and i knew he was an alpha something jeanclaude spoke first this is narcissus owner of this establishment narcissus held out his hand i was momentarily confused about whether i was supposed to shake the hand or kiss it if hed been trying to pass for a woman id have known the kiss would have been appropriate but he wasnt he wasnt so much crossdressing as just dressing the way he wanted i shook his hand the grip was strong but not too strong he didnt try and test my strength which some lycanthropes will do he was secure was narcissus the two men behind him loomed over all of us each well over six feet one had a wide muscular chest that was left mostly bare through a complicated crisscross of black leather straps he had blond hair cut very short on the sides and gelled into short spikes on top his eyes were pale and the look in them was not friendly the second man was slimmer built more like a professional basketball player than a weightlifter but the arms that showed from the leather vest were corded with muscle all the same his skin was almost as dark as the leather he was wearing all these two needed were a couple of tattoos apiece and they would have screamed badass narcissus said this is ulysses and ajax ajax was the blond and ulysses was the ohso brunette greek myths nice naming convention i said narcissus blinked large dark eyes at me either he didnt think i was funny or he simply didnt care the music stopped abruptly we were suddenly standing in a great roaring silence and it was shocking narcissus spoke at a level where i could hear him but people nearby couldnt hed known the music would stop i know your reputation ms blake i must have the gun i glanced at jeanclaude i did not tell him come ms blake i can smell the gun even over he sniffed the air head tilted back just a little your oscar de la renta i went to a different oil for cleaning one with less odor i said its not the oil the gun is new i can smell the metal like you would smell a new car oh did jeanclaude explain the situation to you narcissus nodded yes but we do not play favorites in dominance struggles between different groups we are neutral territory and if we are to remain so then no guns if it is any comfort we didnt let the ones who have your cats bring guns into the club either i widened my eyes at that most shapeshifters dont carry guns no they do not narcissuss handsome face told me nothing he was neither upset nor concerned it was all just business to him like marcos voice on the phone i turned back to jeanclaude im not getting into the club with my gun am i i fear not ma petite i sighed and turned back to the waiting what had jeanclaude called them werehyenas they were the first id met as far as i knew there was no clue from looking at them what they became when the moon was full ill give it up but im not happy about this that is not my problem narcissus said i met his eyes and felt my face slip into that look that could make a good cop flinch my monster peeking out ulysses and ajax started to move in front of narcissus but he waved them back ms blake will behave herself wont you ms blake i nodded but said if my people get hurt because i dont have a gun i can make it your problem ma petite jeanclaude said his voice warning me i shook my head i know i know theyre like switzerland neutral personally i think neutral is just another way of saving your own ass at the expense of someone elses narcissus took a step closer until only a few inches separated us his otherworldly energy danced along my skin and as had happened in new mexico with a very different wereanimal it called that piece of richards beast that seemed to live inside me it brought that power in a rush down my skin to jump the distance between us and mingle with narcissuss power it startled me i hadnt thought it could happen with shields in place marianne had said that my abilities lay with the dead and that was why i couldnt control richards power as easily as i could jeanclaudes but i should have been able to shield against a stranger it scared me a little that i couldnt it had been wereleopards and werejaguars in new mexico they had mistaken me for another lycanthrope narcissus made the same mistake i saw his eyes widen then narrow he glanced at jeanclaude and he laughed everyone says youre human anita he raised a hand and caressed the air just above my face touching the swirl of energy i think you should come out of the closet before someone gets hurt i never said i was human narcissus but im not a shapeshifter either he rubbed his hand along the front of his dress as if trying to get the feeling of my power off his skin then what are you if things go badly tonight youll find out his eyes narrowed again if you cannot protect your people without guns then you should step down as their nimirra and let someone else have the job ive got an interview set up day after tomorrow with a potential nimirraj he looked genuinely surprised you know that you dont have the power to rule them i nodded oh yeah im only temporary until i can find someone else if the rest of you werent so damn species conscious id have farmed them out to another group but no one wants to play with an animal that isnt the same as them it is our way it has always been our way and i knew the our didnt mean just werehyenas but all the shifters yeah well it sucks he smiled then i dont know whether i like you anita but you are different and i always appreciate that now give up the gun like a good little girl and you can enter my territory he held his hand out i stared at the hand i didnt want to give up my gun what id told ronnie was true i couldnt arm wrestle them and i would lose a fair fight the gun was my equalizer i had the two knives but frankly they were for emergencies it is your choice ma petite if it will help you make the choice narcissus said i have put two of my own personal guards in the room with your leopards i have forbidden the others from causing further harm to your people until you arrive until you enter the upper room where theyre waiting nothing more will happen that they dont want to happen knowing nathaniel that wasnt as comforting as it could have been if anyone would understand the problem it would be someone who ran a club like this nathaniel is one of those bottoms that will ask for more punishment than he can survive he has no stopping point no ability to keep himself safe do you understand narcissuss eyes widened just a touch then what was he doing here without a top of his own i sent him out with one that was supposed to watch over him tonight but gregory said that elizabeth deserted nathaniel early in the evening is she one of your leopards too i nodded shes defying you i know the fact that nathaniel suffers for it doesnt seem to bother her he studied my face i dont see anger in you about this if i was angry at everything elizabeth did to piss me off id never be anything else truthfully i was just tired tired of having to rescue the pack from one emergency after another tired of elizabeth being up in my face and not taking care of the others even though she was supposedly dominant to them id avoided punishing her because i couldnt beat her up which was what she needed the only thing i could do was shoot her id been trying to avoid that but she just may have pushed me far enough that i was out of options id see what actual damage had been done if anyone died because of her then she would follow i hated the fact that i didnt care whether i killed her id known her off and on for over a year i should have cared but i didnt i didnt like her and shed been asking for it for as long as id known her my life would be simpler if she were dead but there had to be a better reason to kill someone than that didnt there some advice narcissus said all dominance challenges especially from your own people must be handled quickly or the problem will spread thanks actually i knew that still she defies you ive been trying to avoid killing her we looked at each other very quietly and he gave a small nod your gun please i sighed and raised the front of my shirt though the material was stiff enough that i had to roll it back to expose the butt of the gun i lifted the gun out and checked the safety out of habit though i knew it was on narcissus took the gun the two bodyguards had moved blocking the crowds view of us i doubted most people knew what wed just done narcissus smiled as i rolled my shirt back into place over the nowempty holster truthfully if i didnt know who you were and what your reputation was i wouldnt have smelled the gun because i wouldnt have been trying to your outfit doesnt look like it could hide a gun this big paranoia is the mother of invention i said he gave a small bow of his head now enter and enjoy the delights and the terrors of my world with that rather cryptic phrase he and his bodyguards moved through the crowd taking my gun with them jeanclaude trailed his fingers down my arm and that one small movement turned me towards him my skin shivering tonight was complicated enough without this level of sexual tension your cats are well until you enter the upper room i suggest we do the mark now first why i asked my pulse suddenly in my throat let us go to our table and i will explain he moved off through the crowd without touching me further i followed and couldnt stop myself from watching the way the vinyl fit him from behind i loved watching him walk whether he was coming or going a double threat the tables were small and there werent many of them crowded against the walls but theyd cleared the dance floor so they could set up for some sort of show or demonstration men and women dressed in leather were setting up a framework of metal with lots of leather straps i was reeeally hoping to be elsewhere before the show started jeanclaude took me to one side before we got to the table that jason and three complete strangers were gathered around he stepped in so close to me that a hard thought would have made our bodies touch i pressed myself against the wall and tried not to breathe he put his mouth against my ear and spoke so low what came out was merely the soft sound of his breath against my skin we will all be safer when the marks are married but there are other benefits to it i have many lesser vampires that i have brought into my territory in the last few months ma petite without you at my side i dared not bring in greater powers for fear that i could not hold them once the marks are married between us you will be able to sense those vampires that are mine the exception as always is a master vampire they can hide their allegiances better than the rest the marriage of marks will also let my people know who you are and what will happen to them if they overstep their bounds with you i spoke lips barely moving lower than he had spoken because he could still hear me youve had to be very careful havent you he rested his cheek against my face for a moment it has been a delicate dance to choreograph i had gone into this evening with my metaphysical shield tight in place marianne had taught me that with my aura ruptured the other shielding was of paramount importance i shielded with stone tonight perfect seamless stone nothing could get in or out without my permission except narcissuss power had already danced inside my shields i was afraid that touching jeanclaude would be enough to shatter the stone but it wasnt i wasnt even aware of the shielding unless i really concentrated it could stay in place even when i slept only when you were attacked did you have to concentrate if you were good at shielding id spent a week at the beginning of the month in tennessee with marianne working on nothing but this i wasnt great at it but i wasnt bad either my shields were in place my emotions were drowning in jeanclaude but my psyche wasnt which meant that marianne was right i could hold the dead outside my shield easier than the living this gave me the courage to do a little more i leaned my face against jeanclaudes and nothing happened oh the feel of his skin against mine sent a thrill through my body but my shields never wavered i felt some tension that i hadnt even known was there ease out of me i wanted him to hold me it wasnt just sex if that was all it was i could have been rid of him long ago he must have felt it too because his hands rested lightly on my bare arms when i didnt protest his hands caressed my skin and that small movement brought my breath to a sigh i leaned into him wrapping my arms around his waist pressing the lines of our bodies together i rested my head on his chest and i could hear his heart beating it didnt always beat but tonight it did we held each other and it was nearly chaste just a renewal of the fact that we were touching again id worked on the metaphysical stuff so i could do this and not lose myself it had been worth the effort he pulled back first enough to look into my face we can marry the marks here or find somewhere more private he wasnt whispering as much as before apparently he didnt care now if others knew what we were doing im not clear on what marrying the marks means i thought your marianne had explained it to you she said well fit together like puzzle pieces and therell be a release of power when it happens but she also said that the manner in which it is done is individual to the participants you sound as if you are quoting i am he frowned and even that small movement was somehow fascinating i do not want you to be unpleasantly surprised ma petite i am striving for honesty since you value it so highly i have never done this with anyone but most things are sexual between us whether we will or no so it is likely this will be too i cant leave the leopards here long enough to grab a hotel room jeanclaude they will not be harmed until you go upstairs they will be safe i shook my head and pulled away from him im sorry but i am not leaving here without them if you want to do this afterwards thats fine with me but the leopards are priority theyre waiting for me to rescue them i cant go off and have what amounts to metaphysical sex while theyre afraid and bleeding somewhere no it cannot wait i want us to have this done before the fight begins i do not like that your gun is gone will this marriage of the marks give me more abilities yes and you what do you get out of it i was standing against the wall now not touching him my own defenses will be strong once more and i will gain power as well you know that are there any surprises connected with this that i should know about as i said i have never done this with anyone nor have i seen it done it will be as much a surprise to me as to you i stared up into his lovely eyes and wished i believed that i see the distrust in your eyes ma petite but it is not me that you do not trust it is your power nothing ever goes as it should with you ma petite because you are like no power come before you you are wild magic untamed you throw the best of plans to the wind ive been learning control jeanclaude i hope it is enough youre scaring me he sighed and that was the last thing i wished to do i shook my head look jeanclaude i know everyone keeps saying my people are fine but i want to see for myself so lets just get this done this should be something special and mystical ma petite i looked around the club then we need a different setting i agree but the setting was your choosing not mine but youre the one insisting on it having to be right now before all the fireworks start true he sighed and held out his hand to me come let us at least go to our table i actually thought about refusing his hand funny how quickly i could go from wanting to jump his bones to wanting to be rid of him of course it wasnt exactly him but more the complications that came with him the mystical stuff between us was never simple he said that was my fault and maybe it was jeanclaude was a pretty standard master vampire and richard a pretty standard ulfric they were both wonderfully powerful but there was nothing too terribly extraordinary in their powers well there was one thing about jeanclaude he could gain power by feeding off sexual energy in another century hed have been called an incubus its rare even for a master vamp to have a secondary way to gain power outside of blood so it was impressive sort of the only other masters id met who could feed off of something other than blood had fed on terror and of the two i preferred lust at least no one had to bleed for it usually but i was the wild card the one whose powers seemed to fit nothing but legends of necromancers long dead legends so old that no one believed they could be true until i came along sad but true the table had cleared out while we were whispering now just jason and one other man were there the man was dressed in brown leather from what i could see of his pants to the zippedfront sleeveless shirt he was wearing he was also wearing one of those hoods that left your mouth part of your nose and your eyes bare but covered the rest of your face frankly i found the hoods creepy but hey it wasnt my bread that was being buttered as long as he didnt try anything with me we were cool it wasnt until he looked up into my face that i recognized those pale pale blue eyes the startling ice blue eyes of a siberian husky no human id ever met had eyes like that asher i said he smiled then and i recognized the curve of his lips i knew why hed worn the hood it wasnt sexual preference or at least i didnt think so it was to hide the scars once about two hundred years ago some wellmeaning church officials had tried to burn the devil out of asher theyd done it with holy water holy water is like acid on vampire flesh hed once been in his own way as breathtaking as jeanclaude now half his face was a melted ruin half his chest most of the one thigh id seen what id seen of the rest of him was perfect as perfect as the day he died and the parts i hadnt seen i wasnt sure i wanted to know about through jeanclaudes marks i had memories of asher before i knew what his body looked like in smooth perfection every inch of it asher and his human servant julianna had been part of a mйnage а trois with jeanclaude for about twenty years shed been burned as a witch and jeanclaude had only been able to save asher after the damage had been done the events were over two hundred years old yet they both still mourned julianna and each other asher was now jeanclaudes second in command but they were not lovers and they were uneasy friends because there was still too much left unspoken between them asher still blamed jeanclaude for failing them and jeanclaude had a hard time arguing with that because deep down he still blamed himself too i leaned down and gave asher a quick kiss on the leather cheek what did you do with all your long hair please tell me you havent cut it he raised my hand to his mouth and laid a gentle kiss on it it is braided and longer than ever i can hardly wait to see it i said thanks for coming i would move all of hell to reach your side you know that you french guys do talk pretty i said he laughed softly jason interrupted i think the show is about to start i turned and watched a woman being led towards the framework that had been erected she was wearing a robe and i really didnt want to see what was under it whatever were going to do lets do it and go get the leopards you dont want to see the show jason asked his eyes were all innocent but his smile was teasing i just frowned at him but his eyes looked behind me and i knew someone jason didnt like was coming towards us i turned to find ajax standing there he ignored me and spoke to jeanclaude you have fifteen minutes then the show starts jeanclaude nodded tell narcissus i appreciate the notice ajax gave a small head bow much like his master had done before then walked off through the tables what was all that about i asked it would be considered rude to do something magical during someone elses performance i told narcissus that we would be calling some power i must have looked as suspicious as i felt you are beginning to piss me off with this cloakanddagger magic act you are a necromancer and i am the master vampire of this city do you really believe that we can merge our powers and not have every undead in this room and more notice it i do not know if the shapeshifters will be able to feel it but it is likely since we are also both bound to a werewolf everything nonhuman in this club will feel something i dont know how much or exactly what but something ma petite narcissus would have taken it as a grave insult if we had interrupted this performance without warning him i dont mean to rush you asher said but you will use up your time in talking if you are not quick about it jeanclaude looked at him and the look was not entirely friendly what was happening between them that jeanclaude would give such a look to asher jeanclaude held his hand out to me i hesitated a second then slid my hand into his and he led me to the wall near the table now what i asked now you must drop your shields ma petite that sostrong barrier you have erected between me and your aura i just stared at him i dont want to do that i would not ask if it were not necessary ma petite but even if i were able to do it neither of us would enjoy me breaking down your shielding we cannot merge our auras if my aura cannot touch yours i was suddenly scared really seriously scared i didnt know what would happen if i dropped the shields with him right there in times of crisis our auras flared together forming a unique whole i didnt want to do this i am a control freak and everything about jeanclaude ate at the part of me that most needed control im not sure i can do this he sighed it is your choice i will not force it but i fear the consequences ma petite i do fear them marianne had given me the lecture and it was really too late to get cold feet i could either move forward with this or eventually one of us would die probably me part of my job was going up against preternatural monsters things with enough magic to sense a hole in my defenses before id ever been able to sense auras or at least before i knew that i was doing it my aura had been intact with my own natural talent that had been enough but lately i seemed to be running up against bigger badder monsters eventually i would lose that i might have been able to live with sort of but costing jeanclaude or richard their lives that i couldnt handle i knew all the reasons i should do this and still i stood there gazing up at jeanclaude my heart beating in my throat my shields tight in place the front part of my brain knew this needed doing the back part of my brain wasnt so sure once i drop my shield then what we touch he said i took a deep breath in and blew it out as if i were about to run a race then i dropped my shields it wasnt like tearing down the stone walls it was like absorbing them back into my psyche the tower was just suddenly not there and jeanclaudes power crashed over me it wasnt only that i felt the sexual attraction in full force i could feel his heartbeat in my head i could taste his skin in my mouth i knew hed fed tonight though intellectually id known that when i heard his heart beating now i could feel that he was well fed and full of someone elses blood his hand moved towards me and i flattened against the wall the hand kept moving and i pulled away from it i moved away because more than anything in the world at that moment i wanted him to touch me i wanted to feel his hand against my bare skin i wanted to rip the vinyl from his body and watch him pale and perfect above me the image was so clear that i closed my eyes against it as if that would help i felt him in front of me knew he was leaning close i ducked under his arm and was suddenly standing by the table leaving him near the wall i kept backing up and he kept watching me someone touched me and i screamed asher was holding my arm gazing up at me with those pale eyes of his i could feel him too feel the weight of his age the heft of his power in my head that was my power but i realized in shielding so strongly from jeanclaude id also cut myself off from some of my own powers shielding was a tricky thing i guess i still didnt have the hang of it jeanclaude moved away from the wall holding one slender hand out to me i backed up ashers hand sliding over my arm as i pulled away i was shaking my head back and forth back and forth jeanclaude walked slowly towards me his eyes had gone drowning blue the pupil swallowed by his own power i knew with a sudden clarity that it wasnt his power or lust that had called his eyes it was mine he could feel how my body tightened moistened as he moved towards me it wasnt him i didnt trust it was me i took one step backwards and fell on the small step leading down to the dance floor someone caught me before i hit the floor strong arms around my waist pressing me against the bare skin of a very masculine chest i could feel that without looking i was held effortlessly feet dangling and i knew those arms the feel of that chest the smell of his skin this close i craned my head backwards and found myself staring at richard i stopped breathing to be suddenly inches away from him after all this time was too much he leaned that painfully handsome face over mine and the thick waves of his brown hair fell against my skin his mouth hovered over mine and i think i would have said no or moved but two things happened at once he tightened his onearmed hold around my waist a movement that was almost painful then his newly free hand gripped my chin held my face the touch of his hands the strength in them made me hesitate one moment i was staring into his deep brown eyes the next his face was too close and he was kissing me i dont know what i expected a chaste kiss i think it wasnt chaste he kissed me hard enough to bruise hard enough to force my mouth open then he crawled inside and i could feel the muscles in his mouth his jaw his neck working as he held me explored me possessed me i should have been angry pissed but i wasnt if he hadnt held me immobile id have turned in his arms pressed the front of my body against his but all i could do was taste his mouth feel his lips try to drink him down my throat as if he were the finest of wines and i was dying of thirst he finally drew back from me enough for me to see his face i stared breathlessly at him as if my eyes were hungry for the sight of those perfect cheekbones the dimple that softened an utterly masculine face there was nothing feminine about richard he was the ultimate male in so many ways the electric lights caught strands of gold and copper like metallic wire through the deep brown of his hair he lowered me slowly to the ground from his height of six one his shoulders were broad chest deep waist tight and narrow stomach flat with a fine line of dark hair running down the middle of it and vanishing into the black vinyl pants he was wearing more black vinyl i was sensing a theme here but my gaze traveled down his body just the same tracing the narrow hips lingering where i shouldnt have been noticing things i wished i hadnt because we were in public and i wasnt planning on seeing him naked tonight kneehigh leather boots completed his outfit the only things he was wearing on his upper body were leather and metalstudded bracelets and a matching collar a hand touched my back and i jumped and whirled around turning so i could face them both because i knew who was behind me jeanclaude stood there eyes having bled back to normal i finally found my voice you called him we had an arrangement that whoever you called first would contact the other you should have told me i said jeanclaude put his hands on his hips i am not taking the blame for this he wished to be a surprise against my wishes i looked at richard is that true richard nodded yes why because if id played fair i still wouldnt have gotten a kiss i couldnt stand the thought of seeing you tonight and not touching you it wasnt so much his words as the look in his eyes the heat in his face that made me blush i have played you fair tonight ma petite and yet i am punished rather than rewarded jeanclaude held out his hand to me shall we begin with a kiss i was suddenly aware that we were standing on the dance floor near the metal framework and the waiting actors we had the audiences attention and i didnt want that i realized something i hadnt with the stone shield in place almost everyone in the room was a shapeshifter i could feel their energy like the brush of warm electric fur and they could feel ours i nodded i suddenly wanted the privacy that jeanclaude had offered earlier but staring from jeanclaude to richard i realized i didnt trust myself alone with them if we had a room to ourselves i couldnt guarantee that the sex would be merely metaphysical admitting that even to myself was embarrassing as uncomfortable as it was to do what we had to do in public it was still better than in private here i knew id say stop anywhere else i just wasnt sure i wasnt thinking about the wereleopards i was thinking about how large and bare my skin felt shit a kiss why not we can get a room richard said voice low i shook my head no no rooms he reached out as if to touch me and one look was enough to make his hand drop you dont trust us or me i said softly jeanclaude held out his hand to me come ma petite we delay their show i stared at his hand for a space of heartbeats then took it i expected him to pull me in against his body but he didnt he stopped with the width of a handspan between us i looked a question at him and he touched my face gently tentatively fingers hovering on either side of my face like hesitant butterflies as if he were afraid to touch me he lowered his face towards me as his fingertips found my skin his hands slid on either side of my face cupping it like something delicate and breakable id never felt him so tentative around me so unsure even as his lips hovered over mine i wondered if he was doing it this way on purpose to contrast with richards forcefulness then his lips touched mine and i stopped thinking it was the barest of brushes his mouth over mine then softly he kissed me i kissed him back being as tentative as he my hands raising covering his hands as they cradled my face hed thrown that surprisingly long black hair over one shoulder so that the right side of his face was bare to the lights and the hair didnt get in the way of the kiss i ran one hand down the side of his jaw tracing the shape of his face ever so gently as we kissed he shuddered under that light brush of my hand and the feel of him trembling under my hand brought a soft sound from low in my throat jeanclaudes mouth pressed against mine hard enough that i could feel the press of his fangs against my lip i opened my mouth and let him inside me ran my tongue between the delicate points id learned how to french kiss a vampire but it was a hazardous pleasure one to be done with care and i was out of practice in slipping my tongue between his fangs i nicked myself it was a quick sharp pain and jeanclaude made a soft guttural sound a heartbeat before i tasted blood his hands were suddenly at my back pulling me against his body the kiss never stopped and the urgency of it grew until it was as if he were feeding from my mouth trying to drink me down i might have pulled away i might not have but the moment the front of our bodies touched it was too late there was no going back no saying no nothing but sensation i felt that cool shimmering wind that was his aura touch mine for one trembling moment we were pressed together our energy breathing against each other like the sides of two great beasts then the boundaries that held our auras in place gave way think of it as if you were making love and suddenly your skin slid away spilling you against your partner into your partner giving you an intimacy that was never imagined never planned never wanted i screamed and he echoed me i felt us begin to fall to the floor but richard caught us cradled us against his body laid us gently on the floor the power did not leap across to him and i didnt know why jeanclaudes body was on top of mine pinning me to the floor his groin pressed over mine he drove his hips in against me forcing my legs apart around the slick covering of his legs i wanted him inside me wanted him to ride me while the power rode us he struggled up on his arms leaning up and away from me forcing his lower body tighter against mine and the power built in a skintingling rush building building like that shining edge of orgasm when you can feel it growing large and overwhelming but cant quite reach it i saw richard leaning over me like a dark shadow against the haze of the lights i think i tried to say no dont but no sound came he kissed me and the power flared but still he wasnt part of it he kissed my cheek my chin my neck working lower and i suddenly knew what he was doing he was kissing his way down to the hole over my heart chakra my energy center jeanclaude had already covered the one at my base my groin richards chest stretched above me smooth firm so temptingly close and i raised my mouth to his skin so that as he kissed down my body he drew his naked chest across my tongue i licked a wet line down his body he buried his mouth inside the halter top and touched over my heart and my mouth found his heart at the same moment the power didnt just build it exploded it was like lying at ground zero of a nuclear explosion the shock waves shooting out out out into the room while we melted together in the center for one shining moment i felt both of them inside me through me as if they were wind pure power pouring through me through us richards electric warmth buzzed over us jeanclaudes cool power poured over and through like a chill wind and i was something large and growing holding the warmth of the living and the cold of the dead i was both and neither we were all and none i dont know if i passed out or if i just lost time for some metaphysical reason all i remembered was that i was suddenly lying on the floor with richard collapsed beside me pinning one of my arms his body curled around my chest and head his legs touching down the other side of my body jeanclaude was collapsed on top of me his body pressing the length of mine with his head to one side resting on richards leg they both had their eyes closed their breath coming in ragged pants just like mine it took me two tries to say a breathless get off me jeanclaude rolled to one side without ever opening his eyes the fall of his body forced richards legs to move a little farther out so that jeanclaude and i both lay in the semicircle of richards body the room was so quiet i thought we were the only ones left in it as if all the others had fled in terror of what wed done then the room thundered in applause and howling and other animal noises that i didnt have words for the noise was deafening beating against my body in waves as if i had nerves in places where id never had nerves before asher was suddenly standing over us he knelt beside me touching the pulse in my neck blink if you can hear me anita i blinked can you speak yes he nodded and touched jeanclaude next stroking a hand down his cheek jeanclaude opened his eyes at the touch he gave a smile that seemed to mean more to asher than to me because it made asher laugh the laugh was a very masculine one as if theyd shared some dirty joke that i didnt understand asher crawled around me until he was kneeling by richards head he lifted a handful of thick hair so he could see richards face clearly richard blinked at him but didnt seem to be focusing asher bent low over richard and i heard him say can you hear me mon ami richard swallowed coughed and said yes bon bon it took me two tries but i had a smartaleck comment and i was going to make it now everyone who can stand raise their hands none of us moved i felt distant floating my body too heavy to move or maybe my mind was too overwhelmed to make it move have no fears ma cherie we will attend you asher stood and it was as if it were a signal figures moved out of the crowd i recognized three of them jamils waist length cornrows looked right at home with his black leather outfit he was richards lead enforcer or skцll shangda didnt look comfortable in black leather but the sixfootplus chinese never looked comfortable outside of nice dress clothes with polished wing tips shangda was the other enforcer for the pack the hati sylvie knelt beside me looking splendid in vinyl her short brown hair touched with burgundy highlights though it looked good i knew she was conservative enough that it was probably a temporary color she sold insurance when she wasnt being richards second in command his freki and insurance salespeople didnt have hair the color of a good red wine she smiled at me wearing more makeup than id ever seen her in it looked great but it didnt really look like sylvie for the first time i thought how pretty she was and that she was almost as delicatelooking as me i owed you a rescue she said once upon a time a bunch of nasty vampires had come to town to teach jeanclaude richard and me a lesson theyd taken prisoners along the way sylvie had been one of them id gotten her out and id kept my promise to see everyone who touched her dead she did the actual killing but i delivered them up to her for punishment she kept a few bones as souvenirs sylvie would never complain that i was too violent maybe she could be my new best friend the werewolves took up positions around us facing outward like good bodyguards none of them were as physically imposing as narcissuss bodyguards had been but id seen the wolves fight and muscles arent everything skill counts and a certain level of ruthlessness two vampires came to stand with asher and the wolves i didnt recognize either of them the woman was asian with shining black hair that fell barely to her shoulders the hair was nearly the same color and brilliance as the vinyl cat suit that clung to nearly every inch of her body the suit made sure you were aware of her high tight breasts her tiny waist the swell of her shapely hips she gave me an unfriendly look with her dark eyes before she turned her back on me and stood hands at her side waiting waiting for what i wasnt sure the second vampire was male not much taller than the woman with thick brown hair that had been shaved close to his head except for a layer left on top that came about halfway to his eyes shining and straight he gazed down on me with a smile eyes the color of new pennies as if his brown eyes held just a trace of blood in them he turned his attention outward arms crossed over the black leather of his chest they too faced outward like good bodyguards letting the crowd know that even though we couldnt stand up we werent helpless comforting i guess jason crawled in between their legs head hanging down as if he were almost too tired to move he raised his blue eyes to me and the look was almost as unfocused as i felt he gave a pale version of his usual grin and said was it good for you i was feeling better enough to try and sit up but failed jeanclaude said lie a little longer ma petite since i had no choice i did what he suggested i lay staring up at the dark distant ceiling with its rows of lights theyd turned off most of them so that the club was nearly dark like the soft gloom that comes when you close the drapes during the day i felt jason lay down on the other side of me head resting on my thigh not long ago id have made him move but id spent my time away learning how to be comfortable being close with the wereleopards it had made me more tolerant of everyone apparently why are you tired he rolled his head up to look at me without raising it from my leg one hand curving over my calf as if to keep his balance you spill sex and magic through the whole club and you ask why im tired you are such a tease i frowned at him one more comment like that and youll have to move he snuggled his head on my hose i can see that your underwear matches get off of me jason he slid to the floor without being told twice he could never leave well enough alone our jason he always had to get the last joke the last comment that one bit too many i worried that someday with someone else that little quirk might get him hurt or worse richard propped himself up on one elbow moving slowly as if he wasnt sure everything was working i dont know if that felt better than anything else weve ever done or worse it feels like a combination of a hangover and mild flu to me i said and yet it feels good jeanclaude said i finally got upright and found that they both had a hand at my back to support me as if their movements had been simultaneous i actually leaned in against their hands rather than telling them to move one i was still shaky two i just didnt find the physical contact unpleasant all these months of trying to forge the wereleopards into a cohesive friendly unit and it was me that had learned to be cohesive and friendly me that had learned that not every helping hand is a threat to my independence me that had learned that not every offer of physical closeness is a trap or a lie richard sat up first slowly keeping his hand on my back then jeanclaude sat up keeping his hand very still against me i felt them exchange glances this was the moment that i usually pulled away wed have some fantastic sex metaphysical or otherwise and that was my cue to close down hide we were in public all the more reason to do it i didnt pull away richards arm slid cautiously up my back over my shoulders jeanclaudes arm moved lower around my waist they both pulled me into the curve of their bodies as if they were some huge warm vinylcovered chair with a pulse some say that in that moment during sex when you both have an orgasm your auras drop you blend your energies yourselves together you share so much more than just your body during sex its one of the reasons you should be careful who you do it with just sitting there on the floor with them was like that i could feel their energies moving through me like a lowlevel current a distant hum in time i was pretty sure it would become white noise something you can ignore like psychic shielding when you no longer have to concentrate on it but now it was like we would always walk move through that dreamy afterglow where you were still connected still not quite back in your own skin i didnt push them away because i didnt want to pushing them away would have been redundant we didnt need to touch to breach the barriers anymore and that should have scared me more than anything else but it didnt narcissus walked out into the middle of the floor and a soft light fell upon him growing ever so gradually brighter well my friends we have had a treat tonight have we not more applause screams and animal noises filled the dimness narcissus held up his hands until the crowd fell quiet i think we have had our climax for the night a smattering of laughter at that we will save our show until tomorrow for to do less would be to dishonor what we have been offered here tonight the woman who was still standing to the back of the dance floor in her robe said i cant compete with that narcissus blew her a kiss it is not a competition sweet miranda it is that we all have our gifts some are merely more rare than others he turned and stared at us as he said the last his eyes were pale and oddly colored and it took me a second or two to realize that narcissuss eyes had bled to his beast hyena eyes i guess though truthfully i didnt know what hyena eyes looked like i just knew they werent human eyes he knelt beside us smoothing his dress down in an automatic and strangely odd gesture that id never seen a man make before of course he was also the first man id ever seen in a dress there was probably a cause and effect narcissus lowered his voice i would love to speak with you in private about this of course jeanclaude said but first we have other business narcissus leaned in close lowering his voice until it was necessary to lean forward to hear him as i have two of my guards waiting with her leopards so no harm will come there is time to talk or should i say your leopards for surely now what belongs to one belongs to all he had leaned so far over that his cheek nearly touched jeanclaude on one side and my face on the other no i said the leopards are mine really narcissus said he turned his face that fraction of an inch and brushed his lips against mine it might have been an accident but i doubted it you dont share everything then i moved my face just far enough away so we werent touching no so good to know he whispered he leaned forward and pressed his mouth to jeanclaudes lips i was startled frozen for a second wondering exactly what to do jeanclaude knew exactly what to do he put one finger in the mans chest and pushed not with muscle but with power the power of the marks the power that we had all just moments before solidified jeanclaude drew on it as if hed done it a thousand times before effortlessly gracefully commandingly narcissus was pushed back from him by a rush of invisible power that i could feel tugging on my body and i knew that most of the people in the room could feel it as well narcissus stayed crouched on the floor staring at jeanclaude staring at all of us the look on his face was angry but there was more hunger in it than rage a hunger denied we need to talk in private narcissus insisted jeanclaude nodded that would be best i think there was a weight of things left unsaid in that short exchange i felt richards puzzlement mirror my own before i turned my head to glance back at him the movement put our faces close enough so that we could almost have kissed i could tell just by the expression in his eyes that he didnt know what was going on and he seemed to know that i could tell because he didnt bother to shrug or make any outward acknowledgment it wasnt telepathy though to an outsider it might look that way it was more extreme empathy as if i could read every nuance on his face the smallest change and know what it meant i was still pressed in the circle of richards and jeanclaudes arms a strange amount of bare skin touching all of us my back richards chest and stomach jeanclaudes arm there was something incredibly right about the touching the closeness i felt jeanclaudes attention turn before i moved my head to meet his eyes the look in those drowning eyes held worlds of things unsaid unasked all so tremblingly close because for once he didnt see in my eyes the barriers that kept all those words trapped it had to be the marriage of the marks affecting me but that night i think he could have asked me anything anything and i wasnt sure id say no what he finally said was shall we retire to privacy to discuss business with narcissus his voice had its usual smoothness only his eyes held uncertainty and a need so large he almost had no words for it wed all waited so long for my surrender i knew that the phrasing wasnt mine it sounded more like something jeanclaude would think but with richard also pressed against my body i wasnt really sure who was thinking it i only knew it hadnt been me even before the marks had merged id had moments like this moments when their thoughts invaded mine overrode mine the images had been the worst nightmare flashes of feeding on the warm bodies of animals of drinking blood from people i didnt know it had been this mingling this loss of self that had terrified me sent me running for anything that would keep me whole keep me myself tonight that just didnt seem important definitely an aftereffect of the metaphysical union of marks but knowing what it was didnt make it go away it was a dangerous night jeanclaude said ma petite are you well i am feeling much better energized in fact are you still ill i shook my head no i feel fine fine didnt really cover it energized was a good word for it but there were others how long could it take to rescue the wereleopards from yet another disaster the night wasnt young dawn would come and i wanted to be alone with them before that i realized with a jolt that ran all the way down my body that tonight was it if we could get some privacy and not be interrupted all things would suddenly be possible richard and jeanclaude both stood up in a boneless movement of grace for the vampire and pure energy for the werewolf i gazed at them as they stood above me and i was suddenly eager to have the other business done with i wasnt as worried about the leopards as i should have been and that did bother me whatever this effect was it was distracting me from more important things saving the leopards was why id come it was the first time id really thought of them in a while i shook my head trying to clear it of sex and magic and the weight of possibilities in richards eyes jeanclaudes eyes were more cautious but id taught him caution where i was concerned i held my hands up to both of them i never asked for help to stand unless i was bleeding or something was broken the two of them exchanged glances then they held their hands out to me again in perfect unison like choreographed dancers who knew what the other would do they could feel my desire but that had always been there it told them nothing i took their hands and let them lift me up they were both still looking unsure almost suspicious as if they were waiting for me to recoil from them and run screaming from the intimacy of it all i had to smile if we can get everyone all tucked in safe and sound before dawn all things will be possible they exchanged another look between them jeanclaude made a small movement as if encouraging richard it was a tiny almostpush with his head as if to say go ahead ask normally seeing them plot behind my back pissed me off but not that night do you mean richard let the thought trail off i nodded and richards hand tightened on mine jeanclaudes hand was strangely quiet in mine you do realize ma petite that this new he hesitated willingness may be a byproduct of joining the marks tonight i dont wish you to accuse us later of trickery i know what it is and i dont care i should have but i didnt it was like being drunk or drugged and even thinking that made no difference i was looking at jeanclaude and i saw him let out the breath hed been holding i felt richard do the same it was as if a great weight had been taken from both of them and i knew that i was that burden id try not to be a burden from now on lets get this over with and go get the leopards i said jeanclaude raised my hand to his mouth brushing the knuckles across his lips and be gone from this place i nodded and be gone from this place i said id been complaining to jeanclaude for years that his decorating scheme was too monochromatic but one look at narcissuss bedroom and i knew i owed jeanclaude an apology the room was done in black and i mean black the walls the hardwood floor the drawn drapes against one wall the bed the only color in the room was the silver chains and the silvercolored implements hanging from the wall the color of the steel seemed to accentuate the blackness rather than relieve it chains dangled from the ceiling above the huge bed it was bigger than kingsized the only term that came to mind was orgysized the bed was fourpostered with the largest heaviest darkest wood id ever seen more chains dangled from the four posts set in heavy permanent rings if id been on a date id have turned and run for it but this wasnt a date and in we all trooped my understanding about most people who were into d and s was that their bedrooms were separate from their dungeons nearby perhaps but not the same room you needed somewhere to go to actually sleep maybe narcissus just never rested from the fun and games there was a door in the opposite wall and the drapes were drawn over the middle of one wall maybe his real bed was behind door number two or the drapes i hoped so the only chair in the room had straps attached to it so narcissus offered us the bed to sit on i dont know if i would have sat down or not but first jeanclaude then richard did jeanclaude settled against the black bedspread as he did everything with grace settling his body against the pillows as if he felt utterly comfortable but it was richard who surprised me i expected to see in him some of the discomfort i felt about the room but he didnt seem in the least uncomfortable in fact i realized for the first time that the heavy leather cuffs at his wrists and the collar at his throat had metal hooks in them so they could be attached to chains or a leash hed probably worn them so he could blend into the club scene as id worn the boots but but i could feel that he was calm about the room and everything in it i wasnt i looked at jeanclaude and richard and knew id decided to sleep with both of them tonight however we arranged it but seeing them on the bed in the middle of all this watching them at home in it made me wonder about my decision it made me think that maybe after all this time i still didnt know what i was getting myself into asher was wandering the room looking at the things on the wall i couldnt read him like i could read the others but he too seemed unruffled and i didnt think it was an act narcissus had swept into the room with ajax at his back hed agreed to leave everyone else in the hallway or downstairs in exchange for us leaving our extra wolves outside the room i guess for true privacy you did need less than a double digit worth of people in a room richard held his hand out to me its okay anita nothing in this room can hurt you without your permission and youre not going to give that that wasnt exactly the comforting comment id wanted but i guess it was the truth i used to believe that truth was good but id begun to realize that it is neither good nor bad its just the truth life had been simpler when i believed in blackandwhite absolutes i took his hand and let him draw me to the bed between jeanclaude and himself well narcissus had already made a play for jeanclaude so i guess we needed to make the handsoff point but it still bothered me that richard put me between them not simply beside him the warm fuzzy feeling id had from the marriage of the marks seemed to be receding at an alarming rate magic does that sometimes i felt stiff and uncomfortable on the black bed between my two men what is wrong ma petite you are suddenly very tense i looked at jeanclaude raising my eyebrows am i the only one here that doesnt like this room jeanclaude liked this room very much once narcissus said i turned and looked at the werehyena as he paced the room in his stocking feet what do you mean i asked jeanclaude answered once i submitted to unwanted advances because i was told to do so but those days are past i stared at him and he wouldnt meet my gaze his eyes were all for narcissus as the other man paced around the bed i dont remember you being unwilling narcissus said he leaned against the far post of the bed i learned long ago to make a virtue of necessity jeanclaude said besides nikolaos the old master of the city sent me to you you remember now she was narcissus refusal of an order was not allowed id had the horror of meeting nikolaos personally she had been very very scary so i was an unpleasant duty he sounded angry jeanclaude shook his head your body is pleasant narcissus what you like doing with your lovers if they can take the damage is not jeanclaude looked down as if searching for the right word then raised his midnight blue eyes to narcissus and i saw the effect that his gaze had on the shapeshifter narcissus looked like hed been hit between the eyes with a hammer a handsome charming hammer is not what narcissus asked his voice hoarse is not to my taste jeanclaude said besides i must not have pleased you very much for you did not do what my late master wished you to do i was the reason that nikolaos was the late master of the city shed been trying to kill me and id gotten lucky she was dead i wasnt and now jeanclaude got to be master of the city i hadnt planned that how much of it jeanclaude had planned was still up for debate it is not just prejudice on my part that makes me trust him less than richard narcissus put one knee on the bed one hand still around the bedpost you pleased me very much the look on his face was too intimate they should have been alone for this conversation but then again watching the way narcissus looked at jeanclaude maybe that wouldnt have been such a great idea from jeanclaude all i sensed was a desire to soothe any injured feelings but i was betting if i could peek inside narcissuss head id find a different kind of desire nikolaos thought i failed her and punished me for it i could not ally myself with her not even for you as my permanent toy jeanclaude raised an eyebrow at that i do not remember that being part of the deal when i first told her no she sweetened the offer narcissus crawled onto the bed he stayed crouched on all fours as if he were expecting someone to come up behind him in what way did she sweeten the offer narcissus started to crawl across the bed slowly his knees catching on the hem of his dress as he moved she offered you to me for always to do with as i wished a thrill of terror ran through me from my toes to the top of my head it took me a second to realize it wasnt my fear richard and i both turned to jeanclaude his face showed nothing it was his usual polite attractive almost bored mask but we could both feel the cold screaming terror in his mind at the thought of how close hed come to being narcissuss permanent guest it filled him with a fear that was larger than the shapeshifter images flashed through my mind memories chained on my stomach on rough wood the sound of a whip going back the shock of it biting into my skin and the knowledge that it was only the first blow the wave of utter despair that followed that memory left me blinking back tears i had a confused image of being tied to a wall with a hand rotted to green pus caressing my body then the images stopped abruptly like someone had thrown a switch but the body the hand had been traveling down had been male they were jeanclaudes memories not mine hed been projecting his memories on me and when he realized it hed blocked it i looked at him and couldnt keep the horror out of my eyes my hair hid my face from narcissus and i was glad because i couldnt be blasй about what id just seen jeanclaude didnt look at me but kept his eyes on narcissus i was trying not to cry and jeanclaudes face betrayed nothing jeanclaude hadnt been remembering narcissuss abuse but others many countless others it wasnt the pain i carried away from the memories but the despair the thought that i no he he had not owned his own body he had never been a prostitute or rather he had never traded sex for money but for power the whim of whoever was his current master and strangely for safety he had traded sex for centuries id known that but id pictured him as the seducer what id just seen had nothing to do with seduction a small sound came from richard and i turned to him his eyes were shiny with unshed tears and he had the same look of numb horror that i felt on my own face we looked at each other for a long frozen moment then a tear trickled down his face a second before a hot line of tears eased down my own he reached for my hand and i took it and we both turned to jeanclaude he was still watching even talking though i hadnt heard any of it with narcissus the other man had crawled all the way across that huge bed to be within touching distance of us all but it wasnt us all that he wanted to touch sweet sweet jeanclaude i thought i had forgotten you but seeing you tonight on the floor with the two of them made me remember he reached out towards jeanclaude and richard grabbed his wrist dont touch him dont ever touch him again narcissus looked from jeanclaude to richard and finally back to richard such possessiveness it must be true love i had a ringside seat and watched the muscles in richards hands and forearm tense as he squeezed that dainty wrist narcissus laughed voice shaky but not with pain such strength such passion would he crush my wrist just for trying to touch your hair his voice held amusement and what i finally realized was excitement richard touching him threatening him hurting him he was enjoying it i felt richard realize it too but he didnt let go instead he jerked the other man off balance until he fell against his body narcissus made a small surprised sound richard kept one hand on his wrist and he put the other to the mans neck not squeezing just there large and dark against narcissuss pale skin the bodyguard ajax had moved away from the wall and asher had moved to meet him things could go very bad very quickly here it was usually me that lost my temper and made things worse not richard narcissus had to sense rather than see the movement because richard had him facing away from the rest of the room its alright ajax its alright richard is not hurting me then richard did something that made narcissuss breath stop in his throat and come out harsh you may crush my wrist if its foreplay but if its not then my people will kill you all of you his words were reasonable his tone was not you could hear the pain in his voice but there was also anticipation as if whichever way richard answered it would excite him jeanclaude spoke do not give him an excuse to have us at his mercy mon ami we are in his territory tonight his guests we owe him a guests duty to his host as long as he does not forfeit that right i wasnt a hundred percent sure what a guests duties to his host were but i was willing to bet that crushing their limbs wasnt among them i touched richards shoulder and he jumped narcissus made a small protesting sound as if richard had involuntarily tightened his grip jeanclaudes right richard anita councils you to temperance richard and she is one of the least temperate people i have ever known jeanclaude moved forward laying his hand on richards other shoulder so we both touched him besides mon ami hurting this one will not undo the harm already done no drop of blood less will have been spilt no pound of flesh less will have been lost no humiliation will have been stopped it is over memories cannot harm us for the first time i wondered if richard and i had gotten the same memories in that flash of shared insight what id seen had been horrible but it hadnt affected me like it had him maybe it was a guy thing maybe a white anglosaxon uppermiddleclass male like richard would take memories of being abused and raped harder than i would i was a woman i knew things like that could happen to me maybe he had never thought they could happen to him richard spoke low his voice fallen to a rolling growl as if his beast lurked just behind that handsome throat never touch him again narcissus or well finish this then richard slowly carefully slid his hands away from narcissus i expected him to scoot away clutching his injured wrist but i underestimated him or maybe overestimated him narcissus did cradle his wrist but he stayed pressed against richards body youve torn ligaments in my wrist they take longer to heal than bone i know richard said softly the level of anger in those two words made me flinch with a thought i can tell my men to leave her wereleopards to the mercy of their captors richard glanced at jeanclaude who nodded narcissus can contact his men mindtomind richard put his hands on narcissuss shoulders to push him away i thought but narcissus said youve revoked your safe passage by injuring me against my will richard froze and i could see the tension in his back feel the sudden uncertainty what is he talking about i asked i wasnt even sure who i was asking narcissus has a small army of werehyenas within this building and on the surrounding buildings as guards jeanclaude said if the werehyenas are so powerful then why doesnt everyone talk about them in the same breath with the wolves and the rats i asked because narcissus prefers to be the power behind the throne ma petite it means that the other shapeshifters are constantly currying his favor with gifts like nikolaos used you i said he nodded i looked at richard what have you been giving him richard eased away from narcissus nothing narcissus turned on the bed still cradling his wrist thats about to change i dont think so richard said marcus and raina had an arrangement with me they and the rats dictated that my hyenas could never rise above fifty in number to make this happen they used gifts not threats the threat was always there richard said war between you us and the rats with you on the losing side narcissus shrugged perhaps but have you not wondered what ive been doing since marcus died and you took over i wondered when the gifts would start arriving but instead all gifts stopped even the ones id begun to count on he looked at me then some of those gifts were yours to give nimirra i must have looked as confused as i felt because jeanclaude said the wereleopards yes gabriel their old alpha was a dear dear friend of mine narcissus said since id killed gabriel i didnt like the way the conversation was going you mean that gabriel gave some of the wereleopards to you narcissuss smile made me shiver all of them have spent time in my care except nathaniel his smile faded i assumed gabriel kept nathaniel to himself because he was his personal favorite but now that youve told me what nathaniel is i know that wasnt it narcissus leaned forward on his knees gabriel was afraid to give me nathaniel afraid of what we might do together i swallowed hard you covered your reaction really well when i told you im an accomplished liar anita best remember that he looked up at richard how long has it been since marcuss death a little over a year when the gifts stopped coming i assumed the pact was at an end what are you saying richard asked there are over four hundred werehyenas now some new some recruited from out of state but we rival the wererats and werewolves now you will have to negotiate with us as equals instead of peons richard said what do you jeanclaude interrupted let us come to terms i felt the fear that was behind his calm words and so did richard you did not ask a sexual sadist what he wanted you offered what you were willing to give up narcissus looked at richard are they jeanclaudes wolves now richard do you share your kingship the tone was mocking i am ulfric and i will set the terms no one else but his voice was cautious the temper slowed id never seen richard like this and i wasnt sure i liked the change he was reacting more like me as i thought of it i wondered i channeled some of his beast some of jeanclaudes hunger what did they gain from me you know what i want narcissus said you would be wise not to ask for it jeanclaude said if i cannot have you jeanclaude then perhaps to watch the three of you make love on my bed would be enough to wash this insult clean between us richard and i said together no he looked at us and there was something unpleasant in his eyes then give me nathaniel no i said for one evening no for an hour he said i shook my head one of the other leopards i wont give you any of my people he looked at richard and you ulfric will you give me one of your wolves you know the answer narcissus richard said then what would you offer me ulfric name something im willing to give narcissus smiled and i had a sense of ajax and asher circling each other as they felt the tension rising i want to be included in the conferences that run the shapeshifter community in this town richard nodded fine rafael and i thought you had no interest in politics or you would already have been asked the rat king does not know my heart nor do the wolves richard stood anita needs to go to her people narcissus smiled and shook his head oh no ulfric it is not that easy richard frowned youre to be included in decision making thats what you wanted but i still want gifts no gifts pass between the rats and the wolves we are allies if you wish to be an ally then there will be no gifts except that we will come to your aid when you need us narcissus shook his head again i do not wish to be allies to be dragged into every squabble between animals that do not concern me no ulfric you mistake me i wish to be included in the conferences that set policy but i do not wish to tie myself to anyone and be dragged into a war that is not of my own making then what are you asking richard said gifts bribes you mean richard said narcissus shrugged call it what you will no richard said i felt jeanclaude tense a moment before richard said it mon ami no richard said and turned to jeanclaude even if he could kill us all which i doubt my wolves your vampires they would rain down on this club and take it apart brick by brick he wont risk that narcissus is a cautious leader i learned from watching him deal with marcus he puts his own safety and comfort above all else the comfort and safety of my people above all else narcissus said he looked at me what of you nimirra how confident do you feel do you think if i had my people kill your kittens that the werewolves and vampires would lift a finger to avenge them you forget narcissus shes also my lupa my mate the wolves will defend who she tells them to defend ah yes the human lupa the human leopard queen but not really human is she i met his gaze and said i need to go collect my leopards thanks for the hospitality i pushed to my feet and stood beside richard narcissus looked at jeanclaude who still lounged on the bed are they really such children he asked him jeanclaude gave a graceful shrug they are not like us narcissus they still believe in right and wrong and rules then let me teach them a new rule he stared up at us still kneeling on the bed still wearing the black lace dress and suddenly his power burst out before him in lines of heat it slammed into my body like a giant hand nearly staggering me richard reached out to steady me and the moment we touched his beast jumped between us in a rush of warmth that raced through my body in goosebumps and shivers richards body shuddered and i felt his breath our breath catch that otherworldly power curled between us and for the first time i realized that the power came both ways id thought what was inside me was an echo of richards beast but it was more than that maybe it would have been different if i hadnt separated myself from him for so long but now the power that had once been his was mine the warmth spilled between us like two streams converging into a river two scalding hot streams that spilled into a river that boiled over my skin it was so hot that i half expected my skin to peel away and reveal the beast underneath if she shifts then my men are free to enter this fight narcissuss voice was shocking i think id forgotten he was there forgotten everything but the hot hot power flowing between richard and me narcissuss face began to grow longer it was like watching sticks move behind clay richard ran his hand just in front of my body caressing the power that flowed off of my skin there was a look of soft wonderment on his face she wont shift you have my word richard said good enough you always keep your word i may be a sadist and a masochist but i am still oba of this clan his voice had become a strange highpitched growl you have insulted me and through me all that is mine claws slid out from his small fingers until he raised curved paws not hands at all jeanclaude came to stand beside us come ma petite let them have room to maneuver he touched my hand and that scalding power poured from my skin to his he collapsed to his knees hand still pressed against my skin as if the heat had welded it in place i knelt by him and his gaze raised drowning blue the pupil lost in a rush of power but not his power he opened his mouth to speak but no sound came out he stared at me and judging by the look on his face he felt lost overwhelmed whats wrong asher asked from across the room still facing ajax im not sure i said he seems in pain narcissus said it made me glance up at him except for his face and hands he was still in human form the really powerful alphas could do that partial changes the power spills over him richard said and his voice held that edge of growl his throat was hidden behind the leather collar but i knew if i could see it that the skin would be smooth and perfect his voice could howl from his mouth like a dogs without any change in his appearance but he is a vampire narcissus said the power of the wolves should be closed to him the wolf is his animal to call richard said i looked into jeanclaudes face from inches away watched him struggle through the hot scalding power and knew why he wasnt dealing well with it this was primal energy the life and beat of the earth under our feet the rush of wind in the trees the stuff of life and jeanclaude for all that he walked and talked and flirted wasnt alive richard knelt beside us and jeanclaude let out a low moan halfcollapsing against me jeanclaude richard rolled him over into his arms and jeanclaudes spine bowed his breath coming in ragged gasps narcissus was above us on the bed whats wrong with him i dont know richard said i put a hand on jeanclaudes throat the pulse wasnt just racing it was beating like a caged thing i tried to use the ability i had to sense vampires but all i could feel was the heat of the beast there was nothing cold or dead in the circle of our arms lay him on the floor richard he looked at me do it he laid jeanclaude gently on the floor hand still touching his shoulder move away from him i did what i asked of richard standing and moving around the vampire pushing richard back with my body until jeanclaude lay alone beside the bed narcissuss body had reformed until he was the graceful man wed met downstairs hed moved off the bed without being told but moved around so he could still watch jeanclaude rolled slowly onto his side and moved his head to stare at us he licked his lips and tried twice before he could speak what have you done to me richard and i still stood in a cocoon of heat his hands brushed my arms and i shuddered against him his arms locked around my waist and the more of our bodies that touched the more heat rose around us until i thought the very air should tremble like the heat of a summers day off a tar road shared richards power with you i said no jeanclaude said and he rose slowly to sit propped heavily on his arms not just richard but you ma petite you richard and i have shared much but it never did this you are the bridge between the two worlds asher spoke she bridges life and death jeanclaude looked up at him sharply a harsh look on his face exactement narcissus spoke i knew marcus and raina could share their power their beasts but anita is not a werewolf you should not be able to share your beast with each other wolf to leopard im not a wereleopard i said me thinks the lady doth protest too much narcissus said or wereanimal to vampire asher said i looked at asher dont you start he smiled at me i know that you are not a true shapeshifter but your magic has changed because of the addition of richard there is something about you that if i did not know better i would say you were indeed one of them richard said the wolf is jeanclaudes animal to call narcissus said that doesnt explain this asher said he knelt by jeanclaude reaching towards him jeanclaude caught his hand before it could touch his face and asher jerked back youre hot to the touch not just warm hot it is like the rush after we feed but more more alive he gazed up at us and his eyes were still drowning blue go save your leopards ma petite and let us retire before dawn i want to see how hot he took a deep breath and i knew he was drawing in the scent of us this power will grow it is all very impressive narcissus said but i will have my pound of flesh youre beginning to get on my nerves i said he smiled be that as it may i still have a right to ask for the insult to be avenged i looked at richard he nodded i sighed you know its usually me that gets us into this kind of trouble were not in trouble yet richard said narcissus is grandstanding why do you think i didnt change he stared at the smaller man narcissus smiled and here i thought you were just decorative muscle standing behind marcus you wont fight unless you run out of options narcissus so no more games there was a coldness in richards voice a firmness that could not be crossed or reasoned with again it echoed me more than him just how tough had the last few months been on him and his wolves there are only a few things that will harden you this fast death of those close to you police work or combat where people are actually dying around you in civilian life richard was a junior high science teacher so it wasnt police work i think someone would have mentioned if hed lost family members that left combat how many challengers had he fought how many had he killed who had died i shook my head to clear away the thoughts one problem at a time you cant have any of us or our people narcissus youre not going to start a war over the refusal so where does that leave us i will take my men out of the room with your cats anita i will do that he came to stand in front of me his back to the bedpost one hand playing with the chains attached to it making the metal jingle the people that have them are not terribly creative but they have a certain raw talent for pain he stared at me with human eyes again what do you want narcissus richard said he wrapped the chain around one wrist over and over something worth having richard someone worth having asher said do you merely want someone to dominate or are you interested in being dominated narcissus looked back at him why answer the question truthfully narcissus jeanclaude said you may find it worthwhile narcissus looked from one vampire to the other then back to asher standing there in his brown leather outfit i prefer to dominate but with the right person ill allow myself to be topped asher walked towards us making his tall slender body sway ill top you you do not have to do this jeanclaude said dont do it asher i said well find another way richard said asher looked at us with those pale pale blue eyes i thought youd be happy jeanclaude ive finally agreed to take a lover isnt that what you wanted me to do his voice was mild but the mockery came through just the same the bitterness i have offered you nearly all in my power and you have refused all why him why now jeanclaude got to his knees and i offered him a hand up not a hundred percent sure that i should he looked at the offered hand if you think its safe i said he wrapped his hand around mine and the power flowed in a burning rush down my hand over his down his arm and i felt it hit his heart like a blow he closed his eyes swayed for a second then looked at me it was unexpected the first time he started to stand and richard went to his other side so that we held him between us i dont know if this is good for you or not i said you fill me with life ma petite you and richard how can it be bad i didnt say the obvious but i thought it really hard if you could fill the walking dead with life should you and if you did what would happen to that walking dead so much of what we were doing between us magically had never been done before or only once before unfortunately wed had to kill the other triumvirate that consisted of a vamp a werewolf and a necromancer theyd been trying to kill us but still they might have been able to answer questions that no one else could have answered now we were just swinging in the dark hoping we didnt hurt each other look at you jeanclaude between them like a candle with two wicks you will burn yourself up asher said that is my concern yes and what i do is mine you ask why him why now first you need me which of the three of you would be willing to do this asher moved around narcissus as if he werent there eyes on jeanclaude on us oh i know that you could have topped him you can do it when you want and make a virtue of necessity but hes had you beneath him and nothing less will satisfy him now he stood close enough that the energy swirled outward over him like a lip of hot ocean water his breath came out in a shuddering sigh mon dieu he stepped back until his legs touched the bed then he sat down on the black sheets his brown leather didnt match as well as the rest of us had such power jeanclaude and yet none of you wishes to pay the price for richards temper tantrum but i will pay that price you know my rule asher i never ask of others what im not willing to do myself i said he looked at me curiously face unreadable behind the mask except for his eyes are you volunteering i shook my head no but you dont have to do this we will find another way and what if i want to do it he asked i looked at him for a second then shrugged i dont know what to say to that it disturbs you that i might want to do this doesnt it his eyes were intense yes i said that intense gaze moved past me to jeanclaude it bothers him too he wonders if i am ruined and all that is left for me is pain you once told me that everything worked that you were scarred but functional i said he blinked and looked at me did i well a man does not like to admit such things to a pretty woman or to a handsome man he looked up at us but the only person he was really looking at was jeanclaude i will pay the toll for our handsome monsieur zeemans display of strength but i will not be the whipping boy not this time not ever again hung heavy in the air unsaid but there all the same asher had had two hundred years of being at the mercy of the people who had given jeanclaude the memories that richard and i had flashed on two centuries more of that kind of care and torment when asher had first come to us hed been cruel occasionally i thought wed cured him of it but watching the look in his eyes now i knew we hadnt and do you know the best part of all asher asked jeanclaude just shook his head it will cause you pain to think of me with narcissus and even after i am with him he will still not answer the question you have been wanting so desperately to have answered jeanclaude stiffened hand tightening on mine i felt him slam his own shields into place keeping us out of what he was thinking feeling at that moment the warm roiling power between us began to dissipate jeanclaude had made himself part of our circuit now he was shutting us down though i didnt think it was on purpose he just couldnt shield himself from us and keep the flow going his voice came out calm his usual bored yet cultured tone how can you be so sure that he will not talk i can be sure of what i do and i will not give him the answer you want what answer i asked what are you guys talking about the two vampires looked at each other ask jeanclaude asher said i looked at jeanclaude but he was staring at asher in a way the rest of us were superfluous an audience for a show that didnt need one youre being petty asher richard said the vampires gaze moved to the man on my other side and the anger in those eyes made the blue spill across the pupils in a frosted gleam he looked blind have i not earned the right to be petty richard richard shook his head just tell him the truth there are three people in his power that i would strip for that i would allow to touch me and answer that so important question he stood in one graceful movement like a liquid puppet on strings he stepped close enough for the power to spill around him bringing his breath shuddering from his lips the power recognized him flared stronger as if he could act as our third if we werent careful did the power just need a vampire and not specifically jeanclaude richard shut down his side of the power clanging a shield in place that made me think of metal strong and solid uncompromising asher caressed the air just above richards arm and had to step away rubbing his hands on his arms the power fades he shook himself like a dog coming out of water if you would say yes his torment could end i frowned at them both not sure i was following the conversation not sure i wanted to asher turned those pale drowning eyes to me or our fair anita he was already shaking his head but no i know better than to ask i have enjoyed shocking our so heterosexual richard by my overtures but anita is not so easily teased he came to stand in front of jeanclaude and of course if he wanted the answer badly enough he could do it himself jeanclaudes face was at its most arrogant its most hidden you know why i do not asher moved back to stand in front of me he refuses my bed because he fears that you would what is the american word dump him if you knew he were sleeping with a man would you i had to swallow before i could answer yeah asher smiled but not like he was happy more like it had been a predictable answer then i will pleasure myself here with narcissus and jeanclaude will still not know if i stay because i have become a lover of such things or because this type of love is all that is left for me i havent agreed to this narcissus said before i take second no fourth choice let me see what im buying asher stood turning so that his left side was towards the werehyena he unzipped the mask and lifted it over his head we were standing enough to one side so that i could see that perfect profile his golden hair and i mean golden was braided along the back of his head so that nothing interfered with the view i was used to looking at asher through a film of hair without it the lines of his face were like sculpture something so smooth and lovely that you wanted to touch it trace the movement of it with your hands layer it with kisses even after the little show hed put on he was still beautiful nothing seemed to change that when i looked at asher very nice narcissus said very very nice but i have many beautiful men at my beck and call perhaps not as beautiful but still asher turned to face the man whatever narcissus was about to say died in his throat the right side of ashers face looked like melted candle wax the scars didnt start until well away from the midline of his face it was as if his torturers all those centuries ago had wanted him to have enough left to remember the perfection hed once been his eyes were still goldenlashed his nose perfect his mouth full and kissable but the rest the rest was scarred not ruined not spoiled but scarred i remembered ashers smooth perfection the feel of that perfect body rubbing against mine not my memories i had never seen asher nude i had never touched him that way but jeanclaude had about two hundred years ago it made it impossible for me to look at asher with unprejudiced eyes because i remembered being in love with him in fact was still a little in love with him which meant that jeanclaude was still a little in love with him my personal life just cant get more complicated narcissus drew a shuddering breath and said in a voice gone hoarse eyes wide oh my asher threw the hood on the bed and began to unzip the front of the leather shirt very slowly id seen his chest before and knew that it was much worse than his face the right side of his chest was carved with deep runnels the skin hard to the touch the left side like his face still had that angelic beauty that had attracted the vampires to him long ago when the zipper was halfway down his body baring his chest and upper stomach narcissus had to sit down on the bed as if his legs wouldnt hold him i think narcissus jeanclaude said that after tonight you will owe us a favor his voice was empty when he said it devoid of anything it was the voice he used when he was at his most careful or his most pained asher asked in a careful voice that didnt quite match the striptease he was doing what level of pain does narcissus enjoy straight how do you say out of the box rough jeanclaude said he can control his desire and not step outside the bounds of his submissive but if he is to be topped then rough very rough you do not need a warming up period for this one jeanclaudes voice was still empty asher looked down at narcissus is that true do you like to start out with a bang that last word was slow seductive one word and it held worlds of promise within it narcissus nodded slowly you can start with blood if youve the balls for it most people have to work up to that for it to be pleasurable asher said i dont narcissus said asher finished unzipping and lowered the shirt off his arms held it in his hands for a moment then struck out with a movement so quick it was only an afterimage blur he slapped narcissus across the face with the heavy zipper once twice three times until blood showed at the corner of his mouth and his eyes looked unfocused i was so startled by all of it that i think i forgot to breathe all i could do was stare jeanclaude had gone very still between richard and me it wasnt the utter stillness that he was capable of that all the old masters were capable of and i realized why he couldnt sink into that black stillness of death with the lingering touch of the life wed pumped through him narcissus used the tip of his tongue to taste the blood on his mouth i am an accomplished liar but i always give fair trade he was suddenly more serious than he had been as if the flippant tease was just a mask and underneath was a more solemn thinking person when he looked up there was a person in his eyes that i knew was dangerous the flirt was real too but it was partially camouflage to make everyone underestimate him looking into his eyes i knew that to underestimate him would be a very bad thing he turned those newly serious eyes to asher for this i will owe you a favor but only one favor not three asher reached up and undid his hair letting the heavy sparkling waves fall around his face he stared down at the smaller man and i couldnt see the look he gave but whatever it was it made narcissus look like a drowning man i am only worth one favor asher said i think not narcissus had to swallow twice before he could speak perhaps more he turned and looked at us and his eyes were still raw real go save your wereleopards whoever they belong to but know this the ones inside are new to our community they do not know our rules and their own rules seem harsh by comparison you warn us narcissus thank you jeanclaude said i think that this one would not like it if you were hurt no matter how angry he is with you jeanclaude i am about to let him bind me to this bed or the wall and do to me whatever he wishes whatever i wish asher asked narcissuss gaze flicked back to him no not whatever but until i use the safety word yes there was something almost childlike in the way he said the last as if he were already thinking of what was to come and not really concentrating on us safety word i asked narcissus gazed at me if the pain grows too much or if something is proposed that the slave does not want to do you use the word agreed upon once the word is spoken the master must stop but youll be tied up you wont be able to make him stop narcissuss eyes were drowning drowning in things that i didnt understand and didnt want to it is both the trust and the element of uncertainty that makes the event anita you trust that hell stop when you say stop but you like the thought that he might not stop that he might just keep going richard said it made me stare at him but i caught narcissuss nod am i the only one in this room that doesnt understand how this game is played remember anita richard said i was a virgin until raina got me she was my first lover and her tastes ran to the exotic narcissus laughed then a virgin in rainas hands what a frightening image even i wouldnt let her top me because you could see it in her eyes see what i asked that she had no stopping point having almost been a star in one of her little bedroom dramas saved only by the fact that id killed her first i had to agree raina liked it better if you didnt want to do it richard said she was a sexual sadist not a dominant it took me a long time to realize how big a difference there is between the two i looked at his face but he was safe behind his shields i couldnt read him he and jeanclaude had more practice at shielding than i did but frankly i didnt want to know what was behind the lost look on richards face i realized with a start that i had jeanclaudes memories but not richards it had never occurred to me to ask why that was but later later right now i wanted to be out of this room i want out of here jeanclaude pulled gently away from both of us to stand on his own yes the night is running out and we have much to do i didnt look at him or richard id pretty much promised that if dawn stayed at bay wed have sex tonight but somehow staring at ashers naked back with narcissus gazing up at him with a look somewhere between adoration and terror i just wasnt in the mood anymore the upper hallway stretched white and empty there was a silver wallpaper border high up on the wall more silver ran in thin lines down the walls an opulent yet tasteful display it looked like the hallway of some upscale hotel i didnt know if it was camouflage or if narcissus just liked it that way after downstairs black technopunk and narcissuss own marquis de sade bedroom it was almost startling as if wed stepped from some dark nightmare into a quieter more peaceful dream we were the ones who looked out of place all of us in black too much skin showing jamil paced up the stairs on point his muscular upper body showing in tantalizing glimpses through a series of black leather straps the pants fit his narrow hips like a second skin and id learned long ago from watching jeanclaude undress that you didnt get that smooth line if there was underwear between the skin and the pants he turned his waistlength cornrows flaring out around him he was a contrast in darkness the black of the leather the dark dark brown of his skin he moved like a shadow in that white hallway faust went next he was the new male vampire id met downstairs in the better light his hair was obviously tinted burgundy like a shade of red gone wrong but somehow it suited him his leather pants were covered in more zippers than seemed necessary to get them on and off and his black shirt had a zipper up the front it reminded me of ashers shirt except for the color i tried not to think too much about what asher might be doing right this moment i still didnt know if asher was pimping himself out for us or whether he truly wanted to be with narcissus i was more comfortable with the idea of selfsacrifice i brought up the middle with the two women behind me sylvie still didnt look like herself to me the black skirt was so short that whoever was in back of her couldnt help but get a flash of whatever was under the skirt the hose climbed her legs all the way up making them look long and shapely though she was only three inches taller than me she was also wearing threeinch black spikes which may have added to the illusion of long legs her leather top showed a very discreet line of flesh from neck to waist where a belt cinched in her tiny waist her breasts seemed to stay magically on either side of the line of skin as if they were held in place by something more than a bra she smiled up at me but her eyes had already bled to that pale wolfish color they didnt match the careful makeup and the short curly brown hair meng die brought up the rear where her pale flesh showed around the vinyl cat suit colorless body glitter sparkled there was a touch of glitter at the corner of each uptilted eye complementing pale eyeshadow and dramatic eyeliner she was smaller than me more delicate of bone smaller of breast more slender of waist like a dainty bird but the look she gave me was more vulture than canary she didnt like me and i didnt know why but jeanclaude had assured me shed do the job jeanclaude had a lot of faults but if he trusted meng die to keep me safe then shed do it he was never careless with me not in that way faust just seemed to be amused as hell about it all everything made him smile pleasantly most vampires went for arrogance to mask how they felt he seemed to use mild amusement of course maybe faust was just a happy guy and i was being too cynical why werent jeanclaude and richard with me because the wereleopards were mine if i took other dominants with me it would be seen as weakness i was planning to interview other alphas to take over the wereleopards but until i found someone to do that i was all they had if people began thinking i was weak the leopards would be marked as anyones meat it wouldnt just be outoftown shapeshifters that were trying to take them away from me it would be every shapeshifter in town it was funny how many shifters could be assholes unless you were strong enough to stop them i had to save the leopards not richard not jeanclaude me but i had to stay alive to do that so i did take backup im stubborn not stupid though i know a few people who might argue that each white door had a silver number on its surface again like a very discreet hotel we were looking for room nine there was absolutely no sound from behind the doors the only noises i heard were the distant thud of the music downstairs and the faint whisper of leather and vinyl our body movements id never been so aware of how loud small noises could be maybe it was the eerie silence of the hallway or maybe id gained something new from the marriage of the marks better hearing wouldnt be a bad thing would it so many of the gifts from the vampire marks tended to be doubleedged swords at best i shook off the gloomy thoughts and walked with my foursome of bodyguards down the carpeted hallway i was trusting them to give their lives for mine thats what a bodyguard does jamil had taken two shotgun blasts for me last summer it hadnt been silver shot so hed healed but he hadnt known that when he put himself between the gun barrel and me sylvie owed me one and a woman her size doesnt get to be second in the pack hierarchy without being one tough werewolf i didnt really trust the vampires to give up their undead lives for me its been my experience that the longer something semiimmortal lives the more tightly it hugs its existence so i counted on the wolves and knew i could work around the vampires it didnt matter that jeanclaude trusted them it mattered that i didnt id have preferred to just bring along more werewolves except if i showed up with nothing but wolves at my back it would be like saying that i couldnt do this without richards pack not true or not completely true wed see how deep the shit was once we opened the door room nine was nearly at the end of the long hallway the building had been a warehouse and the upstairs had simply been divided into long hallways with huge rooms scattered along them jamil was standing to one side of the door faust was standing in front of it not smart i stood to the other side of the door and said faust the werehyenas had to take guns off these guys the vampire raised an arched eyebrow at me they may not have found all the guns i said he still looked at me i sighed over a hundred years of life power enough to be a master vamp and he was still an amateur it would be bad to be standing in the center of the door when a shotgun blast went off on the other side he blinked and a little of that humor leaked away showing that arrogance that most vamps acquire i think narcissus would have found a shotgun i leaned my shoulder against the wall and smiled at him do you know what a copkiller is he raised both eyebrows at me a person who kills policemen no its a type of ammunition designed to go through body armor the cops have no defense against it you can carry armorpiercing bullets in handguns faust i used the shotgun as an example but it could be so many things and they would all take out your heart most of your spine or all of your head depending on where the shooter was aiming get out of the fucking doorway meng die said he turned and looked at her and it was not a friendly look you are not my master nor you mine she said children i said they both looked at me great faust if youre not going to be helpful then go back downstairs what did i do i glanced at meng die shrugged and said get out of the fucking doorway i could see his shoulders tighten but he gave a graceful bow at odds with the burgundy hair and leather as jeanclaudes lady wishes so shall it be he stepped to the side closest to me sylvie moved up close to me not exactly between us but close it made me feel better bossing around vampires was always chancy you never knew when theyd try to boss back i really really wanted my gun back what now jamil asked he was watching the vampires like he wasnt any happier with their company than i was all good bodyguards are paranoid it goes with the job i guess we knock i kept my body well to the side extended just enough arm to get the job done and gave three solid knocks if they shot through the door theyd probably miss me but no one shot through the door in fact nothing happened we waited for a few moments but patience has never been my best thing i started to knock again but jamil stopped me and said may i i nodded he knocked hard and loud enough to shake the door it was a solid door if the door didnt open this time they were deliberately ignoring us the door opened revealing a brownhaired man as muscled as ajax but taller what did narcissus do recruit from all the weightlifting gyms in town he frowned at us yeah im nimirra for the wereleopards i think youve been waiting for me about fucking time he said he opened the door wide pushing it flush against the wall putting his back to it arms crossed across his chest his arms apparently werent as muscular as they looked if he could cross his arms that way but he did demonstrate that there was no one hiding behind the door good to know the room was white white floor white ceiling white walls like a room carved of hard snow there were blades on the walls knives swords daggers tiny glittering blades swords the length of a tall man the bodyguard by the door said welcome to the room of swords it sounded formal like he was supposed to say it from the door i couldnt see anyone i took a deep breath let it out slowly and walked inside jamil followed a step behind at my shoulder faust was at my other side sylvie and meng die brought up the rear a figure stepped into the middle of the room at first glance i thought it was a man but on second glance not exactly he was mansized almost six feet broad shouldered muscular but what id thought was a golden tan was golden tan fur very thin and fine covering the whole body the face was almost human though the bone structure was a little odd a wide face a lipless mouth that was almost a round muzzle the eyes were a dark orange gold with an edge of blue in them as if they like the body were only partly through their change it was as if his body had frozen stopping just short of attaining human form id never seen anything like it pale skin showed in patches on his bare chest and stomach i couldnt tell if the dark gold hair and edge of beard that encircled his face was actually hair or what was left of a mane the longer i stared at him the more like a lion he looked until i couldnt see the man id thought id seen for the light coating of beast that covered him he gave a snarling smile do you like what you see ive never seen anything like you i said nice calm even empty he didnt like that my lack of reaction his smile vanished and became only a snarl of very sharp very white teeth welcome nimirra i am marco we have been waiting for you he made a sweeping gesture to either side with his clawed human hands i glanced around at the we they were small to mediumsized men with short black hair and dark skin most groups prides packs whatever were mixed ethnically but there was a sameness to these dark men almost a family look about them two on either side wore hooded cloaks with the hoods thrown back the wide cloaks spread like curtains i glimpsed blond hair behind the blackness to the left i couldnt see nathaniels hair over the blackness but i knew he had to be on the right there was blood on the white floor pooling into a little depression in the concrete a drain was in the middle so they could hose the floor down when they were finished there was another guard in the far corner who looked very unhappy to be there three women that i did not know were chained to the wall on either side of the door two blonds on the right side a brunette on the left they werent wereleopards or at least none that were mine let me see my people i said will you not greet us formally marco asked youre not the alpha anything marco you get your head lion in here and ill greet him but you i dont have to greet marco gave a small bow the gaze of those odd tawny eyes never leaving my face it was the way you bow in martial arts when youre afraid the other person will hit you if you glance away jamil had moved up beside me not ahead of me but close enough that our shoulders brushed i didnt tell him to move back hed saved my life once id let him do his job then greet me nimirra it was another male voice he stepped out from behind the cloaks to the left as he stepped out the cloaks dropped and i could see gregory clearly he was turned towards the wall nude except for his pants that had been peeled down to his lower thighs his boots still on chains held his wrists above his head his legs were wide apart his curling blond hair fell just below his shoulders his body was slender but muscled butt tight you have to take care of your body if youre going to strip professionally there was no mark on his body that i could see but blood had spattered on the floor in front of him below him pooling dark drying they hadnt cut anything on his back my stomach clenched tight my breath squeezing down in my throat gregory i said softly hes gagged said the man i finally dragged my gaze away from gregory and the sight of the other man the alpha made me stare he wasnt a lion man he was a snake man his head was wider than my shoulders covered in olive green scales with large black spots one arm was bare and it looked very human except for the scales and the hands that ended in twisted claws that would have made any predator proud he turned his head to look at me with one large copper gold eye a heavy black stripe stretched back from the corner of his eye to his temple his movements were vaguely birdlike other blackcloaked figures stepped away from the walls dropping hoods to show themselves scaled with the same stripes near metallic eyes and hands with curling claws my people fanned out around me two going to either side who are you i am coronus of the black water clan though i doubt that will mean anything to you marco mentioned you were new in town im anita blake nimirra of the blooddrinkers clan by what right do you harm my people what i wanted to do was start screaming but there are rules i couldnt be furry or scaly but i could follow the rules coronus walked to the wall and stood next to the brunette chained to it she made small panicked sounds as he reached for her sylvie moved a little closer to him to the girl as if she was waiting for an excuse coronus traced a finger down the girls cheek the barest of touches yet she closed her eyes and shivered i came here seeking swanmanes and i found three of them they had already tied up the male we thought it was their leader their swanking or we would not have harmed him by the time we found we had the wrong animal it was late in the game i glanced at the cloaks still held firmly in place the impassive faces of the men as impossible to read as if theyd already become snakes i noticed that one of the figures had breasts it was nearly naked where they showed above a scoop neck tshirt i could see the chains reaching for the ceiling and down to the floor there was more blood a lot more blood on that side let me see nathaniel would you not like to see your blond leopard up close and personal first i started to ask why i didnt like the fact that he seemed reluctant for me to see nathaniel you want me to see gregory first the man seemed to think about it head to one side the movement looked animallike yet not exactly snakelike up close and personal yes yes i do i didnt like the way he kept saying personal but i let it go then youve made a request of me coronus if i do it i can make one of you sometimes the rules are helpful rarely but sometimes what would you have of me i want him unchained he was easily taken once by my people i see no reason why not go gaze upon him touch him then we will unchain him jamil stayed at my side as i walked towards gregory my gut was tight what had they done to him i could still remember the scream over the phone a glance from jamil cleared the snake people away they stood as far away as the room would allow them to on either side i had to step over the chains on the floor and under the ones that held gregorys wrists up i came around to look in his blue eyes a black ball gag was stuffed in his mouth the string tucked under his hair so it hadnt been visible from the back his eyes were wide panicked his face was untouched and my gaze followed down the line of his body almost against my will as if i knew what id find his groin was a red ruin healing covered in dried blood theyd ripped him up if hed been human hed have been ruined i wasnt a hundred percent sure that he wasnt anyway i had to close my eyes for a second the room felt hot jamil had let out a hissing breath when he saw what theyd done to gregory and his energy burned over my skin fed by anger and horror strong emotions make shapeshifters leak all over you my voice came out in a squeezed whisper will he heal jamil had to come closer to inspect the wound he touched it reluctantly and gregory writhed in pain at the gentlest of touches i think so if they allow him to change form soon i tried to pull the gag out of gregorys mouth and couldnt it was too tight i broke the leather string that held it in place and threw it on the floor gregory took a sobbing breath and said anita i thought you werent coming his blue eyes glistened with unshed tears we were almost the same size so i could touch my forehead to his hands on either side of his face i couldnt stand to see the tears in his eyes and i couldnt afford to cry in front of the bad guys ill always come for you gregory always seeing him like this i meant it i needed to find a real wereleopard to protect them but how was i going to give them away like stray puppies to some stranger but that was a problem for another night unchain him i said jamil moved to the manacles and seemed to know just how they worked no key was needed great gregory sagged as soon as the first chain went and i caught him holding him under the arms but when the second wrist restraint opened his body fell against my leg and he screamed jamil undid the last ankle chain and i lowered gregory to the ground as gently as i could i was stroking his hair his upper body cradled in my arms across my lap when i had a sense of movement to either side jamil couldnt guard both sides at the same time the knives in my boots were trapped under gregorys body it was beautifully timed i rolled over gregorys body and felt the cloak rush over me as talons slashed where id been i went for the boot knife but never had a chance i saw the clawed hand coming for me everything slowed down like images caught in crystal so that you see every detail i seemed to have all the time in the world to draw the knife or to try and dodge the slashing talons yet a part of my brain was screaming that there was no time i threw myself back onto the floor felt the air rush over me as the snake man stumbled so sure of its target that it hadnt been prepared for me to move the rest was instinct i footswept the snake and it was suddenly on its back i got a knife in my right hand but the snake was on its feet kicking upward like it had springs in its spine i felt more than saw something large and dark leap through the air over me landing behind me my attention was diverted for a fraction of a second but that was enough the one in front darted in a movement so fast my eyes couldnt follow it i put my left arm out taking the blow as my right tried to stab forward my left arm went numb like it had been hit with a baseball bat i could have stabbed into the stomach but i caught movement out of the corner of my eye and threw myself on my side on the floor as the second claw swept over me i slashed at the legs and opened a gash even through the boots the snake screamed and limped away the second snake came for me claws outstretched i didnt have time to get off the floor or anything else i held the knife ready my left arm only partially useable and watched the thing fall on me like an iridescent nightmare a smaller black blur hit it from the side and they both crashed into the wall it was meng die the claws ripped into her pale flesh as i watched i didnt have time to see more because coronus loomed up over me blood dripping from his neck and shoulder his shirt shredded sylvie was behind him struggling with marco trying to get past him to follow coronus her lovely hands had turned into claws though the rest of her was still human the really powerful shapeshifters could do that partially change at will jamil was in the far corner fighting with two of the snake men gregory was flowing with fur changing shape helpless until he was finished i didnt have time to look at the other half of the room coronus was almost on me and i was out of time i did the only thing i could think of i upended the knife and threw it at him i didnt wait to see if it would hit i was already moving towards the nearest wall and the collection of blades i had my hand on the hilt of a sword when coronus slashed my back open i fell to my knees screaming but my right hand stayed on the sword and i jerked it from the wall brackets as i fell i turned putting my left side to him he sliced open my left shoulder but it didnt hurt like my back had either the wound was deeper or i was losing the feeling in that arm i used the seconds i had the ones he used to cut me and it didnt hurt to turn the sword in my right hand and plunge it backwards behind me without turning to see where he was it was as if i could feel him behind me as if i knew just where he stood i felt the blade bite into flesh i shoved upward coming to my feet with the force of the blow shoving the blade backwards inwards through him as hard as i could i had never done anything like that before but the movement felt like old memory and i knew it wasnt my memory it wasnt my body that remembered now to turn the sword as i turned my body to do extra damage scrambling internal organs as i drew the blade out and raised it over the kneeling figure i raised the sword onehanded this i knew how to do id been taking heads off of bodies for years the blade was on its downward stroke when he screamed enough i didnt stop or even hesitate it was jamil who launched himself into me over the mans bowed head he pinned me to the wall one hand on my wrist while i fought him anita anita i looked up at him and it was as if i was just realizing who he was or what he was doing id known but only in theory my body had been about to take the snake mans head my body relaxed in jamils grip but he didnt let me go talk to me anita im alright he gives we win you get your leopards his hand went to my hand where it still gripped the sword ease down you won i tried to keep the sword but jamil wasnt happy until i let him take it then he moved slowly away from me and i was left looking down at coronus still kneeling on the floor holding his claws against the blood that was flowing from his side he looked up at me and coughed a little blood touching his lips he licked it off you nicked a lung its not silver youll heal he laughed but it seemed to hurt him well all heal he said you better hope gregory heals i said his black eyes flicked up to me and there was something in that look that i didnt like what is it coronus what puts such unease in your eyes i went to my knees in front of him my left arm hung nearly useless at my side but it wasnt numb anymore a deep burning pain was working its way from the wounds at my shoulder and lower back i purposefully didnt look at them i could feel the blood flowing down my skin in tickling lines i kept my gaze on coronuss eyes he met my eyes for a minute while jamil loomed over us then coronuss gaze did a small slide to his right i followed his look and saw nathaniel across the wide room for the first time clearly the world swam in streams of color and i would have fallen to the floor if my right arm hadnt caught me it was partly from blood loss and shock but not all of it was from the wounds i could hear coronus speaking through the dizziness and the nausea his words were tripping over each other remember that it was the hyenas who made us stop they who decreed that nothing else was to be done until your arrival we would never have been so cruel unless we intended to kill him my vision cleared and all i could do was stare nathaniel was nude hanging from his wrists ankles chained like gregorys had been but nathaniel was facing the room knives bisected each tricep smaller blades had been forced through each hand so he couldnt close his fingers around them thin knives had been forced through the bulk of the muscles just above each of his collarbones then the swords began sword blades stuck out just below his collarbones the blades gleamed silver sprinkled with drying blood unlike the knives the swords had been shoved in from behind so you couldnt see the hilts a wide curved sword stuck out of nathaniels right side through the meat of his body there were more too big to be knives too small to be swords bisecting his thighs his calves i was on my feet and didnt even remember standing up i was walking towards him my left arm hanging down blood spilling from my fingers the thing that i hadnt expected when i saw the damage was his eyes those lilac eyes of his were open staring at me full of things that i didnt want to understand a gag filled his mouth cut across that long auburn hair he watched me with wide eyes as i walked to him i stood in front of nathaniel and tried to get the gag out of his mouth but i couldnt do it onehanded faust was there breaking the thong helping me take it out gently i touched nathaniels mouth trying to stop him from making any noise i looked down the length of his body all the blood all the blood drying stiff and tacky against his skin i couldnt not look at the blades and from inches away i saw something that couldnt be true i lowered my hand from his mouth towards the sword blade that protruded from his upper chest i touched the dried blood rubbed at it with my fingertips nathaniel made a small moan i didnt stop i had to be sure i cleared the blood enough to see enough to feel that his skin had closed around the blades in the two hours it had taken me to get to this room his body had reknit itself with the blades inside of him i dropped to my knees as if id been hit between the eyes i tried to say something but no sound came out jamil was there kneeling beside me i grabbed a handful of the leather straps across his chest there was fresh blood on him wounds in his arms and chest i finally managed to say how how do we fix this he looked up at nathaniel we pull the blades out i shook my head help me up the blood loss and the sheer horror were catching up with me i felt sick dizzy jamil helped me stand in front of nathaniel do you understand what were going to have to do nathaniel looked at me with those purple eyes of his yes he said softly almost no sound at all i gripped the knife that was in his quadricep hand wrapping around the hilt my lower lip was trembling and my eyes felt hot i stared into his eyes no flinching no looking away i took a deep breath and i pulled it out his eyes closed his head thrust backwards breath coming out in a hissing rush the flesh clung to the blade it wasnt like taking a knife out of a roast the flesh hugged the blade as if it had grown around it the bloody knife fell from my hand making a sharp sound on the cement floor nathaniel screamed jamil was behind him and one of the swords was missing from nathaniels upper chest the other sword sucked back through his body as i watched nathaniel screamed again blood welled from the wound and i turned away i looked back at coronus still crouched on the floor two of his people crowded around him something in the look on my face must have frightened him because his eyes widened and i saw something like human fear cross his reptilian face we would have taken the blades out but the hyenas ordered us not to touch either of them again until you arrived i looked across the room at the guard that was closest to nathaniel the one that had looked unhappy to be there he flinched under my gaze i was following orders is that an excuse or a defense we dont owe you an excuse the other guard said the tall brownhaired one that had let us into the room he was standing by the closed door he was arrogant defiant and i could taste his fear like candy on my tongue he was afraid of what id do gregory came to stand near me in halfleopard halfman form id never seen him like this all spotted fur taller than his human form more muscled his genitalia hung large and healed between his legs one of the snake men was on the floor dragging its legs behind it its spine was broken but it would heal another scream tore from behind me from nathaniels throat another snake man was huddled against the far wall beside the chained brunette its arm was almost torn from its socket sylvies dress was in shreds baring her breasts to the world she didnt seem to care her hands still curled into claws pale wolf eyes staring back at me take your leopards coronus said and go in peace another scream came on the end of his words peace i said i felt strangely numb like part of me was folding away i couldnt stand in this room and listen to nathaniels screams and feel not and stay sane a quietness that i sunk into when i killed spilled over me and it felt so much better there are worse things than emptiness who are the women swanmanes he said no concern of yours nimirra i looked at him and felt a smile curl my lips i knew it was an unpleasant smile what happens to them when we leave theyll heal he said we dont want them dead my smile widened i couldnt help it i laughed but it was a bad sound even to me you expect me to leave them to your mercy they are swans not leopards why should you care nathaniels voice came thick and when i turned i saw tears sliding down his face dont leave them please dont leave them here jamil pulled another blade out only three to go nathaniel didnt scream this time just closed his eyes and shivered please anita they would never have come here if i hadnt asked them i looked at the three women chained naked to the walls gagged surrounded by dozens of clean unused blades they watched me with wide eyes their breath coming in quick shallow pants their fear slid down my throat as if it were wine and i could drink it down deep and cool fear like wine goes good with food and i knew just by looking that they were food they were swans not predators they were not us i was channeling richard now i was being a smorgasbord of the boys tonight of their thoughts and feelings but there was one thing that was my own rage not the hot rage that the wolves used when they killed this was something colder and more sure of itself it was a rage that had nothing to do with blood and everything to do with death i wanted them all dead for what theyd done to nathaniel and gregory i wanted them dead by the rules i couldnt have them dead but id do what i could id cheat them of their other victims i would not could not leave the three women here like this i could not do it simple as that dont worry nathaniel we wont leave them behind you have no right to them coronus said gregory growled at him i touched gregorys furred arm its alright i looked at coronus surrounded by his snakes if i were you i wouldnt tell me what i have a right to if i were you id shut the fuck up and let us walk out of here with everyone we came for no they are ours until their swan king rescues them hey hes not here but i am and i say to you coronus of the black water clan that i will take the swanmanes with me i will not leave them behind why why do you care why partly because i just dont like you partly because i want you dead and i cant do that tonight according to lycanthrope law so ill cheat you of your prize that will have to suffice but dont ever ever get in my way again because i will kill you coronus i will kill you in fact id enjoy killing you i realized that was true i often killed cold but there was something in me tonight that wanted him dead revenge maybe i didnt question it i just let it show in my eyes i let the shapeshifter see it because i knew hed understand it he wasnt human he knew death when it looked at him he did know i saw the knowledge in his eyes tasted that fresh spurt of fear like a chemical rush he looked suddenly tired i would give them up if i could but i cannot i must have something to show for this nights activities i was hoping it would be the swans and the leopards but if i cannot have one i must have the other why do you care about either the swans or the leopards i asked they are nothing to you you cannot make them part of your tribe his eyes shut down unreadable but that flash of fear grew swelling in a rich odor of sweat and bitterness he was very afraid and it wasnt of me not exactly but of something that would happen if he didnt keep the swans but what i must keep them anita blake tell me why i cannot the fear was leaving him until that moment i never knew that resignation had a scent but i could smell the quiet bitterness of defeat on him it flared through me in a fierce wave and i knew wed won he shook his head i cannot give the swans up youve already lost them i can smell the defeat on you he bowed his head i would give them up if i could but please believe me i cannot give them to you i cannot cannot or will not i asked he smiled and it was bitter like the odor from his skin cannot even his voice held reluctance as if he wanted to just say yes but couldnt do whats best for your people coronus walk away from this i knew in some indefinable way that we would win my will to win was greater than his we would carry this night in victory some of the snakes would die because their leader had lost his nerve without his strength of will to buoy them they could not win they didnt want to be here i looked at each of them and in turn they scented the air as i stared at them defeat hung over them like smoke they had no will to win they didnt want to be here so why were they here their alpha their leader was here and his will was theirs so why were they all weak as if something was missing inside their group something that made them weak i realized with a start that this was what everyone had sensed from the leopards before i came to them this smell of weakness and defeat nathaniel was weak but now my will was his and i was not weak i turned to stare into his face his eyes and i saw through all the pain the torture that he was not hopeless when i first met him nathaniel had had the most hopeless eyes id ever seen but he knew id come hed known with an absolute certainty that i would not leave him here like this gregory could doubt because he thought with that part of him that was human but nathaniel trusted me with something that had nothing to do with logic and everything to do with truth i turned back to coronus run away from this coronus or some of you wont see dawn he sighed heavily so be it and then he did what he shouldnt have done something that had no logic to it from a nonhuman point of view he was going to lose and he knew it yet he did a very human thing he attacked us anyway only humans waste energy like that when theyve been given an out the two snakes guarding coronus suddenly launched themselves at me and i was too close id been so sure with my new werewolf senses that they wouldnt fight us id been careless id forgotten that in the end were only half animal and that human half will fuck you every time they came in a blur of speed too fast for me to do anything but start for the other boot knife i knew id never reach it gregory leaped in a buttercolored streak taking one snake out in midair rolling on the floor but the other one was on me claws slashing down before i hit the ground with it riding me i was already going numb it didnt hurt the claws ripped at my stomach diving through the cloth of my shirt to the flesh underneath i felt it digging for my heart i raised my right hand to try and grab the wrist but it felt like i was moving in slow motion my hand seemed to weigh a thousand pounds and distantly i knew i was hurt badly hurt something bad had happened in that first blur of claws gregory was suddenly there pale fur caught between the multicolored snakes he fell on top of me with one of the things on top of him ripping him up he never tried to defend himself he clawed at the one riding me tore it away from me and the three of them fought on top of me there was a moment when gregorys eyes and that snarling mouth were inches from mine we were pressed as close as lovers and i knew that the claws in me were his hed fallen against me been pushed into my flesh then other hands were pulling us all apart i had a glimpse of jamils face saw his lips move but there was no sound then blackness swirled over my vision and ate everything but a dim dim spot of light then even that vanished and there was nothing but the dark i dreamed i was running being chased through the woods at night i could hear them coming closer closer and i knew that what chased me wasnt human then i fell to the ground and i was running on four feet i chased the pale thing that fled before me the soft thing that had no claws no teeth and smelled wonderfully of fear it fell and its scream was shrill it hurt my ears and excited me my fangs sank into flesh and did not stop until they tore meat blood poured scalding hot down my throat and the dream faded i was in narcissuss bedroom on the black bed jeanclaude was tied standing between the posts at the end of the bed his chest was bare covered in claw marks blood running down his skin i crawled across the bed towards him and i wasnt afraid because all i could smell was the sweet copper scent of blood he stared at me with eyes gone solid drowning blue kiss me ma petite i rose on my knees my mouth hovering over his lips he moved towards me but i stayed out of reach of those kissable lips i moved my mouth lower until it was just above his chest and the fresh wounds that decorated his skin yes ma petite yes he sighed i pressed my mouth to his chest and drank i woke eyes staring heart thudding it was richard above me he still had the leather collar on i tried to raise my arms to hold him but my left arm was taped to a board there was an iv in my arm i looked at the darkened room and knew i wasnt in a hospital i raised my right arm to touch his face but it was heavy too heavy to lift darkness spilled over my eyes like warm water rushing in as my fingertips brushed his skin i heard his voice rest anita rest i think he kissed me gentry then there was nothing i was wading in water to my waist clear icy water i knew i had to get out of the water or id die the cold would steal me away i could see the shore dead trees and snow i ran for those distant trees struggling in the icy water then my feet went out from under me and i fell into a deep hole the water closed over my face and the shock of the cold hit me like a giant fist i couldnt move couldnt breathe the light faded through the clear shining water i began to drift down down into the cold dark water i should have been scared i wasnt i was so tired so tired pale hands reached for me coming from the light the sleeve of the white shirt billowed around his arm and i moved my hand towards him jeanclaudes hand wrapped around mine and he pulled me towards the light i was back in the dark room but my skin was wet and i was cold so cold jeanclaude was cradling me in his lap he was still wearing the vinyl outfit then i remembered the fight id been hurt jeanclaude leaned over and kissed my forehead laying his face against mine his skin was as cold as i felt like ice pressed against me the shivering was worse my body danced in small involuntary movements cold i said i know ma petite we are both cold i frowned at him because i didnt understand he was looking at someone else in the room i have brought her back but i cannot give her the warmth she needs to survive i managed to turn my head enough to look around the room richard was standing there with jamil and shangda and gregory richard came to the bed his hand touched my face it was hot against my skin it was too much and i tried to move away from his hand anita can you hear me my teeth were chattering so hard i could hardly get it out but finally i said yes youve got a high fever a very high fever they put you in a shallow ice bath to bring it down but your body reacted like a shapeshifters the low temperature while so much damage was healing almost killed you i frowned at him and finally managed to say dont understand the involuntary jerks were getting stronger strong enough that it hurt the wounds i was waking up enough to feel how very hurt i was things hurt that i didnt remember getting injured my muscles ached you need the high temperature to heal just like we do i didnt understand who the we was who and a spasm shook my body tore a scream from my mouth my body fell into convulsions and pain smashed through me if i could have breathed id have screamed more my vision began to disappear in large gray patches get the doctor richards voice you know what must be done mon ami if this works then ive lost her my vision cleared for a few seconds richard was stripping out of the tight pants it was the last thing i saw before the gray swept up over my eyes and sucked me down i thought i dreamed but i wasnt sure there were faces in the dark some of them i knew some of them i didnt cherry with her short blond hair her face free of makeup making her look years younger than either of us were gregory touching my face jamil resting beside me curled like a dark dream i drifted in and out from face to face body to body because i could feel their bodies pressed against mine naked skin against naked skin it wasnt sexual or not overtly so i woke if i woke enough to know it was richards arms wrapped around me my body fitting like a spoon against his his thick hair spilled across my eyes i slept knowing i was safe i woke slowly in a cocoon of body heat and that prickling rush of lycanthrope energy i tried to roll over and found the press of flesh kept me pinned on my side i opened my eyes the room was dark with a small light near the wall like a childs nightlight my night vision was good enough to be able to see color by it a man i didnt know was curled against the front of my body his face was pressed into my shoulder just above my breasts his breath hot against my skin normally it would have been my cue to panic and run for the hills but i just didnt feel like panicking i felt warm and safe and more right than id felt in a long time as if i were wearing a favorite pair of flannel jammies wrapped in my favorite quilt it was that kind of comfort that kind of peacefulness even the sight of the arm around my waist from behind didnt disturb me maybe dr lillian had slipped me some medicine that made everything feel okay all i know was that i didnt want to move it was like when you first wake in the morning and theres nowhere you have to be nothing you have to do and you can float in that halfawake halfasleep warmnestofblankets feeling the arm around my waist was muscled definitely masculine but small not just the hand but the whole arm the skin was tanned and looked darker than it should have against the paleness of my skin i relaxed against the warm bulk of the body where it lay spooned against mine the fact that i was okay sleeping in a threeway naked sandwich with me in the middle told me beyond a doubt that i was on some kind of drug id woken up wearing a lot more clothes and been a whole lot more embarrassed i assumed they were both werewolves it was a big pack and i didnt know everyone on sight i was bathed in their energy as if hot invisible water flowed around the three of us i remembered being hurt the claws digging under my sternum my gaze traveled down my own body and found a ragged circle of pinkish scar tissue where the snake had dug for my heart there was a dull ache but the scar was already pink and shiny flat to my skin how long had i been out i kept waiting for the panic to wash over me the embarrassment when it didnt i looked at the first man truly looking at him this time he had rich brown curls cut short in the back but long on top so the curls tickled my skin as he made a small movement in his sleep he was tanned so darkly that his skin almost matched his hair the one eyebrow i could see had a tiny ring piercing it one of his knees pinned my lower leg one hand lay limply on my bare thigh i think it was his leg being raised and a turn of his hips that saved me from seeing the whole show what little modesty i had left was grateful whatever had kept me comfortable was beginning to wear off maybe i was simply waking up the rest of his front was pressed so close to me i couldnt see any details the line of his back and buttocks was smooth flawless no tan lines nude sunbathing the body looked young early twenties if that he was taller than me who wasnt but not by much five seven maybe less he stirred the hand on my thigh flexing as if he dreamed then suddenly i knew he was awake a tension ran through his body that hadnt been there seconds before i was suddenly wide awake my heart thudding i had about two seconds to wonder what the hell you say to someone youve never met when you wake up naked in bed beside him he opened the eye i could see and moved his face enough to blink two solid brown eyes at me he gave a slow lazy smile still half asleep ive never seen you awake before i said the only thing that came to mind i dont remember seeing you at all before who are you caleb im caleb i nodded and started to sit up i was getting out of this bed the comforting warmth was still there but my embarrassment was stronger i just wasnt cool enough to keep talking to a strange naked man while i was naked too nope just not sophisticated enough for this one the arm around my waist tightened holding me against the second man and the bed calebs knee on my leg got heavier sliding farther between mine i could suddenly feel parts of his body that i couldnt see i think id have rather seen the whole show than had it pressed against my very upper thigh alright groin just not the right part to make me start hurting him not yet the hand that had been lying on my thigh was suddenly gripping it it made my pulse speed up it was too close to being trapped everybody be calm i said but i need to get up and out of this bed now the body behind me moved even though i wasnt able to see it i knew he was propped on one elbow and the arm around my waist tightened i was suddenly pressed very firmly against his body and i knew several things one he was about my height because he spooned perfectly against me two he was slender muscular and very happy to be pressed to my body eeek i turned towards him like i was looking back at a noise in the dark at a horror movie slowly halfdreading his face rose over my shoulder long hair spilling to one side of his face in a thick mass that was so sleeptousled i couldnt tell if it was waves or curls only that it was a dark rich brown darker than the first mans almost brunette his face was too triangular almost too delicate crossing that line into androgyny the nose perky a little less than perfect his mouth wide bottom lip thick and pouting it was a sensual face but it was the eyes that made the face or ruined it my first thought was that his eyes were yellow but there was a thick ring of gray green around the pupil the overall effect was a deep golden yellowgreen set in a tanned face they werent human eyes and dont ask me how i knew but they werent wolf eyes either i scrambled out from between them my left arm protested the use but it didnt hurt enough to outweigh my embarrassment it wasnt a graceful exit but at least i was standing at the foot of the bed staring down at the two men instead of sandwiched between them screw graceful i wanted some clothes dont be afraid anita we dont mean you any harm the second man said i was trying to keep an eye on them and still search the dimly lit room for clothes i didnt see any the only cloth in the room seemed to be the sheet and they were lying on that i had a horrible urge to cover myself but two hands werent going to get the job done and standing there with my hands cupped over my groin seemed somehow more embarrassing than just standing there i suddenly didnt know what to do with my hands my left arm ached in a line from my shoulder nearly to my wrist a tracery of pink flat scars down my flesh who are you my voice came out a little breathy im micah callahan his voice was calm ordinary as he lay on his side completely naked no one does comfortable nudity like a shapeshifter his shoulders were narrow everything about him slender almost feminine but muscles showed under his skin even at rest lean muscle not bulk you knew at a glance he was strong but if he were wearing clothes you might not see it there were other things you wouldnt see if he had his clothes on and although the rest of him was slender small graceful in a way that women are graceful parts of him were definitely not small not slender it seemed incongruous with the rest of him as if mother nature had tried to make up for the feminine appearance by overcompensating in other areas noticing just how overcompensated he was brought heat in a rush up my face and i glanced away tried to both keep an eye on them in case they got off the bed and not look at them at the same time its hard to look and not to look but i managed this is caleb he said caleb rolled onto his back and stretched like a big cat making sure that if i hadnt noticed already he was naked too i had noticed what looked like a tiny silver dumbbell pierced his belly button that i hadnt seen we already introduced ourselves caleb said that one innocent sentence sounding anything but innocent something in the tone he used an inflection while he rolled around on his back and waved himself at me made the words obscene i was willing to bet i wasnt going to like caleb great nice to meet you both i still couldnt figure out what to do with my hands what are you doing here sleeping with you caleb said the blush that had been almost gone flamed back to life he laughed micah didnt point for him in fact micah sat up bending a knee to cover himself which earned him even more points caleb stayed on his back flaunting himself theres a robe in the corner there micah said i glanced back where he was looking and sure enough there was a robe it was my robe a deep rich burgundy with satin edgings very masculine like a long victorian smoking jacket when i lifted it up there was a weight in one deep pocket i had to fight the urge to turn my back to slip the robe on theyd already seen the whole show it wasnt like i could express my modesty now when i had the robe belted in place i slipped my hands into the pockets and my right hand closed around my derringer or at least i assumed it was mine it was my robe the only person i knew whod think to leave a gun for me was edward and he as far as i knew was out of state but someone had thought of it and i was very glad i had clothes and a weapon life was good hi micah callahan nice to meet you but the name doesnt tell me who you are i am nimirraj for the maneater clan micah said i blinked at him trying to digest that little tidbit i wasnt embarrassed anymore surprised working on angry maybe i am nimirra of the blooddrinkers clan and i dont remember inviting you into my territory mr callahan you didnt then what the hell are you doing here without my permission the first edge of anger threaded through my voice and i was happy to hear it being angry made everything else easier to handle even talking to two naked strangers elizabeth invited me he said the anger rushed through me like a warm wind and it touched that edge of beast that id thought was richards id learned at the club however many nights ago it was that it was a permanent resident inside me now richards beast or mine it flared through my body and raised above my skin like a sheen of invisible sweat the men reacted to the power caleb sat up his gaze suddenly intent on me no teasing now micah sniffed at the air nostrils flaring his tongue running around the edge of his lips as if he could taste it against his skin strong emotions always make the power worse and i was so angry i already owed elizabeth for abandoning nathaniel at the club but now shed finally done something that i could not let slide part of me was almost relieved because things would be easier with elizabeth dead a tiny part of me was hoping not to have to kill her but i just couldnt see how to avoid it anymore it must have shown on my face because callahan said i didnt know that her pard had a nimirra when i came here she was their old alphas second it was within her rights to audition a new alpha for her pard she just forgot to mention that the pard already had a nimirra is that it i asked thats it he said really i said making sure the sarcasm was thick he stood beside the bed i managed to keep the eye contact pure but it was harder than it should have been i did not know until three nights ago when cherry knocked on elizabeths door and asked her to come help heal you that you even existed bullshit i said i swear it he said my hand closed around the derringer felt its comforting weight i had a moment to wonder what ammo it was loaded with or i hoped it was it had more stopping power my left arm gave a twinge like the muscle was trying to jump apart tension or had i permanently injured myself id worry about it later when i wasnt staring at two wereleopards that might or might not be my buddies you say you really didnt know about me before you hit town great but why are you still here when i found out that elizabeth had lied to me i came here and tried to help to make up for entering your territory without your permission all my leopards took a turn in your bed helping you heal bully for you he held his empty hands out towards me palms up a nice traditional gesture to show that you are unarmed and harmless yeah right what can i do to make this right between us anita i dont want war between our pards and i have learned that you are interviewing alphas to take your place with your leopards im a nimirraj do you know how rare that is among the wereleopards the best youre probably going to find elsewhere is a leopard lionnй a protector but not a true king you applying for the job he started walking towards me and the room wasnt that big id be honored if youd consider me for the job i tried to hold up my left hand but the arm spasmed too badly to complete the gesture but micah got the idea he stopped moving lets start by you staying over there ive had about as much up close and personal with the two of you as i can handle he just stood there hands still in that open seeimeannoharm position we caught you off guard i understand i doubted he understood but it was polite for him to pretend id never met a shapeshifter that had a problem sleeping in a big naked pile like puppies of course id never met a brandnew one yet surely there was a learning curve for this sort of comfort level my left arm was twitching badly enough that i took my right hand off the gun out of my pocket and tried to calm the involuntary movements youre hurt he said every jump of muscle sent sharp little pains through my arm getting clawed up will do that to you i can make it feel better i rolled eyes at him i bet you say that to all the girls he didnt even look embarrassed i told you i am a nimirraj i can call flesh i must have looked as blank as i felt because he explained i can heal wounds with my touch i just looked at him what would it take to convince you that im telling the truth he asked how about someone i know to vouch for you easily done he said and a second later the door opened it was another stranger the man was around six feet broad shouldered muscled well built and since he was nude i knew for a fact that every inch of him was well proportioned at least he wasnt erect that was refreshing he was pale the first of the new ones without a tan white hair with generous streaks of gray fell around his shoulders he had a gray mustache and one of those tiny vandyke beards the hair was a clue that he was over fifty probably but what i could see of him didnt look old or weak he looked more like a lifer mercenary that would cut your heart out and take it back to someone in a box for the right amount of money a ragged scar nearly bisected his chest and stomach curving in a vicious halfmoon around his belly button and sinking towards his groin the scar was white and looked old either hed gotten the injury before he became a shapeshifter or or i didnt know shapeshifters could scar but it was rare you almost had to do something wrong to the wound to get a scar that bad i dont know him i said anita blake this is merle it was only after the introductions that merles eyes flicked to me his eyes looked human some pale gray color his gaze went back to his nimirrajs face almost immediately like an obedient dog that wants to watch its masters face hi merle he nodded his head let her people in the room merle shifted and i knew instantly that he didnt want to do it some but not all he made it a question micah looked at me why not all i asked merle turned those pale eyes to me and the look in them made me want to squirm he stared at me as if he could see through to the other side and read everything in between i knew it wasnt true but it was a good stare i managed not to flinch tell her micah said too many people in too small a room i cant guarantee micahs safety in a crowd of strangers you must be his skцll i said his lips curled back in disgust i think we are not wolves we do not use their words fine to my knowledge theres no equivalent word among the leopards but youre still micahs chief bodyguard right he stared at me then gave a small nod okay do you really see my people as a threat to micah it is my job to see them as a threat he had a point fine how many are you comfortable letting into the room he blinked that harsh gaze shielded for a moment his eyes uncertain youre not going to argue about it again he made the statement into a question with the lilt of his voice why should i most alphas will argue so they dont appear weak he said i had to smile im not that insecure that made him smile yes those that hoard their power are often insecure thats been my experience i said he nodded again face thoughtful two fine do you have a preference who the two shall be i shrugged cherry and whoever else i put cherry in because she seemed to give the best afteraction reports clearheaded was our cherry if not necessarily who youd want at your back in a fight but i needed information not battle skills merle gave me a slight bow then his gaze flicked back to micah still standing by the bed micah waved him off the big man opened the door and spoke quietly cherry was the first one through the door she was tall and slender with wellformed breasts that led the eye to a very long waist a swell of hips and proof that she was indeed a natural blond wasnt anybody wearing clothes today frankly it was just nice to see another woman normally i dont mind being the only girl i do that a lot with the police but nudity always makes me relieved to see another person without a penis she smiled when she saw me relief so large in her eyes her face that it was almost embarrassing she hugged me and i let her but i pulled away first she touched my face as if she couldnt really believe her eyes how do you feel i shrugged and the small movement tightened the muscles in my left arm until i had to press it against my body to keep it from jumping around i spoke through the pain teeth gritted a little arms giving me trouble but other than that im okay cherry touched the arm running her hand lightly over the sleeve of the robe the muscles are tightening up from the rapid healing it will be alright in a few days am i not going to have the use of my left arm for a few days the spasms will come and go massage helps hot compresses may help there must have been some severe muscle damage for this much spasming did i mention that cherry was a nurse when she wasnt turning furry i can give you the use of your arm today micah said we both turned and looked at him how cherry asked i can call flesh he said again the look on her face said she knew what that meant and she was impressed and a second later she looked doubtful suspicious that was my girl though truthfully cherry had had a hard enough life before i met her that shed come with an overly active suspicion i really couldnt take credit for it i was trying to remember what calling the flesh meant when nathaniel stepped through the door the last time id seen him hed been pierced with blades his flesh grown around the steel now he was perfect not even a scar i must have looked as pleased and as astonished as i felt because he grinned at me he did a little turn so i could see that back and front he was healed i touched his upper chest where id pulled out one of the blades the skin was smooth as if id only dreamed the knife i know you guys heal almost anything but i never get over the surprise eventually youll get used to it merle said there was something in his voice that made me look at him cherrys and nathaniels smiles faded they looked suddenly serious whats wrong i asked cherry and nathaniel exchanged glances but it was micah who spoke may i fix your arm i turned to tell him to go to hell until i knew what was happening but my left arm chose that moment to curl up from fingertips to shoulder one massive painful charley horse that bent my knees only cherry catching me kept me standing my hand looked like that of a strychnine victim the fingers convulsed clawlike it felt like my arm was trying to tear itself apart from the inside out cherry was supporting almost all my weight as i tried not to scream let him fix your arm anita if he can she said the muscles in my arm relaxed by painful inches until the urge to scream was only a small voice in my head my voice came out breathy from the strain but it was clear no whimpering what is calling flesh again i was leaning so heavily on cherry that it was only politeness that kept her from picking me up in her arms she was holding all my weight micah came to stand by us merle hovered behind him like an overly anxious nursemaid i can heal damage in my pard with my body micah said i glanced up at cherry and saw nathaniel standing beside her they both nodded at the same time as if theyd heard my unasked question ive never seen a nimirraj that could call flesh but ive heard of it cherry said it is possible you dont sound like you believe him i said she gave a faint smile that left her eyes tired i dont believe in much of anyone she smiled then except you i stood still leaning on her arm but almost standing on my own i squeezed her arm with my right hand trying to put into my eyes what i was feeling ill always do my best for you cherry she smiled again and her eyes lightened a little though that edge of cynicism never quite left them i know that we all know that nathaniel said i smiled at him i said the prayer id been saying since i inherited the wereleopards dear god dont let me fail them i kept a tight grip on cherrys arm but turned to micah why is my arm the only thing thats hurting you dont hurt anywhere else he asked i started to say no then had to think about it i ache but nothing like the arm nothing else hurts like it does he nodded as if that meant something to him your body and our energy healed the lifethreatening injuries first and the smaller ones like the marks on your back i didnt think healing energy could be that selective i said it can when directed he said who directed it his eyes locked with mine i did i glanced at cherry and she nodded he is a nimirraj he was the dominant for us all him and merle i glanced at the big man do i owe you guys a thankyou merle shook his head you owe us nothing nothing micah said we were the ones who entered your territory without your permission it was our transgression not yours i looked at them both okay now what can you stand unaided i wasnt really sure so i let go of cherry in stages and found that i could stand on my own great yeah i guess i can i need to touch the injuries to heal them i know i know bare skin is best for healing among lycanthropes he gave a small frown yes it is i used my right hand to slide the robe off my left shoulder i realized that it didnt bare enough of my arm i started to wiggle my left arm out of the sleeve and another spasm hit me it was micah who caught me this time as my arm tried to tear itself off my body and my hand gripped something that i could neither see nor feel it wasnt just that it hurt it was unnerving like i had lost total control of my arm micah whispered scream theres no shame in it i just shook my head afraid to open my mouth afraid i would scream he lowered me to the floor his hands going to the robes sash the spasm relaxed in stages again leaving me gasping on the floor while he bared most of my left side once hed revealed my left arm and shoulder he pulled the robe back over me covering everything i cared about except for my left breast i appreciated the gesture since i was now lying on the ground staring up at him i also appreciated that he was no longer erect that was somehow less threatening he was on his knees tracing his fingers just above the skin of my arm except he wasnt touching my skin he was touching that otherworldly energy that spilled off of my skin his energy flowed from his hand and mingled with mine in a dance of electricity that sent goosebumps down my skin for the first time i thought to ask is this going to hurt no it shouldnt i heard masculine laughter i was looking up at all the men in the room except for one i turned my head to see caleb still sitting on the bed is there a joke im not getting ignore him merle said i looked up at their soserious eyes while calebs laughter played background music are you sure there isnt something you want to tell me about the calling of flesh micah shook his head sending the tangle of curls sliding around his face i realized that no one had turned on a light we were still moving in the twilight of the nightlight can someone turn on a light there was a flurry of eye flicks one to the other to the other like they were playing hot potato with the glance whats wrong why do you think anything is wrong micah said dont fuck with me i saw the glances why cant we turn on the lights you may be photosensitive because of the rapid healing cherry said i looked at her and could feel the suspicion on my face thats what all those looks were about i said were worried about how your body is reacting to the injuries she knelt beside me on the side opposite micah she stroked my hair like youd pet a dog to soothe it were worried about you i got that it was hard to be suspicious with her vibrating sincerity at me i finally had to smile i guess we can do without the lights until after he heals me she smiled and this time it did reach her eyes good you might want to give us some room here micah said otherwise the energy can spread cherry gave me a last touch then stood and moved back taking nathaniel with her micah stared up at merle you too merle frowned but he moved across the room with the others they all ended up by the bed with caleb strangely id come as far across the room as i could get from the bed without leaving the room totally unconscious on my part honest micah stayed kneeling but leaned back on the balls of his feet hands open on his thighs eyes closed and i felt him open himself his energy swirled over me like a thread of hot air that closed my throat made it hard to breathe he opened those alien eyes and looked at me face slack as if he were meditating or dreaming i expected him to lay hands on me but his hands stayed on his thighs he leaned his upper body towards my shoulder i put my right hand on his arm and the moment i touched him his beast curled through me it was almost as if some great invisible cat were sliding in and out of my body the way theyll entwine themselves around your legs except this cat went places that not even a lover should be touching it froze my words in my throat and from the look on micahs face i could tell he was feeling it too he looked as shellshocked as i felt but he continued to lean into me my hand stayed on his arm but it didnt stop him and i couldnt think well enough to question him his lips brushed my neck where the scars began and it brought my breath in a shaky sigh he pressed his mouth to my neck and forced that swirling living power into me it made me squirm but it didnt hurt in fact it felt so good that i pushed him backwards my voice squeezed out faint almost a whisper wait a minute whats with the mouth i thought you were going to lay hands on me i said i could heal with my body he said the power stretched between us like taffy pulled between the hot sticky fingers of children it was like if we touched we would melt into each other i dragged my hand away from him and it was like my hand was moving through something something real and almost solid my voice was steady and even i was impressed i thought that meant hands if id meant hands i would have said so he lowered his face towards me moving through the power and it felt like waves in water when someone swims towards you i grabbed a handful of those tangled curls define body for me he smiled and it was at the same time gentle condescending and somehow sad he stayed kneeling over me his face close enough to kiss my hand in his hair the power pulsing around us building into something large mouth tongue some hands but it is body my hands alone wont be enough i am told that you can heal with your body as well i took my hand out of his hair and tried to get some distance between us but he didnt move back so it didnt really work truth was i could heal with sex or something so close to it that you didnt want to do it in public sort of i said i looked across the room past micahs head and found cherry is calling flesh like what i do when i call munin munin were sort of the ancestral memories of the werewolves except that they were actually more like ghosts the spirits of the dead you could gain their knowledge their skills and their bad habits if you had the ability to channel them i was a necromancer all the dead liked me the munin that liked me best of all was raina the wolf packs old lupa id been the one who killed her to keep her from killing me and she delighted in the fact that she could take me over id gained the power to control raina when i accepted her warts and all when i called her i didnt fight her anymore wed worked out a sort of truce but calling munin for healing was almost always sexual for me because it had been sexual for raina its not sexual cherry said sensual but not sexual i trusted cherrys judgment on that okay then do it micah looked at me those strange yellowgreen eyes so terribly close do it i said he gave that wistful sad condescending smile again like he was laughing at both of us and crying for us too unnerving that smile then he lowered his mouth to my neck and the first of the scars the first kiss was gentle against my throat he breathed power against my skin and it was suddenly hard to breathe but the power hovered above my skin like cloth then the tip of his tongue slid along my skin licking a hot wet line down my neck the power followed the line of that heat sinking under my skin as he licked me but it was when his mouth pressed over my skin sealing him against me sucking me into his mouth between his teeth that i felt the power shoved into me forced into the scars he literally breathed bit ate the healing into me i made small helpless movements i couldnt help it we all have our erogenous zones in addition to the normal ones places where if were touched our bodies react whether we want them to or not my neck and shoulders are two of my spots he leaned back far enough from my neck to whisper are you alright his breath was so hot against my skin i nodded my face turned away from him he took me at my word pressing his mouth back to my neck there were no preliminaries this time he bit me hard enough that i gasped my stomach knotted twisting me onto my side pulling me away from him anita whats wrong my stomach i said he slid the robe open passing his hand over my stomach there was no wound here another wave of pain tore through my gut bending me over double to writhe on the floor the need tore through me like something alive trying to rip its way out from inside my body micah was there smoothing my hair back from my face that power that was building between us rolling through my body like a cat wading through me he bundled me into his arms his lap pressed my face against his chest get the doctor his chest was smooth warm i could hear his heartbeat feel it against my cheek i could smell blood under his skin like some exotic candy that would melt on my tongue and glide down my throat i worked my way up his body until i could see the big pulse in his neck i watched that pulse like a man dying of thirst my throat burned with the need my lips dry cracked from want of it i had to feed i knew in that instant that it wasnt my thought i stretched out that part of me that jeanclaude claimed and found him found him sitting in a windowless cell he looked up as if he could see me standing in front of him he whispered ma petite and i knew where he was i didnt know why but i knew where he was in the st louis city jail in the rooms reserved for things that cannot stand the light of day i stared into his eyes and watched them fill with blue fire until they cast their own light in the dim cell he reached out towards me as if we could touch and it was micahs power micahs beast rolling through my body that tore me away from jeanclaude i opened my eyes to find my arms around micah my face pressed to his shoulder my mouth very close to the long warmth of his neck there was movement in the room and i knew distantly that someone had run to get a doctor but what i needed a doctor couldnt give me micahs skin smelled clean young it was like i could tell just by scent how old he was the blood was like icing spread just under the tenderness of his flesh and the part of me that thought of micah as meat wasnt jeanclaude it was richard i didnt know how to put the need into words micah turned his face looked into my eyes and i felt something inside me open some door that i hadnt even known existed swung wide a wind blew through the door a wind made of darkness and the stillness of the grave a wind that held an edge of electric warmth like the rub of fur across bare skin a wind that tasted of both my men but i was the center the thing that could hold both of them inside and not break life and death lust and love what are you micah asked his voice a surprised whisper id always thought that vampires took their victims stole their will with their eyes and took them like magical rape but in that instant i knew it was more complex than that and more simple i saw with jeanclaudes eyes his power i stared into micahs face from inches away and i saw felt his own need lust was there a horribly unsatisfied lust and i knew it had been a long time for micah but underneath that was a greater need a need for power and the shelter that power could provide it was like i could smell his needs roll them on my tongue i stared into his yellowgreen eyes in that sohuman face and jeanclaude gave me the keys to micahs soul i am power nimirraj enough power to warm you on the coldest of nights power flowed off his skin like a scalding wind that hot wind mingled with the power inside me twisting together until it drove like a knife deep inside me it tore a gasp from my throat and micah echoed it the power turned into something gentler something that caressed instead of stabbed something that you would wait your whole life to have i saw the sensation flow over micahs face knew that he felt it too a wind stirred the edge of his hair and the wind was moving between us like the point where cold and heat meet and form something larger than either can form alone something huge and whirling a wind so strong it can level houses and drive straw through telephone poles his arms tightened around me i am nimirraj mind games dont work on me i got to my knees still in the circle of his arms and pressed my body down the front of his we were almost exactly the same height the eye contact was terribly intimate the power pressed around us like a giant hand squeezing us together his body responded and he was large again so hard pressed to my groin and stomach this was my cue to be embarrassed to panic but i didnt i knew that jeanclaude fed off of lust as well as blood but id never really understood what that meant until that moment when micahs flesh touched mine it wasnt just the naked press of him hard and firm against my body that made me shudder against him it was the need in his body i felt his hunger quiver through his flesh as if i could read parts of him that were too primitive for words needs that had nothing to do with language and everything to do with naked flesh he closed his eyes and a soft moan escaped him what i offer isnt illusion nimirraj its real he shook his head sex isnt enough im not offering sex not now even as i said it i pressed my body against his his entire body shuddered against me and a sound very like a whimper crawled out of his throat im offering a taste of power nimirraj a small taste of all i can offer you in my head i knew it was a lie but in my heart i knew it was true i could offer him power and flesh the two things he wanted needed above all else it was perfect bait and it was wrong i started to back down to try and cram the power down but jeanclaude fought me he thrust his power into me like an echo of his body riding me it was too late for me to feed as humans feed and give him back his strength hed avoided me for nights because i was weak i had grown strong again and he had grown weak and we had enemies in town we could not afford weakness all this i knew in a heartbeat his mind to mine and it was that seed of doubt could we afford to be weak that made me unable to shut him out what do you want in return micah asked it in a whisper that held an edge of desperation as if we both knew that whatever i asked he would do it i want to drink the warm rush of your body to have you fill my mouth with that hot liquid that beats just below here and i rubbed my lips across his neck the scent of blood so near the surface made my stomach twist but we were close so close mustnt rush it mustnt scare him we were like fishermen we had our net all we needed was for the fish to stop fighting us and lay still my lips hovered over his neck as he spoke show me you have enough power to make it worth my while and ill give you any body fluid you want i swept his hair to one side and it slid back i balled my hand into a fist of his curls to keep it out of the way and even that movement brought a sound from his throat i bared the long smooth line of his neck he moved his head to one side as if he knew what i wanted now i could see the big pulse in his neck beating against his skin like something small and separate from him something alive that i had to make free i licked my tongue across that throbbing skin i meant to be gentle i meant many things but his skin was slick and flawless against my mouth the smell of him intoxicated me like the sweetest perfume his pulse throbbed against my mouth and i sank my teeth around that frantic movement i ate at his skin dug my teeth into the flesh underneath and into his power his beast i felt my beast rise through my body like some great shape rising from the ocean depths a leviathan that grew and grew swelling up inside me until my skin couldnt hold it then it touched his beast and it stopped hovering in black water hovering in my body like some huge thing the two powers floated in that dark water brushing huge sleek sides down the length of their bodies our bodies it was a sensation like velvet rubbing inside me except this velvet had muscles flesh and was hard even where it was soft the imagery that kept flowing through my mind was of some great cat rubbing itself inside me rolling through me but bigger than that id seen richards beast move through his eyes like some great shape halfseen in water and it felt that large that overwhelming i drank micahs power down but not just through my mouth and down my throat everywhere i touched him i fed i could feel his heart beating against my naked breasts i could feel the blood rushing through his body feel every inch of him pressed against me feel his need his desire and i ate at him i fed at his neck as if his pulse were the center of some filled cake as if once i gnawed away the flesh i would have something unutterably sweet i drew blood and with the first touch of sweet metallic flavor in my mouth all pretense all prettiness was wiped away drowned in the scent of fresh blood the taste of torn flesh the feel of meat and blood in my mouth the feel of his hands pressing my body against his my legs wrapped around his waist riding him i was aware like some distant call that he wasnt inside me that he was still pressed between our bodies so hard so ready that he quivered against my stomach his breath came fast and faster someone was making small animal noises and it was me micahs fingernails dug into my body an instant before he poured over me in a scalding wave noises too primitive for words and not loud enough for screams coming from his mouth i felt jeanclaude down that long metaphysical cord that bonded us together i felt him grow quiet and well fed sated i drew my mouth away from micahs torn throat putting my cheek against his bare shoulder my legs and arms still wrapped around him his arms still holding me tight i was covered in fluid my breasts thick with it it ran down my body in heavy liquid lines curling over my stomach tracing down to my thighs he knelt there supporting both our weights while our breathing quieted and the massive pulse of our bodies subsided into silence and in that silence there was nothing but the feel of his flesh the raw scent of sex and in the distance the satisfaction of the vampire the shower was one of those group ones like youd find in a health club but i was the only one in it id cleaned off scrubbed myself thoroughly but i felt like lady macbeth screaming out out damned spot like id never really be clean again i sat on the tiles under the hot beating water hugging my knees i hadnt planned on crying but i was slow tears that felt cool compared to the water pounding my body i wasnt sure why i was crying my mind was blank usually when i try to be blank i cant but just then there was nothing but the water the heat the smooth tiles and the little voice in my head that kept running round and round like a hamster on a wheel i couldnt hear what the voice was saying i think i didnt want to all i knew was that it was screaming a noise behind me made me turn it was cherry still naked none of the leopards ever dressed unless i made them i turned my head away from her i didnt want her to see me cry i was her nimirra her rock rocks did not cry i knew she was standing over me could feel it even before the waters rhythm changed she knelt over me the water sluicing around her leaving me shivering in the sudden touch of the cool waterless air i kept my face turned away from her she touched my watersoaked hair when i didnt protest she hugged me arms going slowly around me as if she expected me to complain i stayed stiff in her arms with her body wrapped around me she just held me head pressed to the top of mine her body sheltering me from the water leaving me colder even as her body stretched like heat against my wet skin i leaned into her by painful inches until finally i let her hold me i cried and cherry held me the crying never grew or got loud it remained slow tears while cherry held me and i let her finally there were no more tears just the sound of the water the heat the feel of cherrys body around mine there was comfort in the touch of flesh that went beyond sex i pulled away and she drew back i stood and turned the water off the silence was sudden and complete i could feel the press of the night outside even without a window i knew it was the wee hours of morning maybe two or even three it would be dawn in a few short hours i needed to know why jeanclaude was in jail everything else could wait we had enemies in town and i needed to know who they were what they wanted after that id think about what had just happened but not yet not yet avoidance is one of my best things cherry handed me a towel and kept one for herself i wound the towel around my hair and retrieved a second towel for my body we dried off in silence no eye contact it wasnt shower protocol girls arent as hung up about that as guys i just didnt want to talk about what had happened not yet i wrapped the oversized towel securely around my body and asked why is jeanclaude in jail for murdering you she said i stared at her for a few seconds and when i could talk i said pass that by me again slowly someone got pictures of jeanclaude carrying you out of the club you were covered in blood anita he was covered in your blood she shrugged drying off a spot shed missed on one long leg but im alive i said it sounded almost silly saying it and how would you explain that in less than a week you were healed of wounds that should have killed you she straightened slinging the towel over one shoulder not bothering to cover even an inch of her body i dont want him in jail for something he didnt do i said if you go tonight the police will want to know how you healed yourself what are you going to tell them her eyes were very direct so direct it made me want to squirm youre treating me like a lycanthrope who hasnt come out of the closet yet im not a shapeshifter cherry she dropped her gaze then wouldnt meet my eyes it reminded me of the looks theyd all given each other in the room where i woke up i touched her chin having to reach up to do it what arent you guys telling me a mans voice came from outside the showers can i please come in and clean off it was micah id planned on running for the hills the next time i saw him but there was something in cherrys eyes that kept me frozen she was scared and there was something else something i couldnt quite read i yelled back just a minute then i continued cherry tell me whatever it is just tell me she shook her head she was afraid but of what are you afraid of me i couldnt keep the surprise out of my voice she nodded looking down again avoiding my gaze i would never hurt you any of you for this you might she whispered i grabbed her arm cherry damn it talk to me she opened her mouth closed it and turned towards the door a second before micah callahan walked through as if shed heard him before i had he was still naked i expected to be embarrassed but i wasnt i was beginning to have the proverbial bad feeling about whatever it was that cherry didnt want to tell me micah had combed his hair it was definitely curls not waves the curls were tight but not small the color was that shade of dark dark brown almost black that comes to people who start out white blond as children then darken the curls fell to just below his shoulders and following the line of hair my eyes found his chest i quickly moved them up so i could concentrate on his face eye contact that was the ticket i was getting back to the embarrassment i told you wed be out in a minute my voice sounded grumpy and i was glad the fact that i was sort of clutching the towel to my body was purely coincidental i heard you he said his face voice were neutral not as neutral as a vampires can become they are the champs of blank expression but micah was trying then wait outside until were finished i said cherry is afraid of you he said i frowned at him then at her why for gods sake cherry looked at him and he gave a small nod she moved away from me towards the door she didnt leave the room but she got as far away from me as she could what in hell is going on i asked micah was standing about four feet away close but not too close i could see his eyes better now and they were so not human i knew at a glance that they didnt belong in his face shes afraid youll kill the messenger he said voice soft look all this tap dancing is getting old just tell me he nodded winced as if it hurt the doctors seem to think that youve been infected with lycanthropy i shook my head serpentine lycanthropy isnt really lycanthropy its not a disease that i can catch you either are cursed by a witch into snake form or its inherited like a swanmane that made me think of the three women id last seen chained to a wall in the room of swords by the way what happened to the swanmanes in the club micah frowned i dont know what youre talking about without warning nathaniel entered the shower i was beginning to feel positively overdressed in my towel we rescued them the snake leader changed his mind after i got hurt he changed it after sylvie and jamil nearly killed him ah so theyre okay i said he nodded but his face stayed serious his eyes gentle like someone whos about to tell you really bad news dont you start too i cannot catch serpentine shit it doesnt work that way gregory isnt into serpentine shit he said the voice as gentle as his eyes i blinked at him what are you talking about nathaniel started to come farther into the room but cherry caught his arm kept him near the door for a quick getaway i think zane appeared in the doorway behind them he was still the sixfeet pale overly thin but muscular guy id met when he was trashing a hospital emergency room but hed dyed his hair to an iridescent pale green cut short spiked the fact that he was fully dressed actually looked odd to me of course it was zanes version of street clothes that ran to leather no shirt and vests i looked at the three of them in the doorway they were so solemn i remembered gregory falling into me during the fight his claws piercing me ive been cut up a lot worse by a wereleopard and i didnt catch it i said dr lillian thinks it may be because the wound was a deep piercing wound instead of a surface cut cherry said in a voice that was almost shaky she was scared scared of how id take the news or scared of something else but what i am not going to be nimirra for real guys i cant catch lycanthropy if i could ive already been cut up enough id have turned furry already the three of them just looked at me with wide eyes i turned from them to micah his face was still neutral careful but there was a shadow in his eyes of pity pity i did not do pity not as the object of it anyway youre serious i said youre exhibiting all the secondary symptoms he said rapid healing to the point that your muscles cramp a temperature hot enough to boil the brain of a human yet when they lowered your temperature you nearly died you needed to bake in the warmth the heat of your pard to heal thats how we healed you it wouldnt have worked if you werent one of us i shook my head i dont believe you thats okay he said youve got two weeks until the full moon you wont change for the first time until then youve got time time for what i asked time to mourn he said i turned away from the compassion in his eyes the pity shit i still didnt believe it how about a blood test that should prove it one way or the other cherry answered wolf lycanthropy shows up in the bloodstream anywhere from twentyfour to fortyeight hours sometimes seventytwo leopard lycanthropy most of the big cat lycanthropies take anywhere from seventytwo hours to over eight days to show up in the bloodstream a blood test wont prove anything yet i stared at them trying to wrap my mind around it and it just wouldnt wrap i shook my head i cant deal with this right now youre going to have to deal with it micah said i shook my head tonight i have to get jeanclaude out of jail i have to show the police he didnt murder me your pard told me that you wouldnt want to be outted that you wouldnt want your police friends to know i am not a wereleopard i said it sounded stubborn even to me micah smiled gently and that pissed me off dont look at me like that like what he asked like a poor little deluded girl there are things you dont understand about me about where my power comes from you mean the vampire marks he said i looked past him to the three wereleopards in the doorway something on my face made them all flinch so nice to know that were just one big happy family with no secrets i was in on the discussions with the doctors on whether your rapid healing could be merely a side effect of the vampire marks he said of course it is i said but the first thread of doubt was worming its way through my stomach if it will make you feel better he said i stared into that compassionate face and felt anger wash over me in a line of heat and with the anger came that trembling energy richards beast or mine i let myself think the thought all the way through for the first time was it my beast that id felt with micah was that why i hadnt gotten a sense of where richard was and what he was doing id thought of him several times during all the hoopla but had never felt the mark between us open completely id assumed it was richards energy because it was lycanthrope energy but what if it hadnt been what if it had been mine someone touched my arm and i jumped it was micah his fingers barely touching my arm you look pale do you need to sit down i took a step back and nearly stumbled he had to grab my arm to keep me from falling on the slick wet tile i wanted to jerk away from him but i was dizzy as if the world wasnt quite solid he eased me to the floor put your head between your knees i sat indian fashion on the floor the wall to my back my head bent over my folded legs while i waited for the lightheadedness to pass i never fainted not just from shock occasionally from blood loss but never from shock when i could think again i raised up slowly micah was kneeling beside me all attentive and compassionate and i hated him i laid my towelwrapped head back against the wall closed my eyes where are elizabeth and gregory elizabeth wouldnt come to help micah said i opened my eyes at that turning just my head to meet his eyes she give a reason for that she hates you he said simply yeah she loved gabriel their old alpha and i killed him hard to be friends after that thats not why she hates you he said i searched his face what do you mean she hates that youre a better alpha as a human than she is as a wereleopard you make her feel weak she is weak i said he smiled and it had humor in it this time yes she is wheres gregory are you going to punish him for contaminating you micah asked i glanced back at the other three waiting in the door silent i realized suddenly what the group dynamics meant they were treating micah as their nimirraj letting him deal with me like calling in the husband when the wife had one too many drinks i didnt like that much but if i concentrated just on the moment the question at hand no speculation no looking for the future maybe id survive if gregory hadnt interfered id be dead right now they would have clawed out my heart it was an accident that he fell into me during the fight i was watching micahs face but i felt the relief sweep through the others felt it from yards away i glanced up at them and it showed in the lines of their bodies so where is he wheres gregory the three of them did that hotpotato eyeflick game again did he refuse to come help save me like elizabeth no of course not cherry said but she didnt explain didnt add to it i looked at nathaniel he met my gaze no flinching but i didnt like what i saw in his eyes there was more bad news to come you could smell it in the air i turned to micah fine you tell me when your ulfric found out that gregory had made you their nimirra in truth he micah spread his hands he freaked zane said it i glanced at all of them what do you mean he freaked he took gregory cherry said what do you mean he took gregory he treated gregory as an enemy of the pack micah said i looked at him go on if you had been their lupa in truth if someone injured you it is within the ulfrics rights to declare them an enemy of the pack a criminal i kept staring into those yellow green eyes what exactly does that mean it means that the wolves have your leopard and they will pass judgment on him for injuring you no way i mean even if i am turning into a wereleopard which im not it doesnt hurt me i mean im just going to be a shapeshifter like them now not like them micah said like us i tried to read his face but i just didnt know him well enough yet you have a point make it you cant be the wolves lupa and the leopards nimirra ive been both for a long time we shook his head and again he winced as if his neck hurt no you were a human dating the ulfric who declared you lupa you were a human that was taking care of the wereleopards until you could find a true alpha leopard to take over the job now youre truly nimirra and the pack wont accept you as one of them are you saying richard dumped me because im going to be a wereleopard no im saying that the pack wont accept you as his lupa micah glanced down then up i could see him trying to put his thoughts into words my understanding of whats been happening with your local wolves is that ulfric has taken them from a monarchy where his word was law to a democracy where the majority rules he gets a decisive vote but not the last word i nodded it sounded like what richard had wanted for the pack it sounds like something hed do ive sort of been out of touch for the last few months he has succeeded too well the vote went against him against you the pack will not accept you as lupa when youre wereleopard and not werewolf i looked past him at the others is that true they all nodded im so sorry anita cherry said i shook my head trying to concentrate and not succeeding alright fine fine richard cant make me lupa i never wanted to be lupa just his girlfriend fuck the wolves but what have they done with gregory richard went apeshit when he found out what gregory had done zane said he thought gregory had done it on purpose because we were all afraid to lose you as our nimirra he accused gregory of doing it on purpose i asked zane nodded oh yeah then they took him they who tamil sylvie others he wouldnt meet my eyes didnt anyone try and argue with him about this sylvie tried to tell him it wasnt right that you wouldnt like it he hit her told her never to argue with him again that he was ulfric not her shit do not blame your leopards for not fighting the wolves micah said they are sorely outnumbered theyd get their asses kicked i know that besides its my job to deal with richard not theirs because you are their nimirra he said because i am his girlfriend sort of of course he said i waved a hand at him look i cant deal with all of this right now so im just going to concentrate on the important stuff i mean the immediately important stuff where is gregory and how do i get him back micah smiled very practical i looked at him and felt my eyes go cold you have no idea how practical i can be his eyes did change but it wasnt fear in them it was more interest like my reaction intrigued him the situation is complex because you are the lupa that was injured in effect you must persuade yourself that gregory meant no harm thats too easy i said i know he meant no harm so why do i get the feeling that i cant just call richard up and say hey im coming to get gregory because you must convince not just richard but the entire pack that you have the right to gregory what do you mean right to gregory hes my leopard hes mine not theirs micah smiled lowering long lashes over his eyes as if he didnt want me to read his expression at that moment the ulfric declared gregory rogue for in effect killing their lupa im alive what micah held up a finger and i let him finish you are dead to the pack as their lupa in effect being a leopard makes you dead to them you may share richards bed again but you will never be their lupa again they voted on it and richard has destroyed his own power structure to the point where he cant force a vote on them youre saying that he is ulfric but he doesnt really rule them i said micah seemed to think about that for a second or two then started to nod stopped in midmotion yes in fact very well put thanks a thought came to me and i gripped his arm they arent going to kill gregory are they something passed over his face that tightened my grip on his arm they havent killed him no micah said i let go of his arm and leaned back against the wall what are they doing to him or what are they planning to do to him the penalty for killing the lupa is death in any pack but the circumstances are strange enough that i think you will be allowed a chance to win him back win him back how i asked for that youll need to ask the ulfric ill do that i looked past him someone get my cell phone out of my jeep nathaniel went for the door without another word what are you going to do micah asked im going to make sure that gregory isnt being hurt if hes okay for tonight ill go get jeanclaude out of jail if gregory is in danger then i get him out first priorities he said softly damn straight he smiled again i am very impressed youve had several shocks in a very short space of time yet you are clearheaded and moving forward to solve the problems one at a time i can only solve one problem at a time i said most people let themselves be distracted im not most people he gave that small smile again shielding his eyes with his long lashes ive noticed something about the way he said it made me suddenly aware that he was nude and i was wearing nothing but a towel it was time to get on my feet and get dressed i stood pushing away his offer of help im fine micah thanks anyway i looked past him at cherry and zane still standing in the doorway do i have any clothes here cherry nodded nathaniel brought your stuff from home ill go get it she moved through the door weapons too i called after her she poked her head back around the doorway i know that left just zane standing in the doorway do you have a job for me not right now he flashed me a smile wide enough to show that he had dainty fangs upper and lower kittycat fangs zane had spent a little too much time in animal form to come all the way back ill go help cherry then he paused at the doorway im really glad you didnt die me too he grinned and left that left me alone with micah i looked into his yellowgreen eyes and knew that they were also a sign that hed spent too much time in animal form we hadnt kissed so i didnt know if he had dainty fangs like zane i hoped not and wasnt sure why i cared do you mind if i start cleaning up he asked i shook my head help yourself im going to go look for my clothes but nathaniel came around the door with my cell phone i looked at the slim black phone id only had it a few months id tried not to buy one if you had a cell phone and a beeper you were never truly free of the office of course i was on vacation though so far it hadnt been all that relaxing i popped the phone open and dialed richards number from memory there was no answer just his machine i left a message then knew what i was going to do i had to know what was happening with gregory i thought about richard the feel of his arms the scent of his neck the brush of his hair and that prickling rush of energy rolled over my skin i reached down the mark that bound me to richard and found him standing on a podium he was arguing with someone but i couldnt see who i never got as clear a visual through richard as i did through jeanclaude richard turned as if he could see me standing behind him then he thrust me out throwing up a shield so solid i couldnt feel him on the other side nathaniel was holding my arm steadying me are you alright i nodded being thrust out like that was always disorienting richard knew that fuck im okay i pulled away from nathaniel and had to call information for the number for the lunatic cafe richard was in the meeting room in the back of the restaurant raina had owned the restaurant and according to pack law it could have belonged to me if i hadnt used a gun to kill her it had to be manoamano handtohand or claws or at least a knife before all that was hers would be mine possessions anyway you cant get anyones power by killing them it just doesnt work that way and anyway who would want it to guns were considered cheating so i didnt inherit all of rainas stuff richard picked up on the second ring as if hed been expecting the call richard its anita i know his voice was angry closed and tight we need to talk im in the middle of something here anita fine if he wanted to play it brusque and hostile id play wheres gregory i cant tell you that why because you might try and rescue him and youre not lupa anymore the pack would defend itself and i dont want you shooting holes in my wolves you leave my leopards alone and ill leave your wolves alone anita its not that simple i got the explanation richard you freaked when you found out gregory may have infected me with leopard juice you had your enforcers grab him and youve charged him with killing your lupa which is just stupid im not dead do you know what the pack is voting on right now right this minute not a clue whether i will be picking another lupa from the pack before the next full moon i guess youll need one i said and even hearing myself acknowledge it made my stomach clench a lover anita theyre wanting to force me to pick a lover from the pack you mean we cant date now thats the vote stephen one of your wolves and vivian one of my leopards are living together no one seems to care about that stephen is one of the least of us they wouldnt tolerate crossspecies dating for a dominant and they certainly wont tolerate it for their ulfric human is good enough to fuck but not leopard i said we are human anita but we arent cats were wolves so you wont be dating me or anything now not if i want to stay ulfric what happens to the triumvirate i dont know youre going to give me up just like that i was suddenly cold my stomach like a hard frozen knot youve been out of my life for over half a year how do i know that something else wont scare you off again i planned on dating you both richard on being with you both i realized as soon as i said it that i meant it id made a decision and hadnt realized it what about a week from now or a month or even a year what will scare you off next time i dont plan on running anymore richard nice to know i could feel his anger like something hot and touchable over the phone either his shield was leaking or hed lowered it you dont want to be with me anymore my voice was soft hurt and i hated it hated it i want to be with you you know that you drive me crazy but i still want you but youll still give me up i said my voice was a little stronger but not much richard was dumping me fine it was his prerogative i was a pain in the ass i knew that but my chest ached with it damn it i dont want to anita but ill do what i have to do you taught me that my eyes were hot id taught him that great if we were really going to break up for good then i would not cry or beg i would not be weak my voice came out more solid more sure of itself my stomach was still in cold knots but it didnt show in my voice the effort that it took to just sound normal over the phone made my chest tight youre ulfric wolf king your word is law in the pack ive worked hard to make sure that everyone has an equal voice anita i cant pull rank now it would undo everything ive tried to change ideals are great in theory richard but they dont work too well in real life i disagree he said his anger was already leaking away he just sounded tired im not going to argue things weve been arguing since we met im going to concentrate on the things i can change and no matter how much we want to we cant change each other richard we are what we are my voice was uncertain again full of some of the emotion i was feeling so is gregory okay hes okay i want him back you know that i know that his anger was making a comeback now that im not lupa not pack how do i get him back you have to come to the lupanar tomorrow night and petition for him what do you mean petition for him you have to prove yourself worthy therell be some kind of test like multiple choice essay what i dont know yet were voting on it fuck richard theres a reason why we have a representative democracy in this country not a pure one pure one person one vote just doesnt work well you cant decide anything that way theyre deciding anita youre just not liking the way its going how could you take gregory how could you do that as soon as i realized what had happened i knew that the pack would vote you out most of them werent happy with you even before you werent pack and they didnt like that the fact that youve avoided them all of them for six months didnt help i had to get my shit together before i could come back richard and while you were getting your shit together mine was falling apart im sorry richard i am but i didnt know tomorrow night at the lupanar about an hour after dark you can bring all your wereleopards and any other shapeshifters that are your allies if it were me as ulfric id bring the wererats im not lupa anymore so they arent my allies are they no he said and the anger was gone again richard never could hold a grudge for long what happens if i dont win gregory back he didnt answer me just the sound of his breathing on the phone richard what happens to gregory hell be judged by the pack and if hes convicted of killing our lupa its a death sentence but im right here richard im not dead you cant kill gregory for killing me when he didnt do it i delayed the judgment until you were well enough to attend it was the best i could do you know richard sometimes its good to be king a king gets to pardon whomever he wants a king gets to fuck whomever he wants i know that then be king richard really be king be their ulfric not their president im doing what i think best for them all richard you cant do this its already done richard if i fail your little test i will not let you execute gregory do you understand me you wont be allowed to bring guns into the lupanar just knives his voice had gone very careful i remember the rule but richard are you listening to me are you understanding me if we try to execute gregory tomorrow night youll fight us i understand but understand this anita your leopards are no match for us not even with micah and his pard we outnumber you five to one maybe more it doesnt matter richard i cant stand by and watch gregory die not for something stupid like this will you try to save one of your cats and risk losing them all do you really want to see what would happen if they tried to fight their way out of the lupanar through the pack i wouldnt want to see it this is damn it richard dont put me in a corner you wont like it is that a threat richard i had to stop in midsentence and count slowly under my breath but counting to ten wasnt going to do it maybe a bijillion richard my voice came out calmer i will save gregory whatever it takes i will not let the wolves slaughter my leopards whatever that takes you lost your temper and took one of my leopards you made your pack a freaking democracy where you dont even have presidential veto are you really going to compound the mistakes by starting a war between your pack and my pard i still think that everyone having a voice is a good idea its a great idea but its not working is it he was quiet again richard dont do this its out of my hands im sorry anita you dont know how sorry richard you wont really let them execute gregory i mean not really silence again richard talk to me ill do what i can but ive lost the vote on it i cant change that can you really stand by and watch him die for something he didnt do how do you know he didnt infect you on purpose i was there he fell on top of me with two of the snake things riding him it was an accident he kept them from cutting out my heart he saved my life richard and this is damn poor payment he couldnt have turned his claws aside at the last minute richard asked no it all happened too fast he laughed but it was bitter youve been around us so long and you still dont understand what we are i could turn aside in less than a blink of an eye gregory isnt slower than i am as a leopard hes quicker more agile are you saying he did this on purpose im saying that he had a fraction of a second to decide what hed do and he decided to keep you as their nimirra he made the choice to take you from me and youre going to make him pay for that is that it yeah thats it with his life he sighed i dont want him dead anita but when i first found out what hed done i wanted to kill him myself i wanted it so badly i didnt trust myself around him so i had him taken somewhere safe until i could cool down but jacob got wind of it and forced a vote whos jacob my new geri third in charge behind sylvie ive never heard of him before hes new damn third in line and hes new hes either a very good fighter or a very vicious one to win that many fights in less than half a year hes good and hes vicious is he ambitious i asked why if jacob hadnt forced a vote would you have given gregory back to me he remained quiet so long that i finally asked you still there im here yes i would have given him back to you i cant kill him for what hes done so jacob set in motion something thats stripped you of a powerful ally me and forced you to declare war on another group the wereleopards hes been a busy boy hes just doing what he thinks is right jesus richard how can you still be this naive you think he wants my job you know he wants your job i can hear it in your voice if im not strong enough to hold the pack then its jacobs prerogative to challenge me but hes got to defeat sylvie first and shes as good as he is and as vicious how big is jacob my size not as muscled sylvie is good but shes five six and slender and a woman and as much as i hate to say it that makes a difference pound for pound you guys have the upper body strength on us if the skill is equal a larger person will beat a smaller one dont underestimate sylvie he said dont overestimate her either shes my friend too and i dont want her dead just because youre not willing to take care of business whats that supposed to mean it means until he defeats sylvie and becomes freki your second in command you can kill him outside of a challenge you can have him executed and if marcus had thought that about me id be dead now and marcus would be alive richard youre not helping your case we arent animals anita were people and i cant just kill him because i think hes after my job you dont just stand down as ulfric richard you fight to the death for it i know theoretically if you both agree it doesnt have to be death but ive been asking around and no werewolf ive talked to can remember a fight for ulfric that wasnt to the death hes not after your job richard hes after your life i cant control what jacob does only what i do i was beginning to remember why richard and i didnt make a go of it as a couple oh there had been a lot of reasons id seen him eat marcus and that had made me run away then we got back together and the marks were overwhelming but there were other reasons reasons that made me feel tired and older than richard even though he was actually two years older than me youre being stupid richard its not really any of your business anita youre not my lupa anymore if you die the marks may drag jeanclaude and me down to die with you so that sort of makes it my business and you dont risk your life every time you go hunting vampires or preternatural creatures with the police you almost died in new mexico less than a month ago you risked all of us i was trying to save peoples lives richard youre trying to remake a political system ideology is great in a classroom or a debate but its flesh and blood that counts richard its life and death were talking about here not some outdated ideal you have in your head about what a better world you can make for the pack if ideals mean nothing anita then we are just animals richard if gregory dies for this then i will kill jacob and anyone else who gets in my way ill destroy your lupanar and salt the ground so help me you explain to jacob and anyone else that needs convincing that if they fuck with me they will die you cant fight the entire pack anita not and win if you think the only thing i care about is winning then you dont know me at all i will save gregory because i said i would if you fail the tests you cant save him what sort of tests are we talking about ones that only a shapeshifter could pass richard richard i wanted to scream and rant at him but i was suddenly more tired than angry more discouraged than enraged mark me on this richard if i fail to save gregory then i will remake heaven into hell to avenge him you explain that to jacob make sure he understands tell him yourself there was silence and the sound of movement then a mans voice came on a voice that id never heard before the voice was pleasant young but not too young hello im jacob ive heard a lot about you his voice made it plain that he hadnt liked what hed heard look jacob we dont know each other but i cannot allow you to kill gregory for something he didnt do the only way you can stop us is by winning him back richard explained that id have to pass a test to get gregory back he also said if i failed that youd execute gregory its pack law jacob you dont want to make me your enemy you are nimirra of a small leopard pard we are the thronnos rokke clan we are the lukoi and you are nothing to us yeah im coming tomorrow night as nimirra of the blooddrinkers pard but im anita blake ask the vampires and other shapeshifters around town about me see what they say you dont want to fuck with me jacob you really dont ive already asked around i know your reputation then why are you pushing this thats my business he said fine you want to do this we can do this if you cause gregorys death through voting or werewolf politics i will bury you if you can he said youre a brandnew shapeshifter you wont even change form until the full moon and thats weeks away you are no match for me you say that like im going to offer to fight you oneonone im not if gregory dies you die simple as that if you shoot me it wont reinstate you into the pack if you could possibly win oneonone against me then maybe theyd vote you back to lupa but if you just shoot me youll never be lupa again im going to say this nice and slow jacob so we understand each other i dont give a shit about being lupa i care about my friends and the people ive promised to protect gregory is one of those people if he dies you die im not going to kill him anita i just made sure there was a vote about it do you like john wayne movies jacob he was quiet for a heartbeat i guess i mean what does that have to do with anything your fault my fault nobodys fault if gregory dies you die am i supposed to get the movie reference he asked he sounded angry now i guess not but the point is this i will blame you personally if anything happens to gregory for any reason if he comes to harm so will you if he bleeds so do you if he dies i get the idea but i dont have a deciding vote on this issue im just one vote then you better think of something jacob because i give you my word that i mean everything i say i heard that about you he was quiet and we stood on either end of the phone in silence until he said what about richard what about him if something happens to him what will you do if i tell you that ill kill you if you kill him that undercuts his authority as ulfric but ill say this much if you defeat him then it better be a fair fight in a challenge circle if you cheat in any way no matter how small ill kill you i wanted so badly to just give richard blanket protection but i couldnt it would weaken his position and his position was weak enough already but if its fair youll stay out of it i leaned against the wall and tried to think ill be honest jacob i love richard i dont always understand him or even agree with him but i love him im ready to kill you over someone who has never been my lover or even a good friend so yeah you kill richard and im really really going to want to kill you but you wont he said i didnt like how persistent he was about the issue it made me nervous ill make you a deal you dont challenge richard for ulfric until after the next full moon then whatever happens as long as its fair ill stay out of it what if its sooner he asked then i am going to rain all over your parade youre undercutting richards authority he said no jacob no im not i wouldnt be killing you because i was lupa or any werewolf stuff id be killing you because i am just that vindictive give me a few weeks until after the full moon and youre in the clear on this one if youve got the cojones to finish the job you think richard will kill me instead he killed the last ulfric jacob thats how he got the job if i dont agree to this youll just shoot me from a nice safe distance oh yeah i can promise that i wont challenge richard until after the full moon but i cant promise that the vote wont go against gregory he was one that raina the old lupa used to help punish some members of the pack theres more than one woman here that he helped rape i know then how can you defend him he did what his old alpha told him to do and what raina the wicked bitch of the west told him to do gregory isnt a dominant hes lesser and he does what hes told like a good submissive shapeshifter ever since i took over as his alpha hes refused to rape and torture as soon as he had a choice he stopped doing it ask sylvie gregory let himself be tortured instead of helping to rape her she told the story to the pack you dont sound impressed its not me you have to impress anita its the others help me figure out a way to impress them jacob are you serious you want me to help you save the leopard yeah thats ridiculous im geri of thronnos rokke clan i dont have to help a wereleopard that even you admit isnt a dominant dont go all class conscious on me jacob remember the early part of our conversation the part about you dying i blame you for the mess and you will help me clean it up or i will splatter your brains all over the walls you cant bring guns into the lupanar i laughed and even to me it was an unsettling sound creepy even you going to spend the rest of your life inside the lupanar jesus he said voice soft youre talking about assassinating me i laughed again a small voice in my head was screaming at me telling me i was being a very good sociopath but rebecca of sunnybrook farm wasnt going to cut it with jacob maybe later i could afford to be soft i think we finally understand each other jacob heres my cell phone number you call me before tomorrow night with a plan what if i cant come up with one not my problem youll kill me even if i try and save him really try and save your leopard but fail youll still kill me yes you cold bitch sticks and stones will break your bones but failure will get you killed call me jacob make it soon i hung up the phone i see what you mean about you being practical micah said he was standing quietly watching me face carefully neutral but he couldnt quite keep everything off his face he was pleased pleased with me i think you not going to run screaming because im a bloodthirsty sociopath he smiled and again his long lashes came down over his eyes i dont think youre a sociopath anita i think you do what needs doing to protect your pard he raised that yellowgreen gaze to me i find that admirable not something to criticize i sighed good that someone approves he smiled and it was that mixture of condescension happiness and sorrow that id seen before a complex smile that the ulfric means well you know what they say about good intentions micah if hes determined to take himself to hell fine but he has no right to drag the rest of us along with him i agree it made me tired that micah agreed with me i wasnt in love with him why couldnt it be richard who agreed with me of course there was someone else i needed to get to jeanclaude while it was still dark i had to put off the shower first to be a gentleman and let you go first then so the noise wouldnt interrupt your phone call i need to get clean now if you dont mind ill give you some privacy i turned towards the door it wasnt privacy i was asking for just explaining why i was turning the water on during our conversation he said that turned me around at the door what conversation he turned on the shower testing the water with his hand adjusting the heat talking over his shoulder ive never felt another nimirra with the kind of power you put off it was amazing glad you enjoyed it but ive really got to go he turned to face me stepping back into the water throwing his head back for a second to wet his hair the water hit his neck and he let out a hissing breath bending over at the shoulders like it really hurt i went back into the room are you alright he nodded and stopped in midmotion i will be i was close enough that when he raised his head i could see the water beaded on his face clinging in thick drops to his lashes i stood to one side getting sprayed with just the faintest mist of the water i got my first good look at the side of his neck shit i reached through the water to touch his face turned him slowly so i could see the bite he had a perfect imprint of my teeth in the right side of his neck the wound was still seeping blood so the circle of toothmarks was filled with crimson the tanned flesh of his neck was already bruising dark colors swirling to the surface of his skin god micah im sorry dont be sorry it is a love bite i dropped my hand from his face yeah right it looks like i tried to eat your throat out i frowned why hasnt it started healing wounds made by the teeth and claws of another lycanthrope heal slower than most not as slow as silver but slower than say steel i am sorry and i said dont be sorry the last ulfric i bit like this and it wasnt nearly this bad i didnt even break the skin he considered it an insult he said it meant i considered myself higher in the pack than he was we are not wolves to the pard a wound on the neck from a nimirra is a sign that the sex was good that made me blush i didnt mean to embarrass you just to explain that you dont owe me an apology i enjoyed it i blushed harder together we could do great things for our pard i shook my head we wont know for sure that im going to be nimirra for a few days lets take it slow until then if you want to his gaze was too direct and i was suddenly aware that he was nude in a shower i was getting better at ignoring or at least not being bothered around nudity but there were moments when you had to be aware of it when the look in the other persons eyes made you aware of it i want to i said he turned his back lowering his head so the water beat on his shoulders back lower things the spray widened as he moved through it spattering on my face shoulders arms legs across the towel it was time for me to leave past time i was at the door again when he called after me anita i turned back he was standing facing me rubbing liquid soap from one of the wall dispensers on his body he was doing his arms as i turned around lathering his chest as he talked if you want us to go with you tomorrow we would be honored i cant let you drag your pard into our mess his hands slid downward trailing white suds over his stomach his hips then slid between his legs working the soap over himself i knew from my own experience of getting the stuff off me that you had to scrub more where it had touched you but his hands stayed until he was slick thick with bubbles and partially erect by the time his hands slid to his thighs my mouth was dry and i realized we hadnt said anything in several minutes id just been watching him spread soap on himself the thought brought heat in a rush up my face micah continued to soap his legs slowly taking more time with each movement than he needed to he was definitely doing it for my benefit i needed to leave if you are my nimirra then your mess is my mess he said head still bent over his legs face hidden from me so that all i could see was the line of his body as he stood in the aisle away from the water so the soap wouldnt rub off i had to clear my throat to say i dont want to pick out curtains micah the power between us is enough that ill agree to any arrangement you want he stood up then stretching his arm back to soap his shoulders it made him stretch the front of his body in a long line and i was painfully aware of him i turned really meaning to go out the door this time anita he said i stopped in the doorway but this time i didnt turn around what i sounded grumpy its alright to be attracted to me you cant help yourself that made me laugh a good normal laugh oh you dont have a high opinion of yourself do you but i stayed facing away from him its not a high opinion of myself you are a nimirra and i am the first nimirraj that youve ever met our power our beasts are attracted to each other were meant to be attracted to each other i turned then slowly trying for eye contact and failing he was turned away with the back of his body facing me he was still spreading soap over his shoulders the suds slid slowly down his skin towards his slim waist we dont know yet that im a wereanything my voice was breathy he managed to reach his entire back his arms moving effortlessly over his skin hands smoothing over the tightness of his buttocks you feel the call of my body as i feel yours my pulse was beating way too hard youre an attractive man naked covered in soap im human so sue me he turned around still soaped and slick and he was huge my mouth went dry my body tightened so hard and so suddenly it almost hurt it deepened my breathing made me have to swallow my pulse youre not human thats the difference thats why you keep looking even when you dont want to he walked towards me slowly moving like all leopards could move when they wanted to like he had muscles in places that humans didnt he glided towards me like some great slinking cat his nude body glistening with suds and water his hair plastered in ringlets to his shoulders around his face those huge yellow green eyes suddenly looked perfectly at home in his face you dont understand yet how rare it is for two lycanthropes to share their beasts as we did he was almost in front of me now they flowed in and out of our bodies he stood there not touching not yet they were like two great cats rubbing their furred sides against each other he ran his hands slick with soap up my bare arms as he said it i had to close my eyes he was describing exactly how it had felt as if he had read my mind or had felt exactly the same thing his hands slid up my arms to my shoulders to my neck spreading slick and wet across my skin his soapy hands cupped my face and i felt his face moving towards mine before his lips touched me the kiss was gentle his body carefully not touching me he slid his fingers into the edge of the towel gripping the cloth pulling me forward it made me open my eyes it took a few steps to realize he was leading me towards the water youll need to wash the soap off he said i was shaking my head and finally stopped moving with him he kept pulling on the towel and it unwrapped starting to slide down my body i grabbed it holding it just below my suddenly bare breasts no i said my voice strangled but i repeated it no he stepped into me pressing the slick hardness of him against my lower hand and arm he tried to uncurl my fingers from the towel and i held on for dear life touch me anita cup me in your hands no i know you want to i can smell it and he moved his face above my skin drawing his breath in and out against my wet skin i can feel it he rubbed his hands up my arms again over my shoulders down towards my breasts but stopped without touching them i can taste it he licked a slow line along the edge of my cheek i shivered and wanted to step back but it was like i was frozen in place i couldnt move i found my voice shaky but mine my hands clutched to my body because i knew if i touched him we were in trouble this isnt like me micah im not like this youre a stranger i dont do strangers im not a stranger im your nimirraj and you are my nimirra we could never be strangers he kissed his way down my face to my neck biting gently at me and it made my knees weak he came back up to my lips and when he kissed me i could taste the soap from my skin the feel of him pressed against the front of my body close enough that if i opened my hand id be able to hold him was overwhelming i realized it was more than just sex i wanted to feed off of him again not with my teeth but with my body i wanted to drink in the energy of him through my skin my bare skin pressed to his i wanted it so badly his hands slid over my breasts covering them in soap making them slick the nipples already tight and hard my arms slid around his waist using the pressure of our bodies to keep the towel in place he moved against my body and his chest was so slick so smooth rubbing against my breasts he began to walk backwards with his arms locked behind me moving us back towards the water my hands moved over the slick hardness of his back sliding dangerously lower it was as if i wanted to press every inch of myself to him to roll his body around me like a sheet and drink him in through the pores of my skin i opened that link with jeanclaude and found him sitting waiting patient i called for help and distantly i heard his voice in my head it is all i can do ma petite to control my own appetites you must control your own whats happening to me even as i asked micah moved his body that fraction away that allowed the towel to slide down and when he quickly moved back he was pressed against my groin and stomach and it was dйjа vu enough to draw a small sound out of my throat jeanclaude looked up and i knew that he saw what was happening with micah that with a thought he could feel what was happening as if it were his hands sliding down the slick soaped skin my hand slid over the thick hardness of micah he halfcollapsed against me as i caressed him and i knew that it hadnt been my idea to touch him jeanclaude had wanted to know what it felt like he drew away enough for me to move my hand but the damage had been done micah dragged me into the water surer now than ever that i would say yes jeanclaudes voice in my head you can feed off his lust but the price for that is that you will crave his lust his sex it is the doubleedged sword of being incubus the sword edge i have walked for centuries help me i cannot you must ride this thing yourself and you will either conquer it or be conquered you felt what happened when i interfered just now because i have denied myself feeding through my body i knew you would not approve so i denied myself and being inside your body while you touch him while you feed would be my undoing i crave you more than you will ever crave the man in your arms i have wanted to take your body in the way that only i could take it to feed from your sex not from a vein but i knew that would frighten you more than blood micah turned me towards the wall putting my hands up against the tile pressing his body against my back jeanclaudes voice was soft in my head more intimate than micahs touch i did not know you would gain this demon from me ma petite and nothing i can say will convince you of that i know that i await you here until you have wrestled the demon whatever the outcome and he shielded from me hid himself away so he would not feel what was happening left me alone to make my choice if i was still capable of choosing i found i did have a voice and said micah stop please stop micah licked the back of my neck and i shuddered pressed against the wet wall please micah im not on birth control a clear thought at last he bit softly at the back of my neck i had myself fixed two years ago youre safe with me anita please micah please dont he bit harder just this side of drawing blood and my body went passive calm it was as if hed hit a switch i didnt know i had when he pressed himself inside me he was slick and i knew that sometime when id been paying attention to jeanclaude inside my head hed spread more soap on himself allowing that thick hardness to slide more easily inside me he pinned me to the wall and slid inside me one tight inch at a time it wasnt that he was long so much as he was wide wide enough that it was just this side of pain to have him work himself inside me even with the soap he pushed until most of him was inside me and there was a stopping point then he began to draw himself out slowly so slowly then in again slowly still having to push himself to work to make room for himself inside me i stood pinned against the wall passive unmoving it wasnt like me i moved during sex but i didnt want to move didnt want to stop and there was no thinking just the feel of him moving in and out of me i wasnt as tight now and the soap had given way to my own wetness so that he began to move more smoothly in and out of me he was gentle but he was so big that even gentle was almost overwhelming he came to the end of my body before the full shaft of him was inside me i could feel him bumping against my cervix at the end of each stroke most women find having their cervix bumped painful but some women find it pleasurable his size was intimidating but when i realized it didnt hurt in fact that it felt wonderful a part of me that was still sane still keeping track of some safety measures relaxed and shut down my last measure of control went away i didnt want sex that was just a means to an end i wanted to feed i wanted to eat his lust drink his heat bathe in his energy the thought brought a sound low in my throat micah braced himself against the wall his body pinning mine completely and began to find a rhythm still gentle but quicker he was being so careful of me and i didnt want him careful i heard a voice that didnt quite sound like mine harder his voice came out squeezed tight it will hurt if i do it harder try me no micah please just do it please if it hurts ill tell you please hed been less controlled in the other room and i realized why he truly was afraid of hurting me because he was inside me when he was just rubbing himself on my body he hadnt had to worry about damaging me now he did it gave him an edge of control that kept me from feeding he was a nimirraj and he had enough power to keep me out unless he let down his guard to do that he had to lose more control than this even as i thought it a part of me was swimming to the surface i could think again at least a little i didnt want to do this i didnt want to feed off of him it was wrong in so many ways it was wrong i started to say micah stop i cant do this i got as far as micah and he took me at my word he thrust into me so hard and fast it tore a scream from my throat and brought that new part of me that was jeanclaudes hunger in a raging wave of heat that rode my body and spilled out my mouth hed stopped are you alright dont stop dont stop he never asked again he drove himself inside me so fast and hard that it left me gasping unable to catch my breath small helpless noises fell from my lips spaced with the words oh god yes yes micah every time he thrust as far as he could smashing himself inside me it rode that fine line between overwhelming pleasure and pain and just as the pleasure began to turn to pain hed withdraw and id be able to breathe again then hed thrust himself inside me again and it would start all over it felt like he filled me up as if i were a cup until there was nothing inside me but the feel of his body the feel of his flesh pounding into mine it was tight thick like hed plugged a hole with his body and would never let it go that sense of fullness inside me grew grew and spilled over me through me inside me and tore out of my mouth in ragged frantic screams as my body spasmed around him and it was only then that his control slipped away letting me know that he had still been gentle his control went when he did and i drank him into me through his chest pressed to my back his hips thrusting against my butt i drank him in as he exploded inside me i fed on him drew him inside every pore of my skin until it was as if our skins gave way and we spilled into each other became for one shining moment one thing one beast and i could feel his beast inside mine as if they were coupling within our bodies as our human shells merged in that moment i didnt doubt that i was truly his nimirra when we were finished and had slid to the floor him still inside me his arms hugging me to the front of his body i started to cry he was afraid hed hurt me but that wasnt it i couldnt explain the tears to him because i didnt want to say it out loud but i knew id tried not to be one of the monsters for so long and now in one fell swoop i was them both of them you couldnt be a bloodsucking vampire and be a lycanthrope at the same time they canceled each other out as a disease or a curse but i had felt my beast curl around micahs i had felt it like an embryo in a safe warm place waiting and i had fed off of him as surely as any vampire id always thought id have to drink blood to be one of them but i had been wrong wrong about so many things i let micah hold me i felt his heart pounding against my back and wept nathaniel drove because i was too shaky to concentrate i was functioning moving forward solving the problems one at a time but it was as if the very ground i walked on the air i breathed was precarious and new as if everything had changed because i had changed i knew better i knew that no matter how bad you feel or what horrible thing happens to you that the world just keeps on going that the rest of the world doesnt even realize that the monsters are eating your heart a long time ago it use to bother me that i could be in such confusion such pain and the world just didnt give a shit the world the creation as a whole is designed to move forward to keep on keeping on without any one individual person it feels damned impersonal and it is but then if the world stopped rotating just because one of us was having a bad day wed all be floating out in space so i huddled in the passenger seat of my jeep in the late darkness and knew that only i had changed but it was just such a big change that it felt like the world should have changed its orbit just a little june was back to its normal hot sticky self nathaniel wore a ribbed tank top and silky jogging shorts hed tied his nearly anklelength hair in a loose braid that curled on the seat beside his thigh hed found that if he let his hair fall onto the floorboard sometimes it tangled around the pedals he had to watch the gear shift between the seats too id never had hair that long nathaniel had only had his drivers license for a few months even though he was twenty gabriel their old alpha had not encouraged them to be independent i sort of demanded it of them as far as they were able at first nathaniel had been lost when i started to demand that he decide things for himself but lately hed been doing better it made me hopeful and i needed some hope right now hed picked out the clothes that hed brought to the makeshift hospital for me black jeans royal blue scoop neck tshirt a black bra that fit low enough to accommodate the low neckline matching undies black jogging socks black nikes a shortsleeved black shirt to cover the shoulder rig with the browning hipower people kept urging me to go shopping for a new main gun they were probably right there was probably something out there that would fit my hand better than the browning but id been putting it off the browning was like a piece of me i felt incomplete without it like i was missing a hand it was going to take something more than a smaller grip to convince me to switch guns so for now it was still me and the browning nathaniel had also brought my wrist sheaths and the matching silver knives i was going to leave them in the car since the shirt was shortsleeved they were a little too aggressive to wear into the police station i had just replaced the back sheath i had ruined in new mexico it had been a special order and it had cost mucho extra dinero to get a rush job on it but it had been worth it there really wasnt anywhere else on my body that i could carry a blade that large and still be able to sit down without the hilt showing we drove in silence nathaniel hadnt even turned the radio on which he liked to do he rarely moved in silence if he could have music for background but tonight he let the silence seep into the jeep i finally asked a question id been wanting an answer for who put the derringer in my robe pocket the derringer was in the glove compartment i did thanks the two things that you always do first is get dressed and get armed his smile flashed in an instant of street light im not sure which is your highest priority i had to smile im not sure either how are you doing his voice was very careful when he asked it quiet in the rushing silence of the car i dont want to talk about it okay he was one of the few people that would actually take me at my word and not press if i told nathaniel i didnt want to talk we didnt talk the silence between us was no longer strained in fact silence with nathaniel was one of the most relaxing sounds of my day nathaniel parked the jeep and we got out i had my executioners license with me and most people knew me on sight it occurred to me that they thought i was dead as we walked towards the door i realized i should probably have called ahead and given them a heads up but it was too late now i was a yard from the door i wasnt using the cell phone now i was a familiar enough sight that i could usually just wave as i went past the desk but tonight the officers eyes got big as he waved me on to the left so i didnt have to go through the metal detector but he was picking up a phone as he did it i was betting he was calling ahead you dont see people rise from the dead every night well i guess i do but most cops dont i was up the stairs leading to rpits headquarters when detective clive perry opened the door and started down the stairs he was slender handsome africanamerican and the most unfailingly polite person id ever met he actually missed the step and had to catch himself on the railing even then he leaned against the wall like his legs werent working quite right he looked shocked no scared anita his voice was breathy it was probably the second time in all the years wed known each other that he had used my first name it was usually ms blake i responded in kind smiling clive its good to see you his eyes flicked from me to nathaniel then back to me youre supposed to be he straightened on the stairs i mean we heard i watched him visibly try to rally by the time we reached the step he was on he looked almost normal but his next question wasnt normal did you die i smiled then felt the smile fade as i stared into his eyes he was serious i guess i did raise the dead for a living so the question wasnt as ridiculous as it sounded but i was realizing that some of his shock wasnt just from seeing me walking around it was from his fear of what i was now he thought i was the walking dead in some ways he was closer to the mark than was comfortable in others he was so far off no clive i didnt die he nodded but there was a tightness around his eyes that made me wonder if i tried to touch his arm would he flinch i didnt want to find out so nathaniel and i just walked past him leaving him alone on the stairs i pushed into the squad room with its crowded desks and the busy clatter of people rpit had some of its busiest hours after three am the noise died gradually like fading water rings going out into the room until i moved in silence between the desks and the staring faces nathaniel stayed at my back moving like an attractive shadow i finally said loud enough to carry through the room the rumors of my death are greatly exaggerated and the room exploded into noise i was suddenly surrounded by men and a few women hugging me slapping me on the back pumping my hand smiling faces relieved eyes no one else showed the reservations that clive perry had shown on the stairs and it made me wonder about his religious background or his metaphysical one he wasnt a sensitive but that didnt mean he hadnt grown up around people who were it was zerbrowski who picked me completely off the ground in a huge bear hug hes only five eight and not that big but he spun me around the room finally putting me down laughing and a little unsteady on my feet damn anita damn i thought we were never going to see you come through that door again he pushed a tangle of dark curls that were beginning to streak with gray from his forehead he needed a haircut but then he usually did his clothes were the usual mismatch as if hed chosen his tie and shirt in the dark he dressed like he was either colorblind or didnt give a shit i was betting on the latter its good to see you too i hear youre actually holding someone on suspicion of having killed me his smile faded around the edges yeah count draculas in a cell can you get him out because as you see i am very much alive zerbrowskis eyes narrowed i saw the pictures anita you were covered in blood i shrugged his eyes became cool suspicious cop eyes its been what four nights youre looking positively spry for suffering that much blood loss i could feel my own face grow neutral distant as cool and unreadable as any cops can you get jeanclaude out and ready to go id like to take him home before it gets light dolphs going to want to talk to you before you leave i thought he might can you please start processing jeanclaude while i talk to dolph you going to take him to your house im going to drop him off at his place not that its any of your business youre my friend zerbrowski not my dad ive never wanted to be your dad anita thats dolphs delusion not mine i sighed yeah i looked up at zerbrowski will you please get jeanclaude ready to go he looked at me for a second or two then nodded okay he looked past me to nathaniel who had moved to the side of the room to let the great reunion take place whos that nathaniel a friend he looked back at me a little young isnt he hes only six years younger than i am zerbrowski but he drove me tonight so i wouldnt have to his eyes looked worried you okay a little shaky but itll pass he touched my face staring into my eyes trying to read them i think id like to know what the hell is going on with you i met his gaze face eyes blank so would i that seemed to surprise him because he blinked and dropped his hand ill get count dracula out of hock you go talk to dolph my shoulders hunched a little and i had to concentrate to square them i was not looking forward to talking with dolph zerbrowski went to get jeanclaude and i left nathaniel talking to a niceenough seeming police woman and went to dolphs office he was standing in the doorway like a small mountain hes six eight and built like a pro wrestler his dark hair was cut very short leaving his ears stranded and bare his suit looked pressed tie neatly knotted hed probably already been on the job for nearly an eighthour shift but he still looked fresh out of the box his eyes were very careful when they looked at me im glad youre alive thanks me too he waved a hand and walked me down the hallway away from the office away from the desks towards the interrogation rooms i guess he wanted privacy privacy that even the glass windows of his office wouldnt give him it made my stomach tight and a little trickle of fear go through me i wasnt afraid of dolph the way i was afraid of a rogue shapeshifter or a vamp i had to kill he wouldnt hurt me physically but i was afraid of the tight set of his shoulders the cautious cold look of his eyes when he glanced back to make sure i was following i could feel how angry he was almost like the energy off a shapeshifter what had i done to deserve such rage dolph held the door for me and i squeezed past his bulk have a seat he said as he closed the door behind us ill stand thanks i want to get jeanclaude out of here before dawn i heard you werent dating him anymore dolph said hes being held without charge on suspicion of killing me im not dead so id like to get him out of here dolph just looked at me eyes as cold and unreadable as if he were looking at a witness no a suspect that he didnt like much jeanclaude has a damn fine lawyer howd you keep him for over seventytwo hours without a charge i asked youre a city treasure i told everyone hed killed you and they helped me lose him for a while damn dolph youre lucky some overzealous officer didnt put him in a cell with a window yeah too bad i just stared at him not even sure what to say im alive dolph he didnt hurt me who did it was my turn to give him cool cop eyes he walked up to me towering over me he wasnt trying to intimidate me with his height he knew that didnt work anyway he was just that big he touched my chin tried to turn my face to the side i jerked away youve got scars on your neck that you didnt have a week ago theyre all shiny and nearly healed how would you believe im not sure no suit yourself let me see the scars i swept my hair to one side and let him trace one large finger down the healed wounds i want to see the rest of the wounds dont we need a female officer in here for this do you really want anyone else to see them he had a point why do you want to see dolph i cant force you to show me but i need to see them why i dont know he said and his voice showed strain for the first time i shed the outer shirt and laid it on the table i held my left arm out to him pushing the sleeve of the tshirt up he traced his finger over the marks what is it about your left arm its always where you get hit the most i think its because im righthanded ill let them chew on my left arm while i grab a weapon with my right did you kill what did this to you no he looked at me and the anger showed for a second i wish i believed you me too especially since im telling the truth who or what did this to you anita i shook my head its been taken care of damn it anita how can i trust you when you wont talk to me i shrugged is the arm all of it almost i want to see all of it there were a lot of men in my life that id have accused of just wanting to get my shirt off but dolph wasnt one of them thered never been that kind of tension between us i stared at him hoping hed back down but he didnt i should have known he wouldnt i worked the shirt out of my pants and exposed my bra i had to raise the edge of the underwire to show the round hole now scar over my heart he touched it like he had all the others shaking his head its like something tried to scoop your heart out he raised his eyes to my face how the hell did you heal it anita can i get dressed there was a knock at the door and zerbrowski entered without waiting to be asked while i was still struggling to get my breasts back behind the underwire his eyes widened am i interrupting were finished i said gee and i thought dolph would have more staying power we both glared at him he grinned count dracula is processed and ready to go his name is jeanclaude whatever you say i had to bend over and rearrange my breasts so the bra would fit right again those underwires hurt if they ride up they both watched me do it and i stubbornly wouldnt turn away zerbrowski watched because he was a cheerful leech dolph because he was angry would you take a blood test he asked no we can get a court order on what grounds i havent done anything wrong dolph except show up here not dead if i didnt know better id say you were disappointed im glad youre alive he said but sorry you cant bust jeanclaudes ass is that it he looked away id finally hit on it thats it isnt it youre sorry that you cant arrest jeanclaude get him executed he didnt kill me dolph why do you want him dead hes already dead anita he just doesnt know enough to lie down is that a threat dolph made a low exasperated sound hes a walking corpse anita i know what jeanclaude is dolph probably better than you do so i keep hearing he said what youre angry because im dating him you are not my father i can date who or what i want to date how can you let him touch you and the anger was there again rage you want him dead because hes been my lover i couldnt keep the surprise out of my voice he wouldnt meet my eyes youre not jealous of me dolph i know that for a fact it just bothers you that hes not human is that it hes a vampire anita he met my gaze then how can you fuck a corpse the level of animosity was too personal too intimate and then it hit me what woman in your life is fucking the undead dolph he took a step towards me his entire body trembling his huge hands balled into fists the rage rushed up his face in a near purple wave he spoke through gritted teeth get out i wanted to say something to make it better but there was nothing to say i moved carefully past him keeping my eyes on him afraid hed make a grab for me but he just stood there regaining control of himself zerbrowski walked me out and closed the door behind us if id been with another woman wed have talked about what just happened if id been with a lot of men in a different line of work wed have talked about it but zerbrowski was a cop and that meant you didnt talk about the personal stuff if you accidentally learned something truly painful truly private you left it the fuck alone unless the man involved wanted to talk about it besides i didnt know what to say i didnt want to know that dolphs wife was cheating on him with a corpse he had two sons no daughters so who else could it be zerbrowski walked me through the squad room in silence a man turned as we entered the room he was tall darkhaired with gray starting at the temples the clean strong lines of his face were beginning to soften around the edges but it was still a handsome face in a manly man marlboro sort of way he looked vaguely familiar but it wasnt until he turned his head exposing the claw scars on the side of his neck that i recognized him orlando king had been one of the premiere bounty hunters in the country until a rogue shapeshifter had nearly killed him the stories could never agree on what animal did it some said wolf others bear or leopard the story had grown in the telling until i doubt anyone but king himself knew the truth king and the shapeshifters that had nearly killed him if they hadnt all died in the attempt that is he had a rep that he never lost a bounty never stopped until his creature was dead he earned good money lecturing across the country and in other countries for his finale hed take his shirt off and show his scars it smacked a little too much of circus sideshow for my taste but hey it wasnt my body he also did some consulting with the police anita blake this is orlando king zerbrowski said we brought him in to help convict count dracula of your murder i glared at zerbrowski who only smiled wider hed keep calling jeanclaude by his pet names until it stopped getting a rise out of me the quicker i ignored it the better ms blake orlando king said in the deep rolling voice that i remembered from his lectures so good to see you alive its good to be alive mr king last i heard you were lecturing on the west coast i hope you didnt interrupt your tour to come solve my murder he shrugged and there was something about the way he moved his shoulders that made him seem taller broader than he was there are so few of us that truly pit ourselves against the monsters how could i not come im flattered i said ive heard you lecture you came up and spoke to me afterwards he said im flattered again you must meet thousands of people a year he smiled and touched my left arm ever so lightly but not many with scars to rival mine and none half so pretty in this line of business thanks he was at least two generations removed from me so i figured his complimenting me wasnt so much flirting as habit zerbrowski was grinning at me and his grin said he didnt think king was simply being polite i shrugged and ignored it ive found that if you pretend not to notice that a man is flirting with you most of them will eventually grow tired and stop its good to meet you again ms blake especially alive but i know that you must be in a hurry if youre going to rescue your vampire boyfriend before dawn there was the faintest hesitation before the word boyfriend i studied his face and found it neutral there was no condemnation nothing but a smile and goodwill after dolphs little fit it was kind of nice thank you for understanding id love a chance to talk to you before i leave town he said again i wondered if he was flirting and i said the only thing i could think of compare notes you mean exactly he said i just did not understand my effect on men i wasnt that attractive or maybe i just couldnt see it we shook hands and he didnt hold my hand any longer than necessary didnt squeeze it or any of those funky things men do when theyre interested maybe i was just getting paranoid where men were concerned zerbrowski led me through the sea of desks to fetch nathaniel the police woman detective jessica arnet one of the newest members of the squad was still entertaining nathaniel at her desk she was gazing into his lilac eyes as if there was some hypnotic power in them there wasnt but nathaniel was a good listener thats rare enough in men for it to be a bigger selling point than an attractive body come on nathaniel weve got to go he stood instantly but tossed a smile towards detective arnet that made her eyes sparkle nathaniels reallife job was as a stripper so he flirted instinctively he seemed both aware and unaware of his effect on women when he concentrated he understood what he was doing but when he simply walked into a room and heads turned he was oblivious i touched his arm say goodbye to the nice detectives weve got to hurry he said goodbye nice detectives i gave him a small push towards the doors zerbrowski followed us out i think if nathaniel hadnt been with us hed have asked more questions but hed never met nathaniel and wasnt sure of him so we moved in silence to the prisoner processing area where jeanclaude was sitting on one of the three chairs normally the processing area was full of people coming in going out and since its the size of a walkin closet that makes it seem crowded the two vending machines took up room but except for the prisoner processing clerk the new name since turnkey fell out of fashion behind his little barred bankteller window the place was deserted but it was in the morning jeanclaude rose when he saw me his white shirt was stained torn on one sleeve he didnt look like hed been beaten or hurt but he was usually a fanatic about his clothes only something drastic would have changed that a struggle perhaps i did not run to him but i did wrap my arms around him press my ear to his chest hold on to him as if he were the last solid thing in the world he stroked my hair and murmured to me in french i understood enough to know he was glad to see me and that he thought i looked beautiful but beyond that it was just pretty noise it wasnt until i felt zerbrowski behind me that i pulled away but when jeanclaudes hand found mine i welcomed it zerbrowski was looking at me as if hed never seen me before what it came out hostile ive never seen you be that soft with anyone before it startled me youve seen me kiss richard before he nodded that was lust this is he shook his head glancing up at jeanclaude then back to me he makes you feel safe i realized with a jolt that he was right youre smarter than you look zerbrowski katie reads selfhelp books to me i just look at the pictures he touched my right hand ill talk to dolph i dont think its going to help i said he shrugged if orlando king can have a conversion experience where the monsters are concerned anybody can what do you mean i asked have you ever read or seen any of his interviews before his accident zerbrowski made little quote marks with his fingers when he said accident no that was before i was interested in the topic i think he frowned at me i keep forgetting you were still in diapers then i just shook my head so tell me king was one of the shining lights behind trying to get lycanthropes declared nonhuman so they could be executed just for existing without a trial then he got cut up and lo and behold he mellowed nearly dying will do that to you zerbrowski he grinned at me it didnt make me a better man id held my hands over his stomach kept his insides from spilling out while we waited for an ambulance it had happened just before christmas about two years ago zerbrowski live and well had been all i put on my list to santa that year if katie couldnt make you a better man then nothing could i said he grinned wider then his face sobered ill talk to the boss for you see if i can get him to mellow without a neardeath experience i looked up into his serious face just because you saw me hug jeanclaude yeah i gave zerbrowski a quick hug thank you he pushed me back towards jeanclaude better get him under wraps before dawn he looked past me to the vampire take care of her jeanclaude gave a small bow from his neck i will take care of her as much as she allows it zerbrowski laughed oh he does know you we left with zerbrowski laughing the clerk staring and the night growing soft around us dawn was coming and i had so many questions nathaniel drove jeanclaude and i rode in back i buckled my seat belt out of habit but jeanclaude stayed pressed to my side arm around my shoulders id started to shake and couldnt seem to stop it was as if id been waiting for him so i could finally fall apart i didnt cry just let him hold me while i shook it is alright ma petite we are both safe now i shook my head against the stained front of his shirt its not that he touched my face raised it to look at him in the softlighted darkness of the car then what is it i had sex with micah i watched his face waited for the anger jealousy something to flash through his eyes what i saw was sympathy and i didnt understand it you are like a vampire newly risen even those of us who will be masters cannot fight our hunger the first night or the first few nights it is overwhelming it is why many vampires feed on their nearest kin when they first rise it is who they are thinking of in their hearts and they are drawn to them it is only with the aid of a master vampire that the hunger can be directed elsewhere youre not angry i asked he laughed and hugged me i thought you would be angry with me for giving you the ardeur the fire the burning hunger i pushed back enough to see his face why didnt you warn me that i couldnt control it i never underestimate you ma petite if anyone i have ever known in all these centuries could have withstood such a test it was you so i did not tell you you would fail because i no longer try to predict what power will do to you or through you you are a law unto yourself so much of the time i was helpless i i didnt want to control it of course not i shook my head is the ardeur permanent i do not know how long until i can control it a few weeks but even after you have control you will have to be careful around those you most lust after they will make the hunger flare like fire raging in your veins there is no shame to it so you say he held my face between his hands ma petite it has been over four hundred years since i first woke with the ardeur raging in me but i remember all these years and i still remember that the cry for flesh was almost worse than the cry for blood i held his wrists pressed his hands against my face im scared of course you are you should be but i will help you through this i will be your guide it may pass away in a few days or come and go i simply do not know but i will help you through it whatever happens nathaniel pulled into the circus of the damned parking lot beside the back door it was still dark as we got out but the air had that soft feel of predawn you could taste the coming morning on the tip of your tongue jason opened the outer door as if hed been waiting for us he probably had jeanclaude hurried past him to the door that led to the stairs we followed but jeanclaude called back over his shoulder i must shower before dawn with that he left us running in a blur of motion the rest of us walked more sedately down the stairs able to walk three abreast because none of us were large people how are you feeling jason asked i shrugged im pretty much healed you look shook i shrugged again okay i can take a hint you dont want to talk about it no i dont jason glanced around me at nathaniel you staying the night am i i knew the question was directed at me sure you may need to drive me home tomorrow or rather later today yes i am staying you can bunk with me then god knows the bed is big enough and doesnt see many visitors i glanced at jason does jeanclaude limit your social activities he laughed no not exactly but the women who come down here are vampire freaks they want to sleep in a bed under the ground at the circus of the damned they dont want me they want jeanclaudes pet werewolf i wouldnt think i stopped myself because i realized it was an insult go ahead and say it i wouldnt think that youd be that picky i said i wasnt when i first got here but lately i just dont want to be with someone who just wants me so she can brag to her friends that she slept with a shapeshifter or got to sleep where the vampires sleep no matter how good it feels for a few minutes it still makes me feel like theyve just come to look at one of the freaks i slipped my arm through his squeezed his arm dont let anybody make you feel like that jason youre not a freak he patted my hand look whos talking i pulled away from him whats that supposed to mean nothing im sorry i said it no i want you to explain it he sighed and hurried down the steps but i was in nikes and could keep up nathaniel followed a few steps behind without saying a word explain it jason you hate the monsters you hate being different thats not true you accept that youre different but you dont like it i opened my mouth to argue with him but had to stop myself had to think was he right was he did i hate being different did i hate the monsters because they were different maybe youre right he looked back at me eyes wide anita blake admitting she may be wrong gasp i tried to frown at him but i could feel it held an edge of smile that ruined the effect i better get used to being one of the monsters or so i hear his eyes went serious are you really going to be a wereleopard well find out wont we you okay with it it was my turn to laugh but it sounded bitter no no im not okay with it but the damage is done i cant change it fatalism he said practicality i said same thing he said no it isnt jason looked past me at nathaniel who treaded softly a few steps behind me how do you feel about her being a wereleopard i think ill keep my feelings to myself youre happy about it arent you and there was an edge of hostility in his voice no im not you get to keep her as your nimirra now maybe doesnt that make you happy stop it jason richards told me his little theory about gregory marking me on purpose you talked to richard he made it a question unfortunately you know whats happened then about you guys taking gregory yeah i talked to jacob on the phone even jason looked surprised what did you say to him gregory dies jacob dies jacob wants to be ulfric we discussed that too i said what did he say he wont challenge richard until after the full moon this month you better give sylvie a heads up because that means jacob has to defeat her within the next two weeks why is he waiting for the full moon because i told him id kill him if he didnt you cant undercut richards authority like that i dont need to jason hes doing such a good job all on his own we were at the bottom of the stairs the heavy door hanging open where jeanclaude had rushed through richard is my ulfric im not asking you to badmouth him jason hes destroyed his power structure within the pack its not something to debate its just the truth jason stopped me at the door maybe if you had been here you could have talked him out of it i was finally angry one you have no right to question what i do or dont do two richard is a big boy and makes his own decisions three dont you ever ever question me again youre not my lupa anymore anita anger flared through me like a scalding wave tightening my shoulders my arms spilling into my hands id never felt rage so quickly and so completely i had to close my eyes to concentrate so i wouldnt take a swing at him what was wrong with me i felt nathaniel at my back are you alright he said i shook my head i dont think so look jason said im sorry but i dont want jacob in charge of the pack i dont trust him richard may be a bleedingheart flagwaving rightwinger but hes also fair and he really does try to put the best interests of the pack before his own i dont want to lose that i looked at him trying to swallow past the anger my voice came out squeezed tight youre scared about what will happen to all of you if jacob takes over he nodded yes me too i said he looked into my face studied it if jacob kills richard in a fair fight what will you do richard isnt my boyfriend anymore and im not lupa if its a fair challenge fight then i cant interfere i told jacob if the fight was fair and after the full moon i wouldnt take revenge on him you wont avenge richards death if i kill jacob and richard and sylvie are already dead wholl take over ive seen what happens to a group of shapeshifters who dont have an alpha to lead them i wont let what happened to the leopards happen to the wolves if jacob died before he fought sylvie then you wouldnt have to worry about it jason said the anger that had been leaking away made a comeback you cant have it both ways jason either im not your lupa not dominant to you and thus cant help you fix this or i am still your lupa still dominant to you still someone you come to for this kind of help make up your mind which you want me to be before you get up in my face again you cant be lupa the pack voted you out but youre right its not your fault you had to try and fix yourself before you could fix anyone else im sorry i got in your face apology accepted i said i started to go around him through the door but he caught my arm i didnt ask you to kill jacob because you were my lupa or dominant to me i asked you because i know youve already thought of it i asked you because i know if you think its best for the pack youll do it pack business is no longer my concern so everyone keeps telling me they dont know you like i do he said i pulled away from him gently whats that supposed to mean it means that once youve given your friendship your protection to someone you take care of them even if they dont want you to if i kill jacob richard will never forgive me he dumped you right what have you got to lose by killing jacob nothing but if you dont kill him then you lose sylvie and richard i pushed past him i am getting really tired of doing everyones dirty work no one is better at dirty work than you are anita that stopped me made me turn back around to face him whats that supposed to mean it doesnt mean anything its just the truth i stared into his sosolemn eyes i would have liked to argue but i really couldnt id thought i couldnt feel worse about myself tonight id been wrong watching the look in jasons eyes hearing him talk about me like that made me feel worse this night just couldnt get any more depressing dawn was minutes away when jeanclaude came through the door in a robe you may have the bed ma petite and i will take my coffin i think your nerves are raw enough without me dying in your arms as the sun rises id have liked to argue because i wanted him to hold me in the worst way but he was right id had enough shocks for one night nathaniel will stay with me i said a look passed over jeanclaudes face and jason as well why i do not have the time to explain ma petite but please trust me that jason should be here too it is for the best i could feel dawn trembling close even so deep underground okay jason can stay too jeanclaude was already edging out the door i will tell him on my way to the coffin room i am sorry to leave you like this ma petite go its almost dawn i said he blew me a kiss then was gone leaving the door slightly ajar nathaniel was sitting on the corner of the bed neutral in face eyes even body language he was very good at seeming nonthreatening soothing almost id been sleeping off and on for almost four days yet i was tired unbelievably tired i wasnt sure it was physical more like id overused my mind my emotions i was wrung out lets get some sleep he pulled off his tank top without another word kicked off his shoes pulled off his socks and began to unbraid his hair i knew that would take a while so i went into the bathroom while he finished it had been a long time since id seen jeanclaudes bathroom with its fancy black tub that was big enough for a small orgy the silver swan that the water came out of always reminded me of a fountain but no bath tonight i just wanted to sleep and to forget forget everything of course i hadnt come away with jammies and the shirt that nathaniel had picked for me though attractive and comfortable was not long enough to be a sleep shirt i could not sleep in jeans it just wasnt comfortable damn why should the small things be so important on a night when all the big things had gone to hell there was a knock on the bathroom door ill be out in a minute nathaniel its jason what do you want didnt jeanclaude tell you that i was bunking with you tonight he mentioned it he also sent me with pajamas for you he figured you didnt pack an overnight case that got me to the door and opening it jason stood there in a pair of blue silk boxers baggy enough to be acceptable as sleepwear acceptable for him to wear while sharing a bed with me i might add jason left to his own devices wore mens bikini underwear or less to bed he held out a folded piece of red satin i took it and let it spill through my hands it was actually two pieces a loose top with spaghetti straps and a pair of shorts it was obviously meant to be lingerie he said to tell you that of anything he had that would fit you it covered the most end quote jason said i sighed thanks jason ill be right out i closed the door without waiting for a reply the top that had looked loose actually clung pretty tightly across my breasts youd certainly know whether i was cold or not the shorts were cut so high on the sides that the legs almost met the waistband it managed to cover everything and still not leave much to the imagination lingerie design at its best i suppose i opened the door and turned off the bathroom light as i came out jason was already tucked into the covers on the right side of the bed nathaniel was still sitting on the other side he got up as i came out his unbound hair floating around him like a living curtain my turn he said softly turning on the bathroom light and closing the door you look wonderful jason said no compliments jason im uncomfortable enough in the lingerie then by all means take it off i frowned at him he patted the bed beside him grinning at me come to bed piss me off enough and ill send you back to your room jeanclaude told me to stay here today i could insist i had my gun on top of my folded clothes tucked under one arm if youd shoot me just for teasing you id have been dead a long time ago please jason i have had a very hard night please just behave yourself just this once he raised his hand in the boy scout salute i wont bite promise that made me think of micah and caused me to blush which was embarrassing under the circumstances jasons eyes widened thats a better reaction than ive ever gotten from you ill have to remember the line you reminded me of something embarrassing thats all the grin faded to a smile i knew it wasnt because of me i am not going to babysit your ego too jason youll have to take care of it yourself always do the smile had faded leaving him serious with his yellow hair and blue eyes he looked somehow out of place against all the black silk as if he needed a different color to frame him to best advantage of course the bed wasnt meant to frame him to best advantage it was meant to frame jeanclaude the thought was enough i felt him in his coffin felt him dead to the world gone away wherever vampires go when the sun rises the feel of him so distant unable to hold me or help me made me feel cold and even more cut adrift i leaned against the heavy cherry wood post of the bed one hand on it but my hands were not big enough to encircle the wood it was a big bed at least king size whats wrong anita i shook my head i dont want to talk about it im sorry i will be good i promise no more teasing i asked he tried to stay serious but a smile crept through id promise no more teasing if i thought i could live up to it but i will promise to try and not tease you anymore today hows that i had to smile honest i guess i sat down on the edge of the bed you seem lost tonight he said it was so close to what i was thinking that i turned and looked at him is it that obvious only to someone who knows you do you know me that well jason sometimes and sometimes you are totally confusing to me i pulled back the covers and crawled under the sheet pushing the heavy satin coverlet away from me id left a lot of distance between me and jason i slid my gun under the nearest pillow safety on and for extra precaution since i was sleeping with nongun users no bullets were in the chamber honest anita ill behave myself you can move closer i know and not just because jeanclaude and richard wouldnt like it richard isnt dating me anymore jason hes not mine anymore just saying it out loud made my skin colder my stomach clench tight he may say that but if he found out i tried anything tonight anything serious hed make me pay for it what do you mean he may not be dating you but ill bet my favorite body part that he wouldnt tolerate you dating any of the other werewolves him not being able to have you isnt the same thing as not wanting you i looked at him sheetcovered knees hugged to my chest when did you get so smart i have my moments i had to smile yeah you do we were both smiling when nathaniel came out of the bathroom hit the lights nathaniel nathaniel did what i asked and the blackness was complete the lights were on a timer and would come on softly in a few hours but until then it was a darkness so complete it was like being dropped in ink im not usually bothered by darkness but just then it was claustrophobic like some giant black hand pressing against me i felt nathaniel by the bed please turn on the bathroom light leave the door ajar he went back and did it one of the good things about nathaniel was he didnt question orders much it used to bug me now i counted on it sometimes he left the door open a crack just enough to let a slender finger of light fall into the room and slant along the bed nathaniel lifted the sheet and crawled into bed without a word but him crawling in meant i had to move over closer to jason i found the gun and moved it down a pillow with me but nathaniel didnt crowd me and there was still space between us when we all tucked in for the night not as much space as id have liked but still space in fact i was able to roll over onto my side without bumping anyone of course that wasnt how i slept at home at home nathaniel and the rest of the wereleopards cuddled into big piles id slept most of the last six months among them it was sadly getting to the point that when i slept alone i felt lonely nathaniel had rolled automatically onto his side his back to me waiting for me to close the distance between us hed already moved his hair to one side like a blanket that had to be moved out of the way leaving his back and part of his neck smooth and bare i lay there for a second or two then thought screw it i moved in against him pressing myself to the smooth warmth of his body my arm sliding around his waist he was just a few inches taller than me enough that i cuddled down just a little pressing my face into his back in the hollow behind his shoulder blade it was the way wed gone to sleep for a long time now i do feel left out jason said i sighed clutching nathaniel a little tighter do you promise not to try anything i promise to be good thats not what i asked he gave a small laugh youre better than you used to be at this game okay i promise not to try anything then you can get closer if you want to you know i do he said i could feel him moving across the bed towards us you also promised to be good you have no idea how good i can be he was very close when he said the last youre pushing it jason sorry but he didnt sound sorry he curled against my back his body spooning against me his knees bending into a near perfect line behind mine we were within an inch of being the same height which made spooning easy it also put certain parts of his anatomy up against my butt and it was hard not to notice that he was happy to be there not too long ago id have made him move but id spent months learning shapeshifter etiquette the men tried their best not to get erections and not to use them when they did the women tried to ignore the fact that they had them that was the rule it allowed everyone to pretend we were just a bunch of puppies sleeping in a nice friendly pile to acknowledge anything else meant the system fell apart i realized that it didnt bother me over the months id learned that it was just one of those involuntary things that happened nothing truly personal i think jason was disappointed that he didnt get more of a reaction from me when i didnt react at all he moved his hips just a fraction away from me but snuggled the rest of himself against me more tightly i was effectively sandwiched between them and it reminded me forcibly of waking up between caleb and micah not a comforting memory but the smell of nathaniels skin was familiar the vanilla scent of his hair where it edged my face and stretched under his body was comforting i drew the scent of him around me like a blanket pulled my body in as close to the warm curve of him as i could go and not come out the other side and clung i acknowledged in my head though never aloud that tonight i clung i held him like he was the last solid thing in the world the way id wanted to hold jeanclaude and couldnt jasons hand smoothed along my hip but id forced his hand up from around my waist when i tucked so tightly against nathaniel there was really nowhere else for it to go his hand was very still against my bare leg and there was a tension to him as if he was waiting for me to protest when i didnt he relaxed and even moved his entire body back against me hed managed to calm himself good for him honestly it was nice having jasons weight at my back normally i spooned nathaniel took the dominant position with my body protecting his my back bare to the room but i wasnt feeling particularly dominant i wanted someone to have my back and if it couldnt be jeanclaude or richard jason wasnt a bad choice for all his teasing he was my friend nathaniel fell asleep first he usually drifted off faster than i did somehow i knew that jason was still awake pressed against my back his hand on my thigh i could feel a tension in him as i began to drift off and strangely it was comforting jason literally had my back it meant i could sleep and between the three of us whatever came through the door we could probably handle it probably i was dreaming something confusing about bodies and running and a ringing noise that made the crowd run faster ringing noise i woke up enough to feel nathaniel move beside me he groped over the side of the bed and came up with my cell phone from my pile of clothes he handed the ringing phone to me its for you jason mumbled god what time is it i flipped the phone open and put it to my ear before anyone answered his question yeah its me i was only half awake anita yes who is this its rafael that made me sit up rafael was the wererat king their equivalent of an ulfric he was also richards ally im here whats up first my condolences i hear you may be nimirra in truth next full moon gee news does travel fast i said trying not to sound bitter but failing second i know the pack has one of your leopards and that you must try and win him back from them tonight you are allowed to bring allies with you and i would be honored if you would allow the wererats to accompany you i appreciate the gesture rafael you dont know how much i appreciate it but im not lupa anymore your treaty is with the pack and im not pack anymore true but you risked yourself once to save me from torture and possible death i told you then that the wererats would not forget what you had done for us what about your treaty with richard its with richard not the pack showing up at my back tonight is still a conflict of interests dont you think i dont think so i think it will make the point that if richard is no longer ulfric the wererats will not be the werewolves allies youll show up with me tonight to make it clear that your treaty is with richard and not the pack jason sat up in the bed yes rafael said clever you thank you so you dont like jacob either jason moved closer to me as if he could hear rafaels side of the conversation maybe he could no rafael said me either so i will meet you at your home tonight before we drive to the lupanar just you i made it a question oh no we will be there in force so the point is not lost on jacobs supporters i like the way you think i said i wish richard did rafael said have you tried to get him to execute jacob too i asked i knew you would understand both the problem and the needed solution anita oh i understand i just wish richard did yes rafael said yes jacob is not the man richard is but he has some qualities that i would wish on richard if i could me too ill meet you tonight at your house at full dark ill be there and rafael yes thanks no thanks are necessary the rats owe you a debt we pay our debts and it allows you to make a threat to jacob and his supporters without doing anything that could start a war i said as i said anita you understand things that richard does not until tonight until tonight i said he hung up i hung up flipping the phone closed jason was practically leaning over my shoulder did i just hear that rafael and the wererats are going with you tonight to the lupanar you going to tattle to richard i asked staring at his face from inches away his back touching my shoulder no my eyes widened unless richard specifically asks is rafael going to be there tonight as anitas ally then i dont have to answer and im not volunteering the information thats cutting your oath of obedience pretty close isnt it my loyalty is to richard and having the rats with you tonight will help richard not hurt him i nodded sometimes you have to keep things from richard to help him unfortunately jason said i handed the phone to nathaniel who put it back on the floor with my clothes i checked my watch it was ten oclock wed had a little over six hours of sleep time to start the day yippee it was still hours before i could expect jeanclaude to be awake i snuggled down into the covers on my back nathaniel rolled onto his side hand going across my stomach one leg entwined over my legs his second favorite sleeping position though one i often had to move him out of before i could go to sleep but i wasnt sleeping i was thinking so it was okay he rubbed his cheek against my shoulder and a small movement of his lower body pressed him against me he was hard and firm under the silky shorts it was morning he was male it was normal normally i could ignore it just one of those things that you pretended didnt happen but today today the feel of him pressed against me made things low in my body clench tight the need rode through my body like fire spilling through me over me inside me nathaniel went very still beside me jason was sitting up rubbing his bare arms what was that i tried not to move not to breathe to just be as still as nathaniel i tried to think of something besides the warmth of his body pressed against the length of mine tried not to feel the press of him hard and ready through the satin of the jogging shorts i grabbed the sheet and jerked it off of us in one violent movement i gazed down the length of his body of our bodies pressed together the shorts clung like a second skin to the back of him the ardeur rushed through me again like a new pulse id never felt before and my beast rose up through the depths with it it was as if they were tied together i hungered and my beast woke rolling inside me like a lazy cat stretching eyeing the mouse except what this cat wanted to do to the mouse was not only against the laws of nature but physically impossible the trouble was this mouse smelled of vanilla and fur and he was warm and full against me i wanted to roll him over on his back and tear off the shorts and see what i was feeling i wanted to lick down his chest down his stomach and the visual was so strong that i had to close my eyes against the sight of him lying there but sight wasnt my only problem the smell of his skin was suddenly overwhelming sweet and i had a desire to roll my body on top of his not for sex exactly but to paint his scent on my body to wear it like a dress anita it was jason whats happening i opened my eyes to find him bending over me propped on one elbow and the ardeur widened to include him it did not discriminate i touched his face ran my fingers down the edge of his cheek traced the fullness of his lower lip with my thumb he moved his mouth back just enough to speak jeanclaude said youd inherited his need his incubus i dont think i believed him my hand traced down his face his neck his chest until now he whispered my hand stopped over his heart it beat against my hand and i could suddenly feel my pulse in my palm beating against his skin as if my heart had spilled down my arm to cup against his body ask me why jeanclaude insisted i stay in here today i just looked at him i couldnt think couldnt speak i could feel his heart almost caress it his heart sped beating faster my heart sped to catch it until our hearts were beating together and it was hard to tell where one pulse stopped and the other began i could taste his heartbeat in my mouth as if it pulsed inside me already caressing the roof of my mouth as if i had already taken a bite of him i closed my eyes and tried to distance myself from the ebb and flow of his body his warmth his need jeanclaude was afraid youd try to feed on nathaniel im supposed to keep that from happening his voice was breathy i raised up and nathaniels arms curled around my waist pressing his face into my side i sat up beside jason with nathaniel like a tempting weight wrapped around my body my hand stayed on jasons chest cupping his heart he should have moved away but he didnt i could feel his desire feel the need in him it was a pure desire not for power or anything else just simply for me it wasnt love but it was purity of a sort he simply wanted me i stared into his blue eyes and there was no deceit no agenda jason didnt want to secure his power base or gain mystical energy he just wanted to have sex with me to hold me in his arms id always treated jason as lesser than a friend young and amusing not serious jeanclaudes ardeur let me see into his heart and i found it the most pure of any that id looked into in a long time i stared down at nathaniel where he lay clinging to me i knew his heart too he wanted me physically but more he wanted me to want him he wanted to belong to me in every way he longed for safety a home someone to take care of him and to take care of he saw in me all the things that hed lost over the years but he didnt really see me he saw an ideal of me that he wanted i ran my hand down his arm and he snuggled against me i looked back at jason and let my other hand drop away from him but it was like i pulled something out of him as it moved his heart still beat inside my body we didnt have to touch for that the fact that jason wanted me just for me with no ulterior motives made me want to reward him made me love him just a little it overrode the hunger stilled my beast helped me think get out both of you get out anita is that you go jason take him with you and go i dont want to go nathaniel said i grabbed a handful of that thick hair and raised him to his knees with it i expected to see fear in his eyes or betrayal but what i saw was eagerness i used his hair as a handle and drew him to me until our faces almost touched i felt his heart thudding the thrill through his body as i drew him into me nathaniel would never tell me no if someone cant tell you no its rape or something like it the ardeur poured through me taking my breath in a long shuddering line i wanted to kiss nathaniel to fill his mouth with my tongue and i knew if i did it would be too late my voice came out strangled you will go when i tell you to go now get out i released my hold on him so suddenly that he fell back against the bed jason was on the other side of the bed pulling nathaniel away from me pushing him towards the door watching them go made me want to cry or scream they were perfect for feeding the room was thick with mutual desire and i was sending them away i could still feel their heartbeats like candy in my mouth like a double echo of my own heart i covered my eyes with my hands and screamed wordless painfilled it was as if the hunger finally realized that i was truly going to let them go it raged through me tearing one ragged scream from my mouth after another as fast as i could draw breath i lay on the bed in the silk sheets writhing screaming i had a sudden memory and it wasnt mine of this need denied locked away in the dark where no hand could touch you where no skin could melt into yours i felt the faintest edge of jeanclaudes madness after that particular punishment hed healed but the memory was still raw hands on me holding me down i opened my eyes to find nathaniel and jason holding me down they each had a hand on one wrist and one leg they could bench press small elephants but as my body writhed against the bed i raised them up made them struggle to hold me anita youre hurting yourself jason said i looked down my body and found bloody scratches on my arms and legs i had to have done it but i didnt remember doing it the sight of those bloody scratches calmed me made me lie still under their hands im going to get something to tie you down with just until jeanclaude rises jason said i nodded afraid to speak afraid of what id say he told nathaniel to hold me but the only way one person could do that was to hold my wrists while pressing against me with his lower body it wasnt perfect control but it kept me from hurting myself nathaniels hair fell around our bodies with a dry rushing sound until i saw the world through a curtain of his hair the scent of him was like some warm pressure between his upraised chest and mine i could smell the fresh scent of blood too and my beast wanted to lick the wounds wanted to feed on my own skin or better yet open wounds on nathaniel and feed off of him just the thought tightened my body made me writhe underneath him until id freed my legs and he slid against me only our clothing separating us he made a small sound halfprotest halfsomething else i raised my wrists off the bed pushing against his grip on me i felt his arms strain against me forcing me back against the bed it shouldnt have been a struggle for him to hold me here like this i was gaining other things besides hunger through the marks or the beast nathaniel was still stronger than i was i could feel that but there are things besides strength that count when youre struggling i raised my arms from the bed again only a few inches and he forced me down again but when i had enough room i rotated my right wrist against his thumb and my hand was free i raised up enough to kiss his chest and he went very still above me i knew in that instant that he wouldnt try and regain control of my arm i bit him gently and his breath went out in a soft sharp sound i licked my way up his chest with him still holding my left arm his lower body still pinning mine i ran my tongue over his nipple and felt his breathing quicken i locked my mouth around his nipple and bit into the skin the flesh underneath he shuddered above me his body jerking enough that i had to be careful not to break the skin but i held on as he moaned above me and when i drew back i saw that i had left a near perfect imprint of my teeth behind i lay back against the bed and stared at the bite mark on his chest with his nipple in the center of it and a thrill went through me a wave of pleasure at the sight of it and a feeling of possession id marked him i drew my left wrist out of his hand and he didnt fight me he stayed propped above me on his arms his hips pressed against me his hair in a cascade around us he stared down at me and his face was raw with need i didnt need anything else to tell me how much he wanted me to finish what id begun i raised up enough to kiss him and his lips trembled against mine the kiss was long and full and a sound came low in his throat and he suddenly collapsed against me his full body weight pinning me to the bed our mouths our arms our bodies locked together in a warm vanillascented nest of his hair like being rolled in warm satin nathaniel kissed me as if he would climb inside me through my mouth and i opened for him let him explore me taste me touch me it wasnt his hand underneath my top kneading my breast that brought me to my senses it was my hands down the back of his shorts cupping the smooth curve of his buttocks it helped me swim back into control to fight down the desire the hunger where the hell was jason i stopped kissing nathaniel stopped touching him while his hands his mouth explored my body his need was so strong so strong i could not leave the bed i could not walk away i was not that strong nathaniel stop his mouth was on my breast through the satin of the top he didnt seem to hear me nathaniel stop i grabbed a handful of his hair and pulled him away from me the front of the top was wet where his mouth had been his eyes didnt seem to focus on me it was as if he didnt see me at all nathaniel can you hear me he finally nodded yes anyone else would have protested being stopped but he simply looked at me eyes beginning to focus there was no resentment on his face no anger he simply did what i told him to do and waited for me to say more i didnt understand nathaniel even knowing his hearts desires gave me no real understanding of him we were too different but today that difference might help us i would not could not have sex with nathaniel but i couldnt stop completely either i had to feed i had to sink my teeth into his flesh had to bathe in his lust had to get off me he rolled onto his back gazing up at me lying in a pool of his hair like a shining auburn frame around his body i wanted to see all of him framed against his hair and all i had to do was drag his shorts down the curve of his hips the image was so strong i had to close my eyes take deep breaths the need to touch him lashed through me almost painful as if the ardeur could force me to do it and maybe it could but i would control how i touched him i would control at least that much i opened my eyes and found him gazing up at me with those impossible lilac eyes roll over onto your stomach i said my voice hoarse he rolled over without a single question and i was reminded how absolutely helpless he was with a dominant he would do what he was told whatever he was told it helped steady me to know that i had to be in charge i had to have some control because he would have none i picked up handfuls of that thick hair and pushed it to one side like a piled beast i bared his back in a clean smooth line he turned his head to the side and gazed at me through the film of his hair there was no fear in him only a vast patience an eagerness and need i rose on all fours over him straddling his body and lowered my mouth to his skin i licked across his shoulders but it wasnt enough i bit him gently and he made a small movement underneath me i bit harder and a tiny sound escaped his lips i bit him hard enough that i felt his flesh fill my mouth felt the grip of him the meat of him i wanted to tear at his flesh to literally feed from him the desire was almost overwhelming i collapsed on top of him my cheek against his back until i could control myself but the scent of his flesh the smoothness of it under my cheek the rise and fall of his breathing under my body it was too much i would not eat him literally but i had to feed i bit the flesh of his back drew him into my mouth and this time i did not stop until i tasted the sweet metallic taste of blood it was the beast that wanted to finish blood was not enough but i raised from the wound and moved on i marked nathaniels back with near perfect imprints of my teeth and more and more of them held blood it was as if the longer i did it the harder it was to control the scent of fresh blood tightened my body filled me with heat and longings that had to do more with food than sex i sat straddling his body looking down at his back at my handiwork blood ran in tiny drops from some of the wounds but mostly it looked like tiny mouths pressed into his flesh and it wasnt enough i slid my hands down the back of his shorts drawing my nails delicately along his flesh he writhed under the touch started to rise from the bed and i pushed him back down no no i said and he went still under my hands i slid his shorts down his body until he lay nude underneath me i spread his legs so i could kneel between them lowered my mouth to that smooth untouched skin and marked him there was more flesh to hold in my mouth here tight but more plentiful i filled my mouth with him drew blood in red hot circles until i heard him making small helpless noises and i knew they werent pain noises i rose on my knees above him gazed down at the wounds id laid on his body and i wanted more i slid my satin top off and wiggled out of the shorts i laid my naked body on his and rolled along his back his buttocks rubbing the blood from the wounds on my body nathaniel was saying please please please over and over under his breath his need was like a pressing weight a thick cloud that hovered over us it was chokingly close so overwhelming he wanted this so badly this not sex this hed waited so very long for me to dominate him to take him micah had wanted me but his had been the want of a relative stranger a man wanting an attractive and powerful mate but with nathaniel it was different his desire had built over years over a thousand intimacies a thousand denials it had built until it was a great weight in his body in his mind it was a thing that burdened him down filled him up and he could not be free of it i understood why jeanclaude had said that we would feed off those we were already attracted to there was so much more to feed from with nathaniel our history together made it not just a feeding but a feast i worked my way back down his body biting along his flesh not drawing blood now i lay with my cheek pressed against the curve of his buttocks fighting with myself not to reach my hand around to the front of him fighting the growing need i would not touch him not like that when i could trust myself i spread his legs as far as they would go and bit down marking areas untouched getting ever closer until i could see him pressed between his body and the bed i wanted to lick him there roll his testicles in my mouth but i didnt trust myself id laid his back and buttocks bloody i didnt trust myself couldnt guarantee what i would do i moved my mouth back without touching him and the pressure of his lust and mine rode like summer lightning almost there almost there i ran my tongue on the small ridge of skin just in back of his testicles and nathaniel cried out i sucked the skin drew it into my mouth in a long line working it with tongue and teeth and the pressure broke over us like a storm released in one long thunderous burst he called my name and i raked his thighs with my nails and fought with two different hungers not to bite that delicate bit of skin away from his body when it was over i drew back from him just enough to see that i hadnt marked him not even the mark of my teeth i lay on the bed between his legs one arm on his thigh the other folded beneath me listening to the pounding of my heart he lay quiet except for his still frantic breathing a sound raised me up to gaze over nathaniels leg propping myself up on the smooth wounded flesh of his butt jason was standing in the middle of the room with what looked like shackles in his arms his eyes were wide his own breathing a little too fast i should have been embarrassed but the ardeur was sated and my beast lay curled inside me like a contented cat i was too wellpleased with myself to be embarrassed how long have you been watching even my voice sounded lazy content he had to clear his throat twice before he could say long enough i climbed back up nathaniels body until i was pressed against the length of him i laid my cheek against his face and whispered are you alright yes it was a whisper i didnt hurt you it was wonderful oh god it was better than id imagined it i raised up stroking his hair turning back to look at jason still standing in the middle of the floor why didnt you try and stop me jeanclaude was afraid youd tear out nathaniels throat or something messy like that jasons voice was returning to normal only the slightest edge of uncertainty in it but i watched you every time i thought id have to intervene you drew back every time i thought you were going to lose control you didnt you rode the hunger you tamed it i felt jeanclaude waken felt him take his first breath of the day he sensed me too felt me still lying naked on nathaniels body smelled the scent of fresh blood felt that i had fed and fed well i felt him coming towards me hurrying towards me attracted to the scent of blood and warm flesh and sex and me jeanclaudes coming jason said i know i said jason walked to the foot of the bed and gazed down at us at me his eyes lingered on me most of my body was hidden beside nathaniel but he looked at what was revealed if i hadnt had that glimpse into his heart id have been mad or told him to stop but i didnt know what to say now he wanted me just me for me not forever but just for a night a day a week just for sometimes jasons feelings for me might be the most uncomplicated of all the men in my life uncomplicated had its attractions even with the ardeur gone the moment i thought gone i realized that wasnt true the hunger was just below the surface like something simmering in a pot you have to keep the heat low or it boils over id had enough heat for one day jason and i looked at each other i dont know what we would have said but just then the door opened it was asher his room was closer than the coffin room but i hadnt expected him his golden hair lay in perfect waves around the shoulders of his robe vampires didnt move in their sleep so no morning hair problems the robe was a rich deep brown open over matching pajama bottoms his chest was bare and the robe flared around him like a cape as he strode into the room he came to stand beside the bed but his gaze went to nathaniels body to the blood i felt he raised his eyes to my face and i peered at him over nathaniels body i felt the call i didnt call you i said the power did he dropped to his knees beside the bed you did this i nodded he reached out towards me as if to touch my face then jerked back it was like hed touched something in the air in front of me that had startled him he raised his hand to his face and sniffed it then licked it as though there was something there to taste may i taste your pomme de sang it was french for apple of blood and it was a nickname for a person that was a regular donor to a particular vampire part of me wanted to argue with the phrase but i had fed off of nathaniel even tasted his blood to demand a different phrase was splitting hairs a little too finely for my conscience wed call a spade a spade define taste i said lick the wounds the suggestion should have bothered me but it didnt i lowered my face enough to see nathaniels eyes is it okay with you nathaniel he nodded face still pressed to the bed help yourself asher lowered his mouth to nathaniels back to a wound just above his waist he kept those ice blue eyes rolled up towards me the way you would watch someone on a judo mat afraid that if you look away theyll hurt you it reminded me of watching lions drink from pools with their eyes rolled up watching for danger while they drank nathaniel made a small sound as asher licked the wound it had stopped bleeding but as the vampire traced the wound with his tongue i saw blood well to the surface again vampires have an anticoagulant in their saliva but id never seen its use demonstrated quite so well before it made me wonder i curled closer to nathaniels body one leg entwining over his i didnt ask permission because he was mine and i knew him well enough to know he would not only not mind but he would welcome it i lowered my mouth to another of the wounds that had nearly stopped bleeding and licked there was the sweet copper taste of blood and the thick rich taste of his skin and a taste of meat as if i could tell what he would taste like if i ate him one bite at a time the beast flared over my skin like something trembling and alive nathaniels beast responded to it flaring rolling as if i could see it just below his skin just below his ribs as if i could feel where it lay in the heart of his body in that moment i knew i could call his beast could coax him to change when the moon was far from full i was his nimirra and that meant so much more than merely being his dominant ashers eyes had drowned in pale blue fire so he looked blind as he licked at the wound he gazed into my face directly across nathaniels body our eyes at the same level as we tasted the wounds my wound bled a little bit more but not as much as ashers did i was not truly a blood drinker i fed on other things and staring across nathaniels body feeling his breathing quicken as the two of us touched him i knew that those other things were here for the taking ashers hand slid over nathaniels body until he touched my thigh where it curved over nathaniels leg the moment he touched me something rushed between us it was as if the ardeur recognized him as if it had touched him before it made me raise up from the wound drew me back into myself a little something on my face made asher take his hand back jeanclaude entered then he was wearing a black robe with black fur at collar lapel and sleeves his black hair melted into the fur so you couldnt tell where one blackness stopped and the other began the last time id seen him in the robe id told him there better be something under the robe besides skin now i hoped there wasnt seeing him brought the ardeur boiling over me again it made me catch my breath things lower than my stomach clenching tight enough to draw a sound from my throat she holds your incubus asher said and his voice tore my gaze from jeanclaude to him oui jeanclaude glided around the room to the opposite side of the bed from where asher knelt she tastes of you and of belle morte oui jeanclaude said he walked around the bed to the other side and i rolled away from nathaniel so i could see jeanclaude move the movement exposed the front of my body and i had enough of myself left to roll onto my stomach jason said awww i ignored him jeanclaude lifted the robe so he could crawl onto the bed the movement revealed a long pale line of skin from his shoulders to his stomach the glimpse of that white flesh caught between the blackness of the fur made me want to untie the sash and expose his entire body but i stayed where i was halfleaning against nathaniel because i was afraid to move afraid to go to jeanclaude because i didnt trust myself there was just enough of me left not to want to make love to jeanclaude in front of the other men but it was a razorthin part something that glittered in the darkness but didnt quite believe itself anymore the hunger recognizes asher is it because its yours or because its hers i asked hers he asked belle morte i do not know he said and he was close enough now that the edge of the robe brushed my body i could see a thin line of pale skin below the waist where the robe gaped a thin thin line of white but it was enough to let me know that there was nothing under the robe but jeanclaude i wanted to open the robe to see all of him i said it without thinking as if i hadnt meant to say it out loud open the robe it startled me as if i didnt know my own voice i closed my eyes tried to think it is alright ma petite once taken blood fills your stomach but lust fur brushed in a teasing line down my arm lust is always there never vanquished completely never satisfied he brushed the edge of his furred cuff down my waist my hip my thigh my calf when he brushed it along my foot he started back up but this time on the back of my body so that the teasing brush touched my buttocks my back my shoulder i lay wordless breathless under his touch when he curved the fur around my face i grabbed the edge of the robe and held him away from me make everyone leave my voice was barely above a whisper i can do nothing until i have fed ma petite you know that i know blood pressure i was having a hard time thinking then do it but hurry he said softly i nodded he drew his sleeve out of my grip and looked down the bed to jason who was still standing there watching the show come pomme de sang come and enjoy the rewards of your sacrifice the phrase was oddly formal and id never heard it put that way before i expected jason to go around the bed to the same side as jeanclaude but he didnt he rolled over the foot of the bed in a movement so liquid it was like watching water flow as if his skin barely contained some elemental energy that had nothing to do with the flesh and bone body i was seeing he ended on his knees on the opposite side from jeanclaude i could taste the movement of his body in my mouth not just his heart but as if every throb and beat of him was trying to slide over my tongue and down my throat i could feel his eagerness not for me but for what jeanclaude had to offer he came eagerly to the vampire in that breathless rush that you usually save for sex they mirrored each other both on their knees gazing at each other across my body i will leave you alone with your pommes de sang and each other asher was standing next to the bed belting the sash at his waist securing the robe around him he stood very straight with that perfect posture that all the old nobles seemed to have but still he huddled inside the robe i rolled onto my stomach gazing at him trying to read his face his body the discomfort i could read and even pain and it must have shown on my face because asher dropped his gaze that wonderful golden hair sliding over the scarred side of his face so that when he looked up you could see nothing but the perfect half of him that one iceblue eye i had a sudden memory of lying in a different bed in a huge dark room surrounded by dozens of candles until the shadows moved and rippled with every small breath of air every movement of a pale arm i lay in that trembling golden darkness in the embrace of a pale darkhaired woman i gazed up at her and her face was like something carved of alabaster with lips red and perfect hair like the darkness of night made into furred silk falling around her nude perfection like a veil her eyes were pale brown like dark honey i knew it was belle morte as if id always known her face the door opened and asher entered wearing a robe more elaborate heavier than the one he wore now but still he huddled in it held it around his body afraid i saw the scars on his face fresh raw and it was painful my chest went tight with the sight of his ruin i went to my knees reaching out to him moving a body that id never been inside jeanclaude reaching out to asher all those centuries ago but she lay there nude and perfect showing every curve every secret place to the candlelight and turned him away i couldnt remember the words she used only the look on her face the utter arrogance the distaste the look on ashers face as he turned from her to jeanclaude to me the look of pain and he let that glorious hair fall forward hiding his face and it was the first time wed seen him do that hide from us i felt her hands on our body as she turned back to us as if asher were no longer there but we remembered the look on his face the line of his body as he left that room i blinked and was back in jeanclaudes bedroom watching asher in his brown silk robe walking towards the door and the line of his shoulders the way he held himself made my chest tight closed my throat made my eyes hot with things unsaid and unshed dont go i heard myself say it and i glanced up at jeanclaude his face was careful unreadable but for just a moment i saw his eyes and the pain i was feeling was only an echo of what filled his eyes asher stopped at the door and turned his hair falling over his face the robe covering everything else he said nothing just looked back at me at us i repeated dont go asher dont go why not he asked his voice as careful and neutral as he could make it i couldnt tell him about the shared memory it would sound like pity and it wasnt that not exactly i couldnt think of a good lie but this wasnt really the time for lies anyway only truth would heal this i cant stand to watch you walk away like this he moved his gaze from me to jeanclaude and there was anger in him now you had no right to share that memory with her i do not choose what ma petiteknows and what she does not very well asher said now you know how she cast me out of her bed how she cast me out of his bed that was your choice jeanclaude said how could you bear to touch me i couldnt bear to touch me he stayed near the door with his head turned to one side so all you could see was a wave of golden hair his voice held bitterness the way it could sometimes hold joy a bitterness that was hard to swallow like choking on broken glass ashers voice and laugh werent as good as jeanclaudes but he seemed better at sharing sorrow and regret than jeanclaude why i asked already knowing the answer why what why did she cast you out jeanclaude moved beside me and i realized two things one he was shielding from me from all of us so i couldnt sense him and two his body movement alone let me know he wasnt happy asher grabbed his hair forced it back from his face showed the scars to the light this this our mistress was a collector of beauty and i am no longer beautiful it pained her visibly to see me you are beautiful asher that she couldnt see that isnt your fault he let his hair fall back it slid over the scars hiding them he had almost stopped doing that when he was here in the circus id forgotten how when he first arrived in st louis he had automatically hidden whenever you looked directly at him he had used every shadow every fall of light to hide the scars and highlight the beauty that remained untouched he had stopped doing that around me it hurt my heart to see him hide i tried to keep the sheet over me as i crawled towards the edge of the bed but it was all tangled and trapped under jasons and jeanclaudes weight screw it everyone here had seen the show i wanted to wipe that hurt look from ashers face more than i wanted to be modest jason moved out of my way without uttering a single teasing comment unheard of i crawled off the bed and walked towards asher and other memories spilled over me like cards thrown in the air how many times had he watched jeanclaude and belle morte and julianna and so many others walk towards him nude and eager even jeanclaude had failed him there had been that shadow in his eyes formed of guilt guilt at failing to save julianna failing to save asher but asher had assumed it was rejection and that jeanclaude touched him only out of pity it hadnt been pity i had the memory of it it had been pain they had become constant reminders of how each had failed the other a constant reminder of the woman theyd both loved and lost until the pain was all they had left asher had turned it into hate and jeanclaude had simply turned away i walked through the memories like moving through cobwebs things that brushed me clung to me but did not stop me his hands were behind his back his body leaning against the door pinning them and i knew why through jeanclaudes gift i knew that asher wanted to touch me and didnt trust himself enough to have his hands out in front of him but it wasnt me he wanted to touch in a way he was like nathaniel he saw in me what he needed to see not exactly what was there i touched his hair where it hid his face he flinched i swept the hair back from his face standing on tiptoe to reach him putting one hand lightly on his chest for balance he moved away from me taking a step into the room i grabbed his robe but he stayed turned away as the robe pulled back from the perfect half of his chest look at me asher please he stayed turned away and i finally had to walk those few steps to him i was short enough that standing right in front of him i could look up underneath the hair into his face he turned away again and i stretched up putting a hand on either side of his face turning him to look at me it put my body against his just for balance and i felt the reluctance in his body the need to move away but he stayed immobile under my touch he kept his hands behind his back as if id tied them there the skin under one hand was so smooth the other so rough he could have fought me but he didnt he let me turn his face to me i wrapped my hands in the thickness of his golden hair holding it back from his face i stared into his upturned face the eyes that impossible pale blue were unreal like the eyes of a husky his lips were still full and kissable his nose still a perfect profile even the scars that started far on the right side of his face were just another part of asher just another piece of him that i loved id always assumed that any emotions i felt for asher were from jeanclaudes memories of him when they were lovers companions for over twenty years but staring at him now i realized that that was only part of it i held memories of his body smooth and perfect but that wasnt what i thought of when i thought of asher i pictured him as he was now and i still loved him it wasnt the way i felt about jeanclaude or richard but it was real and it was mine maybe it wouldnt have existed if i hadnt had jeanclaudes memories and emotions to build on but whatever the foundation i had feelings for asher that were all mine no one elses i realized with something like a shock that it wasnt just everyone elses heart i could see into i turned and looked back at jeanclaude tried to ask with my eyes what i was thinking to know anothers heart you must first know your own ma petite his voice was soft no reproach i turned back to asher and there was something in his eyes half wonderment half pain as if he expected me to hurt him in some way he was probably right but if so i wouldnt mean to do it sometimes the greatest wounds are the ones we try the hardest not to inflict i let what i was feeling fill my eyes my face it was the only gift i had to give him his expression softened and what i saw in those lovely eyes was at the same time wonderful and painful he dropped to his knees one tear trailing down his smooth cheek the look on his face was full of so many things the look in your eyes heals a part of my heart ma cherie and wounds another love is such a bitch i said he laughed and hugged me around the waist the roughness of his right cheek pressed into my belly and i valued that more than anything else he could have done i stroked his hair and held him against me i looked across the room to jeanclaude and the look on his face was drowning deep a longing so immense that there were no words to hold it he wanted asher and me he wanted what he had had so many centuries ago hed once told asher that hed once almost been happy and that had been when he was in ashers and juliannas arms before she died and asher was saved but no longer belle mortes perfect golden boy jeanclaude had been forced to take asher back to the vampire council to have him healed jeanclaude had traded a hundred years of his own freedom to the council for the favor of them saving ashers life then jeanclaude had fled and asher had stayed behind blaming jeanclaude for juliannas death and for his ruin jeanclaude had gone from being in love and being loved by two people to losing one lover and having the other one hate him we gazed at each other the look in jeanclaudes eyes was so raw like a fresh wound that still bled he wanted to secure his power base with the triumvirate he did want that needed it but there were other things that he wanted almost needed and one of those was hugging my waist pressing his face to my stomach jeanclaude lowered his eyes as if he couldnt control what was in them he was the master of blank careful expression the fact that what he felt was too strong to hide said more than anything else he couldnt shield his emotions right now they were too strong they shattered all his careful control and a part of me was glad in that moment i wanted to give him what he most desired i wanted to do it because i loved him but it was more than that i suddenly realized that with richard gone from our bed other things were suddenly possible i turned back to asher gazing down on the top of his head and knew that to be held in the circle of both our arms would heal something inside him that might never heal any other way the ardeur flared through me hot so hot as if my skin must feel feverish asher drew back from me letting his arms drop slowly to his sides he gazed up at me and the look in his eyes was enough i knew he felt the hunger too it feels hot i said always before your power has felt cool or cold even its richards beast that holds the heat lust is warm ma petite even among the coldblooded i turned towards the bed and was suddenly very aware that i was nude i was really going to have to get a robe it wasnt jeanclaudes gaze that made me look away it was nathaniel and jason everyone in this room responded to me in different ways for very different reasons but it was all fodder for this need inside me asher made some small movement that drew my attention back to him i started to reach for him to push his robe from his shoulders to watch it fall to the floor i hugged my arms to me as if i was cold but i wasnt cold it was my turn not to trust where my hands were the temptation was so thick every where i looked that there seemed no place to walk in safety i felt trapped trapped not in the room but in the desire when i was sure i could talk without sounding as confused as i felt i asked is this thing permanent or will it go away when we all adjust to the marks being married i do not know ma petite i wish i could tell you something more certain if you were truly of my get truly vampire then i would say yes it is permanent but you are my human servant you have manifested powers in the past and some have come and gone he raised his hands there is no way to be sure is it always like this never satisfied never finished no you can sate yourself but it takes much to do it usually one must be content with enough to keep the desire from overwhelming you and you havent fed like this in months because you thought i would disapprove years and yes i stared at him across the room with asher still kneeling in front of me id always thought of jeanclaude as the weakerwilled of the three of us richard him and me now i stood there afraid to move afraid not to move wanting to do things that were not me not mine not even jeanclaudes id known that the lycanthropes spoke of their animal half as something separate from them their beast but id never understood that some of the vampires powers were the same way desires hungers so strong and overwhelming that they were like separate beings trapped inside your head your body your blood asher made a small movement and i turned to him my hand reached out to stroke his hair before id turned completely to face him as if my body had been moving without my eyes or my brain his hair was thicker textured more like mine not the babyfine curls of jeanclaude or jason or the velvet silk of nathaniel i bundled my hands into ashers hair as if id memorize the feel of it somewhere between mine and richards somewhere in the middle but not warm like richards was to the touch asher hadnt fed today and he had no warmth to give his skin was cool under my fingertips as i traced his cheek i spoke without looking at jeanclaude how have you stood it how could you fight the need all this time you are a fledgling ma petite your control will never be weaker than now i have had centuries to practice my control i made myself stop petting asher but he took my hand as i moved it back and laid a gentle kiss on my knuckles even that small touch made me catch my breath my voice came out weak so you can go without feeding the desire no ma petite i turned and stared at him and asher rubbed his thumb in small circles on my hand i remembered that small touch as precious a habit he had no matter which of us he held hands with you said you hadnt fed like this i have had no sex nor touched anyone in such a complete manner as you have done with nathaniel but i must feed the desire just as i must take blood what happens if you dont you remember what happened to sabin when he stopped taking human blood i nodded ashers thumb continued its small circle on my hand and it made things low in my body tighten sabin started to rot while he was still alive i stared into jeanclaudes perfect face is that what would happen to you he sat back on the bed in his black robe jason had moved against the headboard as if watching a show and nathaniel still lay on his stomach where id left him watching us with pale eyes there was a vampire of belles lineage who renounced the lust he took only animals as well and i believe would have rotted as sabin did but he did not have the time he began to age in a matter of days when he was a wizened thing belle had him killed but you havent aged what have you been doing it wasnt accusatory i simply wanted to know because i could feel asher on the end of my hand like something huge and like something i couldnt live without id wanted nathaniel id wanted jason id wanted micah but not like this i think it was jeanclaudes feelings that made this so much more it is possible to feed from a distance without touching jeanclaude said thats why a strip club was your first business you were feeding off the lust oui ma petite teach me to feed from a distance even as i said distance asher drew my hand to his cheek and rubbed against it like a cat i had to close my eyes for a second but i didnt tell him to stop feeding from a distance is a poor substitute for a true feeding i opened my eyes and stared at him across the room and now i could feel him i could feel his need for blood sex love and the touch of our flesh against his he wrapped his arms around his body as if he were cold or didnt trust himself not to leave the bed and come to us teach me anyway i said i cannot not this soon in a few nights i will instruct you but your control is not complete enough yet i started to say try me but asher drew my finger into his mouth in one long wet line and i suddenly couldnt think come to bed ma petite jeanclaude said if you feed here there is a chance you may be sated enough that you will not press our sostubborn richard the thought was enough to dim the desire for a moment or two i drew my hand away from asher and he didnt protest the sheer horror of what id be like around richard with this inside me helped me think being around him normally made me want sex but now my god ill be lucky if i dont just strip down and do him in the lupanar i stared at jeanclaude what do i do i say again ma petite if you feed now off of such rich fare you may be too full to need to feed again so soon it is all i can offer you for tonight you could simply delay the meeting for a few nights i shook my head theyll kill gregory i have to get him out tonight then come and feed define feed drink their lust he said i looked at jason and nathaniel and they werent even trying for neutral the looks on their faces brought heat in a rush up my face i shook my head you do not have to have intercourse to feed from them as you have discovered aww jason said but the look on his face didnt match the light teasing of his voice they were responding to my need the way id responded for so long to jeanclaudes drawn like a moth to a flame you just couldnt help wanting to touch it even when you knew it would burn asher stood i will leave you alone but with permission i would feed on nathaniel as my pomme de sang for the day no i said his eyes widened just a touch face going neutral eyes empty and cool as a spring sky i felt him draw away from me as you wish he turned for the door i grabbed his hand slid my fingers between his come to bed asher id thought his face was as blank and careful as it could get i was wrong his voice held nothing when he asked what do you mean i cant give you back what you had i cant even give you i stopped and tried again but i can let you feed together again how if nathaniel says its okay you can take blood from him and jeanclaude will take blood from jason you can feed together do you know how intimate a thing it is to feed together on your pomme de sang a pomme de sang is not a casual feeding it is intimate to be shared only with intimate companions i entwined my fingers around his hand i know i took a step towards the bed drawing him with me let us feed on your lust asher as in days of old asher stared past me at jeanclaude the last time two fed from my desire it was belle and you i remember jeanclaude said softly he held his hand out to asher from across the room and i was reminded of him reaching for asher all those centuries ago let it be again as it was before but better this time anita loves you as you are now not as some ideal thing like a butterfly on a pin to be tossed aside if a wing falls away come to us asher come to us both asher smiled then took a step to be beside me he offered me his arm in a very oldfashioned gesture i wanted to take his arm to have an excuse to rub my body against his as we walked and that was why i asked how about the use of your robe as well as your hand he gave a low and perfect bow so low that his hair almost swept the floor that you had to prompt me to offer you my robe proves i am not a gentleman he slipped it off as he stood and held it for me like a coat asher is six feet so the sleeves hung over my hands and the hem pooled around my feet i pushed the sleeves up and got the sash tied but the only thing to do for the length was just to bundle it in one hand like you would an overly long dress but it covered almost every inch of me and i felt better for it the sweet scent of ashers cologne clung to the robe and that soft masculine scent made me turn back to him made my eyes seek him out seeing asher with no shirt on didnt make me feel better i had the urge to caress his bare skin to lick the scars i never remembered being this orally fixated before and wondered if it was the beast talking or the vampire but to ask the question would be to admit the desire and i didnt want to know that badly i laid my hand in ashers partially because he was holding his hand out to me and partially because even that small touch was satisfying i wanted to touch him wanted to wrap myself around him and answer that question that jeanclaude was so desperate to answer was all this beauty and heat ruined was asher unable to function as a man now i closed my eyes as he led me forward because the visuals were just too strong through jeanclaude i knew exactly what asher had looked like nude before the scars i held memories of his body bathed in firelight as he lay rampant on a rug in a room in a country that i had never seen i knew the play of moonlight on his back as i touched him i tripped on the hem of the robe and he had to catch me to keep me from falling i was suddenly pressed against his chest with the feel of his arms solid against my back my face was suddenly uptilted as if i were waiting for a kiss and there was one of those moments when you become aware of each other painfully and suddenly aware of the possibilities of the next few seconds he picked me up in his arms carrying me easily smoothly forward id have told him to put me down but my heart had filled my throat and i couldnt speak around it asher strode to the bed and laid me on it leaning over nathaniels nude body to do so i lay on my back and felt movement from every direction jeanclaude crawled up beside me and jason moved down beside him from the head of the bed nathaniel rolled over until we were lying beside each other with him on his side his eyes told me nothing except he would not say no but i asked anyway do you want asher to feed from you oh yes nathaniel said and there was something in his voice that i rarely heard surety in this moment he knew what he wanted there was no doubt in him and the strength of his desire made him stronger asher slid in against nathaniels back so that their bodies spooned together i turned in time to see jeanclaude mirror the movement with jason jason reached out touched my arm and it was like a door had been burst open i thought id felt desire before this but it had been a dim echo it roared over me like something huge and burning except this fire did not burn it fed me energy as if i were not the wood on which it fed but i was the flame i was the thing that fed and grew and consumed i found jasons mouth and kissed him kissed him with lips and tongue and teeth biting at his lips pulling him into my mouth and his body was suddenly pressed against mine his arms pinning me to him and nathaniel slid in behind my back i was pinned between them and i didnt care my leg slid over jasons hip my leg touching jeanclaude on the other side of him jason was suddenly pressed between my legs with only the silk of his shorts between us it should have been enough to stop me but it wasnt i needed him nathaniel raised my hair bit gently at the back of my neck and a sound drew from my throat the two of them fell on me hands mouths bodies like they were fire to my wood but this wood drew them in drank them almost jason pushed against me and the shorts were baggy enough the silk thin enough that he entered me the barest of touches but it was enough to bring me up for air to make me draw back from him he drew back enough to whisper sorry my voice sounded as breathless as his when i said im not on birth control everyone froze jeanclaude peered over jasons shoulder what did you say ma petite i stopped taking the pill six months ago ive only been on it for two weeks no guarantee for another two to four weeks you made love to the nimirraj hes been fixed asher said she did what jeanclaude looked across the bed at him her hunger woke for the first time with the new nimirraj you have not met him you have asher said oui jason was looking at me and i had to put a hand over his eyes close them and the embarrassment helped but the ardeur only withdrew momentarily like a wave pulling back from the shore i could feel it rushing towards us again jeanclaude was right every time i said no the next time was harder to deny jeanclaude rolled off the bed and i heard a drawer open he came back into sight with foilwrapped packages and wordlessly handed them to jason and nathaniel that did it i crawled out from between them to huddle against the headboard no no no you said no intercourse i said that you do not need intercourse to feed no oh so no i tucked the robe around my legs and covered everything i could which was pretty much all of me we are not planning on them having intercourse with you ma petite but i have both fed on desire and been fed off of by belle morte there comes a time in the feeding where you lose yourself and cannot always think clearly i do not want regrets if we get carried away i am not going to have sex with nathaniel or jason keep this up and you wont even be on the list i would rather have you angry with me and not in my bed than accidentally pregnant by one of them i think i can keep from fucking them i sounded angry but it wasnt anger that i felt it was a seed of doubt that hesitation made the anger worse i always hid behind anger when i could and before this morning you would have sworn even more strongly that you would not fuck a strange man you had just met the blush was so hot it almost hurt i didnt mean to that sounded weak even to me i couldnt you could not control yourself ma petite i know but if you lose control again would you not rather be safe i shook my head if i cant control myself better than this were not going to do this and if you do not feed from the lust in this room how will you go into the lupanar tonight how will you see your wereleopard lover tonight when he accompanies you to the lupanar without losing your precious control how will you stand this close to our richard and not offer yourself to him ma petite you have had sex with a stranger he is her nimirraj nathaniel said they are meant to be a mated pair pretty to think so jeanclaude said but i have been where ma petiteis right now i have felt the hunger for centuries and i tell you that you will not be able to go among the shapeshifters tonight unless you are sated i ask again can you delay this meeting for a few nights i might be able to delay it for a night i said he shook his head no ma petite one night will not suffice you are drawn to richard and now to the nimirraj i think you will be unable to think around them unless you have fed your wereleopards life is at stake can you afford to be that distracted can you bear the thought of being that out of control in a public setting among potential enemies damn you i said he nodded yes perhaps but is anything i have said untrue no i shook my head i hate it but no then let us at least take precautions ma petite it is luck alone that had the nimirraj made safe our lives are complicated enough without that i knew what that meant an accidental pregnancy the thought of it made my blood run colder than anything else had i hid my face in my hands i cant do this then you must call richard and tell him you cannot come tonight you cannot go as you are ma petite the need will only worsen the longer you deny it i raised my face and stared at him how much worse he lowered his gaze bad enough i crawled across the bed to him made him look at me how bad he tried not to meet my gaze his shields were back in place and i couldnt tell what he was feeling you would be attracted to all the men you would i cannot guarantee what you would do ma petite or who you would do it with i just stared at him no no i would never he touched my mouth with his fingertip ma petite if you have not found my memories of my first days with this inside my body then it is a blessing i was a wanton thing before i became a vampire but what i did when the desire first fell upon me the desire did not hit me at once because i craved blood first then when that quieted the desire rose inside me he took my hands in his pressed them against the cool flesh of his chest i did things ma petite things that even to a hardened libertine were humiliating a look a glance and it was enough to bring me to them didnt belle morte try to protect you i did not meet belle until i had been dead nearly five years i stared at him i thought belle was your whatever that she made you into a vamp lissette was my creator she was of belles line but not a master vampire not by any stretch of the definition in france it is customary that every kiss of vampires has at least one vampire belonging to each of the council bloodlines lissette was the only one of her kind in a nest descended mostly of far less pleasant vampires julian was her master of the city and he was my first true master he brought in people for me but not people i would have chosen he brought in jeanclaude shook his head he amused himself at my expense because he knew i would take whatever he offered because i would have no choice i thought i had no room for embarrassment but he taught me that there were things i did not want to do and i did them anyway i think if he hadnt been shielding so strongly that i would have seen what he was remembering but he didnt want me to see let me spare you such degradation ma petite you are not as i was you have never given yourself freely i fear what you would do or think of yourself if you did these things i do not think your sense of yourself would survive intact youre scaring me i said good you should be frightened asher met me before i had mastered the ardeur he can tell you what i was like then i just looked at asher i had seen the ardeur rise in others before jeanclaude and i have watched it since but i have never seen anyone so crazed by it said asher so you helped him learn how to control the ardeur non lissette sent to belle telling her of jeanclaudes beauty i was sent to how would you say look him over for belle i advised belle not to bring jeanclaude and his master to court why i asked i was jealous of his beauty and his prowess after ten years she was bored with me or so i feared and i did not wish the competition i learned to control the ardeur without the aid of another who had experienced it for five years i fed on flesh as i fed on blood only then did i master the ability to feed from a distance five years i said belle taught me true control of the ardeur and i was not hers until i had been dead five years but i will be there for you from the beginning it will not be as it was for me jeanclaude hugged me against him and that scared me more i would never have married the marks with you if i had thought you could inherit my incubus i would not knowingly have done this to you i pushed away from him and found him crying and the fear sat like stale metal on my tongue i was so scared my body went quiet not racing but almost as if every beat of my body every breath had simply stopped and all there was to fill me was fear what have you done to me i thought at first that you were not vampire and it would not be a true hunger but watching you today i know that it is as it was for me you must feed you must not deny yourself to do so is to court madness or worse no i said if you had withstood the nimirrajs advances then i would say that your strength of will might conquer it if you had withstood the desire to feed on nathaniel i would say you would master it but you fed on him i did not have sex with nathaniel no and wasnt what you did instead more satisfying to some part of you than mere intercourse would have been i started to say no and stopped i could still feel nathaniels flesh in my mouth the touch of his skin under my hands the taste of his blood on my tongue the memory brought the hunger over me in a hot rush not merely the lust but jeanclaudes craving for blood and richards beast or my beast wanting to take that last bite and tear flesh for real no pretending no holding back i had an awful idea if i deny one hunger all of them grow worse dont they if i deny the lust i need more blood and the reverse is true i dont just have your blood lust jeanclaude i have richards beast or mine i wanted to tear nathaniel up i wanted to feed on him for real the way an animal does will that grow worse too his face started to slip back into careful neutral lines i grabbed his shoulders shook him no no more hiding will it grow worse i have no way of knowing for certain no more games will it grow worse i believe so his voice was very soft as he said it i drew back from him huddled against the headboard stared at him waiting for him to say sorry just kidding but he just met my eyes i stared at him because i didnt want to see anyone elses face if i saw pity it might make me cry if i saw lust itd make me mad i finally said what am i going to do there was no inflection in my voice just a dragging tiredness you will feed and we will help you we will keep you safe i finally glanced at the others every face was either carefully neutral or in nathaniels case staring down at the bed as if he didnt trust me to see his eyes probably smart of him fine but i think we can do better than condoms what do you mean ma petite nathaniel can put his shorts on and ill find my jammies i still think i held a hand up and jeanclaude fell silent they can put them on underneath their clothes just in case but i know that if i tell nathaniel not to that he wont i frowned at jason ill be good he said i am not afraid that nathaniel will disobey you ma petite the tone in his voice turned me from jasons face to his what do you mean i am worried that he will indeed do everything you tell him to do we stared at each other for a long space of my heartbeats i understood what he meant now it wasnt the boys he didnt trust it was me i would have liked to say i would never ask them either of them to do that to me but there was something in jeanclaudes eyes some knowledge some sorrow that kept me from saying it how much control am i going to lose i asked finally i do not know im getting really tired of hearing you say that and i of saying it i finally asked what i had to ask what do we do now our pommes de sang fetch their clothing and yours and we feed and as much as i hated it as much as i wanted to deny it i knew he was right id been trying not to be a sociopath because it made me a monster i just hadnt known what i was saying i needed to feed off humans lust instead of blood and flesh but it was still feeding being a sociopath was beginning not to sound so bad somewhere during the dressing process i came to my senses i stayed up against the headboard ashers robe belted securely over the red pajamas my face averted forehead pressed to the wood control was the heart of who i thought i was i could do this or rather not do this i had to try and let this pass me by because to do anything else i could not do this the bed moved and just the sensation of the men moving around on the bed was enough to tighten my body speed my pulse dear god help me this couldnt be happening id feared ending up as a vampire id come close many times but id never thought it would happen like this i was still alive still human but the hunger rose inside me like some great beast trying to dig its way out of me and all that kept it from surfacing was my fingers digging into the wood my forehead pressed against the carvings i wasnt sure which hunger i was fighting but the ardeur colored all of it whether i was craving flesh or blood the sex was there in all of it i couldnt separate them and that was scary all on its own i felt someone crawling towards me and i knew without looking that it was jeanclaude i could just feel him ma petite all is prepared we need only you i spoke with my face still pressed into the wood my fingers clinging to it well then youll just have to do without i felt his hand hovering over my shoulder and i said dont touch me ma petite ma petite i would change this if i could but i cannot we must make the best of what is given us that made me look at him his face was too close eyes that intense midnight blue hair a dark glory around his pale face i flashed on another face just as pale just as perfect with a wealth of black hair but with eyes a rich brown like dark amber they grew in my vision until the world drowned in the dark honey of her eyes as if it were poured over my eyes over my skin my body until it filled me and when i raised my eyes to jeanclaudes worried face his hand on my arm i saw something close to terror in his eyes he scrambled back from me and when i turned and stared at asher he spilled off the bed to stand shaking jason and nathaniel stayed on the bed because they didnt know any better whats wrong jason asked nathaniel whispered her eyes i turned and caught sight of myself in the standing mirror in the corner my eyes had filled with pale brown fire not the darkness of my own eyes but hers no i said softly i felt her thousands of miles away her pleasure at my terror rolled through my body raised my beast and sent me falling onto the bed my hands strained for something to hold on to some help but there was nothing to fight it was power and it was inside me she explored me raising my beast until it rolled just under the surface of skin she touched that part of richard that was still inside me and raised his beast until the two energies entwined and my body started to convulse i heard yelling shes going to change hands holding me down to the bed but belle had learned what she wanted and let them slide back into my body she separated out the powers inside me like youd sort a deck of cards she touched jeanclaudes link to me and it puzzled her i could feel it until that moment shed assumed i was a vampire and now she knew i wasnt she let what puzzled her slide back deep inside me then she called the ardeur the incubus and the moment i thought it i realized it was the wrong word succubus she whispered in my head succubus the hands that had been holding me down poured over my body responding to the ardeur it was like being covered in pure lust rolled in it like flour on a piece of meat before you cook it hands slid along my skin a mouth closed on my mouth and i couldnt see who was right above me kissing me i could feel the weight of their body another set of hands but i could see nothing but a shining amber light belle kept the ardeur on the surface because it amused her i couldnt see whose hands were where or who was doing what all i could do was feel them the brush of silk the press of flesh a curtain of hair the scent of vanilla but i could not see belle morte was using my eyes for other things she touched that part of me that allowed me to raise the dead she caressed my necromancy tried to bring it to the surface as she had the two beasts and the ardeur but everything else she had explored was hers to call it was all in some way part of her lineage her blood but the necromancy was all mine my magic welled up through me pushing her back but i couldnt cast her out not with just the raw power it was as if she floated near the surface of some dark pool and i sat at the bottom trying to push her out i couldnt cast her out but i could see again think again i was nude from the waist up nathaniels mouth closed on my nipple drawing it in i cried out and jason lowered his mouth to my other breast there was a moment when i stared down at the two of them pressed to my body the blond head the auburn their mouths working at my breasts the line of their bodies pressed along mine the marks of my teeth still visible in nathaniels flesh when the ardeur when belle morte spilled over me again jasons hand slid down the front of the red silk bottoms his fingers finding me as if hed always known just where to touch me i writhed under his touch their touch i grabbed jasons wrist tried to pull his hand away but he fought me and it was a tender place to fight over i screamed jeanclaude asher ma petite jeanclaude made the name a question as if he wasnt sure it was really me i found the vampires standing beside the bed not helping not hindering just watching but i understood the ardeur called to them too the were afraid to touch us feed i said non ma petite i cant fight her and the hunger feed and let me feed you cannot break free of her ma petite help me he looked across the bed at asher and i watched something pass between them something built of sorrow and old regrets she is right mon ami she cannot fight belle and the ardeur she doesnt understand what shes asking jeanclaude said no but she asks and if we do not do it we will always wonder i would rather try and fail than regret having never tried at all they stared at each other for a second or two then asher crawled onto the bed and jeanclaude followed him asher stretched out beside nathaniel and jeanclaude mirrored him with jason belle mortes joy flared through me filled my eyes with honeycolored flames and i lost my grip on jasons wrist his hand slid back over me but when i turned to look i could see jeanclaude through the dark glass of her eyes and asher on the other side i knew that once they touched either pomme de sang they would be caught in the desire and they would not break free it was a trap i opened my mouth to say dont but three things happened all at once they each struck into the neck of the man on their side as if theyd known exactly what the other would do and jason forced me over that shining edge of orgasm i screamed body bucking against the bed and only their weight kept me from sitting up from clawing the air because it wasnt just my own pleasure i was feeling i felt ashers fangs in nathaniels neck felt nathaniels body build build and finally release in a rush of pleasure that made him bite down on my breast made me score not his back but ashers with my nails jason drew his mouth back from me and screamed the vampires rode their bodies and i knew with belle mortes awareness that the only reason they didnt orgasm with us was the blood pressure wasnt there yet but the pleasure was the five of us were locked into wave after wave of pleasure like the heat the ardeur was named for it passed over and through us again and again it was like floating skinless formless just above the bed and i could feel their heartbeats inside my body finally i could feel jeanclaude and asher feel their hearts give a massive beat and feel the life flood through their bodies and spill in a long hot line of pleasure that seemed to be pulled from the soles of their feet to the tops of their heads as if every piece of their bodies every atom exploded in pleasure at once nathaniel jason and i screamed for them because their mouths were still locked on the blood still drinking still feeding then it was over and the five of us lay motionless except for the frantic rise and fall of our chests trying to breath trying to remember what it was like to be inside our own skins with just one heart inside us instead of five we melted back into our own skins only the faint dew of sweat and the panicked thunder of our pulses beating against each others bodies jeanclaude and asher pulled back from nathaniel and jason just as theyd bitten them together in a synchronization as perfect now as it had been two centuries ago belle morte filled my mind with images images of the two of them making love to her before asher was scarred when they were her perfectly matched pair i had a confused image of them making love to her at the same time the feel of them pushing inside her as perfectly aware then as now of where each others bodies were and of exactly what they would do she missed them and it was partially my love of asher my seeing him as beautiful that made her regret the sharing wasnt only one way she was getting my feelings too but i was myself again the desire had been well fed sated so now i could do what i did best i called my magic pulled it around me like a breath of cool wind against my sweatsoaked skin nathaniel and jason pulled back from me eyes still unfocused jeanclaude and asher raised up above each of the smaller men their eyes as out of focus as the lycanthropes but jeanclaude said ma petite what i reached for him take my hand ma petite now belles power cut through me like a whip in a practiced hand shed been using it to tickle my skin now she meant it to hurt i writhed on the bed only jasons and nathaniels weight keeping me from flailing my vision was being consumed by brown flames a hand in mine cool flesh and the moment jeanclaude touched me i could see again i was his human servant he was my master we were part of a triumvirate of power if richard had been here we could have chased her back to the hell she crawled out of i sent the call in my head screaming psychically for richard but the answer came against my skin jason stared at me confused he said anita i felt richards power in jason the link of their pack the power of the triumvirate leaped between jeanclaudes hand my hand and jasons body it would work it had to work because i could feel belle morte rising inside me again and i wasnt sure i had it in me to chase her back i drew my necromancy like a great dark cloud a storm ready to break filling the room with the tingling brush of magic nathaniel drew back whispered nimirra the power pressed like lightning in a bottle but the bottle was my body and there was no release without one more thing blood the last time wed done overt triumvirate magic id asked the boys to give me blood watched as jeanclaude had sunk fangs into richard for the first time but not today today i needed the blood i wanted the blood i would not share i used my free hand to lower jasons face towards me but i didnt kiss him my mouth moved down the side of his cheek and i whispered i need blood jason say yes hed been holding himself off of me with his arms but he whispered yes and collapsed his upper body across my breasts his hand sliding along my stomach as if he meant to do other things i could smell the blood just below the surface of his neck could taste his pulse like candy on my tongue and i bit him i wasnt a vampire there were no mind tricks to make it pleasant we werent having sex anymore there was no distraction only my teeth tearing his flesh his blood pouring into my mouth and the moment the blood poured over me the necromancy flared and i pushed it into that honeyed touch she laughed at me at us then the laughter stopped because she felt the push of my power i was a necromancer and she was just another kind of vampire my magic didnt differentiate between her and any other corpse i shoved her out cast her back locked her outside us id been training in witchcraft this year so i bound her from us bound her from harming us in any way bound her from contacting us through her power my last thought to her was if you want to find out what the fuck is going on pick up a phone then she was gone i was naked again it seemed to be a theme that night the five of us lay in a heap breathing hard bodies tingling with that rush that magic will leave behind sometimes where you feel both tired and exhilarated at the same time sort of like sex asher and nathaniel lay on the bed just out of my reach my mouth chin and neck were covered in jasons blood he lay with his head on my chest his head turned so i could see the neck wound id marked nathaniel and micah but there was a piece of meat missing from jasons neck it wasnt a big piece but it was a missing piece of flesh nonetheless i swallowed hard taking deep even breaths i would not throw up i would not throw up i would not throw up i was going to throw up i pushed everyone off the bed and ran for the bathroom i threw up and the flesh about the size of a fiftycent piece came up just like it had gone down whole there was something about seeing it about having my worst fears confirmed that brought nausea in a burning wave i threw up until i thought my head would explode and i was dry heaving there was a knock on the door ma petite may i come in he hadnt asked if i was alright smart vampire i didnt answer him just stayed kneeling with my head against the cool bathtub edge wondering if i was going to throw up again or my head would fall off first my head hurt worse than my stomach i heard the door open ma petite im here i said my voice sounding thick as if id been crying i kept my head down i didnt want to see him or anyone i saw the edge of the black robe then more of it as he knelt down in front of me is there anything i can get you a dozen answers flew through my mind most of them sarcastic but i settled for some aspirin and a toothbrush you could ask me to cut my heart out at this moment and i might do it instead you ask for aspirin and a toothbrush he leaned in and laid the gentlest of kisses on the top of my head i will get what you ask he stood and again i heard a drawer opening and closing i looked up and watched him move efficiently around the bathroom setting out a bottle of aspirin and a toothbrush and a choice of toothpastes it was absurdly domestic and the blackfurred robe didnt fit the part jeanclaude looked like someone who should have servants and he did but mostly around me hed always done for himself and for me when i wasnt around he probably had fifty dancing girls waiting on him hand and foot but with me it was often just him he brought me the aspirin and a glass of water i took them and there was a moment when i wasnt sure my stomach would keep them down but it passed jeanclaude helped me stand and i let him it wasnt just that my legs were shaky though they were it was more like all of me was shaky uncertain i started to shiver and couldnt stop jeanclaude held me against his robe in the circle of his arms my breast hurt where it rubbed against the cloth i pulled back enough to look down at my body there was a perfect imprint of nathaniels teeth encircling my breast around the areola hed only drawn blood in a few places but the rest was a deep redpurple it was going to be a hell of a bruise if my body didnt heal it first jeanclaude traced his finger across the upper part of the bite mark and i winced why is it things like this never hurt while youre doing them the question is its own answer ma petite strangely i understood what he meant its almost a mirror of what i did to his chest nathaniel is being cautious i think what do you mean he did nothing to you that you had not done to him first i thought they were both carried away with the ardeur and belle morte the first time you feel the call of her power it is heady stuff but the fact jason did something that he knew you would not allow and nathaniel didnt may mean that nathaniel has more control of himself than jason does i would have thought it was the other way around i know he said and the way he said it made me look at him whats that supposed to mean it means ma petite that you may know nathaniels hearts desire but i do not think you truly know him he doesnt know himself i said in part that is true but i think he will surprise you are you hiding something from me about nathaniel no i sighed you know on another day id make you tell me what that cryptic remark meant but damn it i want a little comfort from someone right now and i guess youre it his eyebrows raised when you ask in so flattering a manner how can i refuse no games please jeanclaude please just hold me he drew me back into the circle of his arms and i moved so that the bite mark wasnt hurting or rather wasnt hurting more than it already did it had turned into a throbbing pain sharp when touched it did hurt but a part of me found that satisfying it was a confirmation of what wed done a painful souvenir of something that had been amazing if my morals hadnt gotten in the way i could have just marveled at the whole thing why am i pleased that nathaniel marked me i asked it in a small voice because i wasnt a hundred percent sure jeanclaude shouldnt have been jealous about it he stroked my hair as his other arm held me close i can think of many reasons his voice vibrated through his chest against my ear mingling with the sound of his heartbeat one that makes sense to me would be enough i said ah one that makes sense to you now that is a different question i squeezed my arms around his waist no games remember just tell me it could be that you are truly becoming his nimirra his arm tightened around me i do feel something different in you ma petite some wildness that was not there before it does not feel like richards beast feels but it is a difference it may simply be that as nathaniels nimirra you want closer contact with him it made sense it was hard to argue with the logic of it but i wanted to what could be the other reasons belle morte treated you as a vampire of her line if through the marks or your necromancy you have some of the powers of a vampire you may have others it could be that leopards will be your animal to call i admit that the first is the more likely reason but the second is also possible i leaned back enough to see his face are you attracted to the wolves i asked i find it pleasant to have the wolves around me it is comforting to touch them like a pet or lover i wasnt sure how i felt about him using pet and lover in the same sentence but i let it go so you want to have sex with the werewolves do you want to have sex with nathaniel no not exactly but you want to touch him and be touched i had to think about that for a few seconds i guess so in a true joining of animal and vampire there is a desire in both to touch for one to serve and the other to take care of them padma the master of beasts treated his animals like shit one of the many reasons that padma will always be a secondary power on the council is his belief that all power must be taken that all power must come through fear true power comes when others offer it to you and you merely accept it as a gift not as the spoils of some personal war so the fact that you treat your wolves better than most is just what a political decision he shrugged still holding me against him i do not know how other vampires feel i know only that belle morte felt attracted to her cats and i feel the same for my wolves perhaps it is only her line that turns the bond between animal and vampire into something like lovers much of her power fed into sex or at least attraction and perhaps that is not how others feel he frowned i had not truly thought about that before perhaps it is another benefit of her lineage or a shortfall of it that most of my powers turn to something resembling sex does asher feel the same way about his animal to call he has no animal to call i widened my eyes i thought all master vamps over a certain age had an animal to call most of the time they do but not always just as his bite can give true sexual release and mine cannot we have different powers but not having an animal to call is like a major it means he is weaker than i am but he could still be master of the city somewhere else i mean ive met masters of the city that had no animal to call before if there was a territory vacant in this country and he would be willing to leave us then yes he might rise to master of the city i started to ask then why doesnt he go but i was pretty sure i knew the answer and it was a painful answer so i left it unsaid maybe i was growing up at last not every thought that came into my head had to come out of my mouth or it could simply be that youve wanted nathaniel for a very long time there is satisfaction in finally giving in to the desire i pushed away from him you know youre not very good at this comforting stuff you said no games isnt a lie the same as playing a game i frowned at him i did not have sex with nathaniel come ma petite you did not have intercourse but to say you did not have sex is splitting the hair a little too fine no i glared at him and tried to be angry but there was something closer to panic than anger making my heart beat faster are you saying that what we just did qualifies as sex are you saying that it did not i turned so i couldnt see his face hugging my arms around myself i finally turned back to look at him i tried leaning against the wall but the tiles were cold and i was still naked i needed my clothes but they were out in the other room and i was so not ready to see the other men again so youre saying that we had sex all of us he took a deep breath what answer do you want ma petite truth would be nice no you do not want the truth i thought that you did or i would have taken better care about what i said he looked tired i am glad you are the woman that you are but there are moments when i wish that you could simply enjoy something without being chased around the room by your guilt and your morals afterwards what we did tonight is a glorious thing a thing to be shared and treasured not something to be ashamed of i was doing better with it before you told me it counts as sex and the fact that i had to tell you that it counts as sex means you are still lying to yourself more than i have ever tried to lie to you whats that supposed to mean he held up a hand i will say no more about this you do not want the truth and you told me not to lie i am out of options i hugged myself and frowned at the floor i tried to wrap my mind around what hed said what wed done and i just couldnt do it we needed a change of topic fast jason acted like a power substitute for richard i said oui he let me change the subject without a word or a change in expression i didnt know we could do that nor did i he took those few gliding steps that put him beside me again if it is comfort that you want more than truth then i can do that he touched my chin raised my face so that our gazes met but you must tell me when you do not want the truth ma petite it is usually your greatest demand on me i stared up into his beautiful face and understood what he was offering comfort but not honesty comforting lies because i didnt want to hear the truth i dont want you to lie to me but im about at my limit for hard truths for the day i need a breather you want a space of calm to think about everything i understand that i can even give it to you for a few hours but you have to confront richard at the lupanar tonight and i fear that more hard truths await you there i put my face against his chest cuddled into the smoothness of his skin caught between the furred lapels your bringing up richard isnt going to make me feel better my apologies he was rubbing my back with his hands over and over the movement made the fur on the sleeves rub up and down my body from my butt to my shoulders it was soothing and not soothing at the same time i looked up at him and didnt know whether to cry or scream i thought i fed the ardeur his hands went still against my body you have and you have fed it well but it is always just below the surface like being full but still admiring a beautifully made dessert i didnt really like the analogy but couldnt think of a better one i pressed my body into his robe let him cradle me against his body and listened to the comforting beat of his heart i spoke with my face pressed against his chest the black furred edge of the lapels tickling my lips why didnt you warn me that she could do that if you were a vampire of my line then i would have warned you but you are not vampire you are human and it should not work that way for you i leaned back enough to see his face can she enter any of her children no her ability to look in upon her children only lasts for a few nights once the new vampire is strong enough to control its own hunger then she is unable to enter as if some door closes that was held open before she called my beast or beasts or whatever the hell is going on with me she called it to the surface like she knew what she was doing her animal to call is all great cats so leopards i said he nodded among other things i thought only the master of beasts could call more than one animal it was the ability he came with from almost the beginning but many of the oldest grow into a variety of powers she began as i understand it able to call only leopards then one by one the other great cats answered to her if i really am a wereleopard will she be able to control me if she meets me you cast her out ma petite you can answer your own question can you not youre saying i kicked her butt once i can do it again something like that oui i pushed away from him my fingers trailing down his arms under the heavy robe until our hands touched trust me jeanclaude one victory doesnt guarantee youll win the war this was not a small victory ma petite never in all her two thousand years of life has any of her line defied her as you just did hed bent at the waist just a little to kiss my hands showing a long thin triangle of his chest and upper stomach my gaze followed that line of pale flesh down into the shadow that hid the rest of him for once i didnt want to undo the robe part of it was that i was well satisfied and part of it most of it was that i had just had sex with four men at once and my discomfort level was just a little too high to think about any sex for a while i knew that vampires could make the bite pleasant but i never dreamed it felt like that i said it is one of ashers gifts to make his bite orgasmic i looked at him he nodded oui ma petite i can make it pleasant but not that pleasant asher bit me once and it wasnt orgasmic he drew back when he realized he had rolled your mind without intending to he behaved himself i raised my eyebrows at that if tonight was the real thing hed more than behaved himself you fed off of it too and belle morte as well it was a feast was it not and something in the way he said it made me blush i do not mean to embarrass you ma petite but it was glorious i have not shared ashers gift in over two hundred years i had almost made myself forget what it was like so you cant do this without belle morte one of her gifts is to be a bridge a connection between her children that allowed the sharing of gifts i cast her out jeanclaude it wont be happening again and we are both thrilled i do not think you understand the risk we all took ma petite if you had failed to cast her out then she could have done things to us even from such a distance we are the only two of her line that ever left her side willingly some were exiled but none simply left and she is not a woman that takes rejection well that was an understatement she saw asher through my eyes i felt her regret that shed let him go that she hadnt seen him the way i did he turned his head to one side then perhaps even a very old dog can learn new tricks i swallowed and something about it made me very aware of the taste of blood and other things in my mouth i had to get cleaned up i went to the sink and watched him in the mirror behind me id known i was nude but it wasnt until i saw myself in the mirror that i really noticed it id managed to wipe most of the blood off my mouth with toilet paper but it was still clinging to my chest and my neck i really need a robe of my own i said i would offer you mine he said i shook my head reaching for the toothbrush normally i would have washed the blood off first but i wanted that taste out of my mouth more you naked around me right now is not what i need i will send he hesitated asher for a robe for you you started to say jason didnt you he looked at me in the mirror i know hell heal but i could have really hurt him i said but you didnt and that is what matters pretty to think so i said he smiled but not like he was happy i will send asher for a robe great thank you i squeezed toothpaste onto the brush as he went for the door he stopped with his hand on the doorknob normally you would owe your pomme de sangs some gift or show of gratitude for serving you i think theyve had all the gratitude theyre getting from me for one day he laughed and the sound rode over my body like a caress of silk oh yes ma petite and i think they would agree but i tell you this for later you must reward your pomme de sang for his or her services money wouldnt do it i asked the look on his face said he was truly insulted outraged in fact you have just shared something more intimate than most people will ever know with another being they have given us a great gift this day and they are not whores anita my real name i was in trouble they are pommes de sang think of them as beloved mistresses i frowned at him today the sharing of pleasure was reward enough but you will need to feed the ardeur every day and unless it is a feeding worthy of the thirst more than once a day for a few weeks what are you saying i asked i am saying that it would be best if you chose a pomme de sang and kept him near you for you do not truly know yet what your hunger is like it may be a light thing easily tended or it may not youre saying ill need to do this every day yes fuck he shook his head was today so horrible ma petite was the pleasure you gained so very small its not that it was glorious and you know it but well never be able to duplicate that not without belle morte and i dont want a return visit from her nor do i but there are many things that can be done to feed and when you have some control i will teach you to feed from a distance when a few weeks shit i turned back to the mirror not looking at him how do i pick a pomme de sang i think you already have he said i looked at him you mean nathaniel he nodded no i i dont trust myself not to lose control and you know what i mean he is lovely to the eye and he cares for you would it be so very wrong yes yes it would be like child molesting he cant say no if a person cant say no then its the same as rape perhaps what you do not wish to acknowledge ma petite is that nathaniel knows exactly what he wants and what he wants is you he wants me to dominate him in every sense of the word it is best if a pomme de sang is submissive to you i shook my head then who else would you want to risk being carried away with your nimirraj this time there was something in his voice you are jealous the nimirraj is not a pomme de sang a mistress a dessert no matter how delectable he is an entree a very very main course and i wish to be the only entree at your table you were sharing me with richard and he certainly wasnt just dessert very true but he also had ties to me he is my wolf to call and that is a different relationship to me to you than some stranger i know it was the ardeur but damn ive never you are not a woman of casual lusts no ma petite you are not and i fear that this nimirraj is no more casual than the rest of your lusts he looked so serious when he said it solemn what do you mean if you are truly his nimirra then you will be drawn to him there is no help for it and truthfully i cannot fault your taste he is not as fair of face as our richard but he does have certain compensations the look on his face made me blush again i turned to the sink and started brushing my teeth and he took it as a dismissal he went out laughing when the door was closed behind him and i was alone i stood for a long time looking at myself in the mirror it still looked like me but i could taste jasons blood underneath the toothpaste i started scrubbing and spitting and running the cold water listening to the sound of the water instead of the screaming inside my head when jeanclaude came back into the room i was rinsing the blood out of the washrag id used and had three different kinds of mouthwash sitting beside the sink id used all three and i couldnt taste anything but minty freshness you could scrub yourself clean of the blood and the taste of it in your mouth but the stains that really mattered were the ones that no amount of soap or water could touch id have said that things couldnt get any worse but i knew they could and rapidly if i locked myself away for a few days until i could control the ardeur the werewolves would vote without me there and theyd execute gregory if they killed gregory it wasnt just jacob that id kill it would be war between me my pard and richards pack richard was just boy scout enough to get in my way and maybe force me to kill him something inside of me would die if richard died and if i pulled the trigger some things you recover from some things you dont killing richard would be one of those things i wouldnt recover from jeanclaude said softly are you alright ma petite i shook my head but said sure he held a bundle of blue satin out to me then you need to get dressed and i will escort you back outside i looked at him is it that obvious that i dont want to go back out there jason has been taken to his room he will heal but we thought it would upset you to see him nathaniel awaits your pleasure since he did drive you what about asher he took jason away you know we have the answer to the question youve been wanting to know i said we looked at each other i felt his release ma petite i know that he has been tormenting me allowing me to believe he was ruined but we still do not know how badly scarred he is and that is a ruin of a different sort you mean he may feel hes so scarred that he doesnt want anyone to see him or touch him oui until the two of you touched the boys the ardeur didnt spread to you belle morte didnt spread to you its like a disease i said i have seen that particular disease set loose in a banquet room the size of a football field and spread from person to person until all fell upon each other in a well orgy is too mild a word what did she gain from making a whole room of humans lose control like that she gains power from every feeding around her but it was not that alone she wished to see if there were limits to the number of people she could spread the desire through did she find her limit no so hundreds of people i said he nodded and she fed off of the lust from them all oui what did she do with all that power she helped a marquis seduce a king and changed the trade routes and alliances of three countries i widened my eyes well at least it didnt go to waste belle has many faults but the wasting of an advantage is not one of them what did she gain through all the political maneuvering land titles and a king that adored her remember ma petite that this was at a time in history when to be king of a nation meant to be absolute monarch his word was life and death and she ruled him through the sweet secrets of her body no one is that good in bed a look passed over his face a small smile that he tried to hide if she was that wonderful then why did you and asher leave her the first time asher had been with belle for many years before i arrived and more beyond that before he found julianna he and i were in the circle of innermost power where many strived for centuries to get to and failed we were her favorites until asher found julianna it did not occur to me until decades later that belle was jealous but i think in a way that was it she slept with other men other vampires and she was content that asher and i shared each others beds and that we went to the vampires she chose to share us with but another woman that we chose ourselves that was different but it is one of our most sacred laws not to harm anothers human servant so belle did nothing then asher offered julianna to me and we became a mйnage а trois and that raised the question of julianna sleeping with others he looked down at the floor then up again arturo was one of her favorites as well he desired julianna but asher refused him asher refused him not julianna i said she was his servant she could not deny if he had consented ick i said he shrugged it was a different century ma petite and julianna was a different woman than you are so why did asher refuse i asked he feared for juliannas safety we both did arturo liked it rough mother nature had made it almost impossible for arturo to have it any way but rough i looked at him what do you mean he gave that graceful shrug again arturo is still the most wellendowed man i have ever seen it was my turn to shrug so he shook his head you do not understand ma petite he is bien outillй well tooled ah what is the english hung like a horse i started to point out that richard was pretty wellendowed but its bad form to point out to boyfriend a that boyfriend b is bigger micah was better endowed even than richard but again it didnt seem the thing to mention i was finally left with ive seen two men that were hung like horses as you say and it was intimidating but youre implying that you feared for juliannas safety because he was so big that is exactly what i am saying no ones that big arturo makes even our richard and your nimirraj seem ungraced i blushed and wished i hadnt those werent the two men i was referring to he raised an eyebrow at me indeed the way he said it made me blush harder in new mexico one of edwards backups and one of the bad guys and how did you happen to see just how wellgraced they were ma petite there was something in his voice a hint of warmth like the beginnings of anger i did not have sex with anyone then how did you see them nude his voice still held that warm edge and i couldnt really blame him bernardo edwards backup and i got questioned by a local biker gang uh club they didnt believe he was my boyfriend they asked if he was circumcised and i said yes i figured i had a better than fiftyfifty chance in america they made him drop his pants to prove it under some threat i assume he was looking more amused than angry now yeah and the other one he tried to rape me jeanclaudes eyes went wide what became of him i killed him he touched my face gently i have only recently understood why i was so very attracted to you from almost the first time i heard you interact with the police not love at first sight i said but love at first hearing i dont have that good a voice do not underestimate the dulcet sounds of your voice ma petite but it was not the sound of your voice that fascinated me it was your words i knew from the moment i heard you the moment i saw the gun and realized that this lovely petite woman was the executioner that you would never die waiting for me to save you that you would save yourself i cupped his hand against my cheek looked into his eyes and saw again that sorrow for failing to save julianna that never quite left him so you wanted me because i was such a tough broad he let me make the joke he even smiled but it never reached his eyes oui ma petite my voice was soft when i said so arturo wanted julianna he took his hand back slowly and she feared him and we feared for her this is two hundred years ago a little more now asher was not as powerful as he is now and we feared that his human servant would not survive arturos attentions ive got to ask how big was he jeanclaude spaced his hands apart like youd measure a fish like this big it looked to be about six inches thats not so big that is how wide he was jeanclaude said i just gaped at him youre exaggerating no ma petite believe me i remember then how long was he he made another measuring movement i laughed because i didnt believe him oh please youre saying he was what about six inches wide and over a foot long no way yes way ma petite you said arturo was one of belles favorites does that mean she had sex with him oui i frowned couldnt think of a slick way to say it so just blurted out didnt it hurt her she was a woman with a large capacity for men in every way gee that was polite most women wouldnt be able to accommodate that i said no he agreed did she want to kill julianna no she believed arturo would not harm her why he licked his lips which he rarely did and looked uncomfortable which he did even less often let us say that something that belle morte taught asher and me to take pleasure in we also did with julianna i frowned at him because i so did not have a clue if youre hinting im not getting it i would rather not discuss it now perhaps at a later time i frowned harder what arent you telling me he shook his head i think ma petite that you would rather not know i looked at him you know jeanclaude there was a time not that long ago that id have thrown a fit and made you tell me everything but now if you tell me i dont want to know then ill just believe you i really am not up to hearing intimate and shocking details about your vampire sex life ive had enough shocks in that area for one day ma petite i think you are growing up at last dont push it and im not growing up im just getting tired as are we all ma petite as are we all i let the royal blue satin robe fall from my hands it had wide lace sleeves and more lace at what passed for the lapels to curve in flowers down the sides it was beautiful and fit me perfectly most robes are too long for me hed probably bought it with me in mind i belted it in place and didnt want to ask any more questions about the ardeur and sex and vampire stuff but some things had to be clear between us i need to get this straight jeanclaude oui ma petite you say that what we did was sex so in effect i had sex with everyone he just nodded you dont seem at all jealous about that i was participating ma petite why should i be jealous the answer confused me more i frowned up at him okay let me try this again you say the ardeur may need to be fed more than once a day we cant count on you being johnnyonthespot when it happens i can sleep over here but you may need to feed when i am not awake this is very possible in fact it is likely okay then what are the rules it was his turn to frown what do you mean ma petite rules i mean like what will make you jealous and what wont what or who am i supposed to stay away from he started to smile then stopped you are one of the most cynical people i have ever met the most practical in a lifeanddeath context and if you knew some of the people i had met you would understand the compliment that is but you are also very earnest like a child it is a type of innocence that i do not think you will ever outgrow but i find it hard to deal with its a fair question indeed it is but most people would not need to ask it so blandly they would either ignore it and do the best they could when the need arose or they would ask who among my people will i allow you to have sex with without becoming angry it made me wince to hear him say it but i like the way i phrased the question better i know you are simultaneously one of the most direct women i know and one of the most selfdeluding i am really not liking where this conversations going fine but i will answer my question because it is the truth if nathaniel is your pomme de sang then i will let intimacy with him pass jason as my pomme de sang is within his rights to make love with my human servant it is considered a great gift for a vampire to share his servant with another and jason has earned that he has served me faithfully for many years im not a prize to be given away he held up a hand hush ma petite i will answer the question and i will try for truth even though you do not want to hear it today there are many things i would have told you today if you had been in the mood for truth but you are right this we must have clear between us i would simply have urged you to keep nathaniel close at hand and let the cards fall as they may but if you insist on a list then i will give it to you but not without reasons because i want it clear that i do not share you lightly and there are men i will not share you with at all he was angry now and his eyes had bled to sapphire flame the rest of his body was very still but the eyes gave it all away he was in the grip of some strong emotion probably anger but i wasnt sure and he was shielding like a son of a bitch so something he was feeling or thinking he didnt want me to share asher is acceptable he didnt give the reasons for that one and i didnt ask because there were too many of them most of them painful if richard comes to his senses then of course he smoothed his hands down the front of his robe he often checked his clothes when he was nervous the nimirraj will have to be acceptable because he calls to you richards beast calls to you through my marks my ties to him to it but the nimirraj he calls to you anita my real name again he was not happy he calls to something in you in your power it may be that you are truly nimirra and the full moon will see it true or it may be that as with nathaniel you have found your animal to call if you are drawn more strongly to all the leopards then it could be for either reason be wary if the leopards are yours to call it may not merely be nathaniel and the nimirraj that beckon please dont tell me that im going to turn into slutgirl he smiled i do not think you need to fear that you are stronger willed than that you just said i might be tempted by the other wereleopards if the nimirraj or nathaniel are not near you when the ardeur rises then my advice is to give in to it instantly i gave him wide eyes if you fight it ma petite it grows if it grows large enough then you may indeed turn into slutgirl if you give in and feed immediately then you will have sex with one person not several and it will be more a person of your choosing so the real advice is keep the men i prefer within easy reach i would make nathaniel or someone of your choosing your constant companion i swallowed hard and searched his face but it was pleasantly blank his expression when he didnt want me to know what he was thinking his eyes had bled back to normal something occurred to me i havent seen damian around i speak of sex and you think of damian his voice was still pleasant but the words held something harsh you give me this list of people to sleep with and not to sleep with but you leave him off either list and he wasnt at the club and he didnt come to the bedroom attracted by the power like asher where is he jeanclaude rubbed his hands over his face i was going to tell you then you decided you wanted no more hard truths today he lowered his hands and looked at me hes alive id know it if he wasnt yes i believe you would there was a time when my first master made my heart beat her power suffused me made me live but her power came from her master of the city so it was in reality his power that filled me each master vampire that i belonged to demanded blood oaths and each one in turn made my blood course my heart move then belle herself the head of my line brought me in and she filled me she was like the pounding of the ocean and all others before her were but rivers seeking to drown in her embrace gradually i filled with my own power but even now it is her lineage that makes me live the power that made her is what keeps me alive damian is descended from her line not from belle herself but from one of her children as i am i am master of the city and the power that animates me animates damian when he took the oaths that bound him to me that made him loyal to me it became my power that filled him my power that made his heart beat and i broke the tie with she who made him you make all the vampires under you alive i made it a question the power comes through me yes but only if they are of my line my lineage if they are descended from other than belles children then no the blood oaths do not bind as tightly what about asher you dont make his heart beat he nodded very good ma petite no i do not a master vampire is a vampire that has become enough of a power that they fill themselves up it is one of the things that being a master means and one of the reasons that many of the older vampire masters still kill their children when they feel that tie break youre volunteering an awful lot of information and dont think im not grateful its fascinating but what does this all have to do with damian you have raised damian from his coffin once filling him with your necromancy like a zombie you have saved his life twice with your necromancy you have forged a tie between him and you actually i knew that but out loud i said he said that he couldnt tell me no if i gave him a direct order that he wanted to serve me it scared him it should have i didnt mean to do it jeanclaude i didnt even know it was possible legends speak of necromancers that could control all types of undead not merely zombies it was at one time council policy to slay all necromancers on sight gee glad the policy changed yes he said but you severed my tie with damian i did not realize it at first but when he returned from tennessee it was not my power that made his heart beat it was yours i remembered feeling that in tennessee feeling the tie between us it wasnt done deliberately i said i know that but you left me with a problem when you went away for over half a year damian is over a thousand years old though not a master vampire he is still powerful he no longer had ties to any vampire hierarchy it freed him of all blood oaths of all mystically bound loyalties he was yours but you did not come to claim him you should have told me and what would you have done taken him home to live in your basement you did not have the power or control six months ago to deal with him now i do is that what youre saying you cast out belle morte one of the most powerful of the council if you can do that ma petite then you can handle damian this is all great but where is damian i could no longer count on his loyalty i no longer controlled him do you understand ma petite i had a vampire that was more than twice my age and could not control him it both made me look weak in others eyes when i could not afford to appear weak and it was dangerous because he knew when you healed over your aura and shielded so tight it wasnt only richard and me who felt the loss of you you cut damian off and he went a little mad i was scared now my heart beginning to climb up my throat where is damian first ma petite understand that you cannot take him with you tonight because to tend him will be a fulltime job for the first few hours just tell me i said i had to lock him away ma petite i stared at him lock him away how he just looked at me and it was eloquent hes been locked in a crosswrapped coffin for six months about that yes you bastard i could have killed him ma petite thats what others would have done why didnt you because it was partially my fault for exposing him to you damian was mine to protect and i failed him hes mine mine to protect i said yet you deserted him i didnt know you should have told me and six months ago would you have believed me or would you have thought it was some ploy to get you back into my life i started to tell him of course id have believed him but i stopped and thought about it i dont know if id have believed you or not i hoped that i would find a way to reestablish my dominance over him but he is closed to me i swallowed hard and looked at him if hes mine then why didnt i feel him when my shielding broke all to hell in new mexico i have been blocking you from sensing him and it has not been easy i closed my eyes and counted to ten but it didnt help i was so angry my skin felt hot you had no right to do that without the marks being married i think damian would have seduced you because you would have been drawn to him as you are drawn to nathaniel now or perhaps even the nimirraj i would not have fucked damian without the ardeur helping me and i didnt have that six months ago you may have your vampire back tomorrow night i will help you nurse him back to health im coming back tonight to get him talk to asher ma petite ask him what it will take to nurse a vampire back from six months in the coffin damian is not a master he has had no ability to feed or gain energy he will come out of the coffin a starved crazed thing there will be very little left of him at first he was so calm while he said it i didnt know what to say i wanted to hit him but it wouldnt change anything i wasnt even sure it would make me feel better i want him out tonight when i get back from the lupanar you will not be able to tend both your injured wereleopard and damian tonight ask asher and he will tell you how much work goes into such as this one more night will not make a difference to damian and tonight you are trying to prevent war between the leopards and the wolves more than that you are trying to make a strong enough show of force to convince richards enemies that he is too wellallied to be killed you must concentrate on these things tonight ma petite i dont believe you i said he shrugged believe what you like but it will take hours of care to make damian sane again it will take days of care and blood and warmth to bring him back to himself how could you know that and still do this to him my voice didnt even sound angry just tired i learned the lessons of the crosswrapped coffin personally ma petite i have not done to damian anything that has not been done to me you were in it for a few days until i killed the old master of the city he shook his head when i returned to the council with asher and bargained with them the price for them saving his life was my freedom i spent two years inside a coffin unable to feed unable to sit up unable he was hugging his arms holding himself i know that what i have done to damian is a terrible thing but my only alternative was to kill him would you have preferred that no yet i see the accusation in your eyes i am a monster because of what i have done to him but you would feel me more a monster if i had killed him or perhaps you would have preferred that i let him go into the city streets and slaughter people damian would never do that he went mad ma petite he became an alien do you remember the couple that was slaughtered about six months ago i saw several slaughtered couples over the last year youll need to be more specific he was angry now too great we could be angry together they were in a car at a stoplight the front of the car was dented as if they had hit a body but no body was found yeah i remember that one they had their throats torn out the woman had tried to defend herself she had wounds on her arms where something had clawed at her asher found damian wandering a few blocks from the car he was covered in blood he fought asher and it took over half a dozen of us to bind him and bring him home was i supposed to let him wander the streets after that you should have called me i said and what you would have executed him if insanity is a viable plea in your court system then he cannot be held accountable but your court system does not give us the same privileges it gives humans we cannot plead insanity and live i saw that crime scene it didnt look like a vampire did it it looked more like a shapeshifter but but the marks were wrong i shook my head it was vicious a vicious animal oui and so i locked him away and hoped that you would come home to us or sense his plight at first i did nothing to block him from reaching you but you did not come i didnt know you knew that damian was yours and yet you did not ask about him you cast him away i didnt know i said again each word tight with anger and i had no choice anita i had to put him away do you think the insanity is permanent he shrugged arms still hugging his body if you were a vampire and he your vampire child i would say no but you are not vampire you are necromancer and i simply do not know if he stays that crazy he will have to be destroyed jeanclaude said voice soft i didnt mean for this to happen nor did i we stood there for a few moments while i thought about everything and jeanclaude either thought about it too or just stood there if all youre saying is true then you had no choice i said but you are still angry with me you will still punish me for it i glared up at him what do you want me to say that knowing youve shoved him in a box for six months takes the sparkle out of our relationship yeah it bothers me under normal circumstances you would rescue damian and avoid me for a time until your anger cooled i nodded yeah thats about right but you will need me ma petite in these first few nights you will need another vampire with the same hungers to teach you control cant live with you cant live without you is that it i hope your anger cools before you need my help again but i fear it will not remember this ma petite that the ardeur is not bound by morals or even by your preferences if you fight it long enough hard enough you will eventually give in and it will be out of your control who it chooses so do this one thing for me if you cannot forgive me right away keep always by your side either nathaniel or the nimirraj not for my sake but for yours for i think of the two of us i would forgive you sooner for sleeping with strangers than you would we pretty much left the conversation there i found asher and had him confirm the story hell i waited for willie mccoy to climb out of his coffin and heard the story from him damian had gone apeshit and killed a couple that apparently hit him with their car the man had gotten out to check on whoever they hit they had hurt him and damian struck out killing the man but the woman hed climbed into the car after her we might have to kill him because i hadnt understood what my magic meant to damian i hadnt understood a lot of things i drove out in the soft summer dusk with nathaniel riding beside me it had been a very long day i was going to go home and pick up rafael and the wererats and micah and his pard hed left a number at the shapeshifter hospital and id called for it i almost didnt call but we needed backup tonight my embarrassment was a small price to pay if i had been in contact with jeanclaude and richard for the last half year i probably could have talked richard out of doing all the shit hed done to his pack id come home to try and reestablish a relationship or two but i was mostly cleaning up the mess that my absence had made richard might be dead at the full moon and jacob ulfric damian might be permanently crazy and have to be destroyed the couple that had hit him with their car would have been alive if id known what the hell my magic was doing id avoided a lot of mariannes teachings because it was too much like pure witchcraft for my monotheistic beliefs but i knew now that i had to understand how my powers worked i couldnt afford to be squeamish god kept telling me i was okay with him i wasnt evil but at some level i didnt believe it at some level i thought that witchcraft raising the dead wasnt very christian if god was okay with me doing it then what was my problem id prayed about it often enough and gotten the answer more than once the answer was to do it that this was what i needed to be doing if god was for it then who was i to question it look where my arrogance had gotten us two dead one crazy and if richard lost the pack thered be a lot more dead i felt a quietness inside me as i drove usually the touch of god is golden and warm but sometimes when ive been really slow and not picked up on what hes wanted for me i get this kind of quiet sadness like a parent watching a child learn a necessary hard lesson id never once prayed to god about richard and jeanclaude not about who to choose anyway it just hadnt seemed right to ask god to help me choose a lover especially when i thought i knew who hed pick i mean vampires are evil right but driving through the falling darkness feeling his soft presence fill the car i realized that i hadnt asked because id been afraid of the answer i drove and i prayed and i didnt get an answer but i knew he heard me it was full dark when we pulled up in front of my house almost every light in the house was on like i was giving a party and no one had bothered to tell me the driveway was full and overflowing onto the road one of the reasons id rented the house was because i had no near neighbors to get caught up in whatever crisis i was having my crises usually involved gunfire so no neighbors to get hurt had been my primary requisite in a house there was no one around to peek out a window and wonder what the hell was going on next door just trees and the lonely road neither of which cared what i did or at least i didnt think the trees cared though marianne might tell me im wrong on that one you never know i ended up parking quite a ways down from the house with nothing but trees on either side of the road i turned off the engine and nathaniel and i sat in the dark listening to the engine tick he hadnt said much since i came back out of the bathroom at jeanclaudes nothing at all on the fortyminute drive here but then neither had i id left jeanclaude in a huff with a firm date to come back tomorrow night and get damian out of hock it wasnt just damian locked away all these months that made me not want to be with jeanclaude it was that he had finally changed me into one of the monsters i already knew that sex with him bound the marks closer but now that the marks were married what would sex do to us now how much closer could the marks bind us all was it just changes with jeanclaude or did i have mystical surprises coming up tonight with richard too chances were likely and jeanclaude really had no clue what the surprises might be he didnt know what he was doing he really didnt since i didnt know what the hell i was doing either and richard had no clue that left us in a bad place id call marianne tomorrow on the theory that one magic is much like another but until then i was on my own big surprise of course i wasnt exactly alone i looked across the front seat at nathaniel he looked back at me face peaceful hands in his lap seat belt still in place hed pulled his hair back into a thick braid leaving his face very plain and unadorned in the moonlight his eyes looked pale gray instead of their usual vibrant violet without the hair or the eyes showing he looked closer to normal than id ever seen him he was suddenly a person sitting across from me and i realized with a shock that i didnt really think of nathaniel as a person not as a grownup separate human being kind of person anyway he was more a burden than a person to me someone to be rescued helped he was a cause a project but not a person the heat began to press in around the jeep if we sat here much longer id have to turn the air conditioning back on if jeanclaude was right then id had sex with nathaniel earlier tonight i was hoping jeanclaude wasnt right because i still considered nathaniel a child an abused child you took care of them you did not have sex with them not even if they wanted you to my breast was aching faintly from his teeth marks wed shared a bed so often that it felt odd when he wasnt beside me but i still didnt see him as a grownup sad but true jeanclaude is pretty sure that the ardeur is well fed enough that it wont be an issue for the rest of the night i said nathaniel nodded you wont need to feed again until youve slept for a few hours jeanclaude explained it to me a little that pissed me off he did did he he shook his head anita hes worried about you ill bet you really arent going to sleep at the circus tonight are you no i said i was sitting back in the seat with my arms crossed over my stomach im sure i looked as stubborn as i felt and when you get up tomorrow what then his voice was very soft in the hot dark car i dont know what you mean yes you do he said i sighed i dont want to do this nathaniel i dont want to have jeanclaudes incubus inside me id rather be nimirra for real than have to feed off of others and if youre both he asked voice even softer i shrugged arms still crossed but hugging me more than being stubborn now i dont know ill be there for you anita be where i looked at him tomorrow when you wake what else did jeanclaude tell you while i was running around trying to find out about damian nathaniels gaze never wavered never changed he wasnt embarrassed or bothered in the least about the conversation that he wouldnt hold a grudge if you had real sex with me i studied his face you dont consider what we did today sex i made it halfquestion halfstatement no he said i dont either but i was glad it was dark because i was blushing but damn it i wanted someone else to answer this question i know why i dont think today was actual sex but why dont you he smiled and did look away he answered looking down at the floorboard what we did the first time with you marking my back that was closer to real sex for me so it was the dominancesubmission thing no he said still looking down if wed really needed the condoms then it would have been sex you mean intercourse i said he nodded still not looking at me thats how i feel too jeanclaude said i was fooling myself nathaniel flashed me a small smile then went back to staring at nothing he told me i was being very american very male and very young you are american male and twenty i said what else are you supposed to be he looked at me for a moment then looked away again he was definitely uncomfortable now what else did jeanclaude say i asked youll be mad just tell me nathaniel he shrugged the thin straps of the tank top showing most of his shoulders as he did it hes hoping youll choose me as your pomme de sang he said he mentioned it to you he mentioned it can i undo the seat belt he asked be my guest he let the belt slide to one side and turned so he was facing me one leg drawn up into the seat his braid curled over one shoulder jeanclaude said that the more you fight the ardeur the stronger it grows but if you feed when it first arises then its not such a big deal he told me i said hes afraid youll try and tough it out tomorrow without him hes afraid youll fight it all day then only give in when you have to sounds like a plan to me i said nathaniel shook his head dont be tough on this one anita dont fight im afraid of what will happen if you do what im supposed to roll over tomorrow morning and fall into your arms i couldnt keep the sarcasm out of my voice though it brought a hurt look to his face and made me want to apologize its nothing personal nathaniel its not you its having to do it that i dont like i know that he lowered his face not meeting my eyes again just promise me that when the hunger rises tomorrow that youll turn to me or to someone early and not try to be so tough what were you really going to say on the end of that sentence he smiled stubborn i had to smile i dont think i can just roll over the first time the ardeur hits me i just cant give in that quickly nathaniel do you understand that you have to prove youre tougher than it is he said no i have to be who i am and who i am doesnt just give in to anyone or anything he grinned at me thats an understatement youre making fun of me i said a little he said you saw what i did to jasons neck nathaniel what if i hurt you i mean really hurt you jason will heal anita and he wasnt complaining when asher took him away nathaniel grinned and looked away as if he were trying not to laugh what he shook his head youll get mad and he didnt mean it that way what did he say nathaniel ask him yourself he always seems to be able to say outrageous things to you and you think its cute when i say them you just get mad what if i ordered you to tell me he seemed to think about it for a second then flashed me another smile it was a good smile young relaxed real when id first met nathaniel hed forgotten how to smile like that no no i wouldnt some submissive you are i said the smile widened to a grin you didnt like me submissive it made you uncomfortable so youre changing to please me the smile faded but not like he wasnt happy more like his expression had shifted from humor to thoughtful at first but lately some of its to please me too that made me smile thats the best news ive had all night im glad he said i undid my own seat belt lets get out of this car before we melt i opened the door and knew hed do the same we closed the doors and i hit the button on my key chain that locked the jeep it made the little beeping sound and i walked around the cars to the road where the walking was smoother nathaniel and i started walking down the line of cars towards my house his braid fell along his spine like a long thick tail moving as he walked cherry and zane came out from between the cars just ahead of us we thought youd gotten lost she said smiling you guys let everyone into the house i asked her smile faded yes i hope that was okay i smiled its okay cherry really if id been thinking id have arranged for someone to let them in she relaxed visibly and dropped to her knees in front of me i offered her my left hand i was keeping my right hand free in case i had to draw my gun not likely but you never know cherry gripped my hand in both of hers and rubbed her face against it like a cat marking its scent the other formal greeting involved licking but id finally convinced all of my cats that face rubbing was about all i was comfy with zane went to his knees beside cherry but didnt try to grab my right hand he waited until she was done with my left id also broken them of being grabby with my gun hand he rubbed his face on my hand and there was the faintest roughness alongside his jaw as if hed missed a spot when he shaved cherry rubbed herself against my legs while zane greeted me it was like being bodyrubbed by a really big cat that just happened at the moment to be in human form the first few times it had happened id freaked but it just didnt strike me as that strange anymore i wasnt sure if that was good or sort of sad when the greeting was over zane said weve got the extra key so we took care of the company they were both standing now like good little people alright good tall people whatever good though i had no idea wed have this big a crowd they fell into step one on either side of us and i could feel cherry beside me i could feel her energy like a vibrating line against my body id never sensed her this strongly before just another nail in the coffin on the nimirra question the evidence was getting thick enough that if i hadnt been so damn good at selfdelusion id have had to admit it by now but id had enough for one day i needed a pass on this one tonight so i ignored it and if cherry felt anything different she didnt say it was zane who put his face next to nathaniel and sniffed him as we walked you smell like fresh wounds he touched nathaniels back where it showed above the tank top i knew there were bite marks up around his shoulders all the way up to his neck i should have known we couldnthide it hell even with clothes covering it theyd have smelled it what have you been doing zane asked or should i say who nathaniel didnt even glance at me he was going to leave it all to me what was said and what wasnt smart of him or maybe he just didnt know what to say either i tried to think of a lie that would explain it and nothing that didnt make nathaniel sound slutty came to mind either hed had sex with some strange woman or or what the truth i didnt want to tell the truth until i was sure how i felt about it knowing me that could take at least a couple of days cherry and zane circled nathaniel in evertightening circles until their bodies brushed him as they moved around him they bumped him continuously like a shark testing to see if youre good to eat come on guys we dont have time for this we need to get to the lupanar and rescue gregory zane dropped to his knees beside nathaniel running his hands over the smaller mans body zanes hands slid under nathaniels tank top zane get up i said cherry stepped very close to nathaniel looking down at him putting a hand under his chin to lift his face to her as if she meant to kiss him who was it thats nathaniels business i said nathaniel glanced at me sort of sideways the look was enough i was being a coward my pulse was going way too fast in my neck like id tried to swallow something while it was still trying to get away if it were zane or me yes cherry said but while you were in the hospital these last few days we decided that nathaniel has to run all girlfriends past the pard before he does anything intimate with them as nimirra dont i have like presidential veto cherry looked at me of course but you have to agree with checking out people for nathaniel he nearly got you killed again i did agree but just not that night that night of all nights i wanted everyone to mind their own business no one cared a damn who slept with whom until now it figures i make my first indiscreet move with one of them and i was going to have to confess even though i still didnt know how i felt about it i opened my mouth to say it was me but i stopped when i saw the next wereleopard coming down the street of all of them she was the one i least to talk in front of about intimate matters it was elizabeth her walk was always a cross between a strut and a glide the ultimate hookers walk she strode from between the cars on calebs arm and there was a selfsatisfied smile on her face that said either she didnt know i was angry with her or she was confident i couldnt do anything about it she was taller than caleb by nearly five inches her hair fell in curls to her waist a brunette so dark you would have called it black if you didnt have my hair to compare it to she was pretty in a pouting lush sort of way like some sort of tropical plant with thick fleshy leaves and beautiful but deadly blossoms she was wearing a skirt so short the tops of her black hose and the garters that held them up showed her shoes were black sandals with a lower heel than she usually wore after all we were going to be tramping through the woods the shirt was sheer enough that even by starlight you could see she wasnt wearing a bra and she like me was a woman who needed one caleb was wearing a pair of bellbottom jeans no shoes no shirt the jeans were cut low enough to show off his bellybutton ring i was too young to remember wearing bellbottoms personally but i did remember my older cousins competing to see who could get the widest bell even as a child id thought the pants were ugly time had not changed my opinion caleb looked pretty satisfied himself i was betting theyd had sex together but it wasnt any of my business who they fucked honest it wasnt im glad youve had a good night elizabeth she squeezed calebs arm oh its been a very very good night im glad because its about to get very very bad i said she fakepouted at me oh did our little nimirra get her feelings hurt because i wouldnt come and sleep naked beside her i had to laugh whats so funny she asked caleb started moving away from her pulling free why is it that you dont think ill kill you elizabeth for what she asked oh maybe for deserting nathaniel at the club and letting the bad guys get him which led to me nearly getting killed and maybe becoming nimirra for real im tired of babysitting him she said he used to be a lot of fun but not anymore hes got standards now meaning that he wont fuck you anymore i said the first touch of real anger slid across her face we used to have some real good times nathaniel and me not good enough apparently i said she strode up to stand beside cherry which put her very close to me she wasnt afraid of me and i knew why or thought i did shed been insulting arrogant and a downright pain in the ass since i took over the pard and i hadnt hurt her id let it all slide because as she was so happy to point out i could shoot her but i couldnt really punish her punish to a shapeshifter means either beat the shit out of them or do some mystical crap that scares the shit out of them she was right i couldnt do the shapeshifter stuff it had taken me a while to realize why i let elizabeth slide so much id killed her sweetie the man she loved it made me feel bad gabriel had earned death but she had loved him and i sympathized but shed used up the last of my sympathy when i saw nathaniel hanging from those chains with the swords grown into his flesh the rules had changed and elizabeth didnt know it yet the other wereleopards glided out of the trees trailed down the road merles hair gleamed white in the darkness his beard and mustache silvered he was wearing straightlegged jeans and cowboy boots with silvertipped toes an open leather jacket did more to frame his chest than cover it he had a woman with him she was tall six feet or maybe a little over she was wearing jogging shoes jeans and a baggy tshirt that hung to midthigh the baggy tshirt couldnt hide the fact that she was leggy and well built her hair was almost black straight thick cut just above her shoulders she wore no makeup and the bones of her face made her look sculpted almost harsh her eyes were pale her lips thin she had one of those faces that would have been beautiful with a little makeup but was still striking it was a face you wouldnt forget or grow tired of merle was holding her hand but not like they were a couple more like a father holds a daughters hand a comforting gesture she vibrated with that otherworldly energy that all the leopards had to some degree but this one made my skin dance from yards away when they got close enough for me to see that her eyes were pale i could also see that she was afraid her eyes had that wincing look of a person whos been abused once too often merle introduced her this is gina hi gina i said she looked at me and the fear in her eyes was replaced by disdain shes a little short for a nimirra micah and i are the same height i said she shrugged like i said but her bravado didnt ring true it was more like someone whistling in the dark but i let it go gina wasnt my problem tonight vivian was the last of my leopards and she came alone down the street she was one of the few women who made me feel protective and made me think of adjectives like dolllike and delicate she was simply one of the most beautiful women id ever seen and the casual shorts and striped tank top with sandals couldnt hide that she was africanamerican by way of ireland and her skin was that flawless pale cocoa shade that you only get with that particular mixture she looked sort of lost and i realized why i hadnt seen her without stephen at her side in over a year stephen was gregorys identical twin also a stripper at guilty pleasures stephen and vivian were living together and seemed very happy doing it but stephen was at the lupanar tonight like all good werewolves and she was here with the leopards poor vivian poor stephen i hadnt really thought until that moment that stephen might lose a brother tonight shit vivian dropped to her knees in front of me and i offered her my hands she took them in her hands then rubbed her face against them as cherry and zane had done elizabeth hadnt offered a greeting and it was an insult the others werent my leopards but she was and shed deliberately snubbed me it was the first time in front of company i didnt usually insist on it because i didnt like elizabeth touching me but i watched calebs face as vivian rose from her greeting hed noticed the oversight how you doing vivian a real nimirra wouldnt have to ask elizabeth said i squeezed vivians hands and helped her stand are you going to help us rescue gregory or just be a big pain in the ass i asked elizabeth i want gregory safe she said then shut the fuck up she started to say something and cherry gripped her arm thats enough elizabeth youre not dominant to me elizabeth said im trying to be your friend cherry said you want me to leave her alone please cherry said fine elizabeth said she turned back to nathaniel i can smell fresh blood on you nathaniel she put her arms on either side of his neck hands clasped together her body pressed the length of his moving cherry back you finally find someone to top you yes he said who cherry asked we really dont have time for this i said we need to get to the lupanar merle had to add his two cents worth the only reason that elizabeth treats you the way she does is that you let her disobedience must be punished immediately or the power structure cannot survive much like your local ulfric and his pack i control my leopards i said elizabeth laughed planting a big kiss on nathaniels forehead and leaving a red lipstick print behind he fucked someone tonight when hed been forbidden to be with anyone without pard approval and youre going to let that slide too you are so weak i took a deep breath and let it out he didnt fuck anyone tonight caleb had joined the others crawling around nathaniel he plunged his face into nathaniels groin elizabeth moved back so he could do it i smell sperm but not pussy this after i knew that nathaniel had washed thoroughly caleb stood and elizabeth moved back he put his hand behind nathaniels neck and moved their faces together as if they were going to kiss but he stopped just short of their lips touching i dont smell pussy here either i dont think he had sex zane raised nathaniels shirt as far as he could reach from his knees then stood pushing the shirt up to nathaniels neck the bite marks were almost black in the starlight there was a bite mark on almost every inch of his back the edges didnt touch but i hadnt missed much it made me blush vivian looked at me and i realized that she could probably smell the blood rushing to my cheeks zane said he might not have had sex but he had something caleb came around to gaze at nathaniels naked back someone had fun look at this elizabeth said she drew them around to the front and the bite mark around his nipple they ran their fingers over it and zane pulled nathaniels shirt off and threw it on the hood of the nearest car everyone but merle gina and vivian swarmed nathaniel touching the wounds with fingers hands and tongues nathaniels head went back eyes closed and i knew he wasnt exactly having a bad time but thats enough i said elizabeth pulled nathaniels shorts down and i got a glimpse of just how notunhappy he was i yelled thats enough elizabeth turned on her knees her hands on his butt whoever did this could have just as easily done more damage they could have cut him up bad and he would have let them do it wouldnt you have nathaniel i would have let her do anything she wanted he said shit you cant let him do this cherry said standing and coming to me you cant let him skate on this anita or the next time whoever she is might just kill him she wont kill him i said you know who it is she asked i nodded why didnt you say so merle asked i took a deep breath and blew it out because im not comfortable with it yet but thats my problem not nathaniels i held my hand out to him nathaniel he pulled his shorts up so he could walk and came to me squeezing my hand as he took it i put him behind me the line of our bodies touching physical contact was a way of saying he was under my protection i marked him elizabeth laughed still on her knees i know hes your favorite but i never thought youd outright lie for him at least some of you can smell it if i lie i marked his body my teeth marks your anxiety level has been high since we got here i cant tell if youre lying merle said and if i cant tell then no one else here is alpha enough to be sure its gotten so that your scent doesnt change when you lie cherry said id heard of lying with your eyes but never with your scent i didnt know you could do that lie with your smell i think lying just doesnt make you anxious anymore she said oh being a sociopath does have its benefits i said caleb crawled towards us in that gliding crawl the leopards could do it was inhumanly graceful he came close enough to put his face against my leg i let him because i figured that theyd get around to smelling me if i claimed nathaniel i just hadnt planned on it being one of micahs cats first he does have her scent on his skin they sleep in the same bed most nights elizabeth said she was on her feet hadnt even snagged her hose caleb rubbed his face against my leg she smells of wolf and vampire he gazed up at me did you do your ulfric and your master last night is that why nathaniel doesnt smell like pussy because there wasnt a hole left for him id tried to keep my version of an open mind but i decided then and there that i didnt like caleb the pard has a right to question who nathaniel sleeps with because he doesnt have good judgment none of you have the right to question me caleb moved in one of those toofasttosee motions and shoved his face into my groin hard enough that it almost hurt i pulled the browning without thinking about it and had it pressed against his skull before i realized it faster than normal even for me caleb raised his head back so that his forehead was pressed against the end of the gun he stared up at me you dont smell like dick dont tell me you had at least three men with you in a bed and nobody got to fuck you caleb im really beginning not to like you he grinned but you wont shoot me because that would make micah mad youre right i shouldnt have pulled the gun im just not used to being able to draw a gun before i have time to think about it ive never seen you move that fast zane said i shrugged benefits of the change i guess i put the browning back i wasnt going to shoot him for just being obnoxious caleb rested his cheek against my thigh and i let him my struggling would just amuse him and he was behaving himself relatively speaking vivian touched my arm are you really going to be one of us well know in about two weeks i said i am sorry she said i smiled at her thanks you didnt top nathaniel elizabeth said youre too squeamish to use teeth on him like that i looked at her and i let the darkness fill my eyes that was my own version of a beast the look that said just how far down the well id fallen im not as squeamish as i used to be elizabeth you might want to remember that no she said no youre protecting him hes been teachers pet since day one youre just afraid of what micah will do afraid of what a real nimirraj will do to him now that hes disobeyed a direct order she stalked over to us and you should be afraid anita you should be very afraid because micahs strong strong the way gabriel was strong he doesnt flinch ive heard enough about gabriel to wonder if thats a compliment micah came out of the woods with a tall man beside him before micah id never slept with a man that id just met id never slept with anyone that didnt make my heart beat faster my skin react to the sight of him as micah glided from the trees he was graceful and handsome but i wasnt in love with him and my body didnt react like i was i was both relieved and a little ashamed of that he was wearing shorts that had been cut off and allowed to go ragged at the hem a white tank top seemed to glow in the dark making his tan look even darker a wide leather belt encircled his slender waist hed tied his hair back in a ponytail but it was so curly that it didnt give the illusion of short hair you knew even from the front that there was a lot more hair behind him he seemed more delicate in clothes than he had without them maybe i just hadnt been paying attention to how small boned he was there was something graceful in the way he was made fine bones smooth skin very refined especially for a man jeanclaude was prettier but he was too tall to ever be called delicate micah was delicate the only thing that saved him from looking fragile was the play of muscles in his arms the way he walked like the world was his and everywhere he moved he was the center of the universe it wasnt so much confidence as surety so much potential in such a small package he reminded me of somebody the man trailing behind micah was dark complected with very short close cut hair and there was something about his skin tone even by starlight that didnt look tan he was handsome in a young almost preppy sort of way but muscled and very alert that explained why merle hadnt been glued to micahs side wed had a change of guard micah introduced him as noah id dreaded seeing micah again wondered what id say how id feel i wasnt nearly as uncomfortable as id thought id be maybe id have been more so if i hadnt been trying to defend nathaniels honor maybe because i didnt give any sign of what wed done micah didnt either or maybe he was as confused as i was about it or maybe thats how casual sex works i just didnt know what is everyone so tense about micah asked show him nathaniel nathaniel never questioned just stepped out from behind me and showed his back to the two men the bodyguard gave a sharp whistle micahs eyes widened and he looked over nathaniels shoulder at me you did this i nodded she didnt elizabeth said caleb had risen as far as he could on his knees and was sniffing my stomach his face pointed towards other things but he was careful not to touch them i dont think he would have sniffed my groin in front of micah elizabeth was right on one thing the leopards just werent as afraid of me as they were of micah she smells of blood too caleb said get away from me i said he smirked but he crawled away are you saying she has a wound on her like what he has on his back elizabeth asked caleb nodded as he crawled then shes lying whoever did his back did her too i sighed am i really going to have to prove this i would take your word micah said but apparently your pard wont its just that weve wanted you to take one of us like this for so long cherry said and now i think wed have believed sex but not this it just doesnt look like your work and elizabeths right about one thing nathaniel is your favorite and you do protect him great no one believed me fine just fine i said i started sliding out of the shoulder holster to let it flop at my back pulling my shirt out of my jeans wasnt a problem even taking it off and laying it beside nathaniels shirt on the car hood wasnt a problem i was wearing a very nice black bra it was meant to be seen jeanclaude had been a very bad influence on my wardrobe the problem was taking off the bra i really didnt want to do that i undid the back but held the front in place what happens when you see the bite mark if you show me a bite mark on your breast that doesnt have fang marks in it ill believe it was nathaniel micah said everyone had crowded close i never liked being the center of attention not for this kind of thing give me a little breathing space guys they moved back a fraction of a step and i thought screw it everyone here except elizabeth and maybe the new bodyguard had seen me naked oh hell i slipped the bra off and laid it on the hood with my shirt i made absolutely no eye contact a hand came into view and i grabbed the wrist it was caleb nathaniel gets to take a bite and i cant even touch it no you cant i said micah didnt come any closer why did you mark him i met his eyes expecting to see accusation or disdain or something negative but his face was very still i needed to sink my teeth into something i needed i shook my head and looked away it wasnt sex i wanted i wanted to feed no elizabeth came crowding close no you cant be nimirra for real not for real there was something close to panic on her face i could smell her fear she moved close enough that our bodies almost touched and i could hear her heart thundering be afraid elizabeth be very afraid i said she halfturned away from me and micah said something at the same time which is my only excuse for not seeing her fist coming she rocked me back against the side of the jeep filling my mouth with blood and making my knees go weak only cherry catching me around the waist kept me standing the world swam in black and white streamers for a second when my vision cleared elizabeth was being held by micah and noah the bodyguard i pushed myself upright and stepped away from cherry she kept hold of my arm and i let her for a second while i let the last of the vertigo slip away i put a hand to my mouth and came away with blood merle moved up to take elizabeths arm and micah came to stand in front of me are you alright ill be okay he touched my bare arms it was the lightest brush of fingertips but it made me shiver my nipples grew hard and there was nothing i could do to hide the sudden reaction i looked at him and i didnt have to look up for it not even an inch i dont know you why his arms slid behind my back pressed our bodies together and i suddenly couldnt get enough air i am your nimirraj anita there is no shame in that you say nimirraj like other people say husband he ran one hand through my hair until his fingers were tight to my scalp the other hand at the small of my back our souls resonate like the sound of two perfect bells he whispered as his mouth hovered over mine the comment was so romantic it was stupid and i should have laughed at it but i didnt he kissed me a push of his lips then his tongue slipped into my mouth i knew when he tasted my blood because his hands tightened on my body and his body reacted against me he was too large for me not to feel him grow hard between our bodies i ran my hands over his arms his shirt and it wasnt enough i wanted to touch his bare skin to mine to drink in every inch of him into every inch of me he kissed me as if he would drink me in and i knew that part of the excitement was the fresh blood i pulled his shirt out of his pants and ran my hands up his back but it wasnt enough he drew back from the kiss and i pulled his shirt over his head just pressing our bare chests against each other was better it was as if my skin craved his skin id never felt anything like it we held each other both breathing too hard our arms locked around each other faces pressed to each others shoulders his breath hot on my neck we dont have time for more he whispered i nodded my head still against his neck it wasnt like id been planning on more but i had to touch my skin to yours why i told you you are my nimirra and i am your nimirraj i pulled back enough to see his face that doesnt explain it to me he held my face in his hands making very serious eye contact we are a mated pair anita its legend among the leopards that you can find your perfect mate and from the first moment you have sex youre bound more than marriage more than law we will always crave each other our souls will always call to each other our beasts will always hunt together it should have scared me but it didnt it should have made me angry but it didnt i should have felt a lot of things but all i really felt was that he was right and i didnt even want to try and talk him out of it richards going to love this elizabeth said merle and noah took her down to her knees in an abrupt gesture that had to hurt a little i looked at her thanks for reminding me what i was about to do elizabeth i got distracted i drew away from micah my fingers trailing down his arm as if i couldnt quite bear to let go of him let her go boys shes my problem not yours they looked to micah who nodded elizabeth stayed on her knees as if uncertain what to do she tried to get one of them to help her to her feet but they ignored her and left her to stand on her own i took time to put my bra on as i walked back to my jeep the shoulder holster still flapping around my waist i slipped it over my naked skin and it was not comfortable but i didnt want to take the time to put my shirt on i knew what i was going to do now i walked to my jeep and everyone waited in the dark while i unlocked the door scooted into the passenger seat opened my glove compartment and got out a spare clip of lead bullets id started carrying an extra clip of lead bullets in the jeep since i ran afoul of a few rogue fairies you can shoot the fey with silver all day and it wont do much but lead they didnt like lead lead also had other uses because it wouldnt kill a wereanimal only silver would do that i walked back towards them popping out the clip that was in the gun as i moved i put the clip in my pocket though it didnt fit well and shoved the new clip home until it clicked elizabeth finally started looking worried when i was about two cars away anyone else would probably have been running but common sense wasnt one of elizabeths strong suits i had actually pointed the gun at her while i very calmly walked closer before she said you wouldnt dare i stared down the barrel of the gun at her and i felt nothing it was a big cold empty place inside me utterly calm peaceful but at the center of that empty peacefulness was a tiny kernel of satisfaction id been wanting to do this for a long time i shot her twice in the chest while she was still telling me i wouldnt shoot her she went over backwards spine bowing hands scrabbling at the road legs kicking while she tried to breathe everyone had cleared a big space around her i stood over her and stared down while she tried to breathe and her heart struggled to beat around the hole id put in it you keep saying i cant kill you like a real nimirra by tearing your throat out or gutting you maybe thats going to change soon but until then i can shoot you and youll be just as dead her eyes rolled desperately while her body tried to cope with the damage blood welled out of her mouth this time it wasnt silver but fail me again elizabeth in anything large or small fail any member of this pard and i will kill you shed finally gotten enough air to talk she spat out blood and the words bitch you dont even more blood have the guts dark blood from her mouth to shoot me for real staring down at her i realized something i hadnt before elizabeth wanted me to kill her she wanted me to send her to wherever gabriel was she probably didnt realize thats what she wanted but if it wasnt a death wish it was close enough she lay there and healed and cursed me and told me how weak i was i shot her in the chest again she writhed and jerked and the pool of blood just grew wider underneath her body i let the ammo clip fall into my hand from the gun put it in my other pocket and got my main clip back in the gun silver now elizabeth any more smart remarks i waited until she had healed enough to talk answer me elizabeth she stared up at me and there was something in her eyes something that said we finally had an understanding she was afraid of me and sometimes thats the best you can do with people id tried kindness id tried friendship id tried respect but when all else fails fear will do the job good elizabeth im glad we understand each other i turned to the others they were staring at me like id sprouted a second head a nasty one micah held out my clothes to me and i slipped the shoulder holster off and the clothes on no one said anything while i dressed when everything was back in place i said shall we go to the house now caleb looked positively ill micah looked pleased so did merle and gina and all my leopards you will not be allowed guns tonight in the lupanar merle said thats what the knives are for i said he looked at me as if he wasnt sure whether i was serious or not smile merle shell heal im beginning to agree with what the wererats said and what was that that you were scary enough all on your own without being nimirra this isnt even close to as scary as i get i said he raised his eyebrows at me really it was nathaniel who said really my other cats echoed him nodding then why arent you afraid of her gina asked because she doesnt try to be scary to us zane said he looked down at elizabeth on the ground still unable to move much of course maybe the rules have changed only for bad little leopards i said lets get to the rats and go see the wolves and the swans micah said swans i asked he smiled you just keep making conquests anita even when you dont mean to do it he held his hand out to me i hesitated then slowly i took it our fingers interlaced and we walked together handinhand down the road and it felt good and right like id found a piece of myself that was missing i left zane behind to make sure elizabeth didnt get run over by a car wed send dr lillian back for her the rest of the leopards followed behind micah and me and for the first time since id inherited the cats i felt like i really was nimirra and maybe just maybe i wouldnt fail them rafael the rat king had a black limo hed never struck me as a limo kind of guy and i said as much he said marcus and raina used to put on quite a show for things like this i and my rats are not willing to make a spectacle of ourselves so the limo hey i wore makeup i said that had made him smile we were riding in the back of the limo with one of his wererats driving merle and zane were in the front with the driver merle because hed objected to us all being split up among people he didnt know and zane because i just didnt completely trust merle yet though i had no illusions about which of them would win the fight if it came to that richard had a werewolf or two that i would have bet on against merle but there was something downright scary about micahs head bodyguard a something that all of my leopards lacked not ruthlessness more an ultimate practicality you just knew merle would do whatever needed to be done no hesitation no sympathy just business when thats pretty much how you operate yourself you begin to recognize it in other people and you watch them closely all the leaders got to ride in the back of the limo which smacked of elitism to me but it did allow us all to talk together and no one else seemed to have a problem with it i wasnt sure why it bugged me but it did rafael was tall dark handsome and strongly mexican he spoke with no trace of an accent or rather he sounded like he was from missouri he sat facing us yes us micah and i sat across from him we were not holding hands we were not casting longing glances at each other in fact strangely once i was away from the other leopards i was uncomfortable around him maybe it was my usual discomfort that always set in after intimacy but i wasnt sure it felt different or maybe it was the closer we got to seeing richard the more i wondered what the hell i was doing was i really going to tell richard that id taken a lover another shapeshifter wed broken up before and gotten back together but if richard thought id taken a permanent lover besides jeanclaude it was over i didnt want it to be over though part of me wasnt at all sure that dating richard was healthy for either of us we werent really good for each other love is like that sometimes i pushed away serious thoughts and looked at the last member of our little party donovan reece was the new swan king in town he was about six feet tall though it was hard to tell exactly while he was sitting down his skin was that flawless milk and cream complexion that the beauty aids promise when tan is out for a year or two but donovans was the real deal he was whiter than i was as white as jeanclaude but there was a slight pink flush to donovans cheeks like perfectly applied blush you could almost see the blood flowing under his skin as if it were nearly translucent he not only looked alive but very alive as if hed be hot to the touch his eyes were a pale bluegray that shifted with his moods like a summer sky that couldnt make up its mind whether it wanted to be peaceful with fluffy white clouds or rain all over your head he was handsome in a cleancut preppy sort of way as if he should have been on a college campus somewhere pledging to a frat and chugging beers instead he was going with us into a gathering of werewolves where he would be the only nonpredator there that didnt sound like a good idea to me you saved my swanmanes ms blake you nearly got yourself killed doing it i couldnt risk the girls coming they are not he looked down at his folded hands then raised those changeable eyes to me they are like your nathaniel victims nathaniel is driving my jeep with the rest of my people in it i said reece nodded yes but the shape of his beast is a predator my girls are not if they lost control and changed during the meeting they would be meat i agree with you mr reece but doesnt the same logic apply to you i am a swan king ms blake i will not change shape unless i will it so will it so id never heard anyone put it quite that way donovan reece had a bad case of arrogance i wasnt going to talk him out of this rafael had been trying to before i arrived micah never offered hed been very good about letting me do all the talking i liked that in a man can you fight i asked i will not be a burden ms blake dont worry i was worried because i could smell the blood just under his skin i could almost see it flowing under his flesh he smelled like meat and blood and heat he smelled like food id been around shapeshifters that were prey animals but id never realized you could tell by smell what wasnt a predator i knew by the gentle scent of him that reeces beast was something soft and easily killed something that would struggle but not hurt me i had to swallow hard trying to slow my pulse but it would not slow i wanted to drop on my knees in front of him and sniff his skin rub my face against his bare arms until the short sleeves of his buttonup shirt stopped me a white undershirt peeked out the top of the blue and white striped shirt i wanted to rip the shirt open send the buttons popping through the air take a knife from my wrist sheath and slit the undershirt bare his naked chest and stomach but it wasnt the ardeur it wasnt sex i was thinking about i wanted to see his stomach bare to feel the soft tissue under my mouth my teeth to bite into i covered my eyes with my hands and shook my head what was wrong with me micah touched my arm gently anita whats wrong i lowered my hands and looked at him he smells like food micah nodded yes i shook my head again you dont understand what im thinking its frightening i couldnt say it out loud i wanted to feed on him or at least sink my teeth into his flesh i think i could keep from actually feeding but the urge to mark that flawless skin was so strong that i almost didnt trust myself when you told me why you marked nathaniel i knew it was the hunger micah said the last word like it should have been in capital letters it usually takes a few days or weeks before your first full moon to have the hunger become a problem its okay to have thoughts images in your head about feeding its normal normal i laughed but it was a harsh sound what im thinking isnt even close to normal again i couldnt bring myself to say it out loud what do you want to do to reece rafael asked i looked across the seat at him i opened my mouth to say then glanced at reece and stopped no its like telling a sexual fantasy in front of the stranger you just had the fantasy about it feels that intimate it is that intimate rafael said i looked back at him and his dark eyes held my gaze if you tell mr reece what youre wanting to do to him then maybe hell fly home a rat is a prey animal too reece said everything that is smaller is a prey animal rafael said but rats are omnivorous they eat anything that crosses their path including humans if they cant get away a wererat is not a small thing mr reece we are large enough to be the predators that our namesakes cannot be reece was scowling at us all now he shook his head angrily and leaned forward and shoved his wrist into my face get a good whiff all of you seem to like it i wouldnt do that if i were you rafael said listen to him reece micah said i didnt say anything because the scent of his flesh so close was intoxicating it was like the most exotic perfume spread across silk sheets with an undertone of fresh baked bread and some sweet jelly spread over flesh i had no word for it but it smelled better than anything id ever smelled in my life i was holding his wrist pressing the thin skin against my lips before i realized what i was doing the skin was so tender and i could smell the blood under that paperthin layer of skin i wanted to do more than smell it i wanted to taste it to feel his flesh give under my teeth to have the blood gush warm in my mouth to i jerked away from him and crawled across micah across the seat to huddle in the far corner as far away from the swan king as i could get and not jump out the door there must have been something on my face in my eyes that scared him because his eyes widened his full mouth opened slightly my god your control really is that bad i managed to say sorry do you really want to put yourself in the midst of hundreds of us rafael asked i wont be bluffed reece said you wont hurt me from everything ive heard about anita and you rafael youre the good guys his gaze flicked to micah him i dont know but i do know that the swans have never thrown their allegiance to anyone weve been autonomous the fact that im supporting anita and her pard will mean something to the wolves we are weak as battle allies but that any animal other than her own would ally with her pard will mean something to their ulfric i huddled on the far corner of the seat arms hugging my legs to my chest a position not really meant to be performed while wearing a shoulder holster but i was literally holding on to myself hugging my control and my body how was i ever going to get through tonight without doing something embarrassing or deadly how much worse was my control going to get your last swan king answered to their nowdeceased lupa rafael said so ive heard though technically he was a swan prince not a king i dont know what he owed the old lupa but id guess it was something blackmailable because ive found some polaroids that would make you blush i had to clear my throat twice before i could talk kaspar refused to be in rainas dirty movies but the price for that was that he helped audition people for the films reece looked at me audition what do you mean i huddled and talked but i was talking over the pulse in my head the rush of blood in my body i wanted to be next to reece i wanted to take a bite instead i talked kaspar could change form from swan to man at will raina used him to see if nonshapeshifters freaked when he changed in the middle of sex i felt micahs reaction even from a distance reece looked horrified you saw this no but raina took great delight in telling me about it in detail she tried to get me to watch one of his auditions but i had better things to do he did this willingly reece asked no i said it was most definitely not his choice he seemed to hate it we see the fact that we can change forms at will as a great gift were one of the few shapeshifters that can do it with ease is that because your gift is either a curse or a born talent rather than a disease we think so he said kaspar was under a curse i said are you wondering about me actually i was watching the way his adams apple bobbed when he talked and wondering what it would feel like to fix teeth in his throat but that was probably a fact best kept to myself i kept talking but i think both micah and rafael knew how ragged my control was i hugged myself and kept talking because silence filled with awful images terrible desires yeah im wondering i said i was born a swan king you were born a swan king not a swanmane does that mean youre male is swanmane only used for women he looked at me studying my face i was born to be their king im the first king in over a century everybody else is chosen to lead or fights for the right but you make it sound like a hereditary monarchy i said it is but its not bloodlines that makes the difference though being a swanmane either runs in your family or it doesnt but i didnt inherit the title then how did you know i asked his eyes had gotten dark dark gray like storm clouds the answer to that is somewhat intimate im sorry i didnt know ill give you the answer you seek if you answer a rather delicate question for me we stared at each other my heart rate was almost normal again i could look at him without smelling the blood under his skin talking listening doing somewhat normal things had helped i was a person with speech and higher functions not an animal i could do this really i eased out of my little ball slowly ask and ill let you know i said did you kill kaspar gunderson the last swan king i blinked at him that was unexpected the sheer surprise made my pulse rate speed up a touch no no i didnt do you know who did i blinked at him again i wondered if i could lie and if he would be able to tell or not i finally stuck to the truth yes who i shook my head that i wont answer why not because i would have killed kaspar myself if he hadnt gotten away i know he was responsible for several deaths and that he tried to kill you and some of your friends reece said it was a little more diabolical than that i said he was taking money from hunters and supplying them with shifters reece nodded he also made the swanmanes in his care into victims i think thats what he and the old lupa shared sexual sadism thats why your girls as you put it were at the club with nathaniel yes i dont play those sorts of games and theyve grown to crave it i nodded i sympathize i said youve answered my questions truthfully i can do no less he started unbuttoning his shirt i looked at micah who shrugged i looked at rafael who shook his head nice that none of us knew why he was undressing he left the overshirt tucked in but started pulling the undershirt out of his pants he was about to bare his soft underbelly and i wasnt a hundred percent sure my control was up to seeing it my pulse was in my throat again since apparently neither of the men was going to ask i asked why are you undressing to show you the symbol of my kingship i stared at him excuse me reece frowned at me dont worry ms blake im not about to flash you im not worried about you flashing me reece its that but i never finished because hed bared the white white skin of his stomach in the darkened car i could still see the pulse just behind his belly button hell i could almost taste it in my mouth as if id already sunk teeth into that tender flesh as if i was already eating my way through to more vital things something was odd about the hair on his chest it was almost too fine too thin too delicate running in a dainty white line down the center of his chest and spreading in an upside down triangle around his belly button then down into his pants i was on the floorboard crawling towards him and i didnt remember getting there i stopped pressed against micahs legs i dont remember leaving my seat im losing time micah put his hands on my shoulders it happens when your beast controls you at first the first few full moons will be almost complete blackouts until you can begin to access the memories and that will take work reece had leaned back across the seat halfreclining and started to undo his belt this close i could see or thought i saw what was wrong with the hair on his chest and stomach i tried to move forward but micah held me hands tightening on my shoulders i stretched out my hand and could brush fingertips over reeces stomach the light touch of my fingers over his skin made him stop fussing with his belt made him look at me it wasnt hair feathers i said softly like the down on a baby chicken so soft i wanted to run my hands over the surprising texture of it to roll my body across the feathers and the heat of his skin i could hear his heart in his chest pounding and when i looked up i met his gaze his pulse was in his neck like a trapped thing and i could taste his fear that one touch of my hand the soft dreamy quality of my voice had frightened him micahs arms wrapped around my neck and shoulders and drew me in against his body with his legs on either side of me he leaned over me his face pressed to mine and said ssshhh anita ssshhh but it was more than a soothing voice i could feel his beast calling to mine as if hed rolled his hand through my body but so much larger and that touch made my body tighten grow wet it brought my own pulse into my throat what did you do i sounded breathless the hunger can be turned to sex micah said i wasnt going to feed i said your skin went hot our bodies spike a temperature just before we change like a human before a seizure i turned still held in his arms halfpinned between his knees you thought i was going to change it usually takes weeks or at least the first full moon for the first shape change but you seem to be gaining problems faster than normal if you changed for the first time here i dont think either rafael or i would be able to keep you from tearing reece up the first change is very violent rafael said and even the backseat of a limo doesnt have much room to hide or to run in reece looked at me from only inches away held in micahs arms his body and i knew that it wasnt romantic he was holding on in case the sex as distraction didnt work shes been nimirra for over a year reece said but still human until recently rafael said reece stared at me for a second or two then said very well i have a birthmark in the shape of a swan my family knew from my birth what i was meant to be ive heard of such things micah said but i thought it was legend reece shook his head its very true he sat back in his seat tucking his undershirt down in front kaspar had feathers instead of hair on his head i said im told that if i live long enough that gradually that will happen to me there was something in his voice that said he wasnt looking forward to the prospect you dont sound happy i said he frowned at me rebuttoning his shirt you were human once ms blake ive never been human i was born a swan king i was raised to take my place as their king from my earliest memories you have no idea what thats like i insisted on going to college on getting a degree but i may never get to use it because going from place to place caring for the other swans keeps me very busy i stayed in the circle of micahs body but the tension was draining away i saw my first soul when i was ten and my first ghost earlier than that reece at thirteen i accidentally raised my dog that had died ive never been human reece trust me on that you sound bitter about it he said i nodded oh yeah you must both accept who and what you are or you will make yourselves miserable rafael said we both looked at him and i dont think either look was friendly give me a week or two to come to terms with being a kitty cat i said i am not referring to you being nimirra for real rafael said from the moment i met you anita you have half hated what you are as richard has run from his beast so you have run from your own gifts i dont need a philosophy lesson rafael i think you do and badly but ill let that go if it bothers you so very much dont even start on me reece said ive had people preach to me all my life that im blessed and not cursed if my entire family couldnt convince me of it you might as well not even try rafael shrugged then turned back to me lets pick a different topic because we are only minutes away from the lupanar and i saw micahs beast his energy pass through you and your beast responded you saw it i asked he nodded his energy is very blue and yours is very red and they mingled so you got what purple i said micah hugged me a little tighter a warning i think not to be flippant but rafael was more direct no jokes anita if i saw it so will richard hes my nimirraj i said you dont understand anita micah said he thought birthmarks in the shape of your beast was legend well until just now i believed talk of a perfect mate was legend like true fated love just a romantic story rafaels already serious face got even more solemn you recognize some bond from the beginning so the stories go but its only after you have sex for the first time that your beasts can roll through each others bodies only physical intimacy will allow such metaphysical intimacy i glanced down from those hard demanding eyes but finally made myself look back up what are you asking rafael not really asking telling telling you that i know you had sex with micah and that even though richard has dumped you and publicly declared that you and he are no longer a couple he wont like it that was an understatement i pulled away from micah and he let me go no lingering touches i moved away and he allowed it it earned him brownie points richard dumped me rafael not the other way around he doesnt have any right to bitch about what i do if he dumped her then shes free to do what she wants reece said the ulfric has only himself to blame logically youre right but when has logic dictated how a man acts when he sees the love of his life in someone elses arms the bitter way rafael said it made me look at him study his face he sounded like he was speaking from experience as ulfric to my nimirra he has no authority over me tonight is going to be dangerous enough anita you dont need to make richard angry i dont want to make things worse god knows theyre bad enough as they are youre angry with him for dumping you rafael said i started to say no then realized he might be right maybe you want to hurt him i started to say no then stopped and tried to think really think about how i felt i was angry and hurt that he could just cast me aside okay it hadnt been that simple but still yeah im hurt and maybe a part of me wants to punish richard for that but its not just him dumping me its the mess hes made of the pack hes endangered people i care about and hes doing his usual boy scout shit that doesnt even work well in the human world let alone with a bunch of werewolves im tired rafael im tired of it and him it sounds like you might have dumped him if he hadnt beat you to it i came back to make it work to see if we could make some sense of it all but he has to give up that moral code of his that has never worked for him or anyone around him to give up his moral code is to give up being who he is i nodded i know and just saying that made me feel worse he cant change and staying who he is is going to get him killed and maybe you and jeanclaude with him rafael said does everyone know that part its standard that if you kill a vampires human servant the vampire may not survive the death and if you kill a vampire their human servants either die or go crazy logic dictates that killing either of you endangers the other i still didnt like that everyone knew that to kill one of us might kill all of us made it too damn easy for assassins what do you want me to say rafael that richard and i have a fundamental difference of philosophy in nearly every important area theres more than one reason we didnt get married and live happily ever after that maybe hes going to have to choose between survival or his morals that im afraid hed almost rather die than compromise those morals yeah im afraid its going to kill a little piece of him to see me with micah id spare him if i could but i didnt choose any of this you take no blame in this rafael said i sighed if i hadnt left for six months maybe i could have talked him out of the democracy with his pack maybe if id been here a lot of things would be different but i wasnt here and i cant change that all i can do is try fix what got broke you think you can fix this all of it rafael asked i shrugged ask me again after ive met jacob and seen how richard deals as ulfric with all of them i need a feel for the dynamics before i say if its fixable how would you fix it micah asked i glanced back at him if jacob and a few others are the problem then its fixable killing the ones who stand against richard wont fix things anita rafael said the experiment in democracy must end richard must begin being harsher to those who would stand against him he must be frightening to them or there will be another jacob and another after that i nodded youre preaching to the choir here rafael if you are not his girlfriend or his lover then i fear that your influence over richard will be slight im not sure i had a lot of influence over him when we were dating if you cannot talk sense into him then eventually richard will die and someone else probably jacob will take over the pack the first thing any good conqueror does is kill those closest and most loyal to the executed leader you think jacob is that practical i asked yes rafael said what do you want me to do i want you to hide the fact that you and micah are lovers i glanced behind me at micah he shrugged face peaceful i told you i wanted you on any terms that you wished anita what do i have to do to convince you i meant that i searched his face tried to find something false in it and couldnt maybe he was that good a liar maybe i was just being too suspicious when we were with the leopards just the leopards i was completely comfortable with you it felt right and why doesnt it feel that way now youre having second thoughts reece said no rafael said he looked at micah and the two of them had major eye contact the staring contest went on so long that i had to interrupt one of you better start talking i said rafael inclined his head at micah as if to say go ahead i turned to micah alright he said and he seemed to be choosing his words carefully i was almost positive i wasnt going to like this conversation every pard every group of shifters that is healthy has a group mind you mean a group identity i asked not exactly its more he frowned its more like a coven thats worked magic together for a while they begin to be parts of a whole when it comes to working magic or healing together they form more than they form separately okay but whats that have to do with why i felt more comfortable when its just us leopards if you feel differently when the leopards are around you then were forming a group mind it usually takes months to forge that kind of bond between shifters maybe its just a bond with your own leopards the change coming on could have set it in motion but you think its more than that dont you he nodded i think youre forming a group mind with my pard that in effect the decision to join our pards into one unit has already been made i havent decided anything havent you he asked he looked so reasonable sitting there hands clasped in front of him leaning a little towards me so earnest look the sex was great but im not ready to pick out china patterns here you do understand that there was a feeling very close to panic in the pit of my stomach sometimes your beast picks for you rafael said i looked at him what does that mean if you are already a part of a group mind with his pard then your beast has chosen for you anita its more intimate than being his lover because its not just him that you have a commitment to i gave him wide eyes are you saying that im going to feel responsible for the safety and wellbeing of all his wereleopards as well as my own rafael nodded probably i looked back at micah how about you you feel responsible for my people he sighed and it was heavy not happy at all i didnt expect to form a bond this quickly ive never seen it work this fast and i said his mouth moved almost a smile and if weve really formed a group mind then yes ill feel responsible for your people you dont sound happy about that nothing personal but your cats are a mess yours are so much healthier i said gina looks like someone whos been kicked once too often micahs eyes hardened and he searched my face no one talked to you they wouldnt dare no one tattled micah but i could see it on her smell the defeat someones damn near broken her and its recent or ongoing she got a bad boyfriend his face closed down he didnt like that id figured that out something like that but his pulse had sped up and i knew he was hiding something from me something that scared him what arent you telling me micah his gaze flicked past me to rafael will she be able to read my people more easily as time goes on and you hers rafael said her people are pretty easy to read now he said i was watching his face he was controlling his body keeping the tension out of it but i could taste the speed of his pulse and the fear it wasnt just a small fear either the thought that i could read his people so completely almost terrified him i laid my hand over his clasped ones and he turned serious guarded eyes to me why does it scare you that i knew that gina is being abused he tensed under my hand and pulled away gently but he definitely didnt want me to touch him gina wouldnt like it if you knew as her nimirraj arent you supposed to protect her from abusive assholes ive done my best for her he said but it sounded defensive kick the guys ass and forbid her to see him again its a simple problem dont complicate it or is she in love with him he shook his head eyes down his hands clutching so tight that the skin mottled his voice came out even normal but that terrible tension shook through his hands no shes not in love with him then whats the problem its more complicated than you could ever imagine he looked up and there was anger in his eyes now i started to reach out to touch him then let my hand fall back if we really are forming one pard if i really am her nimirraj then no ones allowed to hurt her no one hurts my people the wolves took your gregory he said the anger was still in his eyes trembling down his hands and were going to get him back i know youve had a hard life ive heard some of the stories but you talk as if youre young and naive sometimes no matter how hard you try you cant save everyone it was my turn to look down ive lost people ive failed people and theyve gotten hurt and dead i raised my eyes to meet his gaze but the people who hurt them killed them theyre dead too maybe i cant keep everyone safe but im damn fine at revenge but the harm still happens the dead dont really walk again zombies are just corpses anita they arent the people you lost i know that last better than you do micah he nodded some of the terrible tension had eased away from him but i left his eyes haunted with some old pain that was still raw ive done everything i can for gina and the others and its still not enough it will never be enough i touched his hands and this time he let me slide my hands over his maybe together we can be enough for them all he searched my face you really mean that dont you anita rarely says anything she doesnt mean rafael said but if i were her id ask first what the problems are before i promised to fix them i had to smile i was just about to ask what is gina into thats got you so terrified he turned his hands so he was holding mine tight he looked into my eyes the look was not love or even lust but so serious lets save your leopard first then ask me again and ill tell you all of it the car slowed and turned gravel sounded under the tires it was the turnoff to the farm that fronted the woods around the lupanar tell me some of it now micah i need something here now he sighed looked down at his clasped hands then up slowly to meet my eyes once we were taken over by a very bad man he still wants us and im searching for a home strong enough to keep us safe why are you afraid to tell me his eyes widened a little most pards dont want that kind of trouble i smiled trouble is my middle name he looked a little puzzled i guess i was the only one who liked film noir im not going to kick you guys out because of some asshole alpha let me know which way the dangers coming from and ill deal with it i wish i had your confidence there was a weight to his gaze of such sorrow such horrible loss it made me shiver to see it and he let go of my hands sliding away from me just before merle opened the door and offered a hand out he didnt take the hand but he slid out into the dark reece followed him with a look at rafael as if the rat king had told him to get out and give us some privacy i turned to rafael you have something to say be careful of that one anita none of us know him or his people funny i was pretty much thinking the same thing even though he can make your beast roil through your body i met his dark dark eyes maybe especially because of that rafael smiled i should know by now that you are not a person to let her affections cloud her vision oh it can be clouded but never for long you sound wistful he said sometimes i wonder what it would be like to actually be able to just fall in love and not weigh the risks first if it works out its the best thing in the world if it doesnt work out its like having your heart torn out and chopped up into little pieces while you watch it leaves a big hollow space that never really heals i looked at him unsure what to say but finally you sound like experience talking ive got an exwife and a son they live in a different state as far away from me as she could drag him what went wrong if you dont mind me asking she wasnt strong enough to handle what i am i didnt hide anything from her she knew everything before we married if i hadnt been so much in love with her id have seen that she was weak its my job as king to know whos strong and who isnt but she fooled me because i wanted to be fooled i know that now she is what she is not her fault i cant even regret her getting pregnant right away i love my son do you ever get to see him he shook his head i get to fly in twice a year and have supervised visits shes made him afraid of me i started to reach out to him hesitated then thought what the hell i took his hand and he looked startled then smiled im sorry rafael more than i can ever say he squeezed my hand then moved back from me just thought you ought to know that falling blindly in love isnt at all the way all those poems and songs make it sound it hurts like hell i did fall in love like that once i said he raised his eyebrows at me not since ive known you no in college i was engaged thought it was true love what happened his mom found out my mother was mexican and she didnt want her little blondhaired blueeyed family tree getting contaminated you were engaged before theyd met your family theyd met my father and his second wife but they are both good little aryans very nordic my stepmother didnt like pictures of my mother being out so they were all in my room i wasnt hiding it but thats how my almost motherinlaw took it funny thing her son knew id told him the whole story it hadnt mattered until his mom threatened to cut him off from the family money now im sorry your story is more pitiful that doesnt make me feel better he said smiling i smiled back but neither of us really looked happy aint love grand i said you can answer your own question after you see richard and micah in the lupanar together i shook my head i dont love micah not really not yet but he said i sighed but i almost wish i did it would make seeing richard less painful i dont know how im going to feel seeing him tonight and knowing that hes not mine anymore probably about the same way hell feel when he sees you is that supposed to make me feel better no its just the truth remember that cutting you out of his life was forced on him he loves you anita for better or worse i love him but i wont let him kill gregory and i wont let him cost sylvie her life i wont let him take the pack down to wrack and ruin because of some idealistic set of rules that only he is paying attention to if you kill jacob and his followers without richards permission then he may send the pack after you and your leopards if you are not lukoi not lupa then to let their deaths go unpunished would make him appear so weak you might as well let jacob kill him then what am i supposed to do i dont know merle stuck his head in the car weve got wolves out here your rats are holding them back but theyre getting impatient were coming rafael said he looked across the seat at me shall we i nodded i guess itd be silly not to get out of the car he slid out to the edge of the seat then hesitated holding his arm out for me normally i wouldnt have taken it but tonight we were trying for a show of solidarity and style so i stepped out of the car on the rat kings arm like a trophy wife except for the wrist sheaths and the two folding knives hidden in my clothing somehow i think trophy wives wear more makeup and less cutlery but hey i havent ever met a trophy wife maybe im wrong maybe they know what i know that the true way to a mans heart is six inches of metal between his ribs sometimes four inches will do the job but to be really sure i like to have six funny how phallic objects are always more useful the bigger they are anyone who tells you size doesnt matter has been seeing too many small knives the clearing was huge but not huge enough the cars trucks and vans filled most of the available ground some parked so far under the trees that the paint jobs had to have gotten scratched all to hell there wasnt room for all the wererats to park and the cars filled the gravel drive until it was just another parking lot some people ended up parked beside the road or so they said as they drifted up through the trees rafael had brought all his rats about two hundred of them the treaty between the rats and wolves dictated that their numbers had to top at two hundred rafael had agreed to that on the understanding that the much larger werewolf pack six hundred or so would come to his aid if needed no questions asked your enemies are my enemies sort of thing hed explained that in the last few minutes and it meant that he was risking a great deal tonight made me feel guilty made me wish id found a way to sneak a gun into the lupanar truthfully i hadnt even tried was i growing soft overconfident or just tired the tallest woman id ever seen came to stand beside rafael and me she was at least six feet six inches broadshouldered and had the muscles that only serious weight lifting will give you she was wearing a black sports bra across her tanned chest and a pair of faded black jeans her dark hair was caught back in a tight ponytail leaving her face clean and startling with not a touch of makeup on it this is claudia shes going to be one of your enforcers for the night rafael said i opened my mouth to protest but he stared me into silence his face so serious you have wereleopards but only micah has bodyguards we cant afford to lose you anita not for something stupid like this if i cant take care of myself then what good is my threat richard will have his skцll and hati i will have my guards micah has his only you are without escort raina kept the wereleopards as an adjunct to the werewolves they never really grew into a full pard not really even micahs people added to yours dont have the right personnel for a working pard you have too many submissives and not enough dominants so tonight you will have claudia and igor zane said we can take care of anita no we cant nathaniel said i stared at him he touched my arm take the help anita please we can protect her micah said merle echoed him and if you have to choose between saving micah or saving anita which one will you choose rafael asked merle looked away but noah said micah exactly wont your rats feel just as torn between you and anita as my leopards would micah asked no because ill have bodyguards my rodere my gang runs high to enforcers and professional soldiers why do you think that raina and marcus agreed to the treaty when richard brought it to them theyd never have allied with us if we werent stronger than just our numbers i dont he actually touched my mouth with his finger no anita when this is over and you are truly nimirra then you will need to advertise for enforcers of your own until then ill share i moved his hand away from my mouth i dont think this is necessary i do he said i agree cherry said finally micah said agreed merle and noah both gave him a funny look then exchanged glances with each other i havent agreed to this i said nathaniel leaned into me and said if you dont give in on this well still be standing here an hour from now i frowned at him he smiled and shrugged i turned to the bodyguard in question she just looked at me face impassive as if it didnt matter to her one way or another a man moved up beside her he was about two inches shorter than she was broader through the shoulders and had so many tattoos that for a second i thought he was wearing a colorful longsleeved shirt his tank top was small and strained over the swell of his chest jeans and work boots completed his outfit he was bald with a tattoo of a dragon curling around his ears and the back of his skull even by starlight you could see the design of the tat was oriental and well done how do you guys feel about putting your life on the line for someone you just met you saved our kings life the man said we owe you a life even if its your own i said thems the breaks he said i stared up at the woman you agree with that like igor says we owe you one it always made me uncomfortable when people were willing to put my safety ahead of their own i just wasnt really comfy with the concept of bodyguards but what the hell i put my hand out they exchanged glances between them then shook my hand igor touched me like he was afraid id break and claudia tried to squeeze hard enough to make me cry uncle i didnt i smiled pleasantly at her because i knew she wouldnt really hurt me she just wanted to see if id squirm my pleasant smile made her frown but she let go of my hand my hand actually ached just a little and if my healing powers werent up to it id be bruised in the morning damn rafael turned to some of his rats giving instructions leaving me alone with the two bodyguards is igor your real name i asked nickname he said whats your real name he smiled and shook his head what could be worse than igor i asked his smile widened to a grin wouldnt you like to know it made me smile and some tightness in my chest eased youd almost think i was relieved to have bodyguards of my own naw not me i didnt need no stinking bodyguards i probably wouldnt need them but extra muscle is like extra ammunition if you need it its good to have it if you dont need it then it can always go back in the box truth was i felt more protective of my leopards than protected by them sad but true and i didnt entirely trust merle or noah or even micah he was keeping things from me and i didnt like that some women are just never satisfied rafael moved off through his people giving them softvoiced instructions micah moved up closer to me with merle and noah at a very attentive distance i looked at micah and suddenly couldnt be this close and not touch him i reached my hand out to him his eyes widened but he took my hand his hand slid over mine in a play of pulsing warmth that almost took my breath away i watched a similar reaction play on his face what was going on i drew my hand out of his and it was like pulling it through melted taffy so thick i looked up to find that except for claudia and igor we were surrounded by wereleopards his and mine the moment i met nathaniels eyes the power jolted through me i turned from him to cherry and her pale eyes widened the power was so thick it was like trying to breath something liquid as if it hurt for the air to go down the power leaped between me and zane vivian and caleb who was next in the circle caleb who i didnt particularly like but as soon as i searched his face the power leaped between us just as it had with the others he gasped hand going to his chest as if hed felt it like a blow there his voice came out strangled what are you doing she is being nimirra micah said i turned back to him but in the turning crossed noahs gaze first the power stretched between me and this stranger and the fear showed on his face i was strangely calm it felt right good gina moved closer to merle and that drew my gaze the power swung through her from her we were all like some great circuit of energy sharing flowing growing tears trailed down ginas face she cried softly clinging to merles arm i met his eyes last as if i was supposed to and he tried to turn away but it wasnt a matter of locking gazes it was a matter of my attention going to him the power my power my beast noticing him the power lashed through him because he fought it he tried to shield but he couldnt shield from this it wasnt that i was strong enough to force him i didnt try to push it was more that the power recognized him and something maybe his beast resonated with the power he turned slowly to stare at me and the look on his face was pained it didnt hurt it felt warm and good and frightening the power grew wound tight and tighter until it filled the air around us claudia said what the hell are you doing bonding rafael said and he drew the two wererats out of our circle the instant they were gone the circle tightened and it was like the pressure of a storm my ears needed to pop as if the pressure of the air had changed micah moved to stand in front of me the others formed a circle around us as if someone had choreographed it we stared at each other and then reached a hand towards each other it was hard to move forward as if the air had grown solid and we had to push our way through our fingertips touched and our hands slid together quickly easily like a fish breaking through water into open air we spilled around each other our arms our bodies touching completely as if we could walk into the others body like it was an open door his mouth hovered over mine and the power was there breathing pulsing hot against my lips i tried to be afraid tried to draw back but i didnt want to it was as if a part of me that i hadnt even known existed was in charge and no amount of common sense or doubts could stop it it wasnt a kiss it was a melding the power poured in a scalding wave from his mouth to mine from my mouth to his i could feel the others like lines of heat running out like spokes of a wheel and micah and i were the hub of that wheel the power ran between us all back and forth liquid burning growing growing and melting melting boundaries borders that kept us separate as people it was as if micahs body and mine were a door and we stepped into each other closer than flesh could touch closer than hearts could beat and i felt his beast and mine roll through us around us as if the two great animals bound us together like a rope that ran through our flesh our skin our minds and the beasts flared outward traveled down those lines of power and smashed into each of the others i felt it as a physical blow felt them stagger as our twinned beasts traveled the circle and caressed their beasts in turn and our beasts came home in a rush of heat like standing in the middle of a bonfire but it was also a glorious rush a joyousness like nothing id ever felt i caught with that rush of power glimpses into all the others i saw gina tied to a bed and a man above her like a shadow something evil that the power could not see clearly merle covered in wounds and blood huddled against a wall weeping caleb standing alone covered in blood his eyes haunted noah running down a hallway with screams chasing him making him run faster cherry lying in a huge heap of warm bodies beside zane and nathaniel and me zanes memory was of sitting at my kitchen table eating laughing with nathaniel vivian lying in stephens arms in their bed nathaniels memory was of me marking his back but the sense of peace i got from him with the memory was stronger than the sense of sex as if some great burden had lifted from him and i saw gregory bound wristtoankle behind his back gagged blindfolded terrified he lay naked on a bed of bones i knew this was not a memory this was what was happening to gregory right this minute and i could see it feel his terror and i still didnt know where he was the power burst over us all in a wave of skinrushing nervecaressing contentment as if wed all walked into a strange room and suddenly realized that everything in it was familiar every corner of the room was a key to our hearts and the word that washed over me was home micah drew back first shaking i was crying and didnt remember when it had started i heard other people crying in the dark and i looked beyond us and found that it wasnt just our people some of the wererats were crying faces turned towards us with something like awe or fear in their eyes something made me look past all of them to the woods edge richard stood shirtless dressed in nothing but jeans and whatever shoes he was wearing the sight of him there painted with starlight and shadows made me catch my breath not because he was beautiful or because i wanted him that always went without saying with richard but because he was suddenly for the first time wild it wasnt his anger that made the difference i saw him at the edge of the woods the way youd come unexpectedly upon a wild animal like glimpsing deer in the twilight or that flash as something large and furred raced in front of your headlights and you knew it wasnt a dog and it was too big to be a fox richard stood there and when our eyes met it sent a jolt through me from the top of my head to the soles of my feet and into the ground beyond whatever else richard had been doing to screw up his packs structure one thing hed done right hed embraced his beast you could see it on him like a coat that hed finally grown into something that fit him tailormade marcus the old ulfric had always insisted on dressing up so at a glance youd know he was king richard stood there with no clothes to distinguish him yet you knew he was king power makes you a monarch and all the fancy robes in the world wont do the job without it we stared at each other across the clearing underneath that new veneer of comfortable power the look on his face made my chest so tight it hurt if i could have thought of anything to say that would have made things less painful id have said it but i couldnt think of any words that would help jamil and shangda came up on either side of him and there was a look of anger on shangdas face anger at me i think jamil looked at richard as if he wished there was some way for him to guard richard from this as well as from bullets and claws but with some things even a really good bodyguard cant take the hit for you this was one of those things richards voice came deep loud clear untouched by the look on his face welcome rat king of the dark crown clan welcome nimirra and nimirraj of the blooddrinkers clan welcome to the lands of the thronnos rokke clan the leopards have shown us this night what it truly means to be a clan be they pard lukoi or rodere they show us what we all strive for a true melding of all our parts into a whole bitterness crept in at the last but on the whole it was a lovely speech and more heartfelt than pleasant now join us at our lupanar and we will see if you can win back your lost cat there was anger in his voice and i wondered if gregory was about to pay the price for richards anger with me richard turned and melted into the trees with shangda at his side jamil spared a glance back at me then followed micah leaned close and whispered i owe you several apologies im sorry your ulfric had to see us this way me too i said i said your cats were a mess and i was wrong you have made a home for your cats and mine have nowhere to hide what is wrong with all of you it wasnt perhaps the most diplomatic question but it covered things that is a very long story merle leaned over us he spoke so low that i almost couldnt hear him be very careful for all our sakes they had some very serious eye contact i said what is going on micah raised my hand and laid a brief kiss on the knuckles lets save your gregory that has to be priority tonight right he smiled and tried to charm his way out of the stare i was giving him i stared at him until the smile faded from his face and he dropped my hand yeah saving gregory is priority for tonight but i want to know whats going on one problem at a time micah said i was getting the very distinct feeling that if they all could have lied to me forever they would have it wasnt lying as much as hiding things from me things that had to do with blood and pain and no matter how powerful they all were micahs pard wasnt a family wasnt whole strangely as messed up as me and my leopards were we were a family more so than richard and his wolves even richard was so busy fighting his moral battles and his power structure problems that there wasnt time for mending other things give me the readers digest condensed version micah i said gregory is waiting for you to rescue him so give me a couple of sentences but make it the truth micah micah merle said softly but with force to his voice it was a warning i looked at the big man what are you guys hiding merle micah touched my arm brought my attention back to his face i told you that once we were taken over by a very bad man who still wants us im searching for someplace strong enough to keep us safe are you saying this guy will come looking for you here in st louis yes he said most alphas can take a hint i said micah shook his head this one wont he will never give us up he gripped my arm if you take us on youll have to deal with him eventually is he bulletproof i asked the question seemed to confuse him because he frowned no i mean no i guess not i shrugged not a problem then he looked at me what do you mean that youll just kill him it was my turn to look at him is there any reason i shouldnt he almost smiled stopped then frowned again just kill him just like that it was almost as if he were thinking it over as if it had never occurred to him merle said hes a hard man to kill unless hes faster than a silver bullet merle nobodys that hard to kill rafael came slowly through the leopards claudia and igor trailing him weve all been thinking of your leopards as lesser than us what i just saw makes me envious i know how the wolves work i said and i know that they dont have a sense of home first raina and marcus made them afraid of each other now richards morals have him struggling to be safe but you and yours seem pretty secure how different is what ive done with my leopards from what everyone else is doing ive benefited from your loyalty your sheer stubbornness what i didnt realize until tonight is that you didnt save me just because i was your friend or just because it was the right thing to do you didnt risk yourself and your people to save me from torture because of the kind of moral rightness that richard is fond of you saved me because you could not bear the thought leaving me behind he touched my face very gently not from a sense of right and wrong but because you are just that tenderhearted i looked at him ive been called a lot of things but never that he chucked me under the chin like you would a child dont make light of one of your better qualities you love your people like a mother is supposed to love her children you want whats best for them even if that makes you uncomfortable even if you dont like their choices i had to look away from the wonderment on his face like he was looking at somebody else that couldnt be me you have never been their leopard queen in body but you shamed us all tonight its not seeing your closeness to micah that will torment richard though that will burn its that you gave us a glimpse of what we are all striving for for our clans richard believes his moral rightness will get him where your leopards already are i looked up at him my pard is not a democracy and i have a hell of a lot more than just presidential veto when it comes to decisions richard knows that better probably than anyone and that will gall him anita it will make him doubt himself i shook my head richard always doubts himself when it comes to the lukoi hell never have surety about them until he has surety about who and what he is first i have to accept the fact that youre kindhearted now i have to accept the fact that youre insightful as well i knew you were powerful ruthless and pretty but that you have a mind and a heart besides is going to take some getting used to does everyone pretty much think im just a sociopath who happens to have magical abilities its all you let people see he said until now he gazed out towards the circle of faces still turned to us i saw a kind of hunger in their faces and i knew that they had felt what id felt a sense of true belonging of being home within the circle not of bricks or mortar but of flesh of hands to grasp arms to hold smiles to share so simple so rare all these months id been worried id fail the wereleopards i thought failure meant them dying or getting hurt what i realized suddenly was that the true failure would have been if i hadnt given a damn you can bandage a wound set a broken bone but not caring you cant cure that and you cant recover from it the lupanar was a large clearing yards by yards the clearing appeared to be flat but actually it sat in a large smooth valley between hills you couldnt notice it at night but i knew that just beyond the trees that ringed the far side of the lupanar were steep hills it had taken me more than one visit to find what lay beyond the trees now all vision stopped at the far edge of the clearing torches that rose manhigh were stuck into the ground on either side of the stone throne the throne was a huge chair carved of rock so old that there were places on the arms where countless generations of ulfrics had touched it and worn away the stone probably the back and seat of the chair were worn as well but they were covered by a spill of purple silk suitably royal there was something very primitive about the huge stone chair and its spill of cloth caught between the wavering golden light of the torches it looked like a throne for some ancient barbaric king someone who should wear animal skins and a crown of iron werewolves most but not all in human form stood or crouched in a huge circle there was one opening in the circle which we walked through the werewolves flowed behind us like a door of flesh closing the wererats spread around behind us and to either side but we all knew if it came to a fight we were outmatched and outflanked rafael and two very large wererats stood to one side of me donovan reece the swan king was on the other side rafael had kindly given him a quartet of bodyguards micah stood just a little behind me and my newly acquired bodyguards were just behind him our leopards had spilled out in a rough knot behind us like a line of defense before the main show of wererats someone had hung cloth in the trees to one side of the throne black cloth like a curtain and it took a movement of the wind to draw my attention to it it was held aside and sylvie came through followed by a tall man i didnt know her face was less refined with no makeup less soft her short hair curled neatly but carelessly she was dressed in the first pair of jeans id ever seen her in with a pale blue tanktop and white jogging shoes the tall man was thin the way basketball players are thin all arms and legs and lanky muscle most of that lanky muscle showed because all he wore was a pair of cutoff jean shorts but he like richard didnt need finery he moved in a circle of his own grace and power like a tiger stalking into view except there were no bars to hide behind and id had to leave my gun at home he had short dark hair that curled a little thicker than sylvies his face was one of those that you couldnt decide was attractive or plain it was made up of strong bones long lines thin lips on a wide mouth id just about decided he was plain when he looked at me and the moment i saw those dark eyes i knew i was wrong intelligence burned in there intelligence and dark emotion he let anger flow over his face and i realized the very force of his personality made him so striking that he was handsome though it was the kind of handsome that would never come across in a still photo because it needed movement his vibrating energy to make it work i knew without being told that this was jacob and i knew something else we were in trouble richard came next and he moved in his own vibrating spill of power he glided as gracefully filled with as much anger as jacob but he still lacked something some edge that the other man had an edge of darkness maybe all i knew for sure was that jacob was ruthless i could almost smell it on him and richard for better or worse still was not i sighed id thought if he could just once embrace his beast hed be alright he sat on the throne with the firelight playing in the loose waves of his hair turning it to spun copper and burnished gold the fire shadows playing on the muscles of his chest shoulders arms he looked the part of the barbarian king but there was still something in him something soft and if i could taste it then so could jacob i had one of those moments of clarity that comes sometimes there was nothing that any of us could do to richard to make him truly harsh he might act in anger like hed taken gregory but no matter what the world did to him there would still be something in him that flinched his only hope for survival was to surround himself with loyal people who wouldnt flinch jamil and shangda stood together to one side of the throne not too close but not too far either shangda was back in his usual monochrome black business dress black slacks black shirt black suit jacket and the polished black shoes he always looked very gq even in the woods jamil could dress up with the best of them but he tried to be appropriate to the situation he had on jeans that looked freshly pressed and a red muscle tank top that looked splendid against the darkness of his skin hed changed the beads in his waistlength cornrowed hair to red and black the beads gleamed softly in the torchlight as if they might be made of semiprecious stones jamil caught my glance he didnt exactly nod but he acknowledged me with his eyes shangda avoided my gaze searching the crowd but never quite looking at me i think if richard would have allowed it the two of them would have done whatever was necessary to secure his throne but they were hamstrung by richard and the best they could do was work within his honorable trap sylvie and i stared at each other for a few heartbeats id seen her collection of bones of her enemies she got them out periodically and handled them she said it was comforting to run her hands over them i personally liked a good stuffed toy and some really fine coffee but hey whatever makes you feel better sylvie would do whatever needed doing if richard would only let her and if id still been lupa hell we had enough ruthless people to get the job done if richard would just get out of our way we were so close and at the time we werent even in the ballpark it was more than frustrating it was like watching a train race towards richard and we were all yelling get off the tracks get off the tracks hell we were trying to drag him off the tracks and he was fighting us if jacob was the train then i could kill him and richard would be safe but rafael was right if it wasnt jacob itd be someone else jacob wasnt the train hurtling to destroy richard richard was his voice filled the clearing we gather here tonight to say goodbye to our lupa and to choose another there was a rash of howls and applause from about half of the pack but dozens of the werewolves stood silent watching it didnt mean they were on my side maybe they were neutral but it was good to notice who wasnt a rousing supporter of my being kicked out of the pack we are here to stand in final judgment for one who has wronged our pack by taking our lupa from us there was less applause fewer howls it looked like the vote to condemn gregory had been a close one that made me feel better not much but a little though if gregory died i guess it really didnt matter we are also here to give the leopards nimirra a last chance to win back her cat the howls and applause stayed at about fiftyfifty but the general atmosphere was definitely cooler the pack wasnt lost and it certainly wasnt wholeheartedly on jacobs side i said a little prayer for guidance because this was more a political problem and that wasnt one of my best things it is business between the lukoi and the pard why are the rodere here rafael richard asked he talked like he didnt know us very political very distant the nimirra saved my life once the rodere owe her a great debt does this mean that your treaty with us is null and void i formed a treaty with you richard and i will hold to that because i know you are a man that honors his obligations and remembers his duty to his allies but i owe anita a personal debt and i am honorbound to uphold that as well if it comes to fighting who will you fight with us or the leopards i hope most sincerely that it does not come to that but i came with the leopards and we will go with them under whatever circumstances that leavetaking will be you have destroyed your people jacob said richard turned on him i am ulfric here jacob not you i say what will be destroyed and what will not i meant no offense ulfric but his voice made the words a lie i meant only that if it comes to a fight the rats cannot defeat us perhaps their king would like to reconsider who he owes a debt of honor to a debt of honor exists whether you want it to or not rafael said richard understands what it means to owe an honordebt that is why i know that richard will honor our treaty i have no such assurances when it comes to other members of this pack there hed said it it was as close to saying i dont trust you jacob as he could get a spreading well of silence filled the clearing so that the brush of cloth the shift of a furred body was suddenly loud richards hands tightened on the arms of his throne i watched him because he was shielding so tight against me that i couldnt feel him but i could watch watch him think are you saying that if i am no longer ulfric that the treaty no longer holds yes that is what im saying richard and rafael stared at each other for a long time then the faintest of smiles played on richards lips i have no plans to step down as ulfric so the treaty should be secure for a while unless jacob has other plans that one statement sent a wave of unease through the waiting werewolves you could feel it see it spreading out through them as if they smelled a trap of some kind jacob looked surprised shocked he was a perfect stranger but i watched the confusion play over his face as he tried to think of what to say if he said he had no designs on the throne then he would be foresworn and the shapeshifters were a little touchy about things like that jacob was either going to have to lie or declare his intentions and the look on his face said clearly he wasnt ready to do that a womans voice came from the right clear and ringing like shed had stage training arent we getting distracted from the business at hand i for one am very interested in choosing the new lupa the woman was tall but built all of curves voluptuous the way that movie stars in the fifties had been she seemed soft feminine yet she stalked over the ground in a swaying glide half sex on the hoof and half predatory like shed lure you in by playing victim fuck you till you cried for mercy then eat your face off she was even wearing a dress one that clung to her curves and had a neckline so low that you knew she had to be wearing a bra breasts that size didnt do perky without some help she stalked barefoot her deep red hair styled and perfect falling just above her shoulders in a burnished shine well get around to choosing the new lupa richard said she dropped to her knees in front of the throne folding the dress under her thighs very ladylike though making sure to lean forward enough for richard to look straight down her cleavage i didnt like her much you cant blame us for being eager ulfric one of us and she hesitated making it clear that the us was for politeness sake will be chosen lupa and become your mate all in one glorious night her voice had dropped to a sultry murmur still loud enough to be heard nope didnt like her i had no room to bitch with micah standing beside me but that didnt matter logic had nothing to do with it i wanted to grab a handful of that bottledyed red hair and hurt her it wasnt until micah touched my arm that i realized id been caressing one of the knives in its wrist sheath sometimes i touch my weapons when im nervous sometimes my body just betrays my thoughts i forced my hands to be still but i was so not happy go back with the other candidates paris richard said he was carefully not looking at her as if he were afraid to that didnt make it better it made it worse she leaned forward putting a hand on his knee he jumped you cant blame us for being eager ulfric weve all wanted you for so very long richards face had thinned down with anger sylvie he said sylvie smiled and it was a smile of pure evil pleasure she grabbed pariss wrist and dragged her none too gently to her feet paris was a good two inches taller but sylvies power her beast made her seem ten feet tall the ulfric told you to go back and stand with the other candidates do it she gave paris a little shove towards the crowd the woman stumbled but regained her composure smoothing the tight dress down over her thighs sylvie had turned to walk back to her place at richards side when paris said i heard you liked it rough sylvie froze and i didnt need to see her face to feel the instant rage that radiated from her i knew before she turned slowly muscles tense that her eyes had bled to wolf amber what did you say sylvie richard said voice soft it wasnt a command it was a request i think if hed made it a command shed have fought it demanded some sort of satisfaction but it was a request she turned back to richard yes ulfric take your place please she went back to take her place as freki on his right side but the anger boiled around her like nearly visible heat off a summer road i apologize to the swan king for not recognizing him sooner but weve only met once yes donovon reece said i remember welcome to our lupanar i would give you safe passage among us but i have to know why you are here before i can do that i am here because the nimirra rescued my swanmanes from the people that nearly killed her she risked her life for them i am here at her side tonight as an ally i cant grant you safe passage donovan because if things go badly it will be a fight if youre anitas ally youll be in the middle of it she risked her life for my people i can do no less richard nodded and i watched an understanding pass between them birds of an honorable feather so to speak does she save every shapeshifter she comes across in trouble jacob asked and he made it derisive richard started to say something and sylvie stepped forward touching his arm he gave a small nod and let her speak how many of us has anita saved from torture or death she raised her own hand jamil stepped out from around the throne and raised his own all my leopards raised their hands like a small forest of gratitude rafael raised his hand i finally spotted louie his lieutenant and ronnies boyfriend he gave a small nod to me and raised his own hand richard stood and raised his hand there were other hands here and there then irving griswold mildmannered reporter and werewolf stepped forward his glasses reflected the firelight so that he looked blind he looked like a tall slightly balding cherub with eyes of flame what would have happened if anita hadnt saved sylvie from the vampire councils torture sylvies strong but what if she had broken shes dominant enough to call most of us in to have forced us to give ourselves over to the vampire council irving raised his hand she saved us all hands went up among the werewolves until nearly half of them were holding a hand up it made my throat tight my eyes burn i wasnt going to cry but if someone hugged me i couldnt be sure of that louie stepped forward small dark and handsome with his short black hair cut neat rafael is a strong king so strong that if the vampire council had broken him none of us could have refused his call we would all have been at their mercy you all saw what they did to him and how long it took him to heal anita saved all the rodere in this city the rats raised their hands all of them sylvie said look around you do you really want to lose anita as our lupa most of you remember what it was like with raina do you want to go back to that shes not lukoi jacob said a few others said the same thing but not many if your only objection to her is that shes not a werewolf sylvie said then thats a poor excuse for losing anita losing her jacob said this is the first time ive ever seen her ive been with this pack for five months and this is the first time ive set eyes on your precious lupa we cant lose something we never had there was a lot of support for that a lot of howls cries of yeah applause even i couldnt blame them on this one i stepped forward moving until i stood alone between my allies and the throne silence fell around the clearing until you could hear the torches sizzling richard stared down at me i could meet his eyes now i made sure my voice carried when i said jacobs right sylvie looked startled so did jacob and there was movement behind me as people startled i havent been much of a lupa to the thronnos rokke clan but i didnt know i was supposed to be i was just the ulfrics girlfriend i had my hands full with the wereleopards and i trusted richard to take care of the wolves the leopards had no one but me i turned and faced the crowd i was human not fit to be lupa or nimirra the crowds murmur was louder this time i dont know if youve all heard but there was an accident in the fight that saved the swanmanes i may be nimirra for real in a few weeks we wont know for sure but it seems likely they were quiet now watching me human eyes wolf eyes rats leopards but every face held intelligence a burning concentration theres nothing i can do about that well just have to wait and see but my leopard did not injure me on purpose i will stake my word of honor on that im told that gregory stands accused of killing your lupa i raised my hands out from my body here i stand alive and well if you lose me as your lupa it wont be because gregory took me from you it will be because you choose to let me go if thats what you want fine i dont blame you until tonight until just a few minutes ago i didnt think i was doing a very good job as nimirra let alone trying to be human lupa now i think maybe i was wrong maybe if id stayed around more things would be better i did what i thought was right at the time if you dont want me as lupa thats your right but dont punish a fellow shapeshifter for an accident that happened during a fight where he saved me from getting my heart dug out of my chest a pretty speech jacob said but weve already voted and your leopard has to pay the price unless youre shapeshifter enough to win him back i looked back not at jacob but at richard richard please he shook his head i cant undo the vote anita i would if i could he sounded tired i sighed fine how do i win gregory back she needs to stop being lupa before she can be nimirra this from paris who though back in the crowd still managed to make her voice ring over the clearing i thought you voted me out as lupa i said they have richard said but to make it official by our laws theres a ceremony that will sever your ties to us is it a long ceremony i asked it can be he said let me get gregory out first then ill do whatever lukoi ceremony you want me to do you have the right to refuse to step down sylvie said i looked at richard you have that right his face his voice were neutral as he said it i couldnt tell if he was happy or sad about the idea what happens if i refuse youd have to defend your right to be lupa either by oneonone combat with any dominant that wants the job and he stopped there sylvie looked at him but it was jacob who finished or you can prove that youre lupa enough to keep the job by annointing the throne i just looked at him and shrugged annointing the throne what does that mean you fuck the ulfric on the throne in front of all of us i was already shaking my head somehow i dont think either richard or i are up to public sex its a little more complicated than that richard said he looked at me and there was so much in his eyes anger pain that it hurt to hold his gaze sex alone isnt enough wed have to have a mystical connection between our beasts he was quiet and i thought hed finished but he hadnt like you have with your nimirraj we stared at each other i couldnt think of anything good to say but i had to say something im sorry my voice came out soft almost sad dont apologize he said why not its not your fault its mine that made me widen my eyes at him how so i should have known youd have that kind of bond with your mate youre more powerful as a human than most true lupas i looked at him what are you saying richard that you wish youd made me one of you while you had the chance he lowered his eyes as if he couldnt bear for me to see his expression anymore i stepped closer close enough to touch him close enough so that his vibrating energy spilled like a march of insects across my skin it made me shiver but i felt something else something id never felt before not with richard my beast spilled over my skin and reached out like a playful kitten to swat at richards power the energies sparked against each other and i could almost see the play of colors in my head like flint and steel being struck against one another except in technicolor i heard richard catch his breath his eyes were very wide his voice came hoarse almost strangled did you do that on purpose i shook my head i didnt trust myself to speak the sparks had quieted and it was as if i were leaning against a nearly solid wall of power his and mine as if i could have leaned against that energy and it alone would have kept us from touching i finally found my voice but it was a whisper whats happening the marriage of the marks i think he said voice almost equally soft i wanted so badly to reach through that power and touch him to see if the beasts would roll through each other like they did for micah and me i knew it was silly he was wolf and apparently i was leopard so our beasts wouldnt recognize each other but id loved richard for so long and we were bound to each other by jeanclaudes marks and i carried a piece of his beast inside me i had to know i had to know if i could have with richard what i had with micah my hand moved through the power and it was like shoving it into an electric socket the energy was so strong it bit along my skin i was reaching for his shoulder a nice neutral place to touch someone when he rolled off the side of the throne and was suddenly standing beside it hed moved so fast i couldnt follow with my eyes id seen the beginning of the movement and the end but the middle id blinked and missed it no anita he said no if we cant ever touch again i dont want to feel your beast we may not be the same animal but it will be more than anything weve ever had between us i couldnt bear it i let my hand fall to my side and stepped back far enough from the throne for him to regain his seat i wasnt apologizing again but i wanted to i wanted to cry for both of us or scream i know the universe has a sense of irony and sometimes you get reminded just how sadistic that can be i would finally have to accept his furry half because id have one of my own i could be richards nearly perfect lover at long last and we could never touch each other again richard was sitting on his throne again and i was standing back far enough for him to feel safe rafael micah and reece had all moved up beside me a halfcircle of kings at my back it should have made me feel secure it didnt i was tired so terribly tired so terribly sad even with micah at my back i couldnt stop looking at richard couldnt stop wondering what if oh i knew id never have allowed him to make me a werewolf on purpose but a small part of me wondered but i told that small part to shut up and i got down to business i want gregory back unharmed how do i do that according to lukoi law richard said jacob that one word sounded as tired as i felt jacob stepped forward obviously pleased with himself your leopard is here on our land and weve done nothing to hide his scent trail if you can track him you can take him home i raised my eyebrows at him i have to follow a scent trail like a dog if you were a true shapeshifter you could do it jacob said this isnt a fair test rafael said she hasnt had her first change most of our secondary powers dont appear until after our first full moon it doesnt have to be scenting richard said but it must be something that only a shapeshifter could do something that only a shifter powerful enough to truly be nimirra or lupa could do he was looking at me when he said it and there was something in his eyes something he was trying to tell me that doesnt sound very fair either micah said richard kept looking at me willing me to understand him i didnt know why he didnt just drop his shields and let me see his mind almost as if richard had read my mind he said no werewolf or wererat or wereleopard no one can aid you in finding your leopard if anyone interferes in any way then the test is invalid and hell die even if that help is metaphysical i asked richard nodded even if i looked at him studied his face and frowned i finally shook my head id had a vision of where gregory was and under what circumstances but it gave me no real clue all i really needed to do was ask someone where a hole was with bones at the bottom but i couldnt ask anyone there then i had an idea can i use my own metaphysical abilities to aid me richard nodded i looked at jacob because i knew the objection would come from him if anyone i dont think your necromancy is going to help you locate your leopard actually it might have if the bones gregory was lying on were the largest burial sight in the area then i might be able to track the bones and find him or i might spend all night chasing after piles of buried animals or old indian graves i had a faster way maybe not better but faster i sat down on the ground indian fashion resting my hands lightly on my knees what are you doing jacob asked im going to call the munin i said he laughed a loud bray of sound oh this should be good i closed my eyes and i opened that part of me that dealt with the dead ive heard marianne and her friends describe it to be like opening a door but its so much a part of me that its more like unclenching a hand like opening something in my body that is as natural as reaching across the table for the salt that might sound like an awfully mundane description of something mystical but the mystical stuff truly is a part of everyday life its always there we just choose to ignore it the munin are the spirits of the dead put into a sort of racial memory bank that can be accessed by lukoi who have the ability to speak with them its a rare ability to my knowledge no one in richards pack could do it but i could the munin are just another type of dead and im good with the dead in tennessee the munin of verne and mariannes pack had come quickly and eagerly so very close to being real ghosts crowding around me eager to speak id practiced until i could pick and choose who would join with me and be able to communicate it was close enough to channeling or mediumship that marianne had suggested i could probably do this with normal ghosts if i wanted i didnt want to i didnt like sharing my body with another being dead or alive creeped me out yes it did i waited to feel the press of the munin spreading around me like a ghostly card deck that i could shuffle and pick the very card i wanted nothing happened the munin did not come or rather a gathering of munin did not come there was always one munin that came when i called and sometimes when i didnt raina was the only munin of richards pack that traveled with me always even in tennessee surrounded by munin from a different clan line raina was still there marianne said that raina and i had a etheric bond though she wasnt sure why id managed to call munin hundreds of years old and raina the very recently dead came with more than ease but marcus the previous ulfric remained elusive id thought with my newfound control id be able to call him but not only was marcus not there no one was there the clearing was empty of spirits it shouldnt have been this was the spot where they consumed their dead each pack member eating the flesh to take on the memories and courage or faults of the recently dead they could choose not to feed but it was like the ultimate excommunication raina had been a bad person and i wondered sometimes what exactly you had to do to get excommunicated from the lukoi raina had been so bad that i would have let her go but she was powerful maybe thats why she was still hanging around though hanging around implied she was like the phantoms of vernes pack and she wasnt she was internal to me as if she poured out from inside my body rather than pouring into me from outside marianne still couldnt explain why it worked that way for raina and me some things you just accept and work around because to do anything else is to butt your head against a brick wall the wall will not break first raina filled me like a hand inside a glove and i was the glove but id worked a long time to be able to control her wed worked out a deal of sorts i used her memories and powers and i let her have some fun the problem was that raina had been a sexually sadistic nymphomaniac when alive and death hadnt changed her much i opened my eyes and felt her smile curve my lips felt my face take on her expression i rose to my feet in a graceful line and even my walk was different once id hated that now i shrugged it off as the price of doing business she laughed full throated the kind of laugh that makes a man look in a bar her laugh was deeper than mine contralto a practiced seduction of sound richard went pale hands gripping the arms of his throne anita he made it a question guess again my honey wolf he flinched at the nickname in wolf form richard is a ginger color like red honey though id never really thought of it like that before trust raina to think of something thick and sticky when she looked at a man her words came out of my mouth dont be bitchy when you called me for help i nodded and it was my voice that explained to richards confused frown i was thinking something less than charitable about her she didnt like it jacob walked towards me and stopped when i looked at him with rainas expression you cant have called munin youre not lukoi strange but it hadnt even occurred to me that being a leopard might mean i couldnt call munin it might explain why the other munin hadnt come when i called you said my necromancy wouldnt help me jacob cant have it both ways either im lukoi enough to call the munin or im necromancer enough to help myself we raina and me stalked towards the tall shirtless man raina liked him raina liked most men especially if the man was someone shed never had sex with and among the pack that had been a short list but jacob and more than twenty others were new she looked out over the pack and picked out the new faces she hesitated over paris and didnt like her either you cant have too many alpha bitches in one pack without them fighting amongst themselves i felt something i hadnt felt before from raina caution she didnt like how many new people richard had allowed into the pack in such a short space of time it worried her i realized for the first time that it hadnt just been love that made marcus put up with her as lupa she was powerful but more than that in her own twisted way she did care about the pack and she and i were in perfect agreement on one thing richard had been careless with it but we both felt we could fix it it was almost scary that the wicked bitch of the west and i were in such perfect agreement either i had been corrupted or raina had never been quite as corrupt as i thought i wasnt sure which idea bothered me more of course she thought we should seduce richard into letting us kill a few select people and i was still hoping that a slightly less sweet reason would prevail raina thought i was a fool and i wasnt sure i didnt agree with her scarier and scarier anita richard said my name again hesitant as if he wasnt sure i was in there i turned one hand coming up to my hair flinging it back from my face it was rainas gesture and i watched that one movement make not only richard but sylvie and jamil behind her nervous no frightened i could smell their fear rainas laugh bubbled out of my mouth because she liked it i didnt i never liked it when my friends were afraid of me my enemies fine but not my friends im here richard im here he stared at me the last time i saw you call rainas munin you werent able to think like yourself with her inside you i really didnt leave you for all these months just because i was afraid of how close we all were i left to get my shit together and part of that was learning how to control the munin raina said control me you wish she hadnt said it aloud only in my head it had taken me a long time to realize that some things were said out loud and some things werent it was confusing but you got used to it i said aloud what id seen in vision i saw gregory in a hole naked tied up lying on a bed of bones where is it raina showed me in images it was like a fastforward picture show but the images came with emotions smashing into me one after the other i saw a metal cap that screwed down with a tiny airway on top that let in enough light for you to see if the sun was high enough there was a rope ladder that spilled down into the dark and was taken up when it wasnt needed i was raina kneeling on a bed of bones a human skull next to my knee i had a syringe and injected its contents into a darkhaired man that was chained like id seen gregory chained ankles to wrists he was gagged and blindfolded when the needle went in he whimpered and started to cry the drugs were to keep him from changing i turned him over on his side and saw that a bone fragment had cut into his naked groin i bent towards the smell of fresh blood fresh meat and the absolutely intoxicating stink of fear that came off the man not man lukoi i clawed my way up from my memory before raina pressed our lips over him i shoved it away from me but i could still smell the fear the drugs sweated out on his skin the smell of soap from where raina had cleaned him up daily before the abuse began i knew his name had been todd and hed talked to a reporter about the lukoi helped them set up a blind with a camera on a full moon for money maybe he had deserved to die but not like that no one deserved to die like that i came to myself lying on the ground in front of the throne tears drying on my face jamil and shangda were standing between me and the crowd that had moved to help me claudia and igor were facing off with them and rafael had micah by the arm trying to convince him not to fight his way to me merle and noah were moving up to join claudia and igor this was all about to go to hell i propped myself up on my arms and that small movement froze everyone in place my voice came out hoarse but mine im okay im okay im not sure they believed me but the tension level started to drop almost immediately good i had enough problems tonight without a freeforall breaking out i looked up at richard and all i could feel was anger is that how youre going to kill gregory just leave him down in the oubliette until he rots my voice came out soft because if i lost control of it i wasnt sure how much other control id lose i knew raina she wasnt gone shed want her reward first shed done her job i knew where gregory was i even knew how to get there shed earned her prize i didnt dare lose control of myself with her waiting like a shark just under the water i told them to put gregory some place far away from me i didnt tell them to put him there i got to my feet slowly even my body movements controlled muscles almost stiff with adrenaline and the need to lash out but you left him there whos been going down and pumping him full of drugs to keep him from turning you dont have raina to do the dirty work anymore who was it who was it i screamed it into his face and the rage was all she needed she poured over me and the last control i might have had drowned because i wanted to hurt richard i wanted to do it i hit him closedfist turning my body into it twisting my hand at the end putting all i had into it i did what they taught us to do in martial arts class if it was for real i aimed not at richards face but at a point two inches inside his face that was the real goal i was back in a protective stance before jamil and shangda had time to react i felt them move towards me and felt others move forward too the very thing id been trying to avoid and id set it off raina was laughing in my head laughing at us all richard was leaning over the arm of his throne hair covering his face when sylvie grabbed me i didnt fight her her fingers dug into my arms and i knew id be bruised in the morning or maybe not maybe id heal it jacob was watching it all astonished and pleased i glanced back and found the bodyguards fighting the leopards and rats were spreading out the wolves beginning to close around them i opened my mouth to yell something but richards voice boomed over the clearing enough that one word froze us all and we turned shocked faces to him he was standing in front of his throne blood spattered across one shoulder and on his upper chest one side of his mouth was a red ruin id never been able to do that kind of damage before he spat blood and said im not hurt some of you here have been inside the oubliette you know what it was when raina still lived can you blame the nimirra for hating me for putting her leopard down there you could feel the tension begin to ease as the wolves pulled back richard had to order jamil and shangda to back off and they and claudia and igor pushed at each other like bullies that still didnt know who was tougher i hadnt realized that claudia was nearly six inches taller than jamil until they drew away from each other and he had to stare up at her to glare into her eyes sylvie whispered in my ear are you okay i looked up at richard he was still bleeding other than embarrassed yeah she let me go slowly as if not sure that i was safe to let loose she hovered right next to me between me and richard until he motioned her back he stood in front of me and we stared at each other blood still dripped from his mouth you pack a hell of a punch now he said i nodded if youd been human what would that have done to you broken my jaw or maybe my neck i didnt mean it i said your nimirraj will teach you how to judge your strength you might stop going to your martial arts classes for a while until you understand how your body works now good advice i said he put his hand to his mouth and it came away bright with blood i had the urge to take his hand and lick the blood off of it i wanted to climb his body and press my mouth to his and drink him down the image was so vivid that i had to shut my eyes so i couldnt see him standing there halfnaked bloodied as if that would help me not want him it didnt i could smell his skin the scent of him and the fresh blood like icing on a cake that i couldnt have go get your leopard anita i opened my eyes and looked up at him the oubliette was one of the things you fought against under marcus you said it was inhuman i dont understand how you could use it he was in there for nearly a day before i asked where theyd put him that was my fault but whos idea was it to put him there i asked richard looked at jacob the look said it all i walked over to the tall man you never called me jacob you got your leopard back so what does it matter if you ever touch one of my people again ill kill you you going to pit your kittycats against our pack i shook my head no jacob this is personal between me and you i know the rules i make this a personal challenge between you and me and that means that no one can help you or you he said he stared down at me trying to use his height to intimidate me it didnt work i was used to being short i gave him dead eyes until the smirk on his face faltered and he took one step back which pissed him off but he didnt retake that step jacob might be able to kill richard in a fair fight for dominance but hed never be a true ulfric i stepped up close to him close enough that a good insult would have made us touch theres something weak in you jacob i can smell it and so can they you may challenge richard and win but the pack will never accept you as ulfric you winning will tear them apart itll be a civil war something flashed through his eyes that doesnt scare you you dont care i said he stepped back from me averting his eyes his face you heard the ulfric go fetch your cat before we change our minds you couldnt change your mind with a hundred watt bulb and a team of helpers he frowned at me then sometimes my humor is a little esoteric or maybe its just not funny jacob didnt find it funny go with her sylvie make sure she gets everything she needs to get him out of there and back to the cars safely richard said are you sure you want me to go she asked well stay with him jamil said none of them tried to hide the fact that they were looking at jacob while they said it not only didnt they not trust him but they didnt care that he knew that they didnt trust him how had things downgraded to that what had been happening in the pack that no one had told me about yet plenty from the looks on everyones faces she cant go home until after the ceremony to break her ties with the pack jacob said she will go home when i say she goes home richard said voice low and full of that deep tone he got just before his voice crawled to something growling and inhuman the candidates have all come prepared tonight ulfric dressed to please you then they can dress to please me another night you disappoint you are about to overstep yourself jacob there must have been something in the way he said it because jacob finally shut up and gave a small bow but he managed to make the movement mocking and even from a distance you could tell he didnt mean it but he lowered his eyes with his head as he bent at the waist its a mistake to take your eyes off your opponent i asked am i still lupa until the ceremony i suppose richard said yes sylvie said and they looked at each other good i kicked jacob in the face though not as hard as id hit richard you didnt have to kick as hard to do the same kind of damage i watched who in the pack made movements towards us and who didnt i didnt see what everybody did but i saw enough nobody near the throne made a single move to stop me or help him jacob staggered to his feet his nose had burst like a piece of overripe fruit blood poured from his face over his hands like crimson water he yelled at me voice thick with the blood running down his throat you broke my nose i was in a defensive stance the one id learned in kenpo just in case but he didnt try to hit me back i think he knew that there were too many people close at hand aching for an excuse to hurt him jacob was weak but he was smarter than he looked and not quite as arrogant i am lupa of the thronnos rokke clan maybe just for tonight but i am lupa here and he is ulfric and you will by god show some respect you have no right to question the geri of this clan ive earned my place you just fucked the ulfric i laughed and it startled him made him unsure i know pack law jacob it doesnt matter how i got the job all that matters is that i am lupa and that means that except for the ulfric my word is law his eyes looked uncertain and the first faint trace of fear showed like a bitter scent on the wind you are about to be dethroned as lupa your word means nothing here i am ulfric here jacob not you and i say whose word means something and whose does not until we have the ceremony breaking her ties with our pack anita is still lupa and i will support what she says and i sylvie said and i jamil said shangda said i support my ulfric in all things then lets have a little irony i said since it was jacobs idea to put gregory down in the oubliette let him take gregorys place jacob started to protest hands still trying to stop the blood flow from his nose you cant do that oh but she can richard said and there was a coldness in him that id never seen before he wouldnt have come up with the idea himself but he liked it it let me know just how frustrated hed been with jacob great i said shall we all walk like civilized wereanimals to the oubliette and rescue gregory i will not go willingly down in that hole jacob said his voice sounded a little funny what with all the blood and his nose smashed to hell but he sounded sure of himself he shouldnt have been your ulfric and your lupa have both decreed you will go sylvie said to refuse the order is to refuse their authority jamil continued to refuse their authority is to be declared outlaw from the clan jacob glared at me when he said i will obey my ulfric but i do not acknowledge the nimirra as my lupa if i say she is lupa then to deny that is to question my authority as ulfric richard said jacobs eyes flicked to richard we voted her out as our lupa im voting her back in richard said voice deep and quiet but loud enough that it carried take another vote jacob said still trying to slow the blood from his face it will go against her again no jacob you misunderstand me i said i am voting her back in not you not anyone else just me jacobs eyes widened youve preached about democracy in action since i joined this clan are you going back on all of it now not on all of it but we dont vote for freki or geri or for hati and skцll we dont vote for ulfric why should we vote for lupa shes fucking the nimirraj for that alone she should be cast out as lupa thats my problem not yours not the packs you going to fuck her too you think the nimirraj will share richard started to say something but micah spoke first taking a step from the rest his guards flanking him why dont you ask the nimirraj richard looked at me a question in his eyes i shrugged ask him jacob richard said the blood had almost stopped dripping from richards mouth you mind if the ulfric fucks your nimirra jacob was still bleeding like a stuck pig his chest stomach even the front of his shorts were soaked with blood ive agreed to any arrangement that anita wishes as long as she remains my nimirra and lover youd share her with another man jacob said voice thick with disbelief with two other men micah said that got almost everybody staring at him i glanced at him but mostly watched everyone elses reaction especially richards the others looked shocked richard looked thoughtful as if micah had finally done something he didnt hate she is the master of the citys human servant being my nimirra has not changed that ive felt the mark that binds them together and it is not something that will break as apparently the mark that binds her to the ulfric will not break nothing binds her to the ulfric but her stubbornness and his jacob said you think so micah made it a question jacob looked uncertain the blood from his nose was finally beginning to slow youve seen more than ive seen if you think they still have a special bond more than any of us have seen this from paris who had pushed her way to the front of the crowd i am nimirraj of course i see more than you do his voice made it so logical so matter of fact i am geri third in line to the throne noah is my third in line i think if you ask him he will say he did not see what i saw either third in line to be nimirraj or ulfric is not the same as being the real thing i fought not to give micah the look of gratitude that i wanted to give him we were still deep in bluff territory and not safely out the other side yet you cant mean to share your lupa with two other men paris said shed pushed her way to stand in front of richard with her back to me she was either being insulting or stupid maybe both richard looked down at her and it wasnt a friendly look somehow i didnt think paris ever had a very good shot at being lupa not with richard in charge anyway what i and my lupa do or dont do is none of your business i saw her back stiffen as if hed hit her and maybe he had hit her pride shed really believed she could seduce him into picking her i could have told her that sex wasnt the key to richards heart he liked it well enough but it wasnt one of his top priorities not if it interfered with other things that were it had been the same mistake that raina had made with him or one of the mistakes shed made with him raina had never really understood richard either you cant just arbitrarily decide you dont need a vote for this jacob said yes richard said i can i stepped up beside jacob thats what being ulfric means jacob youre going back to a dictatorship after all the highminded talk jacob said for tonight its sufficient that anita is my lupa and thats not going to change well discuss everything else later i say we put it to a vote whether the pack wants to go back to being a dictatorship jacob said if you dont have someone set that nose it may heal crooked i said he glared at me you stay out of this richard called up a man with short brown hair and a neat mustache he shrugged a backpack off his shoulders and began taking out medical supplies fix his nose richard said and then turned to sylvie when hes bandaged up pick some people and escort jacob to the oubliette there were murmurings in the crowd one clear voice that i hadnt heard before said you cant do that richard looked up searching the crowd and they fell silent under his gaze his power rolled out from him like a burning invisible fog something that clung to your skin and made it hard to breath they avoided his eyes some even dropped down into submissive postures their bodies low to the ground eyes rolled up arms and legs held close making themselves seem small and defenseless clearly asking not to be hurt i am ulfric here if there is any among you that disagree with that then you are free to challenge the next in line and the next after that until you are freki then declare yourself fenrir and you can challenge me if you kill me then you can be ulfric and you can set any damn policy you want until that time shut the fuck up and follow my orders i dont think id ever heard richard cuss the silence was thick enough to cut it was jacob who cut it like i knew he would he pushed the mustached doctor away impatiently while the shorter man tried to pack his nose with what looked like gauze anita shows back up and so does your backbone does she kill and torture for you like raina did for marcus richards fist struck out in a blur that i couldnt follow it was almost magical one moment jacob was standing the next moment he was on the ground with his eyes rolled back inside his head richard turned to the rest of them the dried blood decorating his nude upper body his hair turned to spun bronze in the torchlight his eyes had gone wolf amber and looked more gold than normal against his darker than usual summer tan i thought we were people not animals i thought we could change the old ways and make something better but we all felt it tonight when anita and her leopards melded something safe and good ive tried to be temperate and kind and look where its gotten us jacob said anita is my backbone no but shes doing something right something that ive missed if you wont take kindness then well have to try something else he looked at me with those alien eyes and said lets go get your leopard we need to get him out of the oubliette before jacob comes to and he stalked off through the trees and left the rest of us to trail after there was no question about what to do next we followed richard into the trees we followed the ulfric because youre supposed to follow your king if hes worthy of the name for the first time ever i thought maybe just maybe richard was going to be ulfric after all the oubliette was a rounded metal lid set in the ground the metal lid sat in the middle of a clearing scattered with tall thin trees honeysuckle bushes ringed the lid on one side leaves were so thick on the ground that the area looked untouched i would never have found it if i hadnt known it was there oubliette is french for a little place of forgetting but thats not a direct translation oubliette simply means little forgetting but what it is is a place where you put people when you dont plan on ever letting them out traditionally its a hole where once you push someone in they cant get out you dont feed them or water them or talk to them or anything to them you just walk away theres a scottish castle where they found an oubliette that had literally been walled up and forgotten discovered only during modern remodeling the floor was littered with bones and had an eighteenthcentury pocket watch in among the debris it had an opening where you could see the main dining hall could have smelled the food while you starved to death i remembered wondering if you could hear the person screaming from the dining hall while you ate most oubliettes are more isolated so that once you put him away you never have to worry about the prisoner again two of the werewolves in nice human form knelt by the metal and began unscrewing two huge bolts in the lid there was no key you screwed the lid in place and just walked away fuck the lid lifted off and it took both of them to carry it away heavy just in case the drugs didnt keep the adrenaline from pumping enough and cause the change even in animal form youd still have a hard time getting through the lid i walked to the edge of the hole and the smell drove me back it smelled like an outhouse i dont know why it surprised me gregory had been down there for what three days four in the movies they talk about you starving to death the romantic stuff if such horror is really romantic but no one ever talks about your bowels moving or the fact that when you have to go you have to go its not romantic its just humiliating jamil brought a rope ladder and attached it with large metal clips to the side of the hole the ladder fell away into the darkness with a dry slithery sound i forced myself to crawl back to the edge of the oubliette i was prepared now for the smell and underneath the ripe smell of life in too small a space was a dry smell a dry dusty smell the smell of old bones old death gregory wasnt the strongest person i knew not even one of the top hundred what had it done to him to lie there in the dark with the stench of old bones old death pressed against his body had they explained to him how theyd leave him there to die had they told him every time they screwed the lid back in place that they werent coming back except to drug him the hole was like a perfect blackness darker than the starfilled night sky darker than anything id seen in a long time it was wide enough for richards broad shoulders to have scooted down into the dark but barely the longer i stared at it the narrower it seemed to become as if it were some great black mouth waiting to swallow me down have i mentioned that im claustrophobic richard came to stand beside me peering down into the hole he had an unlit flashlight in his hand something must have shown on my face because he said even we need some light to see by i held my hand out for the flashlight he shook his head i let this happen ill get him out i shook my head no hes mine he knelt beside me and spoke softly i can smell your fear i know you dont like close places i stared back into the hole and let myself acknowledge just how afraid i was so afraid that i could taste something flat and metallic on my tongue so afraid that my pulse was hammering in my throat like a trapped thing my voice came out calm normal i was glad it doesnt matter that im afraid i touched the flashlight tried to pull it from his hand but he held on and short of playing tug of war which i would probably lose i wasnt getting it away from him why do you have to be the toughest the bravest why cant you just once let me do something for you going down in the hole doesnt scare me let me do this for you please his voice was still soft and he was leaning into me enough so that i could smell the drying blood on him the richness of fresh blood in his mouth as if some small cut had not healed completely i shook my head i have to do it richard why and his voice held the first hint of anger like a slap of warmth because it scares me and i have to know if i can can what if i can crawl down into that hole why why do you need to know that youve proven to me and everyone here that youre tough you dont have anything left to prove to us to me richard i have something left to prove to me what difference would it make if you couldnt climb down in that stinking hole youll never have to do it again anita just dont do it i looked at him at the puzzlement in his face his eyes which had bled back to their normal perfect brown id been trying to explain shit like this to richard for a few years now i finally realized that he would never understand and i was tired of trying to explain myself not just to richard to everybody give me the flashlight richard he held on with both hands why do you have to do this just tell me that youre so scared your mouth is dry i can taste it on your breath and i can taste fresh blood on yours but i have to do it because it scares me he shook his head this isnt courage anita this is stubbornness i shrugged maybe but i still have to do it he clutched the flashlight tighter why and somehow i thought the question was about more than the oubliette and why i had to climb inside it i sighed less and less scares me richard so when i find something that does bother me i have to test it i have to see if i can do it why he studied my face like hed memorize it just to see if i can why and the anger was more than a faint hint now i shook my head im not competing with you richard or anyone else i dont give a shit whos better or faster or braver then why do it the only person i compete against is me richard and ill think less of me if i let you or anyone else climb down in that hole first gregory is my boy not yours and i have to rescue him youve already rescued him anita it doesnt matter who climbs in the damn hole i almost smiled but not like it was funny give me the flashlight please richard i cant explain this to you does your nimirraj understand it the anger burned along my skin like a swarm of stings it damn near hurt i frowned at him ask him yourself now give me the damn flashlight if you get angry at me it never takes me long to respond i want to be your ulfric anita your guy whatever the hell that means why wont you let me be he stopped talking looking away from me the man was that what you were going to say he looked back at me and nodded look if we keep dating or whatever the hell were going to do we have to get one thing straight your ego is no longer my problem dont be the man for me richard be the person i need you dont have to be bigger and braver than i am to be my man ive got male friends that spend most of their time trying to prove they have bigger brassier balls than i do i dont need that from you what if i need to be braver than you for myself not for you i thought about that for a second or two then said youre not afraid of going down into the oubliette are you i dont want to go down and i dont want to see what theyve done to gregory but im not as afraid as you are no then it doesnt make you braver than me to go down into the hole does it because it doesnt cost you anything to go down there he leaned very very close to my ear then breathed the barest of sounds against my skin like it would cost you nothing to kill jacob for me i stiffened beside him then turned trying to keep the shock off my face i knew that was what you were thinking the moment i saw you look at him richard said youd let me do that i asked voice soft but not as soft as his had been i dont know yet but wouldnt your reasoning be that it would cost you nothing to do it and it would cost me dear we stared at each other i finally nodded he smiled then let me go down the fucking hole when did you start using the fword while you were away i think i missed hearing it he grinned at me suddenly a bright flash of smile in the dark i couldnt not smile back kneeling by that horrible black opening fear still flat on my tongue his anger still riding the air between us and we smiled at each other ill let you go down the hole first i said the smile widened until it filled his eyes and even by starlight i could see them gleam with humor okay i leaned into him and gave him a quick kiss too quick for the powers to move between us too quick to taste the blood in his mouth too quick to find out if our beasts would roil through each others bodies i kissed him just because i wanted to because for the first time i thought we might both be willing to bend a little would it be enough who the hell knew but i was hopeful for the first time in a long time i was truly hopeful without hope love dies and parts of you wither i didnt know what it meant for micah that i had hope for richard and me wed talked openly about sharing but i didnt know how much of that had been for public show and how much had been real but right that second i didnt care i clutched that positive emotion to me and held on later later wed worry about other things id let richard climb down first but id still be going down and i wanted that small warm hope inside my chest along with the fear richards weight on the rope ladder kept it tight under my hands hed put his flashlight on a strap around his wrist i watched the pool of yellow light vanishing down into that narrow darkness and realized that i was still barely on the ladder my head still aboveground micah was kneeling beside the hole itll be alright he said i swallowed and looked at him knowing my eyes were just a little wide i know but my voice came out breathy you really dont have to do this he said voice soft and as neutral as he could make it i frowned at him dont you start then you better catch up with him his voice was a little less neutral but i couldnt tell what tone it held i started climbing down the soft roughness of the rope ladder moving quickly angrily i wasnt angry with micah not really i was angry with me the anger got me well down into the dark where the light from the flashlight below me seemed very yellow and very stark against the earthen walls i clung there for a second or two staring at that hardpacked earth i gazed up slowly and found micah staring down at me from a distance so far away that i couldnt tell what color his eyes or hair were i knew it was him from the shape of his face and shoulders my god how deep did this pit go it seemed like the earthen walls were curving in towards me like a hand about to close into a fist and crush me so that i couldnt breath enough of the stale flat air to fill my lungs i closed my eyes and forced myself to move one hand off the ladder and touch the wall it was farther away than id thought and when i finally touched it it startled me the earth was surprisingly cool against my hand and i realized it was cool in the pit even with early summer heat up above i opened my eyes and the walls were still about six feet circular just like theyd always been the earth wasnt closing in around me only my phobia was doing that i started climbing down again and this time i didnt stop until i felt the ladder loosen under my body and it was suddenly harder to climb down without bumping into the dirt walls richards weight was no longer steadying the ladder for me if i hadnt been such a pain in the ass i might have asked for him to hold it steady until i got down to the end instead i hugged the ladder frantically and kept moving downward its hard to cling to something while youre climbing down it but i managed the world narrowed down to the feel of the rope under my hands my feet trying to find purchase just the simple act of moving downward it got to the point that i stopped jumping every time my body bumped the walls hands touched my waist and i let out that little yip that is only a girl sound i always hated when i did it they were richards hands around my waist of course he steadied me the last few feet while my heart tried to jump out of my chest i stepped down onto a floor that crunched and rolled with bones they were deep yet you didnt sink into them rather walked on top of them like a saint treading on water the narrow shaft opened into a small cramped cavelike hole in the earth richard had to stand bent almost in two i could stand up if i was careful though the top of my hair brushed the ceiling solidly enough that ducking a little was a good idea micah called from way way above us are you alright it took me two tries to be able to say fine were fine micah pulled back from the opening a dark dot against the paler grayness my god how far down are we sixty feet give or take there was something in his voice that made me turn to him he shook his head and looked to one side shining the flashlight on something small and hunched it was gregory he was on his stomach hogtied his arms and legs at such acute angles that i couldnt imagine lying there like that for three days he was nude a white cloth blindfold cutting across his face knotted in a tangle of long blond hair as if even that had been done to hurt and not merely to blind as richards light played over gregorys body he made small helpless sounds he could see the light through the cloth if nothing else i knelt beside him seeing where the silver chains had dug into his wrists and ankles the wounds were raw and bloody where hed struggled against them the chains have rubbed him raw richard said voice soft he struggled i said no hes not powerful enough to take this much silver against his skin the chains ate their way into his skin i stared at the raw wounds and didnt know what to say i touched gregorys shoulder and he screamed through the gag i hadnt seen his hair had hidden it but there was a dark rag stuffed in his mouth he screamed again and tried to worm away from me gregory gregory its anita i touched him as gently as i could and he screamed once more i looked up at richard he doesnt seem to hear me richard knelt and raised a tangle of gregorys hair gregory struggled harder and richard handed me the flashlight so he could use one hand to steady the smaller mans face and the other to keep the hair out of the way there was more cloth stuffed in his ears richard pulled out the cloth and found a black earplug deeper in the channel they were never meant to be pushed in that far and when richard pulled it free fresh blood trickled from his ear i just stared my mind frozen for a second not wanting to understand but finally i heard myself say it they burst his eardrums why for gods sake wasnt the blindfold and gag enough sensory deprivation richard held the earplug up to the light i had to shine the flashlight directly on it to see that it had a metal point what is that silver he said oh god they were designed for this remember marcus was a doctor he knew all kinds of medical supply places places that would make things the look on richards face told me he was lost in memory and something darker i glanced back at the marks on gregorys arms and legs dear god did the silver tear up his ear canals the way it did his skin i dont know its good that its still bleeding it means if he shapeshifts soon hell probably heal richards voice was thick i wasnt close to crying the horror too overwhelming for tears i wanted jacob down here and whoever had helped him because you didnt do this to a shapeshifter without help not oneonone richard tried to take off the blindfold but it was tied so tight he couldnt get a good hold on it i handed him the flashlight and drew the knife from my left wrist sheath hold him the knives are sharp i dont want to cut him if he struggles richard held gregorys head between his two hands like a vise and gregory struggled harder screaming through the gag but richard held him firm while i slid the knife carefully between the cloth and gregorys hair one quick slice downward and the blindfold eased away from his skin but it had been tied so tight for so long that richard had to peel it away gregory blinked at the light and saw richard and screamed more something died on richards face when he did it like it had killed something inside him to have anyone be that terrified of him i leaned over placing my hand carefully on the pile of bones and watched gregorys eyes finally see me he stopped screaming but he didnt look relieved enough i pulled the gag out of his mouth and it peeled away taking bits of lip skin with it he worked his mouth slowly and for some odd reason i was reminded of the scene from the wizard of oz where dorothy puts oil on the tin mans jaw after hed been rusted the image should have made me smile but it didnt there was a padlock on the chains around each of his limbs richard crawled around me letting me stay where gregory could see me i was saying over and over again its going to be alright its going to be alright he couldnt hear me but it was the best i knew how to do richard snapped the lock on one wrist and pain showed on gregorys face like it hurt for the arm to move at all richard freed both wrists and then began to slowly uncurl gregorys body gregory screamed but not from fear this time from pain i tried to cradle him but moving at all seemed to hurt it took both of us crawling around to get him unbent enough to lay in my lap he was never going to be able to climb the ladder the bends of both of his arms were covered in needle marks none of them had healed the needle marks why havent they healed silver needles in direct contact with the bloodstream a sedative to keep the adrenaline low so you cant change but not so much that you cant feel or know where you are and whats happening thats how raina used to do it this is how she used to tie them up and exactly what she used to do to them how did jacob know that i asked one of my people told him richard said he stayed on his knees rather than stand bent over his face was calm almost serene i want them down here whoever helped jacob whoever brought out those damn earplugs i want them down here he turned those calm eyes to me and i saw the anger at the bottom of that calm could you do this to someone could you plunge these things in their ears could you do all this to anyone i thought about that really thought about it i was angry sickened i wanted to punish someone but no no i could shoot them kill them but i couldnt do this neither could i he said you knew gregory was in the oubliette but you didnt know what theyd done to him did you he shook his head kneeling on the bones still staring down at the bloody earplug like it held answers to questions too hard to ask out loud jacob knew youre ulfric richard you should know whats done in your packs name the anger flared so hot and tight that it filled the little cave like water just this side of boiling gregory whimpered and watched richard with fearful eyes i know anita i know so youre not going to put jacob down here i am but not like this he can stay down here but not chained not tortured richard glanced around the tiny space being down here at all is torture enough i didnt even try to argue that one what about whoever helped him richard looked at me ill find out who helped him then what he closed his eyes and it wasnt until he opened his hand and i saw the flash of blood that i realized hed pressed the silver point into his palm he pulled it out and stared at the bright flash of blood you just keep pushing dont you anita the pack knows you well enough richard they know you didnt mean for anyone to be put down here especially not with all rainas old accoutrements doing this at all was a challenge to your authority i know that i dont want to fight richard but you have to punish them for this if you dont then you lose more ground to jacob even if you put him down here it wont stop things everyone that touched this has to suffer youre not angry now he said and he looked puzzled i thought you wanted revenge but you seem cold about it all now i wanted revenge but youre right i couldnt do this to anyone and i cant order done what i wouldnt do myself just a rule ive got but the pack is a mess and if you want to stop the downward slide and keep them from a civil war werewolf against werewolf you must be harsh you must make it clear that this is not acceptable it isnt he said theres only one way for them to know that richard punishment he said and he made the word sound like a curse yes i said ive worked for months no years to try and get away from a punitive system you want me to throw away all that ive worked for and go back to the way it was gregorys hand came up slowly painfully to clutch weakly at my arm i stroked his matted hair and his voice came out hoarse abused as if even through the gag hed been screaming for days i want out of here please i nodded my head so he could see it and a relief so large it was beyond words flashed through his eyes i looked up at richard if your system worked better than the old one then id support it but its not working im sorry that its not working richard but its not if you continue this experiment in democracy and gentler kinder laws people are going to die not just you but sylvie and jamil and shangda and every wolf that supports you but its worse than that richard i watched the pack theyre divided almost evenly it will be civil war and they will tear each other to bits jacobs followers and the ones who wont follow him hundreds will die and the thronnos rokke clan may die with it look at the throne youre sitting on as ulfric its ancient you can feel it dont let everything that it stands for be destroyed he stared down at the stillbleeding wound in his hand lets get gregory out of here youll punish jacob but not the others i said and my voice was tired ill find out who they are first then well see i shook my head i love you richard i hear a but coming but i value the people who count on me for their safety more than i value that love it felt cold and awful saying it out loud but it was true what does that say about your love he asked dont go all sanctimonious on me richard you dropped me like yesterdays news when the pack voted me out you could have said screw it take the throne i want anita more but you didnt you really think jacob would have let me walk away i dont know but you didnt make the offer it didnt even occur to you to make the offer did it he looked away then back and his eyes held such sadness that i wanted to take it back but i couldnt it was time we talked it was like the old joke about the elephant in the living room no one acknowledged it existed until the shit was so deep they couldnt walk glancing down at gregory i knew the shit was too deep to ignore we were out of options except for the truth no matter how brutal if id stepped down as ulfric even if jacob had let me do it it would still have been civil war hed have still executed those closest to me it would have been deserting them id rather die than just walk away and leave them to be slaughtered if thats how you really feel richard then ive got a better plan make an example of jacob and his followers its not that simple anita jacobs got enough support that it might still be war not if its bloody enough what are you saying make them fear you richard make them fear you machiavelli said it nearly six hundred years ago but its still true every ruler should strive for his people to love him but if they cannot love you then make them fear you love is better but fear will do the job he swallowed hard and there was something close to fear in his eyes i think i could kill jacob and even execute one or two of his people but you dont think thats enough do you depends on how you execute them what are you asking me to do anita i sighed and stroked gregorys cheek im asking you to do what needs doing richard if you want to hold this pack together and save hundreds of lives then im telling you how you can do it with the minimum amount of bloodshed i can kill jacob but i cant do what youre asking i cant do something so terrible that the entire pack would fear me he looked at me and there was a wildness a panic in his face like a trapped thing that finally realizes there is no escape i could feel my face grow calm and i felt myself sinking into that place where there is nothing but white noise and the solid almost comforting surety that i felt nothing i said softly i can he turned away from me as if i hadnt spoken and called up for them to lower the harness we slid the harness around gregory talking only about the task at hand no metaphysics no politics there was a second harness on the rope and richard made me put it on id get to cradle gregory protecting him with my body so he didnt get scraped up too badly ive never done this before i said im too broad through the shoulders to add gregorys bulk to mine it has to be you besides youll keep him safe i know you will there was something in his eyes that made me want to say something but he jerked on the rope and we started rising into the air richard watched us face upturned his flashlight casting odd shadows around the small room as he knelt on the bones then we were up inside the tunnel and i couldnt see him anymore i had my arms full literally and figuratively trying to keep gregory from crashing into the walls his arms and legs were still almost useless i wasnt sure if it was because of the long confinement or the drugs hed been given or both probably both gregory kept saying thank you thank you thank you under his breath by the time we reached the top there were tears drying on my cheeks regardless of what richard decided someone was going to pay jacob was there already bound in silver chains carried like a piece of struggling luggage between three werewolves they let him keep his cutoff shorts no nudity for the good guys i guess there have to be some differences or how do you tell which side youre on cherry was already checking gregory over she had to keep chasing the other leopards back they kept trying to touch him i stared across the clearing at jacob the look in his eyes was enough richard could be squeamish if he wanted to be but if i let what had been done to gregory stand unchallenged then jacob and his followers would see it as weakness theyd turn and destroy us once jacob secured his power base because there was one way for jacob to avoid a civil war and that was by doing what i was encouraging richard to do if he did something so terrible that the others were afraid to fight then he could be ulfric without a bloodbath id seen what hed done to gregory call it a hunch but i was willing to bet jacob would do what needed doing he didnt strike me as the squeamish sort richard climbed out of the hole put him in do you want the drugs used sylvie asked richard nodded what about the blindfold and the rest richard shook his head not necessary jacob started struggling again you cant do this richard knelt in front of him holding him by his thick hair the grip looked painful who showed you where these were he held his hand out with the silvertipped earplugs in his palm oh my god sylvie whispered others asked what is it who jacob who told you our dirty little secrets jacob just stared at him i could have them used on you richard said jacob paled a little but he didnt answer his jaw was so tense that i could see the muscles pulsing but he didnt give up whod helped him he didnt even ask if answering the question would save him from the oubliette i had to admire that at least but i didnt have to like it you wouldnt do that it was paris looking a lot less confident than she had by the throne she looked downright unsure of herself in her skintight dress richard looked at her for a long time or maybe it just seemed long and something in his eyes made her look away youre right i cant use them on jacob or anyone he looked around the clearing at the scattered wolves and at the ones waiting in the trees beyond but hear me if there are anymore of these things around i want them destroyed when jacob comes out of the oubliette it is to be sealed up forever you have learned nothing from me if any of you could do this you have learned nothing he signaled sylvie and she came forward with a syringe the three werewolves had to hold jacob against the ground for her to give him the shot they held him until his limbs went limp and his eyes fluttered shut hell wake up in the oubliette richard said his voice held not just tiredness but defeat he turned to me as they carried jacob towards the hole take your leopards and your allies and go home anita im lupa remember you cant kick me out of pack business he smiled but it left his eyes empty and tired youre still lupa but for tonight youre also nimirra and your leopards need you take care of gregory and for what its worth im sorry about all of this sorry is worth something richard but it doesnt change things it never does he said i couldnt read his mood he wasnt sad exactly or worried or anything i had a name for except defeated it was like hed already lost the battle what are you going to do i asked im going to find out who helped jacob do this how i asked he smiled and shook his head go home anita i stood and looked at him for a heartbeat or two then turned back to my leopards gregory was on a stretcher and zane and noah were carrying it cherry was talking to the werewolf doctor that had packed jacobs nose she was doing a lot of nodding instructions maybe micah was standing at the edge of the group watching me i met his eyes but neither of us smiled i looked back but richard was already moving off through the trees with jamil and shangda at his back micahs face was very neutral as i walked towards him i wasnt hopeful anymore i could have played it cool but i didnt want to i was tired so terribly tired my clothes smelled like an outhouse and probably so did my skin i wanted a shower clean clothes and to make the lost look in gregorys eyes go away the shower and clothes were the easy part i didnt even know how to begin to make gregorys pain go away i held out my hand to micah not because of otherworldly energy apparently depression dampens that but because i wanted the touch of another hand i wanted the comfort and i didnt want to have to think about it i just wanted to be held he widened his eyes but took my hand squeezing it gently i started walking towards the trees leading him by the hand the others followed us even the swan king and the wererats anita blake preternatural pied piper the thought should have made me smile but it didnt two hours later id had a shower and gregory had had a bath though id showered by myself and gregory had had company he still didnt have complete use of his arms and legs i didnt think that cherry zane and nathaniel needed to get naked and in the tub with him but hey i wasnt offering to help so who was i to complain besides it never became sexual it was as if the touch of their flesh on his was necessary part of the healing process maybe it was i was sitting at my new kitchen table my old twoseater table just hadnt been roomy enough for all the wereleopards to have bagels and cream cheese at the same time the new table was pale pine varnished to a golden glow there still wasnt enough room at the table for everyone to sit and drink coffee but it was closer id have needed a banquet table to have that much room and the kitchen wasnt long enough for it there was more than one reason that feudal lords had had great big castles you needed the room just to feed and care for all your people the only person sitting in the dimly lit kitchen was dr lillian elizabeth had been transported to the secret hospital that the shapeshifters kept in st louis all my other leopards were tending to gregory micah and his cats wandered around the periphery of it all caleb had tried to include himself in the bath and had been refused the rest of micahs pard seemed unsettled nervous not knowing what to do with themselves i had my priority for the evening taking care of gregory everything else could wait one disaster at a time or you lose your way and your mind dr lillian was a small woman with gray hair cut straight just above her shoulders her hair was longer than the first time i met her but everything else was the same id never seen her wear makeup and her face still looked pleasant and attractive in a fiftyplus sort of way though id discovered she was actually well over sixty she certainly didnt look it the drugs are still in his system dr lillian said drugs plural i asked she nodded our metabolism is so fast that it takes quite a cocktail of chemicals to keep us sedated for any length of time gregory wasnt sedated he seemed very much aware of everything that was happening i said but his heart his breathing his involuntary reflexes were all subdued if you cant access the full effects of an adrenaline rush you cant change shape why not lillian shrugged taking a small sip of her coffee we dont know but there is something in the extremes of the fight or flight response that opens the way for our beast if you can deprive a shapeshifter of that response then you can keep them from shifting indefinitely i asked no the full moon will bring it on no matter what drugs you pump into someone how long until gregorys back to normal her eyes flicked downward then up and i didnt like that shed needed that second to school her eyes as if something bad were coming the drugs will probably wear off in about eight hours maybe more maybe less it depends on so many things so he stays here until the drugs wear off then he shapeshifts and hes fine right i put a lilt at the end making it a question because i knew the atmosphere was too serious for it to be that easy im afraid not she said whats wrong doc why so solemn she gave a small smile in eight hours the damage to gregorys ears may be permanent i blinked at her you mean hell stay deaf yes thats not acceptable i said her smile widened you say that as if by sheer will you can change things anita it makes you seem very young are you telling me that theres nothing we can do to heal him no im not saying that please doc just tell me if you were truly nimirra then you might be able to call his beast out of his flesh and force the change even with the drugs in his system if someone can tell me how to do it im willing to give it a shot so you believe that you will be nimirra in truth come full moon lillian asked i shrugged and sipped my coffee not a hundred percent sure no but the evidence is sort of mounting up how do you feel about that being nimirra for real i asked she nodded im trying really hard not to think too much about it ignoring it wont make it go away anita i know that but worrying about it wont change things either very practical of you if you can pull it off what not worrying she nodded again i shrugged ill worry about each disaster as it happens can you really compartmentalize to that degree how do we fix gregory i take that as a yes she said i smiled yes as i said if you were a nimirra in full power you might be able to call his beast even through the drugs but since i havent shifted yet i cant i doubt it its a rather specialized skill even among full shapeshifters can rafael do it she smiled the smile that most of the wererats got when you asked about their king it was a smile that held warmth and pride they liked and respected him lets hear it for good leadership no that surprised me and it must have shown on my face i told you it is a rare talent your ulfric can do it i looked at her you mean richard do you have another ulfric she asked smiling i almost smiled back no but we need someone who can call leopards right she nodded how about micah ive already asked him neither he nor merle can call anothers beast micah did offer to try and heal gregory by calling flesh but the injuries are beyond him when did micah try and heal gregory while you were cleaning up she said i took a quick shower it didnt take long for him to be certain that gregorys injuries were above his abilities you wouldnt be belaboring the point if there wasnt some hope i can use other drugs to try and overcome the effects but i said but the mix of the drugs could explode his heart or rupture enough blood vessels in other major organs to kill him i stared at her for a heartbeat or two how bad are the odds bad enough that i need his nimirras permission before trying has gregory given his permission hes terrified he wants to be able to hear again of course he wants me to try but im not sure hes thinking clearly so youre coming to me like youd go to a parent for a child i said i need someone who is thinking clearly to make a decision on gregory behalf he has a brother i frowned because i realized i hadnt seen stephen at the lupanar where is stephen ive been told that the ulfric ordered gregorys brother not to attend tonight something about it being unfair for him to watch his own brother executed vivian has gone to get him my that was big of richard you sound bitter do i and that sounded bitter even to me i sighed im just frustrated lillian richard is going to get people i care about slaughtered not to mention himself which risks both you and the master of the city i frowned at her i guess everyone does know that part i think so she said yeah hes risking us all for his high moral ideals ideals are worth sacrifice anita maybe but im not a hundred percent sure ive ever held an ideal close enough to trade the people i love for it ideals can die but they dont breathe they dont bleed they dont cry so you would trade all your ideals for the people you care about she asked im not sure i have any ideals anymore youre still christian arent you my religion isnt an ideal ideals are abstract things that you cant touch or see my religion isnt abstract its very stract very real you cant see god she said you cant hold him in your hand how many angels can dance on the head of a pin huh she smiled something like that ive held a cross while it flared so bright it blinded me until all the world was just white fire ive seen a copy of the talmud go up in flames in a vampires hands and even after the book had burned to ash the vampire kept burning until it died ive stood in the presence of a demon and recited holy script and the demon could not touch me i shook my head religion isnt an abstract thing dr lillian it is a living breathing growing organic thing organic sounds more wiccan than christian she said i shrugged ive been studying with a psychic and some of her wiccan friends for about a year hard not to soak some of it up doesnt studying wicca put you in an awkward position you mean because im a monotheist she nodded i have godgiven abilities and not enough training to control those abilities most denominations of the church frown on psychics let alone someone who raises the dead i need training so ive found people to train me the fact that theyre not christian i see as a failing of the church not a failing of theirs there are christian witches she said ive met some of them they all seem to be zealots as if they have to be more christian than anyone else to prove that theyre good enough to be christian at all i dont like zealots neither do i she said we looked at each other in the darkened kitchen she raised her coffee mug id given her the one with a tiny knight and a large dragon that said no guts no glory lillian said down with zealots i raised my own mug in the air it was the baby penguin mug still a favorite down with zealots we drank she set her mug on the coaster and said do i have your permission to try the drugs on gregory i took a deep breath and let it out slowly then nodded if he agrees do it she pushed back from the table and stood ill get everything ready i nodded but stayed sitting i was praying when i felt someone come into the room without opening my eyes i knew it was micah he waited until i raised my head opened my eyes i didnt mean to interrupt he said im finished i said he nodded and gave that smile of his that was part amusement part sorrow and part something else you were praying he made it a question yes some trick of the light made his eyes gleam in the dark like there was a spark of hidden fire down deep in their green gold depths the illusion lost his eyes and most of his face to shadow and darkness only that shimmering gleam remained as if the color dancing in his eyes was more real than the rest of him without seeing his face i knew he was upset i could feel it like a tension down my spine whats wrong i asked i cant remember the last time i prayed i shrugged a lot of people dont pray why does it surprise me that you do he asked i shrugged again he took a step forward and the light fell upon his face and that odd mixed smile of his i have to go whats wrong i asked what makes you think anythings wrong tension level between you and your cats whats up micah he pressed his thumb and forefinger against his eyes rubbing as if he were tired he blinked those jewellike eyes at me a pard emergency weve got one member that couldnt come tonight and shes got herself in trouble what kind of trouble violet is our version of your nathaniel the least dominant of us he left it at that as if it explained everything it did and it didnt and i said and i have to go help her i dont like secrets micah he sighed running his fingers through his hair he ripped the ponytail holder out threw it on the floor ran his hands through the shoulderlength curls over and over as if hed been wanting to do it all night the movement was harsh frantic with tension he looked down at me dark brown hair in disarray around his face eyes gleaming in an instant he went from being this nice attractive man to something feral and alien it wasnt just the hair or the kittycat eyes his beast bubbled against my skin like boiling water id felt his power but not like this almost hot enough to scald then i realized that i could see that heat see it it flowed over him invisible but almost not like something halfseen out of the corner of your eye i could almost see the shape of something monstrous looming around him like heat rising off of summer pavement a rippling thing id been around shapeshifters for years and never seen anything like it merle appeared in the doorway nimirraj is anything wrong micah turned and i got a swimming afterimage as if something large and almost invisible moved around and just above his body his voice came out low and growling wrong what could possibly be wrong gina pushed past merle weve got to go micah micah put his hands up and the afterimage moved with him i couldnt actually see claws and fur just hints of it swimming around him he covered his eyes with his hands and i saw those ghostly claws go through into past his face watching it made me dizzy and i looked down at the tabletop to steady myself and reality id heard marianne say she could see auras of power around people and lycanthropes but id never been able to see one before i felt his power folding away the heat the skinruffling sensation pulling away like the ocean going back from the shore i raised my face to see and that seennotseen shape was gone swallowed back into his body he stared down at me you look like youve seen a ghost youre closer than you think i said shes afraid of your power gina said and there was scorn in her voice i looked up at her i saw his aura saw it like a white phantom around his body you say that like youve never seen it before micah said i havent not a visual gina took his arm gently but firmly and tried pulling him towards the door he just looked at her and i felt his presence his personality for lack of a better word like something almost touchable she dropped to the floor gripping his hand rubbing her cheek against it i meant no offense micah the look on his face was cold his power his force began to trickle through the room again nimirraj merle said if you are going then you must go if you are not going his voice was careful almost gentle a pitying tone of voice and i didnt understand why micah growled at merle i think then his voice came out normal human i know my duty as nimirraj merle i would never presume to tell you the duties of a nimirraj micah he said micah suddenly looked tired again all that energy draining away he helped gina to her feet though it looked awkward since she was more than a head taller lets go they all turned towards the door i hope your leopard is alright i said micah glanced back would nathaniel be if hed called for help i shook my head no he nodded and turned back for the door mine either he hesitated and said without turning around ill take noah and gina with me but if its alright ill leave merle and caleb here wont you need them with you he looked back smiling i just need to pick up violet i dont need muscle for that and you might want some extra muscle you mean in case jacobs people get pesky his smile widened pesky yeah in case they get pesky then they were gone into the other room and i was left alone at the table lillian came back in her eyes narrowed what i asked she just shook her head none of my business thats right i said but if it were but its not i said she smiled but if it were id say two things youre going to say them anyway arent you yes she said i waved her to go ahead first its nice to see you letting yourself follow your heart with someone new second you dont know this man very well be careful who you give your heart to anita i havent given anyone my heart yet not yet she said i frowned at her you do realize that youve told me to follow my heart and not to follow my heart she nodded those are contradictory bits of advice i said im aware of that then which piece of advice do you want me to follow both of course i shook my head lets go save gregory and worry about my eversordid love life later i cant promise that well save gregory anita i held up a hand i remember the odds doc i followed her out and into the darkened living room and tried to believe really believe in miracles we decided to do it on the deck out back my deck backed to a couple of acres of mature woodland no neighbors no one to see us the deck was also twice the size of the kitchen which was the only part of the house without carpeting once a shapeshifter changed on a carpet it was either steam clean it yourself or hire it done i was not the one who suggested that gregory would ruin the carpet it was actually nathaniel he was after all the person most likely to be vacuuming between housekeeper visits i wasnt even sure i knew where the vacuum was gregory was curled in the center of the deck his head in his brothers lap his arms wrapped around the other mans naked waist only the curling yellow hair paled by moonlight covered stephens upper body hed stripped to the waist in preparation for the change he was going to go out into the woods with his brother this presupposed that gregory would survive the change we had a fiftyfifty chance not bad odds if all you were about to lose was money but when it was someones life fiftyfifty just didnt sound that good stephen looked up at me his cornflower blue eyes were silvered with moonlight he looked pale and ethereal his face was raw with emotion his eyes held an intelligence and a demand that stephen didnt often show he was submissive fragile in every walk of his life but in that moment he laid a demand on me with his eyes his face the pain that showed in the set of his shoulders the fierce way he touched his brother who was still huddled in his lap just a fall of long pale curls and paler skin gregory was naked in the hot summer night and until that moment i hadnt noticed the nudity didnt make me think of sex it made me think how terribly vulnerable he was stephen looked up at me and asked with every line of his body the desperation in his eyes what he was too submissive to say out loud i didnt need to be telepathic to know what he wanted save him save my brother he screamed at me from his eyes to say it out loud would have been redundant vivian who was as fragile as stephen as submissive said it out loud anyway please try and call his beast at least try before they use the drugs i looked at her and there must have been something in my face that frightened her because she dropped to her knees and crawled towards me it wasnt that graceful stalk that the leopards could do it was like a human crawling awkward slow head down eyes rolled up she was displaying the leopard version of submissive behavior and i hated it hated her feeling the need like i was some ogre that needed placating but i let her do it richard had shown me what happened in a weregroup when the dominant refused to be dominant she leaned against my legs pushing her body against me head down normally leopards would roll around my legs like huge cats but tonight vivian just pressed against my legs more like a frightened dog than a luxuriating cat i leaned over to touch her hair and heard her murmuring under her breath so soft please please please you would have had to be colder than even i was to ignore that soft pleading its okay vivian ill try rubbing her cheek along my jeans as she raised her head her eyes rolled up to me again like a frightened dog vivian had always been timid around me but id never seen this level of fear before i didnt think it was gregorys torture that had made the difference i think it was the fact that id shot elizabeth full of holes yeah that probably did it and i couldnt undermine the lesson by reassuring vivian now that i wouldnt shoot her merle and caleb were listening and if we were really going to combine our pards being feared was not a bad way for me to start i looked across the deck and found merle watching me he was still fully dressed jeans boots jean jacket over bare chest the scar showing like a flash of moonlit lightning across his stomach we stared at each other and the force in his gaze the physical potential that shimmered around him made the hair on the back of my neck crawl id spent years around dangerous men and dangerous monsters merle was both if i could make him truly afraid of me that would be a good thing caleb on the other hand had started stripping off his clothes when everyone else did and only my protest backed by merle had kept his pants on he walked barefoot moonlight catching in the rings in his nipple and the edge of his belly button he had to look directly at me for the ring in his eyebrow to spark he was circling cherry who had never dressed after helping gregory in his bath she stood tall and comfortably nude ignoring him the fact that he was paying attention to her nudity was a breach of protocol among the shapeshifters you only noticed nudity if youd been invited to have sex short of that you pretended everyone was as neuter as a barbie doll zane stepped between cherry and the circling caleb giving a low growl caleb laughed and backed off i did not need another pain in the ass in my pard and thats what caleb was dr lillian was standing behind us holding a huge needle all ready to go the two wererat bodyguards claudia and igor were behind her theyd surprised me by putting on guns in the car on the way over guns werent allowed in the lupanar but they were bodyguards and guns were a good thing for bodyguards claudia had a millimeter beretta tucked behind her back the fact that she could carry a mil anything said how much larger her hands were than mine igor had a shoulder rig with a glock mil they were both good guns and the two wererats handled them like they knew what they were doing rafael had insisted that they stay just in case jacob or his allies got some wild idea about a preemptive strike claudia and igor stood in typical bodyguard pose hands clasped in front of them one hand holding the opposite wrist its usually a guy thing to stand like that or a jock thing but bodyguards do it too its like they hold their own hands for reassurance their faces were neutral they were here to protect me not gregory didnt matter to them or didnt seem to nathaniel leaned against the railing wearing a pair of shorts his hair hanging like a dark curtain around his body still wet from the bath it took forever for his hair to dry naturally his face was serene it reflected an almost zenlike pleasantness as if he trusted me to make everything alright of all their faces his was the most unnerving i was used to people being afraid of me eventually but soft adoration that i was not used to i looked back down at vivian still pressed against my legs there was fear in her eyes but there was also hope i touched her face and managed a smile ill do what i can she smiled and it was radiant she was always beautiful but when she smiled like that there was a little girl peeking out someone more joyous and more free than the vivian i knew i valued that little girl smile from her because i saw it so rarely i walked the few feet to the two men stephen was still kneeling his brother huddled against him he watched me with cautious eyes he was rubbing his hand on gregorys bare back over and over in small circles the way you stroke a sick child when they want some touch to let them know theyre going to be alright looking into stephens eyes i knew he didnt believe that he didnt believe gregory would be alright and it terrified him i knelt beside them and was almost the same height as stephen i met that pale gaze that demand and said im going to try and heal him it was caleb who said if micah couldnt heal him why do you think you can i didnt even bother glancing back at him it doesnt hurt to try you havent seen your first full moon merle said you cant call flesh and heal him not yet maybe not ever calling flesh to heal is a rare talent i did look at merle im not going to call flesh im not even sure how that works then how will you heal him merle asked with the munin how will a werewolf ghost help you heal a wereleopard i shook my head ive healed the leopards before using the munin youve healed nathaniel cherry said twice but no one else if it works for one of you it should work for all of you i said cherry was frowning whats wrong you heal with raina everything was sex with her and you want nathaniel in that way youve never been attracted to gregory i shrugged she was pretty much voicing the same doubts that i had but hearing them out loud made them sound worse i felt more doubtful that i could do it and more slutty because i needed sexual attraction to heal but i was getting over the slutty feeling if i could save both gregorys hearing and his life a little embarrassment wasnt too high a price to pay i looked down at gregory still huddled in a tight fetal ball around stephens lap and waist he held on as if his brother were the last solid thing in the universe as if if he let go hed swirl away and be lost i touched his hair lightly and he moved his face so that he could see me through a tangle of pale curls i swept the curls away from his face it was a gesture you used for a child id hated gregory once because of some things hed done when raina and gabriel were still alive but the moment they were dead and he knew he had a choice hed stopped doing most of them had he made me nimirra on purpose staring into his wide blue eyes i didnt believe that it wasnt naivete it was a surety that gregory just wasnt that dominant to decide even in a split second to change the status quo that profoundly was just beyond him hed debate or ask advice or ask permission but he wouldnt make a unilateral decision without some feedback i knew this about gregory richard didnt i touched his face cupping it raising it so hed meet my eyes without having to do that eye roll that unnerved me just too subservient for my taste i stared into that beautiful face let my gaze glide over the fall of curls the line of his back the curl of his hip but i felt nothing i could appreciate his beauty but i tried very hard to think of my leopards as neuter you can be someones friend and have sex with them the trick is you have to want their emotional and physical wellbeing more than you want to fuck them if you cross that line and want sex more than their happiness then you arent their friend their lover maybe but not their friend but it was more than that cherry was right gregory had never moved me in that way i sighed and moved my hand back from him whats wrong stephen asked hes pretty to look at but stephen almost smiled but you need more than just a pretty face to lust after i shrugged sometimes my life would be simpler if i didnt but yeah i remember i had to talk you through the first time you healed nathaniel he said voice soft i nodded i remember too gregory sat up watching us both trying to read our lips i think there was something frantic about the way he tried to decipher what we were saying god please let me help him he was so scared i think of him more like a child no offense you think more like a parent than a seducer thats a good thing stephen said dont apologize for it cherry joined us kneeling on her heels long body curved in graceful lines you called raina in the lupanar without any lust right i nodded i can call rainas munin sometimes even if i dont want to but she always demands a price before she leaves you didnt seduce anyone at the lupanar tonight she said no but i damn near started a fight by hitting richard and that was part rainas doing she enjoyed my loss of control and and she was worried about the pack tonight she doesnt like what richards done i think she toned down her demands because of that and she doesnt care about us like she does the wolves no she doesnt what are you afraid of stephen asked that youll molest gregory i shook my head no im afraid raina will you healed nathaniel in the woods and didnt do anything awful to him cherry said no but i had richard and the pack there to balance me to help me control her through the marks without extra help in that area rainas idea of payment can get a little messy define messy stephen said sex violence i shrugged messy you have the pard here now cherry said you can use us for balance truth was without micah here i wasnt sure i could do that just as richard was my door to the wolves micah was my door to the leopards or was he i was treating this like i treated richard and jeanclaude like i was the outsider and they were my ticket in but what if i really was the leopard queen if i really was nimirra then i should be able to do this without micah i realized the moment i doubted that i was still hoping i wasnt going to be furry next full moon no matter how much evidence to the contrary i still didnt believe it maybe i didnt want to believe it but i wanted to heal gregory that i did want i looked at them all and knew cherry was right if i was nimirra then i had all i needed to balance me if i wasnt nimirra then it wouldnt work what did we have to lose i looked at stephen and gregory their mirror faces their frightened eyes and knew exactly what we had to lose if i didnt try i took the uncle mikes sidekick holster complete with firestar out of the front of my jeans and looked around if i was going to be calling on the leopards i didnt want them having to worry about the gun i motioned claudia the wererat over since i was still kneeling she towered over me only two inches shorter than dolph i had to admit it was impressive even more so because she was a woman i handed the holstered gun to her and she took it make sure no one gets shot with it she frowned down at me you think someone is going to try and get the gun me maybe the frown deepened i dont understand rainas amused by violence i dont want to be carrying a gun when i call her munin claudias eyebrows raised you mean shed try to get you to use it on some one i nodded shes tried before i nodded again in tennessee when i was practicing with the munin yeah claudia shook her head you didnt seem that worried at the lupanar i can call her once and be okay probably but if i call her too often too close together its like she grows i hesitated stronger or maybe i just get tired of fighting she was a bitch when she was alive claudia said being dead hasnt changed her much i added the tall woman shivered im glad the wererats dont have anything like the munin the thought of some entity inside me just creeps me out me too i said she looked down at me thoughtful now ill keep the gun safe is there anything else igor and i can do to help i tried to think of something but only one thing came to mind if the leopards cant control me make sure i dont hurt anyone how bad is this going to be she asked i shrugged normally i wouldnt be this worried but last time i called her she didnt get her bit of flesh or sex hitting richard made her happy but i tried to explain i called her three times in a row for practice without molesting or hurting anyone my teacher marianne and i both thought it was a sign that i was gaining control of raina then the fourth time i called her it was worse than it had ever been you either pay as you go with raina or you end up owing her and owing comes with interest and the interest is hell to pay should you give me the knives too then claudia asked she had a point no pun intended i took the wrist sheaths off folded them up and handed them to her i thought you could control this shit caleb was standing just a little behind and to one side of claudia he was looking up at the tall woman as if wondering what shed do if he tried to climb her i almost wanted him to try because i was pretty sure what would happen and even more sure that id enjoy watching it caleb needed a good lesson from someone i can then why all the precautions i could have told him about the time in tennessee when rainas munin nearly started a riot among vernes pack in a sort of game of rape tag with me as the rapee but i didnt instead i said if youre not going to be helpful stand over to the side and shut the fuck up he opened his mouth as if to protest but merle said caleb do what she says his voice was quiet a deep rumble of sound but that mild tone seemed to work on caleb like a charm sure merle anything you say he went to stand over to one side near dr lillian and igor i glanced at merle thanks i said he just bowed his head at me dr lillian said i take this to mean that you want me to wait on the injection i nodded yeah she turned and walked back through the sliding glass doors into the darkened house everyone else stayed where they were looking at me even caleb sulking by the railing with his arms crossed was still watching the show i slipped my shirt off and felt rather than saw all my people react like wind through a wheat field involuntary i never undressed in front of people unless i absolutely had to the black bra i was wearing covered more than most swim suits but theres something about letting people see you in your underwear that just makes all us good little girls squirm black lace i like it caleb said i started to say something but merle beat me to it shut up caleb and dont make me tell you again caleb settled back against the rail arms hugging himself face crinkled into a sulk that made him look even younger than he was go on merle said he wont interrupt again i looked at him it was bad that he kept interfering it undermined my authority but since i wasnt entirely sure i had any authority over caleb it was okay i guess but it bugged me i just wasnt sure what to do about it i appreciate the help but if our pards really do merge then caleb is going to have to learn to respect me not you you dont want my help he made it a question priority tonight is gregory but caleb and i are going to have to come to an understanding are you going to shoot him too i tried to read merles face and failed a sort of blank hostility was all that showed you think ill have to merle gave a very small smile maybe it made me smile a little great just what i need another discipline problem in my pard his smile vanished like a hand had wiped it away were not your cats anita not yet i shrugged whatever you say we are not yours he said i watched his face and saw something cross it in the moonlight maybe if id had better light i could have deciphered it why does the thought of me being in charge bother you so much he shook his head its not you being in charge that bothers me then what is it he shook his head again what bothers me is you trying to be in charge and failing failing really really badly i do my best merle thats all i can do he nodded i believe you but ive seen a lot of people try their best and still not make it i shrugged and let it go be pessimistic on your own time merle we need a little hope here not negativity ill just shut up then he said which implied that if he couldnt be negative he had nothing to say fine by me i turned back to gregory and his wide frightened eyes i touched his face gently trying to ease some of that fear but he flinched ever so slightly when i touched him you get enough abuse in your life and you begin to think that every offered hand is a blow waiting to strike itll be alright gregory i said since he couldnt hear me i must have been saying it to reassure myself it didnt seem to do a damn thing for gregory i tried to see gregory as a lust object and i failed i ran my hands over the smooth skin of his back i grabbed a handful of those yellow curls looked into those lovely eyes but all i could feel was pity all i could feel was protective towards him and how much i wanted to keep him safe he was totally nude sitting in front of me and he was lovely there was nothing wrong with the way he looked except that i didnt see gregory in that way trust me to find a way to make virtue a problem i turned to stephen who was still kneeling beside us im sorry hes beautiful but i want to hold him keep him safe not have sex with him and protective instincts are not going to get raina to come out cherry said you simply called raina at the lupanar why is this different i looked up at her standing nude and comfortable against the deck railing zane was next to her clothed and just as comfortable i can call raina but i cant guarantee shell help me heal gregory the healing usually comes with lust not without call her stephen said once shes here maybe the rest will come you mean call her munin then get her in the mood not me he looked very solemn but he nodded you know what her idea of sex is stephen he nodded again trust me he said strangely i did he wasnt dominant in fact was very often a victim but stephen did what he said hed do at almost any cost there was a desperate stubbornness in him no matter how often you knocked him down ill call the munin and ill make sure that raina sees gregory the way she needs to see him we looked at each other and had one of those moments of near perfect understanding stephen would do anything to save his brother and i would almost anything to help him do that i sat back on my heels in front of gregory and i opened myself to the munin dropped that barrier that kept raina out and she spilled up through me like warm water filling a pipe up up riding on a wave of eagerness that she hadnt had at the lupanar a thrill of fear went through me i knew it was a bad sign but i didnt fight her i let her come let her fill me up let her laugh bubble from my throat when she looked at gregory she had no trouble seeing him as a sexual object but then raina saw almost everyone as a sexual object so no big surprise i touched his face caressed the line of his jaw gregorys eyes widened i realized in that moment that he might not know what the hell we were doing or what had changed i could call raina and think rationally id fought long and hard to be able to do that i could be distant while my hand glided down gregorys bare chest i could stop my hand our hand at his slender waist and raina couldnt force me lower she snarled in my head giving me a visual of her in wolf shape snapping at me but it was just a visual like a dream it couldnt hurt me or anyone raina spoke in my head this wolf still has teeth anita you know the rules i said what stephen asked i shook my head im talking to raina that is just creepy zane said i agreed with him wholeheartedly but raina was already talking in my head and i couldnt answer him i know the rules anita do you yeah i do whatever i please and i try to stop you i finished for her like old times the voice in my head said it did sound like the relationship wed had when she was alive she wanted to kiss gregory and i didnt fight it the kiss was openmouthed but soft nothing that would scare me too badly in her own way raina was learning how to work me too id never kissed gregory before never wanted to i still didnt want to kissing in some ways is more intimate than intercourse more special i pulled away from his lips and raina was just as happy to kiss the side of his neck his skin was warm and smelled like soap i buried my face under his hair at the back of his ear and found the hair still damp smelling of my shampoo i tried to call healing from raina but she fought me no not until after my reward i actually had leaned back from gregory and must have said it out loud because stephen asked what reward i shook my head raina wont heal him until after shes been fed it was a type of feeding in her own way raina was like the ardeur except she only needed feeding when i called her her craving not mine what do you want i asked it out loud because i still wasnt comfortable with having silent conversations in my head she gave me a visual of kissing down his chest of forcing him onto his back on the deck and the next thing i remembered clearly was laying a gentle kiss beside gregorys belly button he was lying on his back watching me with unfocused eyes i was lying across his body pinning his legs my nearly naked chest pressed over his groin i didnt remember getting there shit i rolled off of him and raina came like heat racing through my body drawing my mouth down to his hip licking along that small hollow just where the waist meets groin gregory writhed under the stroke of my mouth and as much as id tried to ignore it drew our gaze to his groin he was hard ready but the sight of him pushed raina back left me in control not because it was embarrassing but because i had never seen gregory erect before he was still lovely to look at but he was an odd shape almost hooked at the end i didnt know that men could be made that way and it stopped me cold raina screamed in my head roared over me in a rush of body memory the memory was of being on all fours with a man riding me from behind riding raina i couldnt see who it was all i could do was feel theyd found that spot in a womans body and the rush of orgasm was close raina threw her our head back a rush of auburn hair flinging free of our face and i saw gregorys reflection in the rooms mirror raina whispered in my head its always like that with him from behind because of his shape i tore free of the memory and found myself on all fours beside gregory one hand on his body i fell back from him because the shared memories didnt work without body contact i turned my face away so i wouldnt see him nude and ready because i could still feel the memory of him inside my body rainas body a hand touched my bare arm and the rush of memories this time was overwhelming i was there he filled my mouth my throat came inside my mouth in a spill of thick heat and with his body trembling thrashing teeth tore into thick tender flesh and we ate him blood poured upwards and raina bathed in it i fought free of it screaming shrieking and someone else was screaming it was gregory for one awful second i opened my eyes because the memory was so strong i couldnt tell the difference between it and reality but when could see again he was whole crawling away from me from the shared memory because that was one of rainas gifts the ability to share the horror i could still feel the thickness of meat in my mouth taste blood and thicker things i crawled to the railing pulled myself up and lost everything id eaten that day someone came up behind me and i put out a hand head still dangling over the dark edge of the deck dont touch me anita its merle nathaniel said that no one was to touch you that had ever shared a he hesitated moment with the old lupa i didnt know her she cant hurt you through me i held my head in my hands it felt like it was going to split apart hes right his grip on my shoulders was as hesitant as his words i pushed away from the railing and the world swam merle caught me held me against his chest its alright i can still taste meat and blood and oh god god i screamed it and it didnt help not for this merle held me against his chest tight my hands pinned to my sides as if id tried to hurt myself i didnt think i had but i didnt know anymore months of practice and raina could still do this to me i screamed wordlessly over and over again as if i could scream the memory out of me every time i drew breath i could hear merle whispering its alright its alright anita its alright but it wasnt alright what raina had just shown me would never be alright merle carried me into the bathroom and i didnt protest caleb wet a cloth and put it on my forehead without a word of teasing a small miracle but not the one we needed raina had gone fled laughing pleased with herself god i hated that woman id already killed her it wasnt like i could do anything else to her but i wanted to i wanted her to hurt like shed hurt so many others but i guess it was a little late for that dr lillian was shining a tiny light in my eyes and trying to get me to follow her fingers i wasnt doing a good enough job apparently because she wasnt happy you are in shock anita and so is gregory he was a little shocky before you began but damn it i blinked and tried to focus on her my eyes just couldnt settle on anything as if the world were trembling but that made no sense maybe i was the one that was trembling i couldnt tell i clutched the cover theyd put around me huddling on my white couch amid the multicolored pillows and couldnt get warm what are you saying doc im saying that gregorys chances are worse than fiftyfifty now i blinked and fought to look at her meet her eyes to think how bad seventythirty maybe hes curled on the deck in a blanket shivering worse than you are i shook my head and couldnt seem to stop i closed my eyes forced myself to be still for a second a heartbeat i spoke without opening my eyes i saw how did gregory heal i stopped tried again how did he survive what she did to him we can regrow any body part short of decapitation unless fire is added to the wound to close it we cant heal burns unless the burned flesh is completely removed in effect making a new wound her voice was bitter fierce id never heard her so angry i looked up at her whats wrong with you lillian looked down wouldnt meet my eyes i was the doctor on call the night she did that to gregory i saw the reality not just a memory i shook my head and had to bury my chin on my knees to stop the movement it isnt a memory with the munin doc its real its like its like a liveaction movie but with me in the movie i hugged my knees and tried desperately not to think not to revisit what id experienced i was actually having some luck being absolutely blank even my mind had finally found something so terrible it couldnt cope with it in a bizarre way it was comforting id finally found a line that i could not cross if i try to force gregory into animal form now itll probably kill him dr lillian said i buried my face into my knees hiding i spoke with my mouth buried against the thick covers i cant try again no one is asking you to call that bitch again anita it was nathaniel it wasnt his voice that made me look up it was the rich bitter smell of coffee i found him holding my baby penguin mug full of fresh coffee it was very pale lots of sugar lots of cream good for shock hell good for everything he helped me rescue my hands from the blanket and wrap them around the mug i held the mug tight and it took several seconds to realize i was burning my hands i didnt panic just handed the mug back to nathaniel he took it and i stared at my pink red hands i had firstdegree burns and i hadnt felt the heat until it was too late damn i said softly lillian sighed ill get some ice she left us alone nathaniel knelt in front of me being careful not to spill the coffee merle and cherry glided into the living room while i was still staring at my reddened hands cherry sat beside me on the couch she was still nude but it didnt matter nothing seemed to matter merle stayed standing and i didnt even bother trying to look up at him all i could see were the silver toes of his boots nathaniel said that you touched his beast when you marked his back cherry said i blinked at her meeting her pale eyes i nodded i remembered a shining moment after id marked his back actually where id felt his beast roiling under the touch of my power and id been sure i could call that part of him make him shapeshift for me i was still nodding and made myself stop saying i remember lillian came back out and applied bags of ice wrapped in a small towel to my hands try not to hurt yourself for a few minutes im going back to check on gregory she left me with the three leopards and my ice if you touched nathaniels beast theres a chance you could call gregorys now i shook my head i dont think so cherry gripped my arm dont fall apart on us now anita gregory needs you the first flare of anger pushed through the shock i have done my fucking best for him tonight she dropped her hand away from my arm but didnt look away anita please merle thinks you may be strong enough to call gregorys beast even before your first full moon i clutched the towelcovered ice to my chest the sudden cold across my nearly naked chest helped clear my head i thought that wasnt possible before i shifted for the first time with you anita merle said i would be a fool to say what you can and cant do i let the ice fall on the coverlet in my lap and looked up at the big man why the change of heart i failed gregory out there on the deck you risked yourself for one of your cats it is the very best a nimirra or raj has in them to take great risks for their people i touched the towel found one corner wet and knew the plastic bag hadnt sealed completely i moved the bag rightside up so it wouldnt spill anymore what do you want from me my voice sounded as tired as i felt merle knelt in front of me and i met his eyes there was a look in them that i didnt want right now he seemed to trust me and i didnt feel trustworthy i felt scared call gregorys beast i dont know how when i was with nathaniel it was i sighed it was sexual cherry finished for me i nodded i am not trying for that kind of mood with gregory again tonight i dont think either he or i could handle it if it went wrong again calling the beast doesnt have to be sexual merle said i met his strangely trusting gaze i was beyond tired i just didnt have anything left tonight not for gregory i did not want to touch him again tonight part of me was afraid that raina would make an unplanned appearance though i knew that was almost impossible for her now i did have better control than that but how can i ever touch gregory again and not remember that i dont know cherry said but please anita please help him how do i call his beast without getting in the mood i asked you need to talk to someone who can call the beast from their people merle said i looked at him you got someone in mind i am told your ulfric can call the beast from his wolves i nodded so i hear if he called a wolf into form while you watched then he might be able to show you how to do it you really think it will work i asked him i dont know he said but isnt it worth trying i handed him the leaking bag of ice sure if richard will come nathaniel answered that one richard blames himself for gregorys injuries if we offer him a chance to heal him hell come i stared at nathaniel watched the intelligence in those flowercolored eyes it was one of the most insightful things id ever heard him say it gave me just a little hope that indeed nathaniel could be made whole that he was getting better i needed some hope just then but it was still unnerving for nathaniel to know richard so well to be that observant it meant that id underestimated nathaniel i kept equating submissiveness with being inferior and that wasnt really the case some people choose to be bottoms to serve it doesnt make them less just different i looked into his face and wondered what else id missed or what else hed show me it was a night for revelations so why the hell not have richard join us how much worse could it get please no one answer that i brushed my teeth and sat at the kitchen table in the dark drinking coffee while we waited nathaniel padded barefoot into the room his hair swinging loose around his bare chest and the jean shorts hed put on hows gregory i asked dr lillian put an iv in him to help with the shock she said he stopped beside the table not quite in front of me an iv richard will be here within an hour or less if she put an iv in then i let my voice trail off nathaniel finished for me gregorys very hurt i looked up at him in the darkened kitchen the only light was the small one over the sink it left most of the room in thick shadows you dont mean the injuries he got from the wolves do you he shook his head all that hair sliding around his body a long heavy strand slid over one shoulder and he tossed his head to flip it back behind him id never been around a man that had such long hair who was so comfortable with it he kept talking about raina nathaniel said kept swearing under his breath his voice had dropped low almost a whisper he was staring over my head at things i couldnt see and probably didnt want to i touched his arm you alright he looked down at me smiled but not like he was happy he moved his hand so he was holding mine his grip was tight like he needed the comfort talk to me nathaniel i gave you copies of three of my movies he smiled wide this time before i could say anything i know youve never watched them when i gave them to you i still thought you were like gabriel and raina that it had to be sex that you would like that they were porn i understand now that youll take care of us no matter what not because you lust after us or because you love one of us but just because he went to his knees still holding my hand pressing it against his chest with both his own he laid his head on my lap his face turned away from me i moved a thick line of hair away from his face so i could see his profile as he leaned against me we sat there for a few moments me waiting for him to continue him maybe waiting for me to prompt him but the silence wasnt strained one of us would fill it when we were ready and we both knew that he was the one who sighed keeping one hand on my hand pressed to him his other hand curling around my leg i could feel the beat of his heart against the back of my hand i did more movies than just those three most of them with raina gabriel wouldnt let her have me as a lover or a slave i think he knew shed kill me but on film where things could be controlled he hugged his body against mine clinging what happened i said softly she did that to gregory on her own as a kind of fun but when he survived it she wanted to do a version of it on film i went very still for a second or two i think i stopped breathing because when my breath finally did come out it shook you i made it a question he nodded his head cheek still pressed to my thigh me i stroked his hair stared down into that young face he was six years younger than me almost seven but it seemed like there should have been decades between us he was so much a victim so much anyones meat gregory wouldnt do it again said hed kill himself first and gabriel must have believed him i kept petting his hair because i didnt know what else to do what do you say while someone whispers horrors in your ear tells you their most intimate nightmarish secrets you sit and you listen and you give them the only thing you can the silence and the safety to talk and to be heard his voice dropped soft softer until i had to lean my face over his to hear turn they chained me down and i knew the script i knew what was about to happen and i was excited the fear made the anticipation almost unbearable i laid my cheek against his felt his mouth move as he spoke and i kept very very quiet i had nothing to offer but my silence and my touch he whispered i like teeth biting i like a lot of damage it was wonderful until he closed his eyes turned his face into my jeans as if even now he couldnt look at the memory i had lifted my head up when he moved but laid a gentle kiss on the back of his head its okay nathaniel its okay he said something but i couldnt understand it what he moved his head just enough so that his mouth wasnt buried against my leg god it hurt she took it in pieces wanted it to last longer than it had with gregory his whole body gave one great shiver and i leaned over him my free hand across his back smoothing the hair away so i could reach his skin i stroked over his back and found all the little bite marks id left in his skin i hadnt felt bad for marking him until now now i felt like id used him like everyone else had i curled my body over his hugging him into my lap holding him as close as i could i am sorry nathaniel so sorry you dont have anything to be sorry about anita youve never hurt me yes i have he raised up enough to meet my eyes he looked so young eyes wide i love that youve marked me dont be sorry about that he gave a small smile if you start feeling guilty about it you wont do it again and i want you to i want that very much if i feed on you nathaniel for the ardeur or the flesh or whatever im using you i dont use people he held my hand so tight that it almost hurt dont do this to me do what dont punish me for telling you about how raina hurt me im not punishing you i tell you this horrible thing and you start feeling protective of me and guilty i know you anita youll let your head get in the way of what we both need and what exactly is that and even i could hear the impatience almost anger in my voice he raised up farther bringing his face close to mine because id sat up distancing myself from him you need to feed the ardeur and i need to have a place to belong you are welcome in my house as long as you need it nathaniel he shook his head pushing the hair back impatiently letting go of my hand putting his hands on my knees halfcrawling under the table so that he was kneeling between my legs though only his hands touched the tops of my knees he stared up at me no you tolerate me i do some housework errands but i dont belong you dont go through your day thinking about me im here but im not part of your life i know that if i am your pomme de sang then i will be ill finally belong to you in a way that both of us can live with i shook my head no nathaniel no he grabbed the legs of the chair and picked the entire thing up with me on it from a kneeling position and moved it backwards with a bump so he could fit under the table better he hadnt even strained when he did it he put his hands on the chair arms slid his lower body against the chair putting my knees on either side of his hips and who else are you going to feed off of every day richard jeanclaude micah the ardeur may be temporary i said he put a hand on either side of my waist if its temporary then feed on me until it goes away if its permanent i dont want to feed on anyone his hands slid around my waist his head going to my lap and i realized he was crying please dont do this anita please dont do this i stroked his hair his face and didnt know what to say what was i going to do if the ardeur was permanent richard didnt let anyone feed off of him for any reason same rule i had jeanclaude would be literally dead to the world when i most needed to feed micah was still a question mark but in some ways feeding off of nathaniel because he was the only one that would let me was almost worse i lifted his face from my lap a hand on either side tears glittered on his cheeks in the faint light i kissed his forehead kissed his closed eyes the way you would a childs did i get here just in time or am i interrupting it was richard standing in the doorway perfect fucking timing as always i froze with nathaniels face cradled in my hands him kneeling between my legs with the table hiding most of him having just risen from kissing him and knew how it looked i wasnt sure i could explain it to richards satisfaction to my knowledge richard didnt know about the ardeur yet and right then i didnt want to tell him i laid another gentle kiss on nathaniels forehead and leaned back i wasnt going to act like id done something wrong when i hadnt nathaniel took his cue from me laying his head back in my lap which i realized meant he was invisible from the doorway the table hiding what he was doing richard strode into the kitchen like an angry wind his power biting along my skin he came to stand where he could see that nathaniel had his cheek against my thigh gazing up at the larger man as he towered over both of us jamil and shangda were hanging back by the doorway they were good bodyguards but some things bodyguards cant keep you safe from i felt my face go neutral empty vaguely pleasant i was comforting one of my leopards something wrong with that he looks very comfortable richard said voice mild enough but his power was hot like opening the door to an oven i licked my lips i was going to have to explain the ardeur sooner or later and since i wanted him to help us save gregory tonight was probably the right time nathaniel and i were discussing some side effects of marrying the vampire marks you mean the ardeur he said i was surprised and let it show who told you jeanclaude thought i should know he encouraged me to come over and be here for you in the morning and you said i kept my voice as neutral as i could but not as neutral as i wanted it to be i dont let him or asher or any of them feed off of me blood or anything else i dont see why i should change that rule just because its you and its sex instead of blood did he explain that if i dont feed off of you or him i still have to feed off of someone theres always your nimirraj the contempt in his voice was thick enough to walk on micahs been called away on pard business you really think he wont be back before morning so you can fuck him i do i stared up at him still sitting in the face of his burning power and the sheer physical presence of him richard was one of those big men who never seemed big unless he was angry he seemed big now and i wasnt impressed i started petting nathaniels hair and he snuggled in against my legs letting the tension ease out of his body you dumped me remember and did you fuck him for the first time before or after you found out id dumped you i had to think about that for a second or two after i said you mourned my loss for what half a second i felt heat crawl up my face i was out of moral high ground and explaining that it was the ardeur just wasnt good enough for richard it took all three of us to get into this mess dont make it worse dont you mean four of us or is it five now i must have looked as blank as i felt i dont know what youre talking about he grabbed the table and shoved it backwards with a scream of wood on wood nathaniel stayed curled around my legs and just looked up at him id never gotten my gun back from the wererats i had gotten my knives back but i wasnt really willing to cut richard up not yet not for this i couldnt arm wrestle richard not and win so really my only option was to sit look perfectly calm and tell him by my facial expression what a fucking asshole he was being he shoved the table again making the wood scream then he knelt beside nathaniel and pushed his long hair back he bared his back and stared at the bite marks is that all he asked voice fierce his power so high it was like treading in boiling water up to my chin and still rising no i said richard gripped the back of nathaniels shorts and pulled the movement so violent that nathaniels entire body moved with it i heard the button from the top of the shorts bounce along the floor richard jerked down the shorts and stared at the bite marks where they trailed ever lower richard leaned over nathaniel not quite touching but he was like some huge presence and i felt nathaniel cower against me richard hissed into his ear did she suck you off shes good at that thats enough richard nathaniel answered no youre so scared of me i cant tell if youre lying or not he grabbed a handful of nathaniels hair and pulled him backwards peeling him away from me i had one of the wrist sheath knives in my hand and didnt remember drawing it the point was pressed against the long line of richards throat and even i was breathless at the speed of it it must have been a blur of movement it wasnt human speed everything froze shangda and jamil moved into the room i pressed the point deeper against richards neck dont interfere boys they stopped moving i met richards gaze and found his eyes had gone wolf amber let go of him richard my voice was low but it seemed to fill the room you wouldnt kill me for this his voice was low careful too kill no but bleed oh yes you need me to help you save gregory i could feel his pulse beating against the tip of my knife i wont let you hurt nathaniel to save gregory his grip actually tightened on nathaniels hair and i pressed the point in enough to draw the first crimson drop would you be this upset if it wasnt nathaniel he said this is the only warning i will ever give you richard never touch one of my people again or what youll kill me i dont think youll do it i realized in that moment that if i wasnt willing to kill him i had no threat and i really wasnt willing to kill him not over this not yet i drew the blade back from his neck and watched him relax the tension easing away from him his hand still in nathaniels hair i moved without thinking and i was fast enough that the knife cut across his forearm before he could react he jerked away came to his feet and took a step back holding his bleeding arm the cut was deeper than id meant for it to be because id rushed it blood dripped from between his fingers jamil and shangda moved into the room i stood and drew nathaniel with me as he pulled up his shorts to cover himself i put the french doors at our backs you are never to lay a hand in anger on my leopards richard you or any of your wolves jamil was helping richard press a towel to the wound shangda had gone for dr lillian it would serve you right if i just walked out and left you and your leopards to fend for yourselves youd leave gregory to be permanently deaf or dead because we had a fight hes in danger because you couldnt control your temper or your wolves its my fault right all my fault i just looked at him nathaniel behind me the bloody knife still in my hand richard gave a laugh that sounded more out of pain than humor ive let everyone down tonight he looked at me and there was something fierce in his face that wasnt his beast but just sheer emotion anger pain so deep it was like anguish ill help you save gregory because youre right it is my fault ill take this he raised the wounded arm while jamil still held it because youre right again i had no right to touch one of your people i wouldnt have let you abuse one of my wolves either dr lillian came in took one look and started scolding us for being children who couldnt play well together hes going to need stitches shame on you both richard stared over her head as she cleaned the wound i think he wasnt really glaring at me he was glaring at nathaniel he was genuinely jealous jealous in a way that he shouldnt have been what had jeanclaude told him about the ardeur and about nathaniel and about what wed all done together at the circus jeanclaude wouldnt actually lie but he might make things sound worse if it suited his purposes but what purpose did it serve to make richard jealous of nathaniel i would have to ask jeanclaude about that i had time to call while richard got stitched up jeanclaude admitted only to telling the absolute truth but he added if because of that monsieur zeeman was jealous of nathaniel this wasnt an altogether bad thing he will share you with me because he must and he will share you with micah also because he must but we are both alphas dominants to share you with someone like nathaniel that is different you changed something about the story to make nathaniel sound like more of a threat didnt you no ma petite i merely told the truth without leaving anything out he is not entirely happy with jason either jeanclaude you cant do this to richard youll drive him mad mad enough perhaps to finally acknowledge that he cannot live without you and that he must come to terms with our triumvirate you machiavellian shithead youre playing with him i am trying to maneuver him into doing what must be done if we are to survive if that be machiavellian so be it you are making things worse i said i dont believe so i think ma petite that you still do not understand men many men will give up a woman if they are unhappy with her but let another man try to claim her and often they find they still do want her you and micah arent competition enough i asked as i explained we are his equals nathaniel is lesser and that will prick his pride more i didnt think richard had that kind of destructive guy pride i think there are many things you do not know about our richard and you do i am after all a man ma petite i believe i understand the male psyche a tiny bit better than you do i couldnt argue with that well give me a headsup next time you plan to do any maneuvering you could have gotten one of us killed he sighed i do keep underestimating the stubbornness of both of you my apologies for that i leaned my forehead against the kitchen wall jeanclaude yes ma petite i closed my eyes tell me exactly what you think richard thinks about nathaniel and me i told him the absolute truth ma petite nothing more and nothing less i turned around put my back to the wall looked out at the empty kitchen richard was in the downstairs bathroom getting stitched up nathaniel was with the other leopards id given strict orders that he was not to be left alone i just wasnt up to richard and him actually having a fight it would be too ridiculous or pathetic and what does that mean that you told the truth no more no less you will not like it i dont like it now just tell me jeanclaude i told him what had happened with the ardeur and added my own belief the reason you so often find nathaniel around when sex is in the air is that you find him sexually attractive that did not make richard come over here and start a fight i do remember adding that you might find a lessdemanding male refreshing after the two of us someone who did not make so many demands on you someone who merely accepted you as you are you do that i said so good of you to notice he said but it is not i that has been living in your home for months and from what i smell on nathaniel when he comes into work sharing your bed any of the wereleopards are welcome in the bedroom when they stay here its like a big pile of puppies its not sexual if you say so his voice was soft mocking damn you jeanclaude you know i dont see nathaniel that way he sighed and it was heavy i think it is not me that you lie to ma petitebut yourself i am not in love with nathaniel did i ever say you were then what are you talking about he made a small exasperated sound ma petite you still believe that you must love every man that you come to physically it is not so you can have very pleasant even wondrous sex with a friend it does not have to be love i was shaking my head realized he couldnt see it and said i dont do casual sex jeanclaude you know that whatever you are doing with nathaniel ma petite it is not casual i cant use him as my pomme de sang i cant your morals have reared their ugly heads ma petite do not let them make you foolish i opened my mouth to protest everything hed said but closed it and just thought about what hed said for a few seconds did i find nathaniel attractive well yeah but i found a lot of men attractive that didnt mean i had to be intimate with them ma petite i can hear you breathing what are you thinking what he said made me think a new thought when we first married the marks i could almost read your mind unless you concentrated to keep me out now its not like that maybe the ardeur will be temporary too perhaps we can but hope if i have the ardeur ill have to have sex isnt that what you wanted i would be a fool to deny that your enforced chastity is burdensome but i would never willingly inflict the ardeur on anyone it is a curse ma petite the blood lust that i feel can be sated my body can only hold so much but the ardeur oh ma petite it is never truly satisfied there is always that ache that need how could i wish that upon you though if our monsieur zeeman would cooperate it might be the answer for the two of you to finally reach some permanent arrangement what move in together perhaps his voice was very careful when he said that one word richard and i cant be in a room for an hour without arguing unless we are having sex somehow i dont think that makes for domestic bliss i felt the first emotion hed let me feel over the phone relief he was relieved i want what is best for all of us ma petite but as things grow more complex i am no longer certain what best would be dont tell me your machinations didnt include some backup plan to cover every eventuality you are the ultimate plotter dont tell me you missed a trick i watched belle morte fill your eyes with her fire you are acquiring powers as if you were a master vampire or a master lycanthrope how could i have planned for any of this there was a cold knot of fear in the center of my gut so you finally admit that you dont know what the hell is going on either oui does that please you i heard the first stirrings of anger in his voice are you happy now ma petite i am well and truly out of my depth no one has ever tried to forge an alliance such as we have an alliance not of master and two slaves but of three equals i do not think you appreciate how gentle i am when it comes to hoarding my power the wolves are my animal to call many masters would have forced them to simply be an adjunct to their own vampires nikolaoss animal to call was rats not wolves i said by the time you took over as master of the city marcus and rainas pack was too strong for you to make them an adjunct to your power hell until you replenished the vamps that i killed they were probably more powerful than you and your vampires are you implying that the only reason i am not a tyrant is because i didnt have the strength of arms to make it so i thought about that for a second then said im not implying it im saying it you think so little of me i know what you were like two almost three years ago and i think then you would have consolidated your power base with very little regard for anyone that got in your way are you saying i am ruthless practical i said it was his turn to be quiet for a second or two then practical yes i am that as are you ma petite i know what i am jeanclaude its you im not sure of i would never willingly hurt you ma petite i believe you i said i am not sure the same can be said of you he said quietly i dont want to hurt either of you but richard cannot harm my leopards and if you do anything stupid dont blame me for what happens next i would never underestimate your level of practicality ma petite though i think richard might he told me i wouldnt kill him just for roughing up nathaniel how rough was richard to little nathaniel dont talk about him like hes a child jeanclaude and rough enough that i cut richards arm open how badly the docs stitching him up even as we speak oh dear he said and sighed and this time the sound eased down my skin i realized that hed been behaving himself until now at least about using his voice no more games jeanclaude i want to put richard on the phone and you tell him you did this on purpose but i cannot tell him that i lied about nathaniel now can i you fix this jeanclaude now tonight i need richard to teach me how to call gregorys beast i dont have time for him to sulk what am i to tell him ma petite what surety can i give him that you will not be in nathaniels arms tomorrow morning i believe that i can maneuver richard into staying the night having him there at your side when the ardeur rises richards already made his position clear jeanclaude he doesnt let you or asher or anyone feed off of him he doesnt see why the rules change just because its me and sex instead of blood he said that jeanclaude gave a questioning lilt to his voice yeah he said that almost wordforword jeanclaude sighed and it sounded tired what am i to do with the two of you dont ask me i said i just work here and what exactly does that mean ma petite it means that we dont have a boss its great being equals if thats what we are but none of us knows what the hell is going on and that isnt good jeanclaude we are messing with some very serious stuff here metaphysically and emotionally and just plain physically we need some clue as to what we should be doing with all of it and who should we be asking advice of ma petite if any vampire on the council were to suspect that i have not given you both the fourth mark they would destroy us for fear that with the fourth mark we would become an even greater power ive talked to marianne and her friends theyre witches wiccan so we find what a local coven and ask their guidance he sounded patronizing i resent the tone jeanclaude especially since i dont hear you offering any better suggestions dont criticize unless you can do better very true ma petite and very wise my deepest and most sincere apologies you are quite right i do not have a suggestion for whom we might turn to for advice or guidance i will think upon your suggestion to find a friendly witch to speak with i have a friendly one to speak to she just might need to see the three or us together to see how things work you mean your marianne yeah i thought she was more psychic than witch theres not all that much difference i said i will take your word on that i do not have much business with either i realized id been planning to call marianne since i woke up sandwiched between caleb and micah funny how it had slipped my mind is there anything you can say to richard that will help smooth things on this end do you wish me to lie damn it jeanclaude i can point out to him that if he does not meet the ardeurs appetite that someone else must ive already pointed that out to him i thought about that for a few heartbeats he accused me of having i found i couldnt quite say it he accused me of doing worse with nathaniel than ive done and he was crude about it im not sure i want to have sex with him right now you are angry with him jeanclaude said oh yeah so angry that if he asked you would refuse his bed i started to say yes then stopped myself i was tired tired of all of it of both of them if the truth be known couldnt live with them or without them i wanted richards body like an ache in my heart but when he wanted to be he could be ugly and his mood tonight was ugly i didnt want to have sex with him when he was like this hell i didnt want to be around him when he was like this i dont know i said well that was honest and does not bode well if you refuse richard and nathaniel and your nimirraj does not return tonight what will you do in the morning ma petite please think carefully on this i beg you to choose the lesser evil whatever that may be rather than wait until the hunger overrides your common sense or even your need for survival what are you saying i am saying what i have said before that to deny the ardeur is to worsen it deny it long enough and hard enough and it will begin to erode all that you are or thought yourself to be i survived what i did to feed it in those first weeks but my moral degradation had been accomplished years before i died i say again ma petite that you will not take it as well as i did i believe it will compromise your sense of who you are and fucking nathaniel isnt going to compromise me he sighed put that way i do see your point but how much more compromising would it be to seduce a stranger i would never do that is that not exactly what you did with the nimirraj his voice was very quiet as he said it very careful not to be accusatory i would have loved to have argued the point but i hate to lose and i was going to lose this one alright youve made your point i hope so anita i do hope so he never used my name unless something was very wrong damn you know just once it might be nice to have normal problems and what exactly is a normal problem ma petite another point for jeanclaude i dont know anymore you sound tired ma petite its only a few hours until dawn ive been up all night so yeah im tired just acknowledging it seemed to bring it on in a rush that left me rubbing my eyes which smeared the eye shadow id put on onto my fingers and probably around my eyelids i wore makeup so seldomly that i often forgot i was wearing it richard came back into the kitchen with his bodyguards and the wererats in tow he gave me a look and it was not a friendly one ive got to go i said to jeanclaude do you wish me to speak to richard no i think youve done enough damage for one night i meant only to help sure you did ma petite yes be careful and remember what i have said about the ardeur there is no shame in it even you dont believe that i said ah you have found me out there is no shame in feeding if you feed immediately on a person of your own choosing if you fight then you will find yourself feeding on someone not of your choosing in a place not of your choosing i do not think you would enjoy that ma petite he was right about that anyway ill talk to you tomorrow after you get up i havent forgotten damian you know i did not think that you had ma petite i will look forward to your call i hung up without saying goodbye mainly because i was angry and scared not only did i have richard to deal with tonight and gregory to save but tomorrow morning when i woke up the ardeur would be there waiting there was a chance that it wouldnt be that the one day was the only time id have it but i couldnt count on that i had to plan for the worstcase scenario worst case was i would wake up tomorrow and need to feed just like i had this morning the big question was who would i feed on and could i live with myself after id done it i hate being awake at three in the morning it is the godforsaken heart of darkness when the body runs slow and the brain runs slower and all you want to do is sleep but i had promises to keep and miles to go before i could sleep or at least a couple of miracles to perform before i could go to bed dr lillian had unhooked gregorys iv but he was still bundled in the quilts he sat on the picnic table on the deck cradled between zane and cherry dr lillian kept touching gregory checking his pulse how clammy his skin was she was frowning and clearly not happy nathaniel stayed by them keeping the picnic table between him and richard richard hadnt tried to hurt him again in fact hed ignored him studiously the other cats milled around near the sliding glass doors the two wererat bodyguards claudia and igor were standing to one side of me as i leaned on the railing they started following me around when richard came out with his bandaged arm and jamil and shangda at his back richards power crept on the summer darkness like close thunder making the hot sticky night even thicker and making it harder to breathe i think it was the press of his power the edge of his anger that made the wererats start acting like bodyguards id tried telling them that richard wouldnt hurt me but claudia had shrugged and said rafael told us to keep you safe and thats what were going to do even if i tell you that there is no threat she shrugged again id say youre a little too close to this one to make a sound judgment call id glanced at igor you agree with her i never argue with a lady especially one that can beat me at arm wrestling igors logic was hard to argue with but it meant that i had acquired two tall muscular shadows and it irritated me but neither of them gave a damn whether i was happy or not they were following rafaels orders and my wishes didnt count so richard and his bodyguards and me with mine stood on the deck facing stephen who had stripped off in preparation for the change if you made the change with clothes on you ruined them shapeshifters either haunted the thrift shops looking for old clothes to wear on the night of the full moon or went nude we all stood there in the circle of richards power the energy built around us like invisible lightning lashing around us the power literally crackled raising the hair on our arms raising the hair on our heads like the hackles on a dog jamil said richard but one glance from richard stopped him in midsentence the power rose another notch squeezing around us like some kind of giant hand whats wrong richard whats with the power display i asked he turned to me and the anger in his face made me want to step back but i didnt i stood my ground but it took effort do you want to save your cat he asked voice thick with the emotion that showed on his face that crackled in his power my voice was almost a whisper yes then watch he said he spread his hands in front of stephen keeping them about eight inches away from the smaller mans shoulders the energy squeezed tight and tighter until i had to swallow to try and clear my ears as if thered been a pressure change but swallowing didnt help it wasnt that kind of pressure richards hands convulsed as if his fingers were digging into something invisible just in front of stephen he staggered towards richard one step and i was close enough to hear a small pained sound come from him richard balled his hands into fists and something shimmered between them like heat caught in the close summer darkness the bones in my face ached with the building power the air was almost too thick to breathe as if it had weight richard made one abrupt movement with his hands and the pressure broke like a storm finally bursting to life for a second or two i thought the heavy clear liquid that burst around us was rain but it was hot like blood and it didnt fall from the sky it burst from stephens body id seen dozens of shapeshifters change but nothing like this it was as if stephens body blew apart in a rain of hot thick fluids and small bits of flesh the beast usually pulls itself from the human body like a butterfly from a chrysalis but not this time stephens body folded over on itself and his manwolf shape was just suddenly standing there it collapsed to its knees panting shivering i was left standing not even breathing covered in the rapidly cooling bits and pieces of stephens body when i could breathe again i gasped jesus christ stephens fur was the color of dark golden honey he crouched shivering at richards feet again the change may hurt while the person is going through it but once its over they usually stand up and start moving around stephen seemed disoriented almost like he was in pain what the hell was happening he crawled the last few steps to richard laying his long teethfilled snout against his wolf kings jogging shoes he was almost in a fetal position great muscular arms wrapped around golden fur lying at his ulfrics feet it was extreme submissive behavior and i didnt know why stephen hadnt done anything wrong i looked up at richard his white shirt was plastered to his body with the thick fluids he turned his face to look at me and the faint light of stars glistened in the wetness on his face a thick piece of something slid down his cheek as he glared at me the look on his face was defiant as if he expected me to be angry with him i raised a shaking hand and wiped the worst of the gunk off of my face flinging it onto the deck where it hit with a wet splat i looked at the bodyguards they too were spattered with the thick stuff but not nearly as messy as richard and i they hadnt been standing as close they all stared at richard stared at him with a mixture of horror and anger and astonishment on their faces which let me know that something was very very wrong i had to try twice before i could speak and even then my voice was breathy ive seen a lot of shapeshifters change into their beasts but ive never seen anything like that was it different because you called stephens beast instead of him doing it on his own no richard said i waited for more but that was all he said and it looked like all he intended to say but no just didnt cover it i looked at the others okay someone tell me what just happened here jamil started to speak then stopped and looked at richard with my ulfrics permission the words were polite but the tone was angry almost defiant richard looked at him i couldnt see his face but whatever look he gave jamil it was something that made the other man flinch jamil dropped to one knee in the spreading pool of thick liquid he bowed his head i mean no offense ulfric thats a lie richard said and his voice was lower than normal just a tone or two above a growl jamil darted a glance upward then bowed his head again i dont know what you want me to say ulfric tell me and i will say it richard turned back to me leaving jamil kneeling i didnt just call stephens beast i tore it from his body i glanced down at stephen who was still crouched at richards feet why i asked its usually punishment to do it this way what did stephen do nothing richards voice was harsh almost as harsh as the look on his face then why punish him because i could his chin lifted when he said it and that arrogance was back what the hell is wrong with you richard he laughed and the sound was so inappropriate that it made me jump he laughed but it was too loud too harsh didnt this teach you how to call gregorys beast i didnt learn a damn thing except that youre in a foul mood and taking it out on other people you want to know whats wrong you really want to know yeah i do get out of the way stephen he said and stephen didnt even ask why he just crawled out from between us we were left staring at each other not quite two feet apart what hed done to stephen seemed to have taken the edge off his power but it was still there like some great slumbering thing pressing against the surface open the marks anita feel what im feeling i opened the marks already i figured i had to to learn how to do this so its just my shielding he made it a question i nodded i can feel your rage richard i just dont know why just my shields between us and he shook his head almost smiling then he dropped his shields it hit me like a physical force drove me back a step anger so raw it filled my throat with bile a selfloathing so deep that it drew tears down my cheeks in two hot lines i stood there for a minute feeling richards pain and it was suffocating i stared up at him the tears still wet on my cheeks richard oh my god dont feel sorry for me dont you dare feel pity for me he grabbed my arms when he said it and the moment we touched our beasts poured up from inside us and spread across our skins in a hot dance of power his beast crashed through me invisible metaphysical claws ripping through my body it was as if richards beast was trying to eat his way through my body i screamed and thrust my beast into his and i felt claws ripping into meat there was nothing to see with the eye but i could feel it feel fur and muscle and meat under claws and teeth i screamed not just from the pain but from the sensations of cutting richard up he hurt me and i wanted to hurt him back there was no more reasoning no more thinking just reacting our beasts tore through each other rolling clawing tearing we collapsed on the deck screaming dimly i could still feel richards hands locked on my arms as if he couldnt let go there was movement all around us people hovering but no one interfered no one touched us when we fell they scattered as if afraid to touch us voices shouting above our screams whats wrong whats happening anita anita richard control it his beast was suddenly like a weight inside me but it didnt hurt the two energies lay quiet leaning against each other not mingling just leaning i could almost feel the solid push of his beast against something inside of me that had bones and fur and wasnt me i couldnt hear anything but the thundering of the blood in my own head i felt richards weight on top of me before i looked down to find him collapsed over me his head rested on my chest i could feel the pulse of the blood in his body his heart racing against the skin of my stomach i was covered in the cool slime from stephens body one i was lying in a pool of it two richard had been covered in it and hed slid down my body i was going to have to shower before i could go to bed even if it was dawn and i ached ached as if id been beaten i knew id be stiff when i moved everyone was standing in a ring above us staring down i found my voice hoarse almost raspy but clear get off of me richard raised his head slowly as if he hurt too im sorry youre always sorry richard now get off of me he didnt move in fact he settled heavier hands curving at the edges of my waist do you still want to help gregory thats what this whole show is about so yeah then lets try again i tensed and started trying to wriggle out from under him his hands tightened at my waist easy anita it wont hurt i dont think says you it hurt like a son of a bitch let me go richard my voice held the beginnings of anger and fear i liked the anger could have done without the fear you fought me to a standoff its over he said i stopped struggling and stared at him what are you talking about were not the same kind of animal anita they had to find out whos tougher i stared down the line of my body into those brown eyes are you saying this was some kind of dominance display not exactly strangely it was merle who answered when two such different beasts meet and they are both strong dominants such as a true nimirra and a true ulfric the two animals must fight and test each other i have seen it before it is a type of taming of one beast by the other i looked way up at the tall man no one tamed anyone merle knelt beside us i think you are right it is as the ulfric has said a standoff he could have kept fighting until one of you won or lost but he chose to let it be i remembered someone telling richard to control it it being his beast i looked at richard you stopped didnt you i dont care which of us is more dominant anita those kind of games have never meant anything to me unless people forced me to play them you said something about helping gregory what did you mean he started working his way a little higher up my body sliding his body along mine i could feel the slime from his shirt recoating my bare stomach and nearly bare chest my disgust must have shown on my face because he asked whats wrong your shirt is covered in slime and im lying in a pool of it i didnt just want you to get off me to be off of me i wanted to get up out of this mess he came to his knees his legs on either side of mine i could feel our beasts stretched between us like something that should have been visible as if each of their heads was buried in the others chest he offered me a hand i stared up at him i know you dont need the help anita but our beasts are touching now its a close connection and physical contact will help us keep it until we finish gregory i didnt need the earnest look on his face to know he was telling the truth the marks were still open between us i knew he was telling the truth i took his hand and he lifted me to my feet standing up hurt and either he felt it or saw it on my face i hurt you he said softly we hurt each other i could feel that he was stiff aching but he moved like he wasnt and i still moved human stiff he raised the bottom of his shirt still holding my hand touch me i looked up at him and he laughed just keep physical contact anita i dont mean anything by it but i need both my hands i laid a hand on his side very tentatively he shook his head im going to take my shirt off if you cant touch a persons hands arms or much of their upper body you run out of polite places to touch i settled for sliding my hand under the wet shirt touching the smooth firmness of his side even his skin was damp from the shirt having molded to it richard drew the shirt over his head and i was left standing inches from him as he revealed the flat plains of his stomach the muscular swell of his chest and arched his back to draw the shirt over his head the sight of him the pull of the lust that always came when i saw him without clothes pushed my beast against his i felt furred sides roll against each other a tentative roll of power that felt like someone had taken velvet and caressed the most intimate part of me richard gasped i concentrated hard to stop the movement but that id done it without thinking brought heat in a wash up my face i looked at the ground my hand was still only touching his side just above his jeans but the touch felt suddenly intimate i wanted to take my hand away and his hand covered mine before i could move he pressed my hand to him firm but not forceful he touched my chin raised my face until i had to look at him its alright anita i love the fact that just seeing me moves you like that the blush that had been fading blazed harder he laughed soft low with that edge that a mans laugh gets when hes thinking intimate things i have missed you anita i looked up at him i missed you too his beast moved through me in a wash of power and sensation that left me gasping my beast responded to his i couldnt seem to stop it maybe i didnt want to those shadow forms rolled in and out of each other through us until i couldnt breathe couldnt think it was richard who drew back first and said dear god i never thought i felt the effort it cost him to draw back from me to stop his face showed a businesslike nononsense look but i could feel the trembling of other things inside him his voice came out brisk ill call jamils beast the way its supposed to be done feel what i do how i use my beast to call his my voice was a little breathy then ill do gregory he nodded or i can call shangdas beast if you need to see it one more time i nodded okay he slid a hand around my waist drawing me against him it didnt seem as intimate as the roil of our beasts inside us jamil stood facing us hed stripped off his shirt and shoes but kept on his pants it occurred to me for the first time that id never seen him nude except when hed been injured and near death jamil didnt do casual nudity one of the few modest shapeshifters i knew im ready ulfric after what richard had done to stephen i thought jamil was being awful trusting but then everyone trusted richard he was very trustworthy no lack of trust wasnt the problem i dont need to physically touch anyone to do this but its easier that way so ill touch him so you can understand better how it works i nodded wrapped in the circle of his arm the firmness of his body the velvet roll of our beasts like another arm to hold us against each other richard touched jamils bare shoulder and i felt his power move outward like a warm wind it caressed jamils skin and richards beast flowed with it pulling mine along for the ride richards power teased along jamil coaxing and the best analogy i could think of was like someone trying to lure a cat down out of a tree beckoning talking sweetly promising caresses and treats if only it would come down but jamils beast didnt come down it came out it rolled out of the center of his being like a pale golden fog an almost shape i saw his beast like id seen micahs earlier for an instant then jamil collapsed to the deck and his bare back began to ripple like water under a strong wind the wolf drew out of his back in a long wet line and his body dissolved into that dark furred shape so that his human body became the wolf like flipping over a coin heads tails but still the same coin i felt the rightness of it the harmony of it jamil embraced what he was there was no conflict between him and his beast id never seen him in wolf form manwolf but not this ponysized black beast he was like little red riding hoods worst nightmare the wolf shook himself and i realized that his fur was dry there was more of that clear goop all over the deck but very little of it had clung to the wolf itself yet another metaphysical mystery how do werewolves stay dry when shapeshifting is such a mess i turned without a word drawing richard with me i went to gregory still sitting on the picnic table only cherry and dr lillian with him now zane had come to see what the matter was when richard and i started writhing on the deck gregory looked at me blue eyes silvered in the moonlight i smiled and touched his cheek cupped the side of his face against my hand i reached for his beast not with my hand but with that shadowy thing that swirled through richard and me i sent it shivering across gregorys skin and he sat up letting the quilt fall away from his bare upper body cherry moved away just enough so they wouldnt touch as if she was afraid to touch him now i tried to coax his beast to call it with sweet caresses and gentle persuasion but it remained stubbornly just under the surface trapped by the drugs that still made gregorys body a prison and the shock that had further dampened everything i needed to call but i knew that it didnt have to be gentle i might not have been along for the ride when richard brought stephens beast but id seen it and i knew enough of power to guess what hed done ill try not to hurt you i said but i thrust my power into gregory i felt it hit his chest and sink into him like a large fleshandfur blade gregory gasped back arching just a little i found his beast like a curled cat asleep sluggish and i grabbed it in my hand sank claws in it and pulled it screaming into the air i ripped his beast out of him and gregory shifted as stephen had shifted in an explosion of blood flesh and fluid i was covered in it so thick i had to scoop it out of my eyes to see to see that yellow and black spotted manleopard lying hunched on the table i watched stephen come to sniff along his brothers shivering body gregory gregory can you hear me i asked and my voice was softer than i meant it to be gregory blinked leopard eyes at me but a growling voice came out of that furred throat i can hear you stephen threw his head back and bayed jamil echoed him and the leopards screams of triumph filled the night dawn was sliding through the trees in a wash of white white light that left the trees looking like black paper cutouts against the shining sky when i pulled the curtains and filled the bedroom with twilight dimness id put very heavy curtains in the room when jeanclaude had been a frequent visitor the bedside lamp seemed dim after the glow of sunrise nathaniel sat on the edge of the bed by the lamp he was wearing the bottoms of silk pajama shorts they were a pale lavender silk that echoed his eyes and looked too delicate a color for mens sleepwear i always suspected the shorts were originally designed for a woman but shorts were shorts the lamplight caught red highlights in his auburn hair where it gleamed down the side of his body like something warm and alive almost separate strangely in wereleopard form he was a black panther so that auburn hair vanished once he left human form nathaniel was the only one of the wereleopards still in human form so he was the only one that got to share my bed if they were kittycats they had to sleep elsewhere but in human form we tried to be a big pile of puppies somehow it was less comfy with only nathaniel than it would have been with more of them maybe it was the fact that his right nipple still had a circle of my teeth marks shouldnt the bite marks have healed by now i asked i dont heal as quickly as some he said softly and marks made by another shapeshifter or even a vampire heal more slowly why is that he shrugged why does silver kill us and steel not point taken i said i ran my hand through my stilldamp hair id showered and was actually wearing pajamas not an oversized tshirt which was my usual sleep attire though pajamas may have been too big a word for the emerald green camisole and matching shortshorts there was a floorlength robe in the same vibrant green so everything was covered but nathaniel knew i hadnt dressed up for him or at least i hoped he did he watched me pacing the room with careful eyes we had crossed a line he and i and the mark on his chest just kept reminding me of it i didnt think that richard would tolerate nathaniel and me sharing the bed alone not that i really expected the three of us to bunk together either oh hell i didnt know what i expected i had expected richard to come to me after his shower but he was a noshow and it was dawn and i was tired there was a firm knock on the door i said come in with my heart beating a little too fast merle opened the door and i hoped my disappointment didnt show on my face his own face registered nothing so i couldnt judge what he saw on mine the ulfric is in the kitchen he did look uncomfortable then he is crying i felt my eyes widen excuse me merle looked down then up almost defiant he has ordered his bodyguard out of the room and he is crying i do not know why i sighed although i was tired i was excited at the thought of richard being in the house of him coming to me maybe instead of sex we were going to have another session of handholding and shouldercrying damn it i felt my shoulders slump and forced myself to stand upright again i didnt have to ask why merle had told me who else would richard take comfort from i wasnt even a hundred percent sure hed take comfort from me i went for the door merle held it open for me and i walked under his arm without having to duck thanks for telling me merle i muttered as i went out into the darkened living room shangda was leaning against the wall by the open doorway that led into the kitchen he looked as uncomfortable as id ever seen him he wouldnt meet my eyes what was going on caleb was settled on the couch with a blanket and an extra pillow he was sitting up the blanket bunched in his lap he was nude from the waist up and probably nude from the waist down if no one had made him wear jammies i hoped someone had remembered to put a sheet on the couch he watched me walk across the room and even in the dim light from the kitchen i didnt like the way his eyes followed me nice robe he said i ignored him and went for the doorway richard sat at the kitchen table opened all the curtains so that the room was filled with the soft light of dawn his shoulderlength hair had been blowdried to a soft fluffy mass i could never blowdry my hair without it turning to something thick and awfullooking the early morning light made his hair look more golden than normal less brown he looked up and i realized the gold glow was a halo effect of the rising sun it painted a nimbus of shining gold around him leaving his hair light brown around his face making the skin at the center of his body look even darker than it was almost like it was in shadow i had a moment to see the shine of tears on his shadowed face then he lowered his head and twisted in his chair so i couldnt see the movement placed more of his body in the burning golden light but the illusion of halos and shadow was gone i walked to the table stood close enough to touch his bare shoulder not sure if i should richard whats wrong he shook his head still not looking at me i reached out touched the smoothness of his shoulder gently he didnt tell me to go away and he didnt pull away okay i touched the tears on the cheek closest to me smoothed them away with my hand it reminded me of comforting nathaniel earlier i touched richards chin turned his face to me and dried the tears on his other cheek with the sleeve of my robe talk to me richard please he smiled maybe it was the please i didnt use that word often ive never seen this before he touched the sleeve very gently i wasnt going to be distracted not even by him noticing what id worn with him in mind you have to be as tired as i am richard whats keeping you up he looked down then up and there was such sorrow in his dark eyes that i almost said no dont but he needed to talk louisa is in jail and guy is dead i frowned i dont know the names louisa is one of our newest wolves he looked down again not meeting my eyes guy is her fiance husband was her husband he covered his face with his hands shaking his head over and over and over i held his wrists lowered his hands so i could see his eyes richard talk to me his hands turned in my grip holding my hands we held hands while i watched the pain in his eyes spill out in words louisa killed guy on their honeymoon yesterday i got the call just before i came here i still dont understand its awful tragic but i said i was her sponsor i trained her to control her beast and she lost that control on her honeymoon in the middle of he lowered his head and raised my hands so that his forehead rested against the back of my hands she lost control in the middle of sex i finished for him he nodded his face still pressed to my hands losing her virginity he said voice muffled low did you say virginity he pulled away from me then dropped his hands in his lap and i noticed for the first time that he was wearing a towel knotted at his waist yes you mean shed never tried to control her beast during intercourse i asked he shook his head theyd been engaged for more than two years before louisa was attacked and became one of us they both wanted to wait for the wedding night commendable i said and orgasm to a certain extent is orgasm if she could control herself during nonintercourse orgasm then she should have been able to control herself during intercourse too i touched his shoulder again you did all you could for her he jerked away as if id burned him coming to his feet so suddenly that the chair crashed back against the kitchen island then the floor i sensed rather than saw people in the doorway i said were alright i turned to see shangda merle and the two wererats still hesitating in the doorway were alright go away they all pulled back but i knew now that we had an audience because they wouldnt go far richard stood in the middle of my kitchen wearing nothing but a towel and the golden first light of dawn normally it would have distracted me from anything reasonable but not this morning the pain in his face was more important than his body right now looking at him standing there so defiant so hurt i had an idea an awful idea please tell me you dont mean she wanted to wait for any sexual contact until the honeymoon his chin raised and that arrogance tried to slide over him but it was a mask and i saw through it now underneath he was scared and guilty i taught her to control the beast during anger sadness fear pain every extreme of emotion but not sex i respected her convictions i stared at him it was so something richard would do theoretically i even approved but theory and practice arent the same in real life it had been a bad idea and richard should have known that better than i did i felt my face go blank empty it was a good cop face i didnt want anything i was thinking to show for this so this louisa shifted in the middle of sex and killed her husband and the cops caught her i didnt add that i was surprised they hadnt shot her on sight finding the big bad wolf eating the body of the nice little human would be cause enough for shooting to kill louisa turned herself in i think if she didnt think suicide was a sin shed have killed herself he turned my way walking to the sliding glass doors leaning his forehead against the glass as if he was tired i wished i could have said it wasnt his fault but it was he was her sponsor the one who was supposed to teach her how to be a shapeshifter id learned from dealing with the wereleopards and richard and vernes pack in tennessee that orgasm of any kind was one of the true tests of their control orgasm was supposed to be a release but to truly give up all control meant shifting form and that was the ultimate nightmare when you had a human lover richard had lectured me often enough when we were dating that he didnt trust himself the night of the full moon or even the day before he didnt fear losing control and killing me just losing control and scaring me to death or more honestly grossing me out he had shifted on top of me once and that had had nothing to do with sex and that one experience had sent me running to jean claude well richard changing on top of me and seeing him eat someone i didnt know what to say all i knew was that i had to say something that silence was almost worse than anything he spoke without turning around go ahead anita tell me im a fool tell me i sacrificed both of them on the altar of my ideals his voice was bitter enough to choke on just hearing the pain in it louisa and her husband wanted to hold true to who they were you wanted to help them do that its perfectly logically you my voice was empty but at least it wasnt reproachful it was the best i could do because it was a waste a waste because richard and the girl and her fiance had been more worried about appearance than reality or maybe im just cynical and tired oh so tired it was like any really good tragedy entirely dependent on the personalities of the people involved if richard had been more practical and less idealistic if louisa and her late husband had been less religious less pure hell if the husband really brought her to orgasm with just intercourse then if hed only been less talented so many things had gone into making all the good intentions go horribly wrong yes it was perfectly logically me and i was wrong i should have at least forced her to have her first experience with guy where the pack could oversee it save him but louisa was so delicate about it i just couldnt insist i just couldnt make her strip down in front of strangers and have her most intimate moment witnessed i just couldnt do it i didnt know what to say i did the only thing i could think of to comfort him i went to him and put my arms around his waist put my cheek against the smooth firmness of his back and held him i am so sorry richard so very sorry his body started to shake and i realized he was crying again still soundlessly but not gently great racking sobs shook his body but the only sound he allowed himself was the harsh shaking of his breath as he gasped trying to get enough air he slid slowly to his knees his hands making harsh sounds down the glass of the door as if he were taking skin off as his hand slid down the glass i stayed standing leaning over him cradling his head against my body my hands on his shoulders and chest trying to hold him he fell backwards and i was suddenly trying to hold all his weight as he went for the floor i tripped on the hem of the robe and we ended in a heap on the floor with his head and shoulders in my lap and me struggling to sit up the knot on the towel had loosened and a long uninterrupted line of his body showed from his waist down his hip to his foot the towel was still in place but it was losing the battle his mouth opened in a soundless cry then suddenly there was sound he gave one ragged tearchoked scream and the sound seemed to free something inside him because the sobbing was suddenly loud full of small awful painful sounds he sobbed and whimpered and screamed and clutched at my arms enough that i knew id be bruised and all i could do was hold on touch him rock him until he quieted he finally lay on his side his upper body as far into my lap as he would fit the rest of him curled up so that one thigh covered him the towel formed a heap on the floor underneath him i didnt even know when the towel had fallen away i was sort of proud of that because usually when i see richard naked i lose about forty points of iq and most of my reasoning ability but now his pain was so raw that that took precedence it was comfort he needed not sex he finally lay quiet in my arms his breathing slowed almost to normal his eyelids had fluttered shut and for a moment i thought he was asleep then he spoke eyes still closed i appointed an eros and eranthe for the pack his voice was still thick with all the crying eros was the greek god of love or lust and eranthe was the muse of erotic poetry in werewolf lore they were the names for sexual surrogates a man and a woman that did what needed doing when a werewolfs sponsor was too squeamish vernes pack had them because vernes lupa was very jealous of her ulfric and sometimes you just needed someone who isnt emotionally involved thats good richard i think it will make things easier he opened his eyes and they were bleak it made my chest ache to see that look in his eyes there are other positions that would make a lot of things easier he said voice thick and low i tensed up i couldnt help it because i knew that there were titles among the lukoi that would make all the problems hed created in the pack fixable there were titles that amounted to executioners torturers the lukoi have a long history through some very harsh times very few packs fill these slots anymore most dont see the need but then most ulfrics are good little tyrants they dont need to delegate the rough stuff do you know what bцlverk means richard asked softly its one of the names of odin it means worker of evil my voice was almost as soft as his you didnt remember that from a semester of comparative religion back in college no i said my pulse had sped up i couldnt help it bцlverk was the title for what amounted to someone who did the ulfrics evil deeds it could be anything from trickery to lies to murder you asked verne about it didnt you yes i kept my voice low i was afraid to be loud afraid hed stop talking thought i knew where the conversation was going and i wanted to get there jacob is going to challenge sylvie richard said and his voice was growing stronger and hell kill her shes good but ive seen jacob fight she cant win i havent seen him fight but i think youre right if i made you bцlverk he stopped i wanted to yell at him to finish but i didnt dare all i could do was sit there very still and try not to do anything that would change his mind he started over if i made you bцlverk what would you do that last was soft again as if he couldnt quite believe he was saying it i let out a breath i hadnt even realized i was holding and tried to think think before i spoke because id only get one shot at this i knew richard and if what i said didnt meet with his approval the offer would go away and he might never be willing to ask for this kind of help again id seldom been so eager to speak and so afraid at the same time i prayed for wisdom diplomacy help first youd need to announce my new title to the pack then id choose some helpers im allowed three baugi suttung and guunlod richard said the two giants bцlverk tricked to get the mead of poetry and guunlod the giants daughter who he seduced for it yes he rolled his upper body over so he was looking up at me you spent almost every weekend of the last six months in tennessee i thought you were just studying with marianne learning how to use your talents but you were studying the lukoi too werent you i tried to be very careful as i said vernes pack runs very smoothly hes helped me make the wereleopards into a true pard you dont need a bцlverk or a guunlod to make the leopards into a pard his gaze was very direct and i couldnt lie to him i was still your lupa but not a werewolf the least i could do was learn about your culture he smiled then and it reached his eyes just a little chased that lost look away you didnt care about the culture that pissed me off yes i did his smile widened his eyes filling with light the way the sun filled the sky as it rose above the edge of the world alright you cared about the culture but that wasnt why you wanted to know about bцlverk the evildoer i looked down feeling just a little embarrassed maybe not he touched my face lightly turning me to look down at him again to meet his gaze you said you didnt know about jacob before you talked with him on the phone i didnt i said then why ask verne about bцlverk i stared down into those truebrown eyes and spoke the truth because you are kind and fair and just and those are lovely things to have in a king but the world is not kind or fair or just the reason vernes pack runs smoothly the reason my pard runs smoothly is because verne and i are ruthless when we need to be i dont know if you could be ruthless if you had to be but think it would break you if you managed to pull it off having you be ruthless for me is going to break something inside of me anita something thats important to me i stroked his hair feeling the thick softness of it but me doing it wont break as much or as badly as you doing it richard he nodded slowly i know and i hate myself for that i leaned over and kissed his forehead very gently i spoke with my lips touching his skin the only true happiness richard lies in knowing who you are what you are and making peace with it his arm curved up around me holding me against him he spoke with his mouth against the hollow of my throat and are you at peace with what you are im working on it i said he kissed my throat very softly me too i drew back enough to see his face and his hand thrust upward through my hair pulled my face down to his we kissed soft then harder his lips his tongue his mouth working at mine i cupped his face in my hands and kissed him kissed him long and hard when i drew back breathless i found that hed rolled his lower body over and lay on his back nude he laughed at the expression on my face and pulled me down towards him i lost that forty points of intelligence and all my reasoning skills as he undid my robe and i ran my hands down the long line of his body i had just enough selfpossession left to say not here weve got an audience in the living room his hand slid under the green satin of the camisole curving around to my back pulling me against him theres no place in the house that they wont hear us smell us i pulled back from him before he could kiss me gee richard that makes me feel a lot better he propped himself up on one arm staring down at me we can go into the bedroom if you want but we wont be fooling anybody i didnt like that and it must have shown on my face because richard drew his hand out from under my top and said do you want to stop we hadnt really gotten started but i knew what he meant i looked into the solid brown of his eyes traced the edge of his jaw with my gaze the fullness of his lips the curve of his throat the spread of his shoulders the way his hair fell around him catching the early morning light bringing out shades of gold and copper in his hair the swell of his chest his nipples already dark and hard the flat line of his stomach with that thin dark line of hair that went from his belly button to the skin was darker richer you could almost smell the blood that pumped him full and hard he looked ripe like he was something full to bursting with life i wanted to touch him to squeeze oh so delicately i lay on the floor with my hands at my sides my pulse beating in my throat and said no i dont want to stop my voice was almost a whisper his eyes filled with that dark heat that spills into a mans face when hes almost a hundred percent sure of whats about to happen his voice was deeper that low note that most mens voices get when the excitement runs deep here or the bedroom i tore my gaze away from him to look at the open doorway to the living room there was no door to close i needed more privacy than this even if they could hear us even smell us in the bedroom at least they wouldnt be able to see us maybe it was only an illusion of delicacy but sometimes illusion is all youve got i looked back at him bedroom good choice he said and got to his knees taking my hand so that when he got to his feet he halfpulled me to mine the movement startled me and i fell against him the height difference was enough that it put my hand on his hip and so very close to other things it embarrassed me how very much i wanted to touch him hold him i started to pull away because i was so close to losing all decorum and groping him right there in the kitchen i wasnt entirely sure that if i grabbed him wed make it to the bedroom i wanted that door between us and everyone else he put his arms around my waist and lifted me off my feet until our faces were even and i didnt know what to do with my legs if id been sure we wouldnt be using the kitchen table id have wrapped my legs around his waist but i didnt trust either of us that far he put his arms under my butt so that my head was slightly above his and i rested in his arms almost like i was in a swing i could still feel him pressed hard and firm against my body but it had a certain decorum to it that straddling his waist lacked he started walking for the door carrying me his eyes so intent on my face that he almost tripped on a chair it made me laugh until his eyes came back to meet mine and i saw the need in those dark eyes that one look robbed me of speech and all i could do was stare into his eyes as he carried me into the bedroom the bedroom was empty when he kicked the door shut behind us i didnt know if the living room was empty or not i couldnt remember anything but richards eyes from the kitchen to the bedroom every room might have been empty for all id seen we kissed just inside the door my hands were full of the rich thickness or his hair the firm warmth of his neck i explored his face with my hands my mouth tasted teased caressed just his face he drew back from my mouth enough to say if i dont sit down im going to fall down my knees are weak i laughed fullthroated and said then put me down he halfwalked halfstaggered to the bed laying me on it going to his knees beside it he was laughing as he crawled onto the bed beside me he lay beside me his knees hanging over the side of the bed though since he was tall enough for his feet to actually touch the floor when he lay like that maybe hanging wasnt the right word we lay beside each other on the bed laughing softly not touching we turned our heads to look at each other at the same moment his eyes sparkled with the laughter his whole face almost shining with it i reached out and traced the lines of laughter around his mouth the laughter began to fade as soon as i touched him his eyes filling up with something darker more serious but no less precious he rolled onto his side the movement put my hand along the side of his face he rubbed his face into my hand eyes closed lips half parted i rolled onto my stomach and moved towards him my hand still on his face he opened his eyes watching me crawl towards him i propped myself up on hands and knees and watched his eyes as i leaned in towards his mouth there was eagerness there but there was also something else something fragile did my eyes mirror that look halfeager halffearful wanting afraid to want needing and afraid to need my mouth hovered over his our lips touching delicate as butterflies blown by a warm summer wind touching not touching sliding along each other gliding away his hand grabbed the back of my neck forced my mouth to press against his hard firm he used his tongue and lips to force my mouth open i opened to him and we took turns exploring each others mouths he came to his knees hand still pressed to the back of my neck our mouths still locked together he drew back crawling backwards to the head of the bed leaving me kneeling alone in the center of the bed he reached under the covers drew out pillows propped himself up watching me there was something almost decadent about him naked propped up watching me i knelt looking back at him having a little trouble focusing thinking i finally managed to say whats wrong nothing he said voice deep lower than normal it wasnt the growl of his beast it was a peculiarly male sound i want to run my beast through you anita for a split second i thought it was a euphemism then i realized he meant exactly what hed said richard i dont know i know you dont like otherworldly stuff during sex but anita he settled into the pillows in a strange smoothing motion that somehow reminded me that he wasnt human i felt your beast it rolled through me just hearing it out loud took a little of the glow off for me i slumped back against the bed still on my knees but no longer upright hands limp in my lap richard i havent had time to think this through i dont know how i feel about it yet its not all bad anita some of it can be wondrous this from the man who had hated his beast for the entire time id known him but i didnt say that out loud i just looked at him he smiled i know how strange that sounds coming from me i looked at him harder he laughed settling lower on the pillows until he was sprawled in front of me one leg bent up so he wouldnt touch me but close enough that i could have touched him he lay there unselfconsciously nude which id seen before but it was more than that he seemed bathed in a comfortableness that was rare for richard id seen it at the lupanar that hed accepted his beast but it was more than that hed accepted himself what do you want from me richard this was his cue to get serious to demand i be less bloodthirsty or a half dozen other impossible things he didnt i want this he said and i felt the prickling rush of his power a second before it passed through me like a warm ghost i shuddered with it i dont know richard i dont know if this is a good idea it would have sounded better if my voice hadnt had a tremble in it i expected him to question or talk but he didnt i felt his power like a brush of thunder a second before it smashed into me i had a second of panic a moment to wonder if his beast and mine would claw me apart then his power rubbed through me like a velvet glove my beast rose as if from a great warm wet depth up up to meet the warm burning rush of richards energy he pushed his beast through me and i could feel it impossibly huge the brush of fur so deep inside me that i cried out i felt his beast as if it had crawled inside me and was caressing things from the inside that his hands would never have touched my power seemed less certain than his less solid but it rose around the hard muscled fur like velvet mist swirling through his power through my own body until it felt as if something huge was growing inside me something id never felt before swelling inside me it felt larger than my body as if i couldnt hold it inside myself like a cup filled to the brim with something hot and scalding but the liquid kept pouring in and still i held it held it held it until it burst over me through me out of me in a roar of power that turned the world golden and slow drew my body to its knees curved my back sent my hands clawing at the air trying to hold on to something anything while my body spilled apart and remade itself on the bed for a space of labored heartbeats i thought hed brought on the change and i had slipped my skin for real but it wasnt that i felt like i was floating and only gradually felt my body again i lay on my back my knees folded under me hands limp at my sides so relaxed it was like being drugged i felt the bed move under me and a moment later richard appeared above me he was on all fours looming over me and i had trouble focusing on his face he cradled my face staring into my eyes while i tried to look at him anita are you alright i laughed then slow and lazy help me get my knees straightened out and ill be fine he helped me straighten my legs and even then all i wanted to do was just lay there what did you do to me he lay down beside me propped on one elbow i brought you using the beasts i blinked at him licked my lips and tried to think of an intelligent question gave up and settled for what i wanted to know is it always like that between lycanthropes no he said and leaned over me until his face filled my vision no only a true lupa or a true nimirra can respond to my ulfric the way you just did i touched his chest enough to back him up so i could see his face clearly youve never done that with anyone before he looked down then a curtain of his hair sliding over his face hiding it from me i pushed his hair back so i could see that nearly perfect profile who i asked heat washed up his neck and face i wasnt sure id ever seen him blush before it was raina wasnt it he nodded yes i let his hair fall back in place and lay there for a few seconds thinking about it then i was laughing laughing and couldnt stop he was back at my shoulder peering down at me anita the laughter faded as i looked into his worried eyes when you forced raina to give you up all those years ago did you know that she was the only one that could do this with you he nodded face solemn raina pointed out the downside to not being her pet i took his hand and slid it down the front of my satin bottoms his fingertips found the wetness that had soaked through the satin and i didnt have to guide his hand anymore he cupped that big hand of his over my groin and the cloth was soaked through he traced fingertips across my inner thigh and the skin was wet wet down to my knees how did you give it up my voice came out in a whisper his finger slid up the inside of my thigh in the hollow just below he leaned in to kiss me as his finger slid slowly slowly upward across the moist skin under the wet satin his mouth stayed just above mine so close that a sharp breath would have made us touch he spoke his breath warm on my skin as his finger caressed the edge of me no amount of pleasure was worth her price two things happened at once he kissed me and his finger slid inside of me i screamed against his mouth back arching fingernails digging into his shoulder as his finger found that small spot and thrust over and over it until he brought me again the world had soft white edges like seeing through gauze i felt the bed move but couldnt focus couldnt see wasnt sure i cared what was happening hands fumbled at my shorts i blinked up to see richard kneeling over me he slid my shorts down spread my legs and knelt between them he leaned over me raising the satin camisole baring my breasts he ran his hands across them made me writhe then moved his hands down the line of my body his hands gripping my thighs bringing me in a harsh jerk against his body the moment he rubbed against the outside of me i felt the rubbery latex of the condom i looked up at his face and asked how did you know he moved so that his lower body was lying between my legs but still pressed against the outside of my body most of his weight was supported by his arms like a modified pushup position do you really think jeanclaude would warn me about the ardeur and not warn me that you werent on birth control good point i said no he said this is i felt the movement of his hips seconds before he thrust inside me in one powerful motion that drove sounds from my mouth somewhere between a scream and a shout he lowered his head enough to see my face i lay gasping under him but whatever he saw there reassured him because he arched his back his face looking somewhere in the distance and drew himself out of me slowly inch by inch until i made small noises he drew himself out until he was barely touching inside me i gazed down the length of my body to see him stretched hard and ready hed always been careful of me because he wasnt small that one first thrust had been more force than hed ever before allowed himself he like micah filled me up hit that point deep inside that was either pain or pleasure i saw his back and hips flex a second before he thrust into me i watched him thrust into me saw every inch of him plunge into me until it bowed my back my neck and i couldnt watch because i was writhing underneath him my hands scrambling at the bedspread digging fingers into the covers he drew himself out of me again and i stopped him with a hand on his stomach wait wait i was having trouble breathing its not hurting you i can tell by your face your eyes your body i swallowed took a shaky breath and said no its not hurting me it feels wonderful but youve always been so careful even when i asked you not to be whats changed he looked down at me his hair falling around his face like a silken frame i was always afraid of hurting you before but i felt your beast i havent changed yet richard we dont know for sure anita he said softly and i knew he was chiding me maybe it was a case of the lady protesting too much but still im still human richard i havent changed yet he leaned over me his hair gliding around my face as he kissed me gently on the cheek even before the first full moon we can take more damage the change has already begun anita i pushed against his chest until he drew back enough for me to see his face youve always been holding back havent you yes he said i searched his face and saw such need in his eyes and i knew why hed been so angry at gregory hed said that he almost regretted not making me his lupa in truth now that hed seen me be nimirra but it was more than that i looked into his brown eyes in the spill of early morning light and knew that hed wanted me to be what he was even though he hated it that at some level hed been tempted to make me his lupa for real somewhere in the lovemaking where he had to be so careful hed thought of it more than once it was there in eyes his face he started to look away as if he could feel that i saw it all but he made himself look back meet my gaze he was almost defiant how careful have you been of me richard he did look away then using his hair as a shield i reached through that thick hair to touch his face to turn him to look at me richard how careful have you been of me there was something close to pain in his eyes he whispered very i held his face between my hands you dont have to be careful anymore a look of soft wonderment crossed his face and he bent his head down and we kissed kissed as we had earlier propping exploring taking turns at thrusting into each other he drew slowly back from the kiss and i felt the tip of him touch my opening i stared down the length of our bodies so i could watch as his body flexed above me and he thrust himself inside me harder this time quicker it brought my breath in a soundless scream anita i opened my eyes not realizing id closed them i gazed up at him dont be careful anymore richard dont be careful he smiled gave me a quick kiss then he was back arched above me and this time he didnt stop he thrust every inch of himself into me as hard and as fast as he could the sound of flesh into flesh became a constant sound a wet hammering i realized it hadnt been just his size that made him careful but his strength he could have benchpressed the bed we lay on and that strength lay not just in his arms or back but in his legs his thighs in the body he was pressing inside me over and over again for the first time ever i began to appreciate the full power of him id felt the strength in his hands his arms when he held me but it was nothing to this he made of our bodies one body one pounding sweating soaking drenching piece of flesh i was vaguely aware that it did hurt that i was bruising and i didnt care i called out his name as my body tightened around his squeezing and i spasmed underneath him body slamming against the bed not from richards thrusts but from the power of the orgasm itself screams spilled from my throat as my body rocked underneath him it felt good better than almost anything but it was almost violence almost pain almost frightening somewhere in the midst of it all i was aware that he came too he screamed my name but held his place while i continued to writhe and fight underneath him it wasnt until i lay quiet that he allowed himself to collapse on top of me slightly to one side so my face wouldnt be pressed into his chest we lay in a sweating breathless heap waiting for our hearts to slow enough to speak he found his voice first thank you thank you for trusting me i laughed youre thanking me i raised his hand to my mouth and kissed the palm then rested his hand against my face trust me richard it was my pleasure he laughed that rich throaty sound that is purely male and purely sexual were going to need another shower whichever of us can walk first can have the first shower i said he laughed and hugged me i wasnt even sure my legs would work enough to shower at all maybe a bath i woke just enough to feel the weight of someone at my back i snuggled against that warmth wrapping sleep back around me an arm spilled over my shoulder and i wriggled into the circle of arm and body it wasnt the warmth or the feel of him that woke me the wereleopards had gotten me used to all that it was the scent of his skin by the scent alone i knew it was richard i opened my eyes and snuggled deeper against him curling that dark muscled arm tighter around my body like drawing a cozy blanket around me of course a blanket didnt have the hard weight of richard or the silken glide of his naked skin against mine or the ability to cuddle back to use hands to pull my body tighter in against him he closed the distance worked until even with the height difference his chest stomach and hips were curled around me he gave one last movement and i could feel him pressed hard and ready against the back of my body it was morning he was male but it wasnt something embarrassing to be ignored i could pay as much or as little attention to it as i wanted and i wanted i started to roll over in the almost tight circle of his body and found i was stiff my lower body felt bruised aching but in a good way i laughed as he opened his arms enough for me to roll onto my back whats so funny richard asked i stared up at him still laughing i think to keep from groaning im stiff he wiggled his eyebrows at me so am i i blushed and he kissed my nose then my mouth but still chaste still not really sexual it made me laugh if it had been anyone but me id have said i giggled the next kiss wasnt chaste and the one after that pressed me back against the bed he slid his leg between my thighs until his knee touched me and i winced he drew back are you too sore for this im willing to give it the ol college try i said but honestly maybe he stayed propped above me fingers moving a lock of my hair from my cheek what i did last night would have broken things inside an ordinary human i didnt need a mirror to feel my eyes go cool id really been trying not to think about it im sorry he said i didnt mean to ruin the mood he smiled suddenly and looked younger more relaxed than id seen him in a long time im just glad to be with someone i dont have to worry about hurting i had to smile at him im not hurt but we might have to try something a little more gentle this morning the humor faded and something else filled his eyes as he lowered his face for another kiss he spoke as he moved towards me i think we can come up with something he kissed my lips then worked one kiss at a time down my neck my shoulders he got distracted at my breasts covering them in kisses his tongue licking a quick wet line across one nipple he cupped one breast in his hands holding it in the circle of his warmth sliding his mouth over the nipple taking as much of the breast into his mouth as he could he sucked me into his mouth until he held over half my breast in the wet warmth and with that touch the ardeur flared up through my body from wherever it had been hiding richard drew back from my breast hands still cradling it what was that there were goosebumps on his arms the ardeur i said voice soft he licked his lips and i saw real fear in his eyes jeanclaude told me about it even let me feel his own version of it but i didnt really believe it i dont think i wanted to believe it my beast had awoken with the ardeur as if one hunger fed the other i felt it uncurl inside me and stretch for all the world like some great cat waking from a nap it rolled through me reaching out to richard and his beast woke to it one hand was on the solid warmth of his chest but i could feel something else in there something moving around as if his chest were hollow and there was something caged inside he gripped my hand moved it back from his chest what are you doing the ardeur calls to our beasts richard i snuggled down underneath him my hand sliding down his body tracing the flatness of his stomach the curve of his hip he grabbed my hand just before i could touch him he had both my hands now trapped in his larger ones it didnt bother me because i knew that i could touch him with things other than my hands or even my body i remembered the feel of his beast thrusting through me and i spilled mine into him in a hot push of energy he jumped off of me rolled out of the bed in a movement that was almost too quick to follow with the eyes he stood by the bed breath coming in ragged gasps as if hed been running i could feel his fear like fine champagne it added to the sex brought me to my knees to crawl from the tangle of covers to the edge of the bed i could smell how warm he was the scent of his skin came to me on the air the faint sweetness of the cologne hed put on the day before my gaze wandered over the beauty of him his sleeptousled hair hung in a heavy mass over one side of his face he brushed the thickness of it back from his face with one hand and a toss of his head and that one simple movement made things low in my body tighten but underneath the sex was the thought of what all that smooth hard skin would feel like under my teeth i wanted to mark him as id marked nathaniel i wanted to sink my teeth into his flesh and bite i had a flash of what it felt like to taste him like so much meat to feel his body respond not just to the sex but to the hunger and i knew for the first time why shapeshifters spoke of the hunger like it should be in all capital letters raina had risen her lascivious head the ardeur overrode or overpowered her but she was there supplying images to the things i was feeling i slid off the bed and richard backed up i could see his pulse in his neck beating like a trapped thing his beast was trapped too trapped by his control his fear i could feel it as if it were literally pacing inside his body like a wolf in a cage at the zoo pacing pacing never free it might be a large roomy cage but it was still a cage raina gave me a visual that drove me to my knees i saw richard pinned under my body chained to a bed and when he came inside me he shifted at the same moment that was release for the shapeshifters anything else was holding back richard knelt in front of me are you alright he touched my arm and that was a bad thing my beast roared across our skins hit his in a blow that i felt physically in my stomach and ribs like a punch it staggered richard made him fall forward into me and we clung for a second arms around each other our bodies pressed together the ardeur flared over us like invisible flame and we knelt in the heart of that fire like the wick of a candle his heart beat against my arms where they lay pressed to his chest as if my skin had become a drum and he beat inside me filled me with the rhythm of his body my own heartbeat found a home inside richards body we were filled with the rise and fall the pulse and beat of each other until i couldnt tell whose heart was in my chest whose blood rushed through us for a trembling moment we pressed above one another as if our skin would give way and we would finally be what the marks had promised one being one body one soul the power broke apart as richard struggled against it like a drowning man breaking apart the power like arms shatter water you can move it disrupt it but it flows back around you swells over you engulfs you richard screamed and i felt him fall back i opened my eyes as his hand pulled away and my hand tried to hold him his hand was almost free only his fingers still caught in mine when the ardeur pressed around us and i knew his control was fragile enough that i would feed i felt his confusion felt him struggling to decide what to hold on to and what to let go i realized that the shields had come down long ago because he couldnt hold the marks closed keep himself in human form and keep me from feeding all at the same time he screamed again and i felt richard decide felt the conscious choice of the lesser evil he shoved his beast down down deep inside himself and he shut the marks between us like slamming a door it was so sudden that it felt like the world had lurched i had a moment of dizziness was almost sick then the ardeur rode over us through us like a thundering thing to trample us both underfoot until we were just flesh bone blood just meat just need i saw richards back arch his head fling back and through the ardeur i felt the growing pressure tightness in his body seconds before hot release spilled over him and i held his hand while his body rocked with the strength of it and the pleasure of it drew me to my knees almost as if the power itself lifted me up for a second held me rocked me and i fed i fed and fed and fed until we were left lying on the floor sweatcovered breathing in gasps our hands still locked together richard pulled away first he lay there eyes unfocused breathing labored his heart beating too fast filling his throat he swallowed hard enough that it sounded like it hurt i felt weighted heavy with the feeding almost like i could sleep again like a snake after a big meal richard found his voice first you had no right to feed off me i thought that was the idea of you staying until morning i said he sat up slowly as if he were stiff now it was you never said no i rolled onto my side but didnt try and sit up yet he nodded i know that im not blaming you he was but at least he was trying not to you could have stopped me richard all you had to do was either leave the marks open between us or let your beast go you could have held the ardeur out you made your choice on what to control i know that too but he wouldnt look at me i propped myself up on my arms almost sitting then whats wrong he shook his head and got to his feet he was a little unsteady but he went for the door im leaving anita you make that sound awfully permanent richard he turned and looked at me no one feeds off me no one hed closed himself so tight that i couldnt tell what he was feeling but it was plain on his face pain his eyes held some deep pain and hed pulled so far away in his mind his heart that i couldnt tell what it was only that it hurt him so you wont be here tomorrow morning when the ardeur comes again my voice sounded almost neutral when i asked he shook his head all that heavy hair sliding around his shoulders his hand was on the doorknob his body turned away enough that he hid himself from me as much as he could i cant do this again anita for gods sake you have the same rule no one feeds on you either i sat up arms wrapping around my knees holding them tight to my chest i guess i was covering my nakedness too youve felt the ardeur now richard if i cant feed off of you then who who do you want me to share this with jeanclaude but his voice dropped off before he could finish its a little after noon and hes still dead to the world he wont wake in tune to share the ardeur with me his hand tightened on the doorknob hard enough for me to see the muscles in his arm tense the nimirraj then im told youve already fed on him once anyway i dont know micah that well richard i took a deep breath and said i dont love him richard i love you i want you you want to feed off me you want me to be your cow no i said no i am not food anita not for you or anyone else i am ulfric of the thronnos rokke clan and i am not cattle i am the thing that eats the cattle if you had shifted then you could have blocked the ardeur kept me from feeding why didnt you he leaned his forehead against the door i dont know honesty richard at least with yourself he turned then and his anger flared across my skin like a whip you want honesty fine we can have honesty i hate what i am i want a life anita i want a real life i want free of all this shit i dont want to be ulfric i dont want to be a werewolf i just want a life you have a life richard its just not the life you thought it would be and i dont want to love someone who is more at home with the monsters than i am i just looked at him hugging my knees to my bare chest my back pressed up against the bed i looked at him because i couldnt think of a damned thing to say im sorry anita but i cant wont do this he opened the door then he opened the door and he walked out closing it behind him the door closed with a soft firm click i sat there for a few seconds not moving i dont even think i was breathing then slowly the tears squeezed out and my first breath was a ragged gasp that hurt my throat i rolled slowly to the floor lying in a tight tight ball i lay on the floor and cried until i was cold and shivering thats how nathaniel found me he pulled the blanket from the bed and wrapped it around me picked me up and climbed onto the bed with me in his arms he held me in the curve of his body spooned against me and i couldnt feel him through the thick blanket he held me and stroked my hair i felt the bed move and opened my eyes to find cherry and zane crawling around me they touched my face took my tears with the tips of their fingers and curled around me on the other side until i was cupped in their warmth gregory and vivian came next and climbed onto the bed until we all lay in a warm thick nest of bodies and covers and i was hot and had to peel the blanket back and their hands spilled over me touching holding i realized that i was still naked and so were they no one ever put on clothes unless i made them but the touching wasnt sexual it was comfort the warm pile of puppies and everyone in that pile loved me in their way maybe it wasnt the way i wanted to be loved but love is love and sometimes i think id thrown away more love than most people ever get a chance at i was trying to be more careful lately they held me until i fell asleep exhausted with crying skin hot but down in the center of my being was a cold icy spot that they couldnt touch it was the place where i loved richard had always loved richard almost from the first time id seen him but he was right on one thing we couldnt keep doing this i wouldnt keep doing this it was over it had to be over he hated what he was and now he hated what i was he said he wanted someone that he wouldnt have to worry about hurting and he did want that but he also wanted someone human ordinary he couldnt have both but that didnt keep him from wanting both i couldnt be ordinary and i wasnt sure id ever been human i couldnt be what richard wanted me to be and he couldnt stop wanting it richard was a riddle with no answer and i was tired of playing a game i couldnt win i slept like i was drugged heavy with harsh fragmented dreams or nothingness i dont know when i would have woken but someone was licking my cheek if theyd shaken me or called my name i might have been able to ignore it but someone was licking my cheek in long languorous movements that i couldnt ignore i opened my eyes and found cherrys face so close i couldnt focus on it she moved back just enough so i wouldnt feel crosseyed looking at her then said you were having a nightmare i thought we should wake you her voice was neutral her face blank cheerful in an anonymous sort of way it was her nurse face cheerful comforting telling you nothing the fact that she was naked lying on her side propped up on one elbow so that her body showed in one long line didnt seem to distract from her professionalism i could never pull that off naked no matter what else was happening i was always aware that i didnt have clothes on i dont remember what i was dreaming i said i raised a hand to smooth the wetness along my cheek you taste salty from all the crying she said the bed moved and zane peeked around my other shoulder can i lick the other cheek it made me laugh and that was almost miracle enough to let him do it almost i sat up and instantly regretted it my whole body felt stiff and abused aching as if id been beaten hell id felt better after some of the beatings id taken over the years i hugged the blanket to me partially to cover my nakedness partially because i was cold i leaned against the head of the bed frowning you said nightmare what time is it about five cherry said i could say daymare if you like but either way you were she hesitated whimpering in your sleep i hugged the blanket tighter i dont remember she sat up patting my knee under the blanket are you hungry i shook my head she and zane exchanged one of those looks that say just how worried about you people are it made me angry look im okay they both looked at me i frowned at them ill be okay alright they didnt look convinced i need to get dressed they both just lay there staring at me which means get out and give me some space they exchanged another of those looks which bugged me but at a nod from cherry they both got up off the bed and went for the door and put some clothes on i said if itll make you feel better cherry said it will i said zane gave a little salute your wish is our command that was actually a little too close to the truth but i let it go when they were gone i picked out some clothes some weapons and made it to the bathroom without seeing anyone i wouldnt have put it past cherry to make sure i had a clear shot to the bathroom they were managing me but this morning make that afternoon i didnt care enough to complain i was as quick in the bathroom as i could be and for some reason i didnt like looking in the mirror i was trying not to think and seeing my eyes staring back at me like those of a shock victim made it hard not to think about why i looked so pale so shellshocked i put on my usual black undies and matching bra it was getting to the point where i didnt own a white bra jeanclaudes fault black jogging socks black jeans black polo shirt shoulder rig complete with browning hipower the firestar in its interpants holster in front almost lost against the black shirt i even added the wrist sheaths and the two silver knives i didnt need this much firepower for walking around the house especially with so many shapeshifters running around but i was feeling shaky as if my world was less solid today than yesterday id always thought that richard and i would work something out i wasnt sure what but something now i didnt believe that we werent going to work anything out we werent going to be anything except the bare minimum to each other i wasnt even sure his invitation to be bцlverk was still on the table i hoped so i could lose him as my lover but i couldnt let him send the pack to rack and ruin if he didnt cooperate i wasnt sure how i was going to stop it but that was a problem for another day today my goal was just to survive just to get through the day i huddled my weapons around me like comfort objects if id been alone in the house or if it had just been nathaniel i would have carried sigmund my stuffed toy penguin around with me that was how bad a day it was i did have a moment when i caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror in my bedroom where i stopped and had to smile i looked like i was dressed in casual assassin chic id teased some of my friends who were assassins or bounty hunters about assassin chic but sometimes you gotta go with the stereotypes besides i look great in black the blackonblack look made my skin look almost translucent like it should have glowed my eyes were swimmingly dark i looked almost ethereal like a wingless angel on a bad day alright maybe a fallen angel but the effect was still striking id learned long ago that if youre feeling unloved by the man in your life the best revenge is to look good if id really wanted to follow the strategy completely id have put on makeup but screw that i was still on vacation i didnt wear makeup on vacation there was a crowd in the kitchen the order for everyone to wear clothes had been taken to heart cherry had on cutoff jean shorts and a white mens shirt with the sleeves torn off so that little bits of thread decorated the arm holes shed tied the ends of the shirt so her stomach showed as she moved around the kitchen zanes gaze followed her wherever she moved i wasnt sure how cherry felt about him but zane was beginning to act like a man in love or at least very serious lust he sat at the table wearing the leather pants hed taken off last night ignoring his coffee and watching cherry caleb leaned against the counter in his jeans with the top button unbuttoned so that his bellybutton ring showed he sipped coffee and watched zane watch cherry with an odd look on his face i couldnt decipher it but i didnt like it as if he were trying to think how to cause trouble between them caleb struck me as one of those who liked to cause trouble nathaniel was sitting at the table his long hair in a braid down his back chest bare but i knew without checking that hed have something on he knew me well enough to know i liked my houseguests clothed igor and claudia stood when i came into the room his tattoos were even more striking in the full light of day they graced his arms what i could see of his chest through the white tank top and the sides of his neck like liquid jewels brilliant eyecatching even from a distance they were beautiful against his pale skin i wasnt much into tattoos but i couldnt picture igor without them the look just worked for him hed put on the shoulder rig and it still looked like it should chaff with the tank top but hey it wasnt my skin the glock sat under his arm a black spot on all that pretty color like an imperfection on a picasso claudia looked positively ordinary beside him if a woman that was so damn close to seven feet and muscled better than most men could look ordinary the gun at the small of her back wasnt nearly as noticeable as igors her black hair was still pulled back in a tight ponytail leaving her face clean and empty and that included her eyes claudia had cop eyes or badguy eyes the eyes of someone who doesnt let you see whats inside i didnt meet many women with eyes like that outside of the police if her face had been a little softer shed have been beautiful but there was something in the set of her jaw the way she held that full mouth that said back off no touching it robbed her of something that would have changed everything about her the two of them came to take up posts to either side and a little behind me i would have protested but id discovered last night that it didnt do much good they took orders from rafael not me hed said keep her safe and that was what they were going to do i was too whatever the hell i was to waste energy on telling them to back off they could follow me around if it made them feel better this afternoon i just didnt care merle was standing in the corner of the cabinets near enough to the coffeemaker that igor crowded him while i poured my coffee i didnt know who had made a fresh pot and i didnt care just the sight and smell of it made me feel better merle was wearing the cowboy boots jeans and jean jacket over bare chest that hed had on last night he was sipping coffee out of one of the few plain mugs i owned the scar on his chest was very white ragged pitted in one spot as if that had been the deepest part of the wound it did look like lightning carved into his chest and stomach i wanted to ask what had happened but there was a look to his eyes as he watched the kitchen that said he probably wouldnt tell me and hed definitely see it as intrusive none of my business anyway the only chairs open at the table gave their backs to the bay window and the sliding glass door i hated sitting with my back to a window or a door especially a door nathaniel touched zanes arm he glanced back at me then got up coffee cup and all and went around to the chair that backed the door cherry sat beside him though her chair had been claudias and it was turned so that she had the view of both doors cherry moved the chair closer to zane giving her back to all that glass thered been a time when i wasnt this careful especially at home but today was going to be one of my paranoid days insecurity had that effect on me even emotional insecurity claudia sat beside me igor leaned against the island behind me keeping an eye on merle i think they didnt seem to like each other i took the first sip of coffee hot black and let the warmth fill me for a few seconds before i asked wheres gregory stephen and vivian took him back to their apartment cherry said but hes alright i asked she nodded smiling that smile that made her look years younger than we both were hes healed anita you healed him i called his beast i didnt heal him she shrugged same difference i shook my head no i couldnt heal him last night she frowned and even that was pretty she was buzzed today shining with it i glanced at zane who was still gazing at her maybe it was love for both of them something had certainly put a twinkle in her eye for heavens sake anita you saved him does it really matter how you did it it was my turn to shrug i just dont like the fact that rainas munin seems to be interfering more and more when i try to heal the doorbell rang and i jumped like id been shot nervous who me i ordered takeout nathaniel said i looked at him please tell me its chinese he nodded smiling i think at my pleased expression wed discovered that though no chinese restaurant would ordinarily deliver out this far that for a sizable tip and i mean sizable theyd make an exception for us nathaniel got up but caleb pushed away from the door ill get it i dont seem to be much use for anything else he set his mug on the island and threaded his way between us to vanish into the living room whats his problem today i asked igor answered he tried to get friendly with claudia and me cherry said i looked from cherrys smiling face to claudias frown and hes not bleeding or bruised it wasnt necessary to hurt him claudia said only to be very very clear the tone in her voice and the look in her eyes made my own eyes go cold i dont know if id ever met a woman that had that effect on me it made me feel sexist to say that it was more unnerving because she was a woman but it was still true her nostrils flared and i watched all of them sniff the air everyone moved at once scattering around the room claudia stood grabbed my arm my gun arm and pulled me back towards the far side of the kitchen and the wall she already had her gun out in her right hand i jerked my gun arm free as igor moved with her and they stood in front of me blocking my view igor had his gun out too i was about to ask what the hell was going on when i smelled it the acrid musty scent of snakes i had the browning out and pointed at the door sighted twohanded when the first snake man came through the kitchen doorway with caleb in front of him a sawedoff shotgun pressed into the angle of his jaw anyone moves and he dies everyone froze as if wed all taken a collective breath and held it no one has to die here the snake man said he looked at me with a huge coppercolored eye the strong black stripe that edged the eyes looked like dramatic makeup there were no scars on this ones face he was shorter and seemed younger his scaled face almost managed a smile but the jaw of a snake is just not made for smiling his eyes were as empty and alien as the rest of him our boss just wants to talk to ms blake thats all have him pick up the damn phone and make an appointment i said i was staring down the barrel of the browning at a point near the center of his chest far enough up from calebs head that i wasnt worried about shooting him but close enough to the throat that with the ammo i had in the gun it might pretty much decapitate him if he ever moved the gun barrel out of calebs jaw a sawedoff shotgun with silver shot at touching range and caleb would be gone i didnt much like him but i couldnt let the bad guys blow his head off could i he didnt think youd come the snake man said you go away have him call and i promise to give it the consideration it deserves my voice was quiet because i was stilling my breath as much as i could waiting for that one shot if it ever came the snake man ground the barrel into calebs neck until he forced a small pain sound from him this is silver shot ms blake at this range itll take his head the second after he dies so do you claudia said it her voice as quiet and steady as the arm that held the gun that was pointed at the snake mans head he gave a hissing laugh and it was echoed from behind him more of the things started to move up in the open doorway i caught a flash of silver metal more guns no one else comes through that doorway or ill blow you away and let caleb take his chances he pushed the barrel of the shotgun into calebs jaw until the smaller man had to rise on tiptoe and i saw the first hints of panic on his face i dont think she likes you very much the snake man hissed doesnt matter i said im not letting you bring more guns into this room you promise not to hurt anita it was merle id almost forgotten him standing to one side and behind us we wont harm a hair on her head we can smell that youre lying claudia said the snake head turned to one side birdlike most people cant smell changes in us cant smell anything but the stink of snake cherrys voice anita my eyes flickered to her and i saw movement outside the sliding glass doors they were trying to flank us weve got movement on this side igor said for once other people had guns and they seemed to know what they were doing how refreshing my gaze turned back to the snake man in time to see him motion with the barrel of the gun towards the glass we have the house surrounded there is no need for all of you to die claudia fired a second before i did her bullet hit him in the face mine took him high on the chest low on the neck his head vanished in a welter of blood and thicker things my ears rang with the shots in the small space the snakes body jerked back the shotgun went off as his hand convulsed caleb threw himself to the floor towards us two more snake men came through the door shouldertoshoulder both with shotguns claudia said left i shot the one on the right and she took the one on the left both of us hit what we aimed at and the two fell to the floor one shotgun skidding across the floor towards us another shotgun blast exploded to our left i turned towards the noise i couldnt help it the sliding glass door had shattered and i hadnt heard the sound of falling glass just the shotgun roaring igor was kneeling using the island as cover as he put two shots into the chest of a man the man fell to his knees abruptly like a puppet whose strings had been cut incoming claudia said and i turned back to the other door i could see the barrel of a shiny revolver something nickel plated claudia was standing with her body pressed to the cabinets on the near wall almost hidden from the door she fired twice at that shiny barrel and there was a scream that overrode the ringing in my ears a screaming that went on and on like the squeal of a baby rabbit when a cat gets it dimly i heard someone yell shut up felix shots showered into the room from the side of the inner door that neither claudia nor i could see and still stay hidden someone touched my arm and i whirled smacking into nathaniel with the barrel of the browning he pointed igor was on the floor on his side with the first hint of crimson trickling across the floor i saw zane and cherry under the table hugging the ground i caught a glimpse of merle farther back tucked into the corner of the cabinets probably better hidden than any of us what do you do in a gunfight if you have no gun hide i had a moment of meeting merles eyes before i turned back to the wreckage a man stepped through the broken sliding glass door a pumpaction shotgun in his hands he pumped a round in as he stepped through the door i shot him three times before his knees collapsed from under him he should have had the round pumped in before he stepped through the door claudia was putting bullets into the inner door i dont think she was hitting anything now but she was keeping them from rushing us nothing else moved in the broken door but i stayed crouched gun aimed twohanded at the opening bullets rained down from the inner door and claudia and i hugged the cabinets i kept an eye on the far door but i couldnt keep aimed and take cover at the same time another shotgun blast roared through the room from the little window above the sink it took a big bite out of the island cabinets i was as low to the ground as i could get on my butt pressed to the cabinets but i kept the browning on the sliding glass door the shotgun sent another blast through the little window and the shots from the living room came one after the other not aiming just keeping us where we were i kept my eyes and my gun on the far door they were shooting to cover something and that was the only door left three of them came through the sliding door and everything slowed down i was seeing the world through crystal everything sharp edged i had all the time in the world to see the two snakes and the lion man marco come through in a blur of movement that was so fast i knew that none of them was human i saw the shotguns long and black barrels impossibly long the lion marco had a mil in each hand i had an impression of blond and golden fur before my first bullet took him in the side spun him around claudia fired into one of the snakes dropped him but the other shotgun roared and i felt her stagger above me i put two shots into the mans chest and he collapsed on the kitchen table shotgun falling soundlessly to the floor a bullet hit right next to me and i saw marco aiming from a prone position i brought the browning around to aim at him but i was going to be too late i watched him squeezing off the shot and knew he had me there wasnt time to be scared just a calm thought that he was going to shoot me and i couldnt stop him then a black blur was on his back jerking him backwards as the shot skidded along the floor in front of me a wereleopard in man form threw the man out of the door and vanished after him i kept my eye on the door but nothing moved something dripped on my face warm almost hot claudia slumped down the cabinets to sit legs sprawled out in front of her gun still gripped in her hand but loosely i gave myself a second to see that her right shoulder and arm was a mass of red then i turned back to the sliding glass door i hugged the cabinet beside her if they came through from the living room then i could get some of them if they rushed us from both doors at once it was over i saw movement in the far corner and found merle on his feet with a shotgun in one hand and a snake in the other hed pulled him through the window it was another pump and he pumped a round in the chamber with one hand tearing his fingers through the throat of the snake with the other i saw his mouth move more than heard him and knew the lack of sound wasnt just shock it was too much gunfire in a small room i thought he said ive got this door i eased around claudia and tried to cover the living room having to trust that merle really could handle the other door claudias eyes rolled as i moved around her her mouth moved but i couldnt hear her she began to reach her left hand towards her motionless right as if the right hand couldnt move i kept an eye on the door but felt her painfully slow movements as she transferred the gun to her left hand since i was pressed just above her body i hoped that she practiced lefthanded id hate to get shot by accident when i was so much more likely to get shot on purpose nothing happened for what seemed like forever the silence was utterly still my hearing came back in stages i heard caleb muttering over and over again mother fucking son of a bitch mother fucking son of a bitch he was curled against the far cabinets behind me making as small a target of himself as he could nathaniel actually had igors dropped handgun and was pointing it at the sliding glass door id taught nathaniel the basics of guns i had too many around for him not to know something about them but watching him lean against the island cabinets above igors body the gun held twohanded his left arm steadied against the cabinet edge i knew hed shoot whoever came through that door if he was actually going to start picking up guns during fights i was going to have to take him out to the range with me more of course that presupposed we would all live to do anything else the silence stretched until the wind sighing through the trees outside the broken glass seemed loud a voice came from the direction of the deck its me its micah the voice was a deep growling bass it doesnt sound like micah i called back it sounds like me when im not in human form the voice said i said merle its micah he said come into the doorway slowly i said the black wereleopard eased through the broken doorway claws held in the air the dark shape seemed to fill the doorway in leopardman form he was over six feet broader through the shoulders bulkier all over as if he had muscles in this shape that he didnt have in human form his fur gleamed like ebony sunlight caressed his side bringing out blackonblack rosettes like sable flowers crushed into velvet pale skin showed through at his chest stomach lower in the movies the wolfmen are sexless smooth as a barbie doll in real life they are very much male somehow it was easier to see him naked in halfhuman form and not be the least bit embarrassed i just didnt see the shapeshifters as sex objects once the fur started to flow wheres the guy you threw out the door i asked he got away i dont hear anyone in the living room merle said they all went out the front door zane said or at least the room looks clear he and cherry were still crouched under the kitchen table flat to the ground ill check the living room micah said these bad guys have silver bullets i wouldnt be so cavalier about it i said he nodded and his head was mostly leopard very little left of the man he was except strangely those chartreuse eyes they marked him as alien other in human form but as that furred and muscled body stalked past me those same eyes marked him as micah the color was richer encircled with black fur the eyes were even more striking he hesitated in the doorway then crept through going low making as small a target of himself as he could it was rare to see a lycanthrope that took advantage of cover most of them seemed to see themselves as invulnerable which was usually true but not today igor was very still on the floor and claudias shoulder looked like so much meat she was dumped against the cabinets her left hand still gripped the gun though the hand was motionless on the floor as if she had no use of the arm when i glanced down the gun was pointed somewhere in the direction of the sliding glass doors the hand wavered enough that i was nervous crouching over her but she fought that shaking limb so that she never quite compromised the line of my body the right side of her body was soaked with blood and her eyes were having trouble focusing i think only shear stubbornness was keeping her conscious my gaze flicked to igors still form and the bodies piled in the doorways if igor was breathing i couldnt see it check his pulse nathaniel nathaniel glanced down at the man gave me a second of eye contact then turned back to staring at the broken sliding door id hear his heart if it was still beating hear the blood in his body if it was still moving its not he said all that with his head turned away from me it made it somehow worse more unnerving micah appeared in the far doorway theres no one left alive in here he stepped over the pile of bodies in the door and even that movement was gliding his balance forward on the feet which were somewhere between human and leopard was i really going to be a leopard when the moon came full this month was this dark graceful shape this muscular shadow what i had inside of me i pushed the question away we had other more pressing problems like the wounded id concentrate on the emergencies and try to let everything else go it was one of my specialties i put my fingers against claudias neck trying to check her pulse she shrugged her shoulders moving just enough so i couldnt check it im fine she said voice harsh im fine that was so obviously not true i didnt even argue until i checked the house personally i wouldnt believe we had the allclear but my industrial size firstaid kit was in the pantry and i knew the immediate area was safe cherry crawl out from under the table on this side and get the firstaid kit i stood up and moved around the cabinets so id be able to see both the living room and the sliding glass door not to mention the bay window over the breakfast nook cherry glanced once at zane then crawled out from among the chair legs she stayed low until she got to the pantry closet she had to make caleb move scooting at him gently with her feet he finally unwound from his tight fetal position and crawled about a foot away so cherry could get the kit cherry went to igor first she was a wereleopard her hearing was just as good as nathaniels but she went through all the motions then turned to claudia claudia tried to push her away with her left hand gun still in it claudia let cherry help you i said damn it cherry took that for a yes and started inspecting the shoulder claudia didnt fight her anymore and i was glad shock can make you do and say funny things i didnt really want to arm wrestle the wererat wounded or not of course micah was here and he could probably arm wrestle claudia and win at least while she was wounded i was still keeping a peripheral sense of the open spaces but as the time dragged on quietly there was only the wind in the trees the noise of summer locusts thrumming through the open living room door and the splintered glass of the back door i began to relax by inches that tension in my shoulders that i always get during a fight and never really notice until the adrenaline lets down let me know that i thought we were safe for now then i heard something over the summer silence sirens police sirens wailing getting closer i didnt have any near neighbors you heard gunshots in jefferson county pretty regularly so who the hell reported the gunshots micah turned that strangely rounded face towards me are they coming here i shrugged i dont know for sure but it seems likely we both glanced down at the bodies on the floor then looked at each other we dont have time to hide the bodies he said no we dont i said i looked at everybody merle was still watching the kitchen window the borrowed shotgun in his big hands zane had crawled out from under the table to play nurse for cherry handing her things as she asked for them she had packed claudias arm cherry looked up at me she could partially heal herself if she shapeshifted but shed still need medical attention the police tend to shoot shapeshifters in animal form i said ill stay claudia said teeth gritted just a little the more wounded we have on our side the better the police will like it she had a point i looked at micah the sirens were very near now almost in front of the house you better go micah why the police are about to burst in here see a lot of bodies a lot of blood anything in animal form stands a good chance of getting shot thats not a problem he said the fur began to recede like water pulling back from the shore as human skin was revealed his bones slid out of sight into it like hard things thrown in wax covered melted id never seen anyone change so casually so easily it was almost as if he were merely changing clothes except for the clear fluid that ran down his body like a liquid sheet the sound of bones popping reforming even the sound of flesh boiling over him only his eyes remained the same unchanging like two jewels fixed in the center of the universe then he was suddenly human again body covered in that thick watery fluid id never seen so much of the liquid before from only one change i was standing in a pool of it and hadnt noticed he slumped suddenly trying to catch himself on the cabinet but i was in the way and had to grab him around the waist to keep him from falling to the floor rapid change comes with a price ive never seen anyone change back that quickly cherry said and he wont fall into a comasleep either merle said give him a few minutes and hell be fine messy but fine there was admiration in the big mans voice and something else almost jealousy the sirens wailed to a stop outside the house then silence everybody put the guns down dont want to get shot by accident i said nathaniel did as i asked instantly i had to press micah closer into my body onehanded so i could put my own gun back on the cabinet micahs body shuddered against me i looked at him about to ask if he was alright but the look in his eyes stopped me it wasnt pain i saw in his eyes i slid my other hand around his waist so that i held him more securely against me his skin was slick under my hands he managed to put a hand on the cabinet behind us i stared into his eyes from inches away and there were worlds to drown in in those eyes needs and hopes everything a mans voice yelled police i yelled back dont shoot the bad guys are gone weve got wounded i moved micah so he could prop himself against the cabinet then put my hands on my head and moved carefully into the doorway i had to step over the bodies in the kitchen door to come into the line of sight of the two officers crouched in the doorway if id been a large imposing man they might still have fired not on purpose exactly but you dont see three bodies in a doorway in jefferson county missouri every day but i was small female and looked fairly benign unarmed but i kept talking as i moved anyway things like they attacked us weve got wounded we need an ambulance thank god you guys came when you did the sirens scared them away i kept babbling until i was sure that they werent going to shoot me then the really hard part started how do you explain five bodies in your kitchen some of which even in death didnt look very human beats the hell out of me two hours later i was sitting on my couch talking to zerbrowski he looked as he usually did like hed dressed in a hurry in the dark so that nothing quite matched and hed grabbed the tie with the stain on it instead of the one that he probably meant to wear his wife katie was a neat orderly sort of person and id never figured out why she allowed zerbrowski to leave the house dressed like a walking disaster of course maybe it wasnt a matter of allowing him to do anything maybe it was just one of those battles you just gave up on after a few years caleb sat on the far end of the couch huddled in a blanket wed gotten off the bed the paramedics that had taken claudia away had said he was in shock i was betting that this was the first time hed been on the wrong end of a shotgun only the top of his curls and a thin slit of brown eyes showed above the blanket he looked about ten years old huddled like that i would have offered comfort but zerbrowski wouldnt let me talk to him or anyone else merle stood against the wall at the end of the couch watching everything with unreadable eyes the cops kept giving him little eye flicks as they moved around the room he made most of them uncomfortable for the same reason he made me uncomfortable he wore the potential for violence like an expensive cologne zerbrowski pushed his glasses more firmly on his nose shoved his hands in his pants pockets and looked down at me he was standing i was sitting the looking down part was easy so let me get this straight these guys just burst in here and you dont have the first idea why thats right i said he stared at me i stared back if he thought i was going to break under the pressure of his steely gaze he was wrong it helped that i really didnt have the faintest idea what was going on i sat he stood we stared at each other caleb shuddered on his end of the couch merle watched all the people scurrying back and forth there were a lot of people they moved around the house behind zerbrowski going in and out of the kitchen like huge ambitious ants theres always too many people at a crime scene not gawkers either you always have too many cops around way more than you need but you never know which pair of eyes or hands will find that vital clue frankly i thought more evidence was probably lost with all the traffic than found with the extra help but that was me im just not the social type we stood in our own little well of silence the bedroom door opened behind us i glanced back to see micah come out of the room he was wearing a pair of my sweatpants since they were mens sweats anyway and we were the same height they fit perfectly id never had a boyfriend that i could trade clothes with before you just didnt find that many grown men my size the police hadnt let him shower so his long hair had dried in messy clumps to his shoulders the drying liquid was beginning to flake off in patches his chartreuse eyes flicked towards me but they stayed neutral dolph came right behind him looming over micah the way he loomed over me dolphs eyes werent neutral they were angry hed been angry since he stepped through the door hed separated us all into different rooms nathaniel was being questioned by his friend from the police station detective jessica arnet they were in the guest room upstairs detective perry had questioned caleb and was still questioning zane dolph had done merle and micah zerbrowski hadnt so much questioned me as simply stood there and made sure i didnt talk to any of the others call it a hunch but i was betting dolph planned on questioning me personally we did have five bodies on the ground three of which even in death hadnt changed back to human form the three snake things had stayed snakey shapeshifters always change back to their original form in death always which raised the question if they werent shapeshifters what the hell were they anita dolph said one word but i knew what he meant i got up and went for the bedroom micah brushed his fingertips across my hand as i passed him dolphs eyes tightened and i knew hed noticed he held the door for me and i walked past him into my bedroom i resented them using my house my bedroom to question me but it beat the hell out of going downtown so i kept my complaints to myself dolph had every reason to take us all downtown we had dead bodies and i wasnt even denying i had killed them oh i might have tried to deny it if i thought i could get away with it but i couldnt so i didnt he motioned me to the kitchen chair that had been moved into the bedroom he stayed standing all sixfeeteight of him tell me he said i told him exactly what had happened i told the truth all of it of course i didnt know enough to need to lie theyd carted igors body away all those bright tattoos still vibrant more alive than the rest of him we had one dead and one wounded it was my house it was obviously a case of selfdefense the only difference from the other two times id had to kill people in my house was the number of bodies and that some of them were so nothuman other than that id walked on much more questionable occasions so why was dolph treating this one more seriously i didnt have a clue dolph stared down at me he has a much better steely gaze than zerbrowski but i gave him calm blank eyes i could look innocent this time because i was and you dont know why they wanted to take you actually i had a thought on that one but i didnt share it couldnt they might have come hunting me because i nearly killed their leader one of the problems with withholding evidence from the police is that later you cant always explain yourself without confessing that youve withheld evidence this was one of those moments i hadnt told dolph about the halfmen halfsnakes taking nathaniel and the fight afterwards i could have told him now but but there were too many things that id have had to tell him like that maybe i was going to be a wereleopard dolph hated the monsters i wasnt ready to share that with him i gave him an innocent face and said nope they wanted you pretty damn bad anita to come in here with this kind of firepower i shrugged i guess so the anger filled his eyes thinned his lips to a tight line you are lying to me i widened my eyes would i do that he whirled and slammed his hand into the top of my dresser hard enough that the mirror thudded against the wall the glass shivered and for a second i thought it might shatter it didnt but the door opened and zerbrowski stuck his head in the door everything alright in here dolph glared at him but zerbrowski didnt flinch maybe i should finish questioning anita dolph shook his head get out zerbrowski brave man that he was he looked at me you okay with that anita i nodded but dolph was already yelling get the fuck out zerbrowski gave us both a last look and closed the door saying yell if you need anything the door closed and in the sudden silence i could hear dolphs breathing heavy labored i could smell the sweat on his skin faint not unpleasant but a sure sign that he was in distress what was going on dolph i made his name a question he spoke without turning around i am taking a lot of heat for you anita not on this youre not i said everybody that you took out of this house wont be human the laws may cover shapeshifters as human but i know how it works whats one more dead monster he turned then leaning his big body against the dresser arms crossed i thought that shapeshifters changed back to human form when they died they do i said the snake things didnt no they didnt we looked at each other youre saying they werent shapeshifters no im saying i dont know what the hell they are there are snake men in a lot of different mythologies hindu vaudun they could be something that was never human to begin with you mean like the naga you pulled out of the river two years ago he said the naga was truly immortal these things whatever they are couldnt stand up to silver bullets he closed his eyes for a second and when he looked at me again i saw how tired he was not a physical tiredness but a tiredness of the heart as if hed been carrying some emotional burden around a little too long whats wrong dolph whats got you so riled up he gave a small smile riled up he shook his head and pushed away from the dresser he sat on the edge of the bed and i turned in the chair so i was straddling the back of it and could see him better you asked what woman in my life was sleeping with the undead i shouldnt have said that im sorry he shook his head no i was being a bastard his eyes were fierce again i dont understand how you can let that thing touch you his revulsion was so strong that i could almost feel it against my skin weve had this discussion before youre not my father but i am darrins father i gave him wide eyes your oldest the lawyer i asked he nodded i watched his face tried to catch a clue afraid to say anything afraid id misunderstood him what about darrin hes engaged i watched the terrible seriousness of his face why do i get the idea that congratulations arent in order shes a vampire anita a fucking vampire i blinked at him i didnt know what to say those angry eyes glared at me say something i dont know what you want me to say dolph darrins older than i am hes a big boy he has the right to be with whoever he wants to be with shes a corpse anita she is a walking corpse i nodded yeah he stood pacing the room in long angry strides shes dead anita shes fucking dead and you cant get grandchildren from a corpse i almost laughed at that but my sense of selfpreservation is stronger than that i finally said im sorry dolph i its true that as far as i know female vamps cant carry a baby to term but your youngest paul the engineer hes married dolph shook his head they cant have kids i watched him pace the room back and forth back and forth i didnt know im sorry he sat back down on the bed broad shoulders slumping suddenly no grandchildren anita i didnt know what to say again i couldnt remember dolph ever sharing this much of his personal life with me or anyone for that matter i was both flattered and almost panicked i am not a natural caregiver and i just didnt know what to do if he had been nathaniel or one of the leopards or even one of the wolves id have hugged him petted him but he was dolph and i just wasnt sure he was a petting kind of guy he just sat there staring blindly at the floor his big hands limp in his lap he looked so lost i got up from the chair and went to stand beside him he never moved i touched his shoulder im so sorry dolph he nodded lucille cried herself to sleep after darrin made his little announcement is it the vampire issue or the nograndchildren issue i asked she says shes too young to be a grandmother but he looked up suddenly and what i saw in his eyes was so raw i wanted to look away i had to force myself to meet that pained gaze to hold it and take in everything that he was offering dolph was letting me see further inside him than ever before and i had to honor that i had to look at him let him see that i saw it all if he had been a girlfriend id have hugged him if he had been most any of my male friends id have hugged him but he was dolph and i just wasnt sure he turned his face away and only then when hed given me all the pain in his eyes did i try to hug him he didnt let me do it he stood up moving away from me but id tried and that was the best i could do when he turned back towards me his eyes were blank his face set in that mask he usually wore his cop face if you are holding out on me anita i will bust your ass i nodded my own face falling back into a mask as empty as his the moment of sharing was over and he was uncomfortable with it so wed go back to familiar ground fine with me i hadnt known what to say anyway but id remember he let me see inside id remember though i wasnt sure what good it would do either of us a group of shapeshifters or whatever attacks me in my own home kills one of my guests wounds another and youll bust me what the hell for he shook his head you are holding out on me anita sometimes i think you do it out of habit sometimes just to be a pain in the ass but you dont tell me everything anymore i shrugged again im not saying im holding out anything about today but i tell you what i can dolph when i can how about the new boyfriend with the cat eyes i blinked at him i dont know what you mean micah callahan i saw him touch you he brushed my hand dolph he shook his head it was the way he touched you the way your face softened when he did it it was my turn to look down i didnt look up until i was sure i could keep an empty face im not sure id call micah my boyfriend what would you call him i appreciate you sharing your personal life with me dolph i really do but i dont have to return the favor his eyes hardened what is it with you and the monsters anita us poor humans not good enough for you its none of your business who i date dolph i dont mind the dating but i still dont know how you can stand for them to touch you if its none of your business who i date it sure as hell isnt any of your business who i have sex with you fucking micah callahan he asked i met his angry eyes with my own and said yeah yeah i am he stood trembling in front of me big hands in fists at his side and for just a second i thought he might do something something violent something wed both regret then he turned his back on me get out anita just get out i started to reach out to touch him then let my hand drop i wanted to apologize but that would have made it worse i was uncomfortable with the fact that i had sex with micah and that made me touchy dolph deserved better i did the best i could to make up for it the heart wants what the heart wants dolph you dont plan on making your life complicated it just happens and you dont do it on purpose and you dont do it to hurt the people who love you it just turns out that way sometimes he nodded still turned away from me lucille wants to call you and talk about vampires sometime wants to understand them better id be happy to answer any questions she has he nodded again but wouldnt look at me ill tell her to call ill look for the call we both stood there him still not looking at me the silence stretched between us and it wasnt companionable it was strained i dont have any more questions anita go on out i stopped at the door looked back at him he was still carefully turned away and i wondered if he was crying i might have been able to sniff the air and use my newfound leopard senses to answer the question but i didnt hed turned away so i wouldnt see wouldnt know i respected that i opened the door and closed it quietly behind me leaving him alone with his grief and his anger whether dolph cried or not was his business not mine when the last policeman had wandered away the last emergency vehicle driven off the summer silence settled over the house the kitchen was a messbroken glass ground into the floor blood drying to blackred puddles on the polished wood id never get all the blood out from the crevices in the wood it would be there forever a reminder that superior fire power had prevailed but not without cost i was going to have to call rafael and tell him id gotten his man killed and his woman wounded i had to admit that it had been a damn good thing id had them the two extra guns had made the difference if id been the only one armed things might have gone differently okay i might be dead a noise behind me whirled me around nathaniel stood in the doorway with a broom a dustpan and a small bucket i thought id clean up the glass i nodded my heart in my throat too much to talk i hadnt heard him come up behind me he was only in the doorway not so close but close enough if hed been a bad guy with a gun i had been utterly calm through everything i hadnt fallen apart when the police were here but suddenly i was shaking a faint trembling a nice delayed reaction damn nathaniel set the dustpan and the bucket on the table propped the broom against a chair and walked slowly to me he peered into my face lilac eyes concerned are you alright i started to open my mouth and lie but a small sound came out when my lips parted almost a whimper i closed my mouth tight to hold the sounds in but the shaking got worse if youre too damn stubborn to let yourself cry then your body finds other ways to let it out nathaniel touched my shoulder tentatively as if not sure he was welcome for some reason that made my eyes burn my chest tighten i clutched my arms tight around myself as if by holding tight i could keep the tears squeezed inside he started to move in started to hug me i pulled away because i knew that if he held me id cry id already cried once today that was all i was allowed hell if i cried every time someone tried to kill me id have drowned in my tears by now nathaniel sighed if you found me like this youd hold me make me feel better let me do the same for you my voice came out squeezed tight i fell apart once today once is enough he grabbed my arm almost anyone else id have been watching for it but not nathaniel i thought of him as safe his fingers squeezed my arm not hard enough to hurt but hard enough to let me know he was serious i stopped shaking like a switch had been thrown i was focused not even close to tears he shook me by the arm hard enough to have me glare at him you wouldnt take a hug i knew that this he squeezed the arm a little harder would help let go of me nathaniel now my voice was low and careful purring with anger nathaniel had never laid hands on me before in any way that was close to violent underneath the anger was sadness he was supposed to be safe and now he wasnt he was becoming a person not just a submissive mess and it hadnt occurred to me until just this moment that i might not like everything that nathaniel would grow into i felt movement as if the very air had changed current just before micah stepped through the doorway of the kitchen his hair was still wet from the shower slicked back from his face giving me the first real glimpse id ever had of that face without the curls to distract the eyes his face was as delicate as the rest of him id assumed the long curls only made him seem more delicate but it was bone structure just him if you could ignore the broadening of his shoulders going down into that slender waist the straight line of his hips you might almost say girl he wasnt really anymore feminine looking than jeanclaude but he was more delicately boned slighter it was just easier to pull off being masculine when you were an inch away from six feet than when you were an inch away from fivefeetfive only one thing ruined the delicacy of his face his nose wasnt quite perfectly straight it had been badly broken once upon a time and not healed quite right it should have ruined the nearperfection of his face but it didnt it like his eyes seemed to add to micah make him more interesting not less attractive maybe id just had my fill of perfect men hed added an oversized tshirt to the sweatpants the shirt hit him at midthigh which hid more of his body than it showed but even covered i was aware of him aware of him in a way that i was aware of richard and jeanclaude id always assumed it was love mixed with lust but i didnt know micah well enough to love him either pure lust felt pretty much like love or there was more than one kind of love it was too confusing for me whats wrong he asked nathaniel went back to his broom bucket and dustpan he picked them up and began to sweep the glass up ignoring us nothing whats up he frowned at me youre both upset i shrugged well get over it he closed the distance between us but the movement was too sudden after nathaniels grab and i backed up micah stopped looked at me clearly puzzled what happened you didnt look this spooked when the guns were out i glanced at nathaniel who was kneeling sweeping glass into the dustpan he was studiously avoiding looking at me at us we had a disagreement nathaniel stiffened then his whole body reacting to what id said he turned slowly around until he looked up at me with those flowercolored eyes that wasnt fair anita ive never disagreed with you in anything i sighed not because he was right but because of the hurt in his eyes i went to him balanced on my heels because i didnt dare try to kneel in the glass i touched his bare shoulder the side of his face im sorry nathaniel you just caught me off guard why wont you let me in anita why i know you want to i touched his back where the bite marks had almost healed dim reddish circles i dont let anyone in without a fight nathaniel you should know that by now not everything has to be a fight he said his eyes were very wide glittering for me it does he shook his head closing his eyes and tears trailed down his cheeks i helped him stand because i was still worried about the glass when we were standing i eased my arms around him until my face touched his bare skin my mouth pressed into the hollow of his shoulder where the collarbone spoons inward his arms wrapped around me held me close his skin was so soft so warm i took a deep shaking breath he smelled of vanilla like always i was never sure whether it was soap shampoo cologne or just him but underneath was a ranker scent one that no perfumemaker in the world would bottle something feral and far too real the scent of leopard of pard i felt micah at my back i knew the feel of his body like a line of heat before he pressed himself against me but his arms didnt encircle me they touched nathaniel micahs body spooned against mine as we stood but his hands his arms traced mine holding nathaniel to us embracing him nathaniel let out a trembling breath a deep rumbling sound came out of micahs throat and it took me a second to realize he was purring a deep rhythm of contentment the purr vibrated against my back nathaniel started to cry and i heard myself say were here nathaniel were here were here pressed into the rich vanilla of nathaniels skin micahs purr thrumming against my body the feel of both their bodies so solid so real and i did cry i held nathaniel micah held both of us we cried and it was okay someone cleared their throat loudly from the doorway i blinked through the soft tears and found zane standing there sorry to interrupt but weve got a crowd out here what do you mean micah asked the swan king his swanmanes and pretty much at least one representative from every other wereanimal in the city as far as i can tell nathaniel and micah pulled away from me we all rubbed at our faces even micah had been crying i wasnt sure why maybe he was just an emotional kind of guy what do they want i asked to see you anita why zane shrugged the swan king wont talk to us flunkies he insists that he talk to anita and her nimirraj if she pleases micah and i exchanged glances we both looked as puzzled as i felt tell reece that i need a bit more info before i grant an interview im a little preoccupied zane grinned wide enough to flash his upper and lower cat fangs we deny him entrance to the house until he tells us peons what he wants i like it but he wont i sighed i dont want to start a fight just because he shows up without calling shit i started to walk out but micah caught my hand as i went by i turned back to look at him may your nimirraj accompany you i smiled partly because hed asked rather than assumed and partly because looking at him made me smile i squeezed his hand and his hand closed around mine pressing back what i wanted to say was id love the company what came out was sure he smiled and for the first time it wasnt mixed it was just a smile he raised my hand to his lips and pressed his mouth against my knuckles the gesture reminded me of jeanclaude how was it going to be to have micah and jeanclaude in the same room at the same time with me micah frowned you dont look happy now did i do something wrong i shook my head squeezed his hand and led him towards the living room he pulled me back towards him no you thought of something that bothered you what was it i sighed truth he nodded truth just wondering how awkward its going to be when you and i are in the same room with jeanclaude he pulled on my hand drawing me against him i put a hand up to keep our bodies from touching completely and found his heartbeat under the palm of my hand even through the cotton shirt i could feel the thud of his body as if his heart were naked in my hand i had to raise my head just a little to meet the green gold depths of his eyes his voice came out a little breathy i told you i want to be your nimirraj whatever that means whatever it takes my own voice wasnt doing much better than his even if that means sharing me with someone else i knew that coming in i felt a frown forming between my eyes you know what they say about things that are too good to be true dont you he touched his fingertips to my face and bent towards me speaking softly as he moved am i too good to be true anita he whispered my name against my lips and we kissed gentle soft wet his heart was beating so fast under my hand my pulse was in my throat and i think id forgotten to breathe he drew back first i was breathless and a little disoriented there was a look on his face delight i think with the effect the kiss had had on me it took me two tries to find my voice too good to be true oh yeah definitely he laughed then and i wasnt sure id ever heard him laugh before it was a good sound i cant tell you how much it means to see that look in your eyes what look he smiled and he was suddenly all male pride pleased with himself and something else almost embarrassed he touched my face i love the way you look at me it made me lower my eyes and i blushed even though i wasnt thinking a damn thing that was sexual he laughed again a surprised burst of sound that held so much joy he laughed the way children laugh before they learn to hide how they feel he picked me up around the waist and swung me around the kitchen i would have told him to put me down but i was laughing too hard i hate to interrupt donovan reece the swan king said from the doorway but i told them youd help us he frowned at us his pale pale skin showing almost no lines as if his skin was like the water that his alter form swam upon he had obviously decided not to wait outside i asked still held above the ground in micahs arms help you do what he shrugged nothing important just find some missing alphas and try to convince the kadru of the werecobras that her kashyapa her mate isnt dead just missing with the rest trouble is reece said i think shes right i think hes dead micah let me slide back to the ground i wondered if my face looked as grim as his marianne tells me that the universedeity loves me and wants me to be happy so why is it that every time i get a little happy all hell breaks loose the message seems clear and its not about love donovan reece had curled up on the far end of my white couch he was dressed in blue jeans so faded they were almost white his pale pink shirt brought out the natural pink and blue undertones of his near translucent skin he was beautiful but not in the way a man or woman is beautiful in the way a statue or a painting is beautiful as if he wasnt quite real maybe it was because i knew that he had baby swan feathers on his chest but of all the people in the room he seemed the most surrealistic a tall woman with hair almost as white as his sat on the arm of the couch by him her pants were black leather her loosefitting blouse a pink that matched his shirt almost im not sure i would have remembered the woman if the other two hadnt been kneeling on the floor at their feet the second blonds hair was pale yellow and matched her long summer dress the brunettes hair fell like a curtain around a navy blue dress with tiny white daisies all over it the swanmanes that wed saved from the club were all looking at me with large almost fearful eyes i only recognized one person other than the swan king and his entourage id met christine for the first time at the lunatic cafe back when raina still owned it and marcus her ulfric was still trying to control all the other wereanimals in town and make himself high supreme commander whether everyone else agreed or not christines hair was still blond short professional she was dressed in a navy business suit her powder blue shirt was partially unbuttoned as if shed removed a tie though i dont think she had she was perched on the other end of the couch from donovan her sensible navy pumps still on almost everyone else had gotten casual there were a pile of shoes near my front door hi christine its been a while i said she looked up at me and it wasnt a friendly look im impressed you remembered my name i tend to remember people i meet under stressful situations i got the tiniest smile out of her well we do seem to meet under less than pleasant circumstances she said donovan took over then introducing me to the man and woman sitting between them they were both darkcomplected their bone structure was pure middle america nothing special but their eyes were too big too dark the hair truly black there was something exotic about them that straight european just doesnt give you they also looked amazingly alike like male and female versions of each other they were ethan and olivia macnair respectively the man in my white chair was bulky not muscled or fat just big he had the fullest beard id ever seen the thick hair covered most of his face and neck he was introduced as boone and the moment he turned small dark eyes to me i knew he was something that would eat me if it could not wolf not cat but something with teeth his voice was a rumbling bass so low it almost hurt to hear it ms blake i nodded mr boone he shook his head the dark beard rubbing back and forth over his white shirt just boone no mister boone i said nathaniel zane and cherry were bringing in kitchen chairs so the last four people could sit down two women two men were left one man was slender with golden red hair and strangely uptilted green eyes he sat on the floor huddled against the side of the couch as if he were hiding thats gilbert donovan said gil he said voice almost too soft to hear the woman was tall nearly six feet broadshouldered stronglooking her hair was brown streaked with gray pulled back from her face in a loose ponytail her face was bare of makeup she offered me a hand and gave me one of the best handshakes ive ever had from another woman her brown eyes were deep with worry as she said im janet talbot its good of you to see us all on such short notice i didnt come here to make small talk this from a woman who was standing on the far side of the room near the big picture window she was looking out through the closed sheers hands gripping her elbows nervous tension singing along her straight spine as she turned to face the room i could see where ethan and olivia had gotten the dark skin and their exotic look nilisha macnair was about my size but even more delicately put together so that she seemed smaller a man might think words like birdlike kittenish until he looked in her eyes once you looked into those dark dark eyes you knew better the eyes gave the lie to the packaging she was hell on wheels and used to getting her own way a man stood near her but not too near he was as tall as blond as pale as she was small blackhaired and dark he was also muscled in a way that nature does not do his shoulders were broad waist narrow hands large enough to palm her entire head yet he was clearly afraid of her oh it was bodyguard deferential but there was real fear there too merle was leaning casually near the big blond man i didnt know where caleb was and didnt care i am the kadra and the kashyapa who is dead is my husband nilisha macnair let out a sudden breath that shook then she regained control like a mountain squeezing downward was my husband father is not dead olivia said i wont let you make him dead by giving up her brother ethan touched her arm as if trying to soothe her or tell her to shut up she ignored him but the damage was done the fight was on how dare you how dare you say that i would make him dead i am merely facing the truth olivia stood up shaking off her brothers hand you just cant stand the fact that he was with another woman when it happened the fight went downhill from there apparently henry macnair patriarch of the clan had been leaving his mistress and fellow werecobras house when someone had taken him no body was found but a lot of blood was left behind there had been signs of a struggle a car on its side a goodsized tree torn up when wereanimals struggle they struggle i actually learned quite a bit from the fight but when it was reduced to the two women screaming at each other from less than a foot away some of it not even in english id had enough i looked across the room at donovan he had brought them to my house after all he shrugged basically he didnt know what to do either i had visions of dumping water over their heads but decided that it might just work better to leave the room i motioned the others into the kitchen and they all trooped out it was as the last of them were leaving the room that the shouting began to die down then nilishas voice where are you all going janet talbot spoke for all of us someplace quieter i couldnt see the womens faces but i could almost smell the embarrassment on the air not wereanimal ability just a good guess please olivia said please i do apologize please come back everyone started trickling back into the room nilisha actually took a chair with the blond bodyguard behind her we are all very worried about my husband worried about him mama olivia said the woman nodded smiled yes worried hes not dead the girl said if you can have hope so can i they smiled at each other like bright mirrors so alike in that one moment ethan looked relieved but he didnt smile alright besides henry macnair who else is missing my son andy janet talbot said she handed me a snapshot of a young man with her brown hair cut short but his features were softer than hers he was handsome bordering on pretty he looks like his father she said it as if strangers had remarked on the lack of resemblance before i wouldnt have said a damn thing our ursa boone said i didnt think to bring a picture ursa bear your queen i made it a question he nodded that massive bearded head and i wondered how id missed it she went out to pick up a few things at the store and never came back no signs of a struggle just gone i looked at gil of the green eyes whod you misplace he shook his head no one im just scared i looked at christine how bout you im here as a representative for the weres that only have one or two members those of us who have chosen st louis because there were no others like us im the only weretiger in town so i havent lost anybody but weve lost one werelion i dont suppose the missing lion is named marco christine shook her head no joseph why donovan answered the lion man was named marco oh she said and donovan added joseph isnt able to change that close to human no one i know of can change that close to human and hold it without changing christine continued as if i hadnt spoken focused christine was always focused josephs mate is pregnant amber would be here but shes under complete bed rest until the baby is born until she loses it you mean cherry said i glanced at her you say that like shes lost some before this is her third try cherry said im sorry to hear that losing her mate must not be helping her stress levels that is an understatement christine said shes a fool to keep trying cherry said we cant carry a baby to term and thats that i looked at her again pass that by me again slowly the change is too violent it causes miscarriage cherry said it matter of factly then i watched her understand what shed just said and she whispered anita i didnt you shouldnt have had to find out this way im sorry i shrugged then shook my head but the macnairs have two children im looking at them janet has a son my type of shapeshifting is inherited janet said its not tied to the moon i avoided shapeshifting until after andy was born i looked at nilisha i am a werecobra i can choose to try and carry a baby like a mammal or like a snake you laid eggs i made that one a big question she nodded i couldnt have carried them in my body the change is too hard but i had other options the unspoken but you dont hung on the air it was too hard to think about it wasnt like id ever considered having children i mean get real with my life out loud i said one problem at a time so who disappeared first henry macnair was the first victim and had had the most struggle then the werelion joseph andy talbot weredog as it turned out and last the ursa of the bears rebecca morton the last time wed had this many wereanimals missing it had been the old swan king who was delivering them over to be hunted by illegal thrill seekers i looked at donovan reece he either read my mind or anticipated it interesting coincidence that i come into town about the same time everyone goes missing isnt it gee donovan you read my mind i swear to you that i know nothing of this nilisha said i know all about the betrayal of the last swan king but i am betting my husbands life that donovan is innocent of all this i shrugged well see you do not trust my judgment she said i dont trust much of anyones judgment but mine nothing personal olivia touched her arm mother nilisha took a deep breath and calmed down the day was looking up the first thing im going to suggest is that we call in the police nobody liked that idea look they have resources that i dont computer searches forensics no nilisha said no we must handle this among ourselves i know the rule is that we dont bring in the human authorities but guys we have four missing and they made a run at the swans and the leopards already you think the snake people and their pet lion are behind this donovan asked it would be too big a coincidence if they werent i said i agree micah said hed been very quiet through everything carefully not standing or sitting too close as if he didnt want to confuse things he was letting me be in charge without hovering okay then who are these guys and what the hell would they want with a variety of shapeshifters we talked for a couple of hours but didnt come up with anything brilliant the snakemen were behind it but why why would any wereanimals give a shit about other wereanimals that werent their kind if it had just been the werecobras targeted then maybe it could be a reptile turf war though frankly it was unusual to have a fight even between two different kinds of snakes the town was big enough for everybody as long as they werent the same species i thought nilisha macnair was right and her husband was dead if people kidnap someone and dont want money they want worse things usually things that include blood pain and eventually death they were probably all dead and if they werent we needed the police in on it to keep them alive it turned out that everyone had reported their people missing neglecting to mention the part about being wereanimals but dont you see the police have a twentyoneyearold college senior missing a fortyfiveyearold husband a thirtysomething single woman and a thirtysomething married man other than the fact that theyre all caucasian there is no common denominator to link up these cases but if i can tell the police they are all wereanimals then thats the link you guys live all over the city you have different police units working on each case theyll never make the connection unless we tell them what the connection is janet talbot nodded first andys almost got his premed degree if they find out what he is hell never be a doctor but i want him safe more than i want anything right now so i agree go to the police i cant speak for amber christine said but im pretty sure shed agree i should ask the others first but the hell with it find rebecca for us even if that means bringing in the cops boone said we all turned to nilisha macnair no if they find out we are all ruined olivia took her hand ethan knelt in front of her mother without father what does it matter i wasnt sure shed agree since hed been cheating on her but she nodded and she agreed love is a funny thing sometimes but whatever the motive it meant i could talk to dolph and i wouldnt even have to lie dolph answered on the second ring dolph he never said regional preternatural investigation team or even police just his name not even his last name not even his full first name just dolph or dolph here did anyone ever complain somehow i doubted it he sounded as close to surprised as he ever gets anita i didnt expect to hear from you until wed at least finished the paperwork on the last batch of bodies i heard a mans voice but couldnt tell what was said dolph came back on zerbrowski says that if you killed someone else just hide the body hes not starting over on the paperwork i know enough about procedure to know that hed have to start a new report anyway separate crime separate report right do you really have a fresh body out there he sounded tired but not surprised no i said then how do we rate a call i have information pertaining to several crimes and the permission of those involved to tell you the truth the whole truth now isnt that refreshing i could almost feel him sitting up over the phone im a cop truth is always refreshing so dazzle me i told him as id suspected the macnair case was already on the roster for dolph and the gang but it was the first hed heard of the others i interviewed the wife personally she kept saying she had no idea why some monster would attack her husband it might have helped us find him if wed known dolph they run a restaurant if it gets out that theyre shapeshifters they may lose it board of health cant shut them down for this no but word will get out and the customers will start to worry you know it and i know it no one will find out from my people you have my word on it yeah but how many other departments are involved how many nonpolice are at every crime scene not to mention clerical workers itll come out dolph eventually itll come out ill keep a lid on it anita but i can only guarantee my people i know dolph but andy talbot wants to be a doctor hell never get into med school once this comes out rebecca morton is a chiropractor if they find out what she is theyll yank her license why is it that most of these people go in for professions where this is a problem i shrugged knew he couldnt see it just lucky i guess i think its stubbornness dolph said what do you mean tell anyone that they cant do something and theyll want to do it he had a good point makes sense how do these disappearances tie in to the attack on your house damn the whole truth id said there was my chance to prove it i took a deep breath and told him almost all of the truth i told him that gregory had called for help leaving out why hed call me dolph never questioned that id be a good choice when calling for rescue from the monsters he did say he could have called the police it hasnt been that long since the police killed wereanimals on sight dolph you cant really blame them for being leery of you guys why didnt you tell me all this when you were in for questioning you were mad at me i said as if that explained it and it sort of did though it made me sound childish what are you leaving out he asked i tell you the truth and you still doubt me that really hurts dolph not as much as its going to if i find out you withheld evidence on this its not like you to make threats dolph im tired he said i was quiet for a second you should get some rest dolph yeah if you can keep from killing anyone else maybe ill catch up on the paperwork ill do my best i said you do that i heard him take a deep breath is this all the information youre going to give me on this yep ill go back and interview the families again do you know how much extra work this is going to be just because they fucking lied the first time they didnt mean to make your job hard dolph they were just scared yeah so isnt everyone with that he hung up i stared at the buzzing phone the man was not in a good mood i knew why now and i was probably one of the few outside his family that did know why i wondered how much grouchier he was going to get and if it would start affecting his job if it hadnt already if his hatred of the monsters took away his objectivity then he was going to be useless as the head of the regional preternatural investigation team shit it was a problem for another day i could add it to the list of things id worry about later at the rate the list was growing id never have time to worry about everything on it maybe i could throw a dart and make what it stuck in the problem of the day or maybe i could just ignore the list yeah ignoring sounded good the macnairs plus bodyguard promised to drive straight to rpits headquarters and give statements janet talbot went with them christine didnt really know anything about the werelions disappearance so she just went home promising to be careful i offered to let her stay at my place until the bad guy or guys was caught but she turned me down flat donovan reece said she is an independent creature i could admire that i hope her independence doesnt get her hurt he shrugged getting to his feet i noticed a lump under the front of his pink shirt youre armed i said he glanced down at the place where his gun was trying and failing to hide i wont let my girls be taken again people call them people i said he gave me a smile they are all girls humor me i said he gave a small bow of his head my people fine but i wont let them be taken again or you either donovan remember everyone thats vanished has been a leader not a follower they chained nathaniel up because they thought he was you your people being taken was just incidental he met my eyes suddenly very serious youre right how did you know i was armed if youre going to tuck a gun into the front of your pants wear a darkercolored shirt and maybe one thats a size bigger he nodded ive never carried a gun before do you know how to use it i know how to shoot i just dont usually carry concealed do you have a license to carry he blinked at me i take that as a no no he said then if you use it and kill someone its going to be a headache in court carrying concealed without a license will make it an illegal weapon depending on the judge you might see jail time how long does it take to get a license longer than youll want to wait but check your county and start the process or dont start the process and when you get arrested you can try and claim ignorance of the law its not a legal excuse but it might sway a judge i dont know id apply for a license and hope it goes through what do i have to do to apply it differs from county to county check with your local police theyll know who you have to see he nodded again ill do that he looked at me gray eyes so serious thank you anita i shrugged just doing my job he shook his head this isnt your job youre no ones alpha here you could have just refused to help us and what good would that have done i asked most of the wereanimals wont help each other you know of all the furry and feathered politics thats the one i understand the least just like now what happens to one group can affect the others if you guys had been talking to each other then youd have known that henry macnair went missing violently missing it might have put all of you on guard you think it would have prevented the other disappearances i dont know but it might have helped people would have been more cautious maybe not gone out alone we might have at least had witnesses it was after my girls people got taken and you helped us that christine came to me she knew about the bears ursa having gone missing it was ethan macnair not his mother that told us about his father i bet he paid for going outside his mothers orders i said probably donovan said but youre right if wed just bloody talk to each other we could help each other more not just in emergencies either i said his eyes narrowed you mean a coalition of wereanimals i shrugged i hadnt thought that far ahead but why not something where we share information weve got a lion working with a bunch of snakes why should the bad guys get along better than we do every time one of the animals talks about joining forces they always mean that theyll be top dog you want to be everybodys nimirra anita im not talking sharing authority thatll never work without a war im just saying share information help each other more when one of the leopards or wolves gets hurt he or she has a place to stay until theyre well that kind of thing someone would need to be in charge of it i felt like grabbing him by the front of the shirt and shaking him why donovan why does anyone have to be in charge something happens to one of your swans you pick up the phone and call me or ethan or christine we call someone else we try to help each other we dont need a hierarchy just a willingness to cooperate he looked unhappy almost suspicious you dont want to be in charge i shook my head donovan i dont even want to be in charge of what im in charge of now i sure as hell dont want to add to it it was micah who had been leaning against the wall so still so calm that you forgot he was there who said shes offering you friendship donovan friendship he made it sound like a foreign concept micah nodded pushing away from the wall to stand beside me if something goes wrong and you need help you call your friends donovan frowned hard enough that he formed lines in that flawless skin wereanimals arent even friends with each other let alone across species lines thats not true i said richard i paused after id said his name as if it hurt or i was waiting for it to hurt micah touched my shoulder and i put my hand over his held on i tried again richards best friend is one of rafaels rats my leopard vivian is living with and in love with stephen one of richards wolves thats different why because the wolves and rats have a treaty and through you the leopards and the wolves are joined i shook my head youre quibbling donovan or deliberately missing the point lets just agree to try and help each other thats all i dont have any ulterior motives im just trying to keep the damage to a minimum its true you didnt have to save my girls it nearly cost you your life and you didnt have to go to the lupanar with me but you did thats how it works cooperation he thought for a moment then nodded agreed ill try to get the others to agree also youre right you are right if wed just talk to each other we could prevent a lot of bad things from happening great i said and let out a breath i hadnt realized i was holding i wanted this i wanted them to talk to each other to help each other someone cleared their throat softly it made us all look at gil he was still huddled beside the couch where hed been the entire time you have something to say donovan asked how far does this new spirit of cooperation go he asked his uptilted green eyes were almost round with anxiety he gripped his knees so hard his hands were mottled he was scared you could smell it on him that and a neckruffling scent that i didnt recognize what do you mean donovan asked im actually talking to anita gil said i glanced at micah then back to the man huddled on the floor what do you want to know i asked im the only werefox in town i dont have an alpha or any family he stopped there and licked his lips nervously and i said how much help are you willing to give how much do you need can i stay with you until this thing or whatever is caught i felt my eyes go wide i opened my mouth closed it exchanged a look with micah he shrugged it has to be your call its your house point i turned back to gil i dont know you at all if you are a bad person and you do bad things to my people i will kill you but if you really just want someplace to hide for a few days you can stay he seemed to get smaller more huddled i wont hurt anybody i just want to feel safe again thats all i looked at donovan do you know anything about him hes scared of his own shadow i wouldnt trust him to help in an emergency i think hed save himself first gil didnt argue with donovans estimation of him he just huddled trembling if we only help the strong ones then were not helping ourselves i said youll take him in knowing he cant help you in a fight and would probably run to save his own skin donovan asked i looked at those wide terrorfilled eyes and saw something besides fear a pleading they said please please help me you can stay and well protect you but if there is an emergency i expect you to do your best you dont have to fight but dont be a hindrance whats that mean he asked it means if the guns come out hide under something get low to the ground dont make yourself a target if my people get hurt and you have a chance to drag them to safety but leave them to die instead youll be next im not brave anita im not even a little bit brave dont be brave gil just do what youre told do your best whatever that is but understand the rules keep yourself out of the line of fire because we wont have time to worry about you when the fighting starts help if you can stay out of the way if you cant simple he nodded rubbing his chin between his knees over and over simple he whispered i wish life were simple life isnt simple gil but a fight is i knelt in front of him and i hated the weakness that radiated from him dear god the last thing i needed was another emotional cripple following me around but i couldnt kick him out anita the bleeding heart whod have thought it i stared at him until his frightened eyes met mine a fight is simple gil you protect yourself your people and you kill the bad guys you do whatever it takes to get yourself and your people out alive how do you know who the bad guys are he asked voice almost a whisper anyone in the room that isnt us i said and you kill them just like that i nodded exactly i said i dont think i could kill anyone then hide he did that chinrubbing nod thing again like he was scent marking his own knees i can hide i know how to do that i touched his face very gently he flinched then relaxed a little all the animals liked to be touched im not very good at hiding maybe you can teach me why would you need to know how to hide he asked because theres always someone or something bigger and badder than you are i can teach you how to hide but i dont know if i can learn how to kill where had i heard that before oh i knew richard but even he had learned how in the end youd be surprised what you can learn gil if you have to he hugged himself again i dont think i want to learn how to kill people now that i said is a different problem altogether i dont want to he said i stared down at him then dont but dont let your squeamishness get any of my people killed its more likely to kill me true but thats your choice get yourself killed if you want but dont bring harm to me or mine because of some moral high ground would you really kill me for it i knelt back in front of him you can stay with me and ill keep you safe or die trying but if you fuck up and cause the death of one of my leopards or my friends i will kill you i dont want you to be crying later and saying you didnt understand because if youve earned it i will shoot you while you beg me not to but who decides whether i deserve it he asked i do he stared up at me as if he werent sure if he was safer with me or without me i watched him think it through and felt nothing no pity because gil the werefox was a liability in a combat situation he was a fucking casualty waiting to happen i was civilized enough to give him protection when he asked but not civilized enough to pay in the blood of those i held dear in that moment i knew i wasnt a sociopath because if i had been id have kicked his ass out the door oh hell id have shot him and put him out of everyones misery instead i offered him a hand and pulled him to his feet do you understand the rules i asked i understand he whispered you willing to live by them he gave one small nod you willing to die by them he took a shaky breath then gave another nod i smiled and knew it never reached my eyes then welcome to the club and keep your head down theres some business we have to take care of tonight you can come along even i wasnt sure if that was an invitation or a threat there was still a thread of light in the sky like a slender golden ribbon glowing against the push of dark dark clouds when we parked in the back of the circus of the damned the back parking lot was for employees it was dark bare not the least bit entertaining unlike the front which was like a carnival id driven past the bright lights and dramatic posters without a second glance did the clowns up front have fangs caleb asked it wasnt until he asked that that i realized that none of them had ever been to the circus i undid my seat belt and leaned around so i could see him in the middle section of seats he was sitting pressed against the door with merles broad shoulders crowding him nathaniel was on the other side of merle cherry and zane were in the back seats with gil micah was sitting up front with me until we knew my house wasnt a freefire zone wed keep everybody together rafael had sent two new bodyguards over but theyd arrived just as we were leaving and i wouldnt make anyone in the jeep move they followed us not happy but taking orders which was good i answered calebs question yeah the big spinning clowns on top of the sign have fangs i saw a poster for zombie raisings do you do that merle asked i shook my head i dont believe in using godgiven gifts for entertainment purposes i didnt mean to insult you he said i shrugged sorry im a little touchy about shit like that i dont approve of a lot of things some of my fellow animators do for money you raise the dead for money caleb said i nodded yeah but ive turned down more money than ive taken turned down why he asked i shrugged local money who wanted to have his halloween party in a cemetery so i could raise zombies at midnight or the guy that had offered a million if i could raise marilyn monroe and guarantee that shed do anything he asked for a night i shuddered i told that one if i even heard a rumor that hed gotten someone to do the job id see his ass in prison calebs eyes were a little wide i think id shocked him good to know that i could youre deeply moral merle said a tone in his voice like he was surprised my own version of it yeah you hold to your own rules no matter what merle made it a question i nodded most of the time what will make you break your own moral code harm to my people survival the usual merles eyes flicked to micah sitting beside me it was a small movement if i hadnt been looking directly at him id have missed it what i asked glancing from one to the other merle answered you sound like micah you make that sound like a bad thing i said he shook his head not a bad thing anita not a bad thing at all just unexpected you still dont sound entirely happy about it i said merle worries too much micah said i glanced at him but he was watching the big man micah had tied his hair back while it was still wet so that it lay flat to his head utterly straight until it spilled out into the long ponytail where the curls spilled like froth along his spine his hair lay like brown velvet against the charcoal gray of his shirt what does merle worry about i asked taking care of me mostly and now i think you i looked at the big man is that what youre worrying about something like that merle said hed put a clean white tshirt underneath his jean jacket but other than that he was wearing an identical outfit to the first one id ever seen him in if hed been wearing more leather hed have looked like an aging biker micah turned towards me his shirt made that rich slithery sound that silk makes against leather seats the dark gray shirt was shortsleeved buttonup dressy the color brought out the goldgreen of his eyes made his skin look even darker hed matched the shirt with black jeans black belt silver buckle soft black tieup shoes it occurred to me for the first time that he looked like hed dressed for a date had he dressed to impress me or jeanclaude it was a semiformal occasion for any alpha to meet the master of the city but especially one that was fucking the masters human servant i just wasnt sure how to handle the whole situation jeanclaude had taken micah in stride in theory but how would he react to seeing him in the flesh how would micah react to seeing jeanclaude damn it i had enough to worry about without having to juggle male egos youre frowning again micah said i shook my head its nothing lets get this over with why do you sound less than thrilled i had my door open and turned back around to say were here to rescue damian i dont know what shape hes going to be in why would i be thrilled i know youre worried about your friend but are you sure that thats really whats bothering you i frowned at him what are you talking about im nervous about meeting the master of the city too it was almost like hed read my mind we didnt know each other well enough for him to really read me but he was either telepathic which i didnt believe or he could read me that well i wasnt sure which thought bothered me more i let out a breath and half slumped in the seat yeah im a little nervous about introducing you to jeanclaude he was cool about you in the abstract even knowing that weve been together but seeing you in the flesh i tried to think how to word it i dont know how hell feel about that will it make you feel any better if i promise to behave myself maybe if you can pull it off i can pull it off he said giving me very serious eye contact he certainly vibrated sincerity dont take this wrong micah but ive been disappointed pretty badly recently by the men in my life its a little hard to trust that anyone can pull it off he reached out to touch me then let his hand fall back as if something in my face hadnt been friendly ill do my best tonight anita that i can promise i sighed i believe you but he said i had to smile your intentions are good my intentions are good jeanclaudes intentions are probably good i shrugged you know what they say about good intentions my best is all i can offer he said and its all i can ask but lets say im not exactly sure how to handle this id barely gotten to where i could deal with richard and jeanclaude at the same time and now here you are i just dont know i can go back to your house he said no jeanclaude asked to meet you micah looked at me and that makes you nervous i halflaughed oh yeah why if jeanclaude were having sex with someone else i wouldnt want to meet them micah shrugged do you think he means me harm no i said no nothing like that i tried to put it into words and couldnt maybe it was just my lack of sophistication how do you introduce boyfriend c to boyfriend a after boyfriend a has been such a good sport of late about boyfriend b who is no longer in the picture or maybe it was the way jeanclaude had asked for him bring your nimirraj ma petite i would like to meet him why id asked am i not entitled to meet the other man in your bed it had made me blush but here micah was and here we were outside the circus jeanclaude was inside waiting i was actually more scared about introducing the two of them than i was worried about damian if jeanclaude didnt try and kill micah then id worry about damian i was ninetynine percent sure that jeanclaude wouldnt start a fight it was the last one percent that clenched my gut into a tight knot as we moved out into the darkness the two new bodyguards came up to flank me as i walked towards the back door they were both over six feet male and radiated bodyguard badass other than that they were almost opposites cris no h its short for cristiano was midtwentysomething skin tanned a soft gold eyes a pale shade of gray blue his hair was that shade of pale brown that some people call blond bobby lee was over forty very short hair gone white gray eyebrows still black above startling blue eyes like bits of waterblue sapphires he had a neatly trimmed mustache and beard that were also black with the first streaks of white and gray running through them cris had no accent whatsoever but bobby lees voice was thick as hominy and twice as southern nathaniel tried to stand next to me and cris moved to keep him away hes with me i said we were ordered to keep you safe i dont know him look both of you we dont have time for major introductions here hes one of my wereleopards so are the two blonds micahs the one with the ponytail the two men with him his leopards whos the redhead bobby lee asked gil hes a werefox and hes under my protection too theyre like walking cannon fodder cris said i frowned up at him most of this cannon fodder are friends or more to me if the shit hits the fan and you save me at the expense of their lives you will follow them our orders are to keep you safe maam no one else bobby lee said i shook my head and drew nathaniel into the crook of my arm what would rafael do if you protected him but got his people slaughtered they glanced at each other bobby lee finally spoke it would depend on the situation yeah maybe but im armed and can take care of myself most of the time i need backup not interference we werent told to be backup bobby lee said i know but tonight there may be a certain amount of grandstanding jeanclaude wont let me get hurt but he might play with some of the others even me dont overreact okay youre making it so we cant do our job cris said i shrugged hugging nathaniel to me i appreciate you being here i appreciate the help i might be dead right now if igor and claudia hadnt been with me but there are people who i would risk my life to keep safe and some of them are with me tonight all im saying is keep cool dont overreact dont jump the gun again they looked at each other i sighed bobby lee was wearing a sleeveless jean jacket over his tshirt cris wore a shortsleeved dress shirt and oversized black tank top untucked sloppy over his khaki pants it was too hot to wear a coat but i was wearing a black silk shirt open over a black tank top myself i had my shirt tucked in and the firestar mm in a front draw across the front of all that black most people wouldnt see it black on black but the longsleeved shirt was hiding guns and knives i was betting that bobby lee had at least one gun under his jacket probably at the small of his back because there was no bulge no matter how slight under either arm it was hard to see the bulge under criss left arm hed chosen a shirt with a lot of print on it bright patterns to distract the eye but a hot wind blew his shirt back and i caught a glimpse of his shoulder holster i couldnt be sure what was under the untucked tank top but i was betting at least one more gun in front for a crossdraw just like mine you cannot shoot anyone tonight unless i say so hows that for clear we have our orders bobby lee said and they arent from you then you can go back to rafael and tell him i refused your help criss eyes widened a touch bobby lees expression never changed those pretty blue eyes were as empty as glass no one home why are you so afraid of taking us inside he asked i sighed again and tried to put it into words theyd understand and i was willing to share i couldnt come up with anything so i tried the truth i am about to introduce my nimirraj to the master of the city for the first time you fucking both of them bobby lee asked and the phrase seemed wrong with that scarlett ohara accent i started to protest or bitch but let it go yeah i am and im a little worried about how the introductions going to go you think the master will try and kill your nimirraj cris asked no but he may want to play with him and a vampires idea of fun and games can get a little odd bobby lee laughed odd she says odd he laughed again and it sounded warm and deep and rumbly the laughter filled his eyes made them more real what she is trying to say cris is that we are about to be entertained just like when the rats meet the hyenas a show of force with no danger but maybe a little discomfort yeah what he just said cris nodded so tonight isnt real its real i said but its just not dangerous in any way you can protect me from were supposed to protect you period cris said bobby lee clamped him on the shoulder we cant protect her from her own love life cris were supposed to keep her body intact not her heart oh cris said and he looked suddenly much younger early twenties at best bobby lee turned to me well hang back tonight unless youre in real physical danger im glad we understand each other his eyes went empty again the smile still curving his lips oh we dont understand each other at all maam i can almost guarantee that but well do what were told until we decide not to i didnt exactly like the sound of that but looking into his empty blue eyes i knew it was the best i was going to get the steps leading down into the bowels of the circus are wide enough for three small people to walk abreast but the steps themselves are oddly spaced as if whatever the steps were originally built for wasnt twolegged or at least wasnt human sized we were following ernie down the steps the first time id met him hed had one of those long hair cuts with the sides shaved the sides had grown out and hed cut the rest so he had a fairly standard short haircut with a little more on top so he could gel it into soft spikes sort of executive punk the short hair also left his neck bare so you could see two fang marks on the right side he wasnt feeding jeanclaude i dont think the master of the city fed off humans anymore not when he could have lycanthrope but there were other vampires under the circus and they had to eat too micah walked beside me merle bobby lee and cris had a disagreement about exactly where they were going to walk they finally settled on cris walking with ernie ahead of us and merle and bobby lee walking just behind us everyone else sort of trailed behind including caleb none of the bodyguards seemed to give a shit if the others lived or died i was pretty sure that the bodyguard thing was going to get on my nerves soon like tonight the huge metal door at the end of the stairs was open waiting it was usually kept locked for security purposes my stomach clenched so tight that it hurt i just didnt know how to handle this did i kiss jeanclaude hello did i touch micah in front of him oh hell did you say something micah asked not on purpose i said he looked a question at me and that did it i would behave like i always did i would do exactly what id do if the other one wasnt there to do anything else was going to have us all walking on pins and needles besides id been careful with richard and jeanclaude and look where that ended up i didnt want the same mistakes again maybe we could make new ones there were silver drapes just inside the door that was new ernie parted the drapes and led us into jeanclaudes living room once upon a time it had been black and white drapes and a smaller area but now it was white silver and gold white drapes silk and sheer hung like a hallway that led into something that looked like a huge fairytale tent the stone walls and ceiling that i knew were there were hidden by yards and yards of gold and silver cloth it was like standing in the middle of a jewel box the coffee table had been painted gold and white and made to look antique or maybe it was the real deal a crystal bowl sat in the center of the table with a spill of white carnations and babys breath a huge white couch sat against the far drapes so covered in silver and gold pillows that some of the pillows had fallen to the white carpeted floor two overstuffed chairs were in opposite corners one gold one silver with white pillows on each the fireplace looked real but i knew it wasnt because it had been added later but it was everything a fireplace should have been except it was painted white there was even a new marble mantel that was white with veins of silver and gold ordered to match the only thing that hadnt changed was the portrait above the fireplace the first thing you saw was julianna sitting dressed in silver and white halflaughing brown hair done in careful ringlets asher stood behind her in gold and white his face still perfect his gold hair in ringlets longer than hers his mustache and van dyke beard a blond so dark it was almost brown jeanclaude sat behind julianna the only one of the three not smiling solemn dressed in black and silver hed designed the room around the painting silver and gold and white wow caleb said it for us all id seen jeanclaudes sense of style before but every once in a while hed amaze even me then i felt him coming towards us i felt him coming and that wasnt a good thing id expected anger jealousy but what was moving towards me was simply lust need he could shield better than this was this my punishment to be drowned in his lust if so hed misjudged me because it was just going to piss me off he pushed through white and silver drapes and for a moment i couldnt see where his clothes began and the cloth ended he was wearing a silver frock coat with white edging white buttons his shirt was a spill of white froth the pants what i could see of them were white but the white leather boots covered almost all of his long legs the leather looked soft pettable held in place with small silver buckles going from just above his ankles to his very upper thigh i stared because i couldnt do anything else even if he hadnt been projecting sex inside my head hed have made me think of it his hair fell in loose curls nearly to his waist a black glory on all that silver and white bobby lee said well arent you just pretty as a picture jeanclaude didnt even look at him he looked at me and i was walking towards him across the sosoft carpet without a thought except that i had to touch him he closed his eyes held out his hand no ma petite do not come closer i hesitated for a second then started walking again i could already smell his cologne sweet spicy i wanted to run my hands through his hair wrap the scent of him on my hands he stumbled back halftripping in the drapes there was something like panic on his face ma petite i thought i could shield you from the ardeur but i cannot that did stop me i had to frown at him i couldnt seem to think that kept me where i was almost close enough to touch him but not quite whats happening jeanclaude i have fed this night but i have not fed the ardeur thats what im feeling i said the ardeur oui i am shielding as hard as i can yet you are picking up on it that has never happened before is it because ive got my own ardeur that is all that has changed so yes i believe so youre not going to be in any shape to help with damian are you he sighed and looked down i need to feed all my hungers ma petite i have not had this much difficulty with the ardeur in centuries something about sharing it with you has affected me i did not know until i felt you enter the building that it had changed you mean your control is better farther away from me he nodded what the hell is this ardoowhatever bobby lee asked i glanced back at him when we want to share ill let you know bobby lee raised his eyebrows at that then made a small pushing motion youre the boss maam for now i let that slide and turned back to jeanclaude what do we do nathaniel offered a suggestion feed him i looked back at him and the look must have been enough because he put his hands out empty and went to stand by the fireplace everyone else had taken a seat except for gil who was huddled beside one of the chairs on the floor clutching a pillow i turned to jeanclaude and it was micahs voice that turned me back again ive seen anita in the he changed whatever he was going to say grip of the ardeur and this doesnt look like it shes way too calm jeanclaude looked past me at him seeing him i think for the first time at least in person his gaze traveled up and down his body an assessing look like he was thinking of buying or was trying to be deliberately insulting micah either didnt catch the insult or was proof against it because he started walking towards us he moved in a well of his own power as if even here surrounded by jeanclaudes things he was supremely confident totally at ease he moved like a dancer compact graceful strong the sight of him tightened things low in my body jeanclaude made a small sound i started to turn towards him but it was too late his shields shattered and the ardeur roared over me my skin ran with heat my breath stopped my vision was gone in streamers of color jeanclaudes need marched over me through me inside me it screamed in my head danced down my nerves flowed through my veins in that instant if he had asked anything anything at all i would have said yes my vision cleared and i found jeanclaude on the floor halfcaught in a spill of draperies that hed pulled from their hangers so that he sat in a nest of white and silver his face was almost slack with need his eyes already a spill of blind blue fire i was on my knees too and didnt remember falling micah was there taking my arm i think to help me stand but the moment he touched me the ardeur leaped and he fell to the floor beside me like someone had struck him with a hammer his legs just stopped holding him he whispered oh my god the bodyguards moved in then and i had to scream no there must have been something in my voice because all three of them froze in midmotion no one touches us no one my voice was high frantic there was a very real chance that the ardeur could spread through the whole room one touch at a time we had enough problems without that micah had released my arm his hands nerveless in his lap but the tie had been made and the act of touching or not didnt change it jeanclaude crawled from the bed of glittering cloth slowly every move something graceful and dangerous hed never looked more predatory than he did at that moment jeanclaude i whispered dont but i couldnt move i watched him like a tiny bird fascinated as the serpent glides closer caught between terror and the sheer beauty of him asher was suddenly there in the space between the cloth jeanclaude froze but it wasnt that stillness that the old vampires could fall into there was a thrumming energy to him more like a big cat about to pounce than something cold and reptilian jeanclaude you must control the ardeur better than this he was hugging his arms as if he felt at least a brush of it himself hed noticed the new faces and used a practiced shake of his head to spill his golden hair across the scars only revealing the perfect half jeanclaudes voice came low and harsh i cannot id been afraid now it was sheer terror i looked up at asher and saw him through a film of all the times wed touched him all that beauty all the beauty that i still saw i whispered help us asher was shaking his head if i am dragged in as well it will help no one asher please once he feeds all will be well simply let him feed i shook my head not here not like this micah said if it will help why not let him feed i looked at him and just turning to him made my mouth part my breath catch it was almost like the ardeur remembered him like a succulent food that it wanted to taste again it took two tries to say you dont understand zane said anita doesnt let jeanclaude feed off of her he and cherry were sitting on the far edge of the couch watching with wide eyes not coming near us i thought she was his human servant micah said she is jeanclaude whispered it something in those two words made me look at him made me stare into those glittering blue eyes he couldnt trap me with his gaze anymore because i was his human servant but tonight there was a pull to those eyes i wanted to cradle his face in my hands wanted to taste those halfparted lips anita ashers voice jerked me around made me look at him help me he can feed on me micah said it voice soft we all turned and stared at him he looked a little less sure i think something he saw on our faces made him hesitate but he said it again if a little blood will cure this then im willing he has fed on blood tonight already asher said it is not blood he needs but voir les anges english asher even i didnt understand that one i said he waved his hands as if erasing what hed said he needs release a he said several things in rapid french and i couldnt follow it asher was in great distress if his english had abandoned him i was careful not to look at micah when i tried to explain its the ardeur that jeanclaude needs fed he needs sex not blood nathaniel said his voice was soft but a glance showed him standing as far across the room as he could get i didnt blame him a bit the first time you fed on me it wasnt intercourse just contact he said i nodded still trying not to look at any of the men i remember contact is okay micah said i had to look at him and the surprise was great enough that for just a second i almost fought free of the ardeur i could almost think what kind of contact sexual contact his face was very serious eyes solemn as if he too could think again i said i would do anything to be your nimirraj anita what do i have to do to convince you i mean it what are you offering micah whatever you need he looked past me to jeanclaude whatever you both need i felt jeanclaudes attention sharpen almost like a physical force and the ardeur was back thick enough to drown in my breath froze in my throat my pulse was too fast to swallow jeanclaudes voice came i think in my head because his lips never moved be careful what you offer mon ami my control is poor tonight micah answered as if hed heard jeanclaude too you were a mйnage а trois with the ulfric hes gone im here and im staying i will be anitas nimirraj whatever that means i managed to say who said that we were a mйnage а trois everyone he said i wondered who everyone was because i knew it wasnt everyone jeanclaude was moving forward again painfully slow every movement so full of energy so full of potential violence and grace that it almost hurt to watch it made my pulse race my breath hard to take made my body run moist oh shit oh shit oh shit jeanclaude no but my voice was a whisper his mouth hovered over mine then his face turned for a second to micah i watched the two of them gaze at each other from inches away and felt the power pulsing in the air between jeanclaude moved so slowly to close the distance between them that it was like watching slow motion micah sat there waiting he didnt move in to him but he didnt move away either i thought at first theyd kissed then some trick of the light let me see a thin line of space between their mouths not touching not yet i watched their lips so tremblingly close and part of me wanted them to touch but jeanclaude held his place held his place until micah closed his eyes as if he couldnt stand to meet those glowing orbs like looking away from the sun too brilliant to bear and still jeanclaude did not close that small distance it was the distance of a breath the flick of a tongue and still he held himself almost touching almost there but not quite the tension grew grew grew until i wanted to scream i didnt realize that id moved in towards them until they both turned at once and looked at me from inches away my eyes flicked from one to the other eyes like blue fire eyes like yellowgreen clouds micahs eyes grew more green as i watched until they were pale pale green like spring leaves he focused on me i couldnt explain it but i knew that this was the look he hunted with that sharp focus the pupil nearly lost in the color of his eyes i realized that id pushed the ardeur back i was attracted to both but i could think again feel something besides the burn you practice one kind of metaphysical control and i guess it gives you an edge on all of them the relief made me feel weak as if i could have curled on the floor and slept we werent going to fall on each other like ravening lustmonsters yippee i eased away started to crawl backwards jeanclaudes gaze followed me but he made no move to touch me there was something about the way he stayed on all fours that let me know the ardeur was still riding him but if i could keep from touching him wed be alright he watched me like a starving man who was watching his first meal in days crawl away but he played fair he stayed where he was he let me crawl away he knew the rules micah didnt he reached for me and i threw myself back to the floor in a blur of speed that id never had before but micah wasnt human either he followed me in a movement that was too fast for my eyes to follow so that he was above me before my mind could see that hed moved it was magical he was frozen just above me his body balanced on hands and feet almost like he was doing a pushup i reached out around him trying not to touch him i had time to say no dont then two things happened at once micah dropped his body on top of mine and jeanclaude took my outreached hand maybe he thought i was reaching for him i dont know but the moment we touched the heat ran over us through us and there was nothing but the need we kissed and it was like melting from the mouth down my hands slid over the silk of micahs shirt and it wasnt enough i ripped at it tore it from his body until my hands spilled over the solid smoothness of his chest his skin like warm satin under my fingers micah was suddenly grinding me into the floor so heavy i opened my eyes and found jeanclaude above us over micah pressing us both into the floor i had a moment of meeting his eyes a moment to see the rage in that blind blue fire then his arms were around micah and he was jerking the smaller man backwards i sat up watching them roll across the floor fighting anger frustration and just sheer tiredness welled up inside me until there was no room for the ardeur i was tired of fighting so tired of it i smelled blood like a hot spike through the center of my body the smell was almost sexual that was enough i drew the browning and sighted around the room for a split second i had the two of them at the end of the barrel for a split second it occurred to me then i moved the gun around the room registering for the first time that there was no one left in the room but us good to know we didnt have an audience i pointed the gun at the overstuffed white couch and fired one of the small gold and silver pillows jumped upward with the impact the noise was thunderous in the stone room as if the heavy drapes caught the sound held it around us they froze micahs hands were claws shredding across jeanclaudes back because that was all he could reach jeanclaudes face was buried in micahs neck his body wrapped around him so that everything vital was hidden while he tried to tear micahs throat out i sighted on them stop it stop it both of you or the next one goes in one of you i swear by god that i will shoot you jeanclaude raised up blood in a crimson wash across his mouth chin down his neck there was so much blood it made me afraid to look at micahs neck micahs claws stayed in jeanclaudes back i could see the tension as if every muscle were poised to drive the claws farther in the nimirraj holds me in place ma petite i cannot move micah let him up micah didnt move and i guess i couldnt blame him but i aimed the gun at his head because that was the only clear shot i had i had a small spurt of panic that i might have to pull the trigger then a calmness welled over me and i stood in that well of silence that buzzing white noise that i went to when i killed there was no feeling here there was almost nothing here i will kill you micah my voice sounded as empty as i felt micah turned his head slowly to look at me blood flowed from the left side of his neck down his shoulder his chest he was drenched in his own blood i could see more of it welling up sliding down but not constant the blood pumped out with his pulse shit let him up micah hes pierced your carotid i lowered the gun and started to close the distance between them micah looked up at the vampire still poised with his claws in jeanclaudes flesh if i die i want him to go with me it should be simple enough for a nimirraj of your power to heal such a small wound jeanclaude said still pressed around the other mans body intimate micah withdrew the claws from jeanclaudes back jeanclaude moved enough to prop himself up on his hands i saw micah tense a second before his arm swung in that unbelievable speed so fast so fast jeanclaudes throat hadnt even started to bleed when micahs hand was back at his side then blood spilled in a fountain from jeanclaudes throat heal that micah said i was left standing there watching them both bleed to death mother fucking son of a bitch jeanclaude half fell half moved off of micah blood sprayed in a red rain as he knelt on all fours coughing as if he were trying to clear his throat it made the blood pump faster i screamed at first wordless then i thought of something better i screamed asher micah was already rolling in black fur bones sliding in and out muscles rolling in glimpses of pinkish flesh hed shapeshift and heal himself but jeanclaude couldnt shapeshift i grabbed jeanclaudes arm and the moment i touched him the marks flared between us i was choking on my own blood drowning in it strong hands were digging into my arms fingers like cold stone i blinked and found jeanclaudes face glowing like carved alabaster with white light inside it his skin glowed behind the coating of blood on his lower face like rubies spread across diamonds his eyes were pools of molten sapphire flame if fire could be cold achingly cold a wind sprang from his body from our bodies and it was the cold of the grave that danced around us fluttered our hair around our faces we reached that cold power out out to find richard and as before the answer came against our skin jason was kneeling beside us i didnt have time to marvel that he was healed he touched us and the mark that was richard flared through his body a warmth to dance with our coldness and i knew micah was kneeling behind me furred and clawed i felt him at my back the way i felt jason as if he were tied to us micah fell back screaming nooo the tie was cut and for a second i swayed as if part of my support was gone then nathaniel was there and the world was solid again we knelt bound by flesh magic and blood i watched the flesh in jeanclaudes throat reknit reform remake reshape itself until the flesh was perfect and white surrounded by a coating of wet blood hed healed so fast that the blood hadnt had time to dry i smelled roses not the faint perfume of potpourri but thick meltonyourtongue oldfashioned garden roses as if i were drowning in the cloying sweetness of them it was like being dipped in honey that you knew had poison in it honey honey brown eyes i remembered the pale honey brown of belle mortes eyes do you smell the roses i asked jeanclaude turned drowning blue eyes to me roses i smell nothing but the scent of your perfume and skin he scented the air and blood nathaniel and jason were lost in the wonder of the power rush but no one smelled roses but me once upon a time id smelled perfume when a certain master vampire had been using her magic my friend and fellow animator larry kirkland had smelled the perfume too but no one else around us had been able to scent it i looked into jeanclaudes eyes not with my sight but with my magic and found something something that wasnt him it was subtle what shed done with me earlier had been like a sledgehammer between the eyes this was a stiletto in the dark i found the thread of her power coiled in him and the moment my magic my necromancy hit it the power uncoiled opened and it was like a window thrown wide i saw her sitting in her room by fire and candlelight as if electricity hadnt been invented she was dressed in a white lace dressing gown all that black hair falling around her and a bowl of pink roses next to her pale hand she turned those huge pale brown eyes to me and i saw the surprise on her face the shock she saw me kneeling with the men as i saw her before her dressing table with her roses i cut her off cast her out of jeanclaude as id cast her out of me earlier it was easier because she hadnt tried to possess him only to tamper with him to be that dark voice in his ear that pushed him a little over the edge jeanclaude slumped suddenly as if dizzy he raised eyes to me that were as normal as they ever got his usual midnight blue there was fear on his face no hiding it i thought i saw belle sitting before her mirror i nodded you did he looked at me and i think that only all our hands on him kept him from falling to the floor she weakened my control of the ardeur and your control of your temper i said what has happened asher asked i looked up to find that everyone was back in the room any of this blood yours maam bobby lee asked i shook my head not a scratch on me then i guess we wont get blacklisted from the bodyguard union for leaving you alone with a shapeshifter and a vampire so they could fight over you he was shaking his head the next time you ask us to leave you alone because its your love life we arent going to listen to you i shook my head again well talk about it later no maam he said we wont i let the argument go there was always time to fight later besides he was too close to right if id gotten between them at the wrong moment who knew what accident might have happened jeanclaude spoke softly voice urgent to asher they were speaking french and i still didnt know enough to catch more than a word here and there i heard belle clearly several times in english asher said do you remember marcel oui he went mad one night and slew his entire household including his human servant asher said which is what killed him the two vampires stared at each other no one ever understood what had caused it jeanclaude said so fortuitous asher said only two nights before he would have fought belle for her council seat jeanclaude took ashers offered hand and let him help him to his feet asher had to steady jeanclaude with a hand on his elbow so fortuitous that many tried to prove she had poisoned him or some such asher said jeanclaude nodded passing a hand over his face as if he were still dizzy i felt nothing as if my necromancy protected me from whatever belle had done to him the council themselves tried to prove her at fault and failed jeanclaude said did they hire a witch to look into the magic angle i asked i stood on my own just fine nathaniel and jason got to their feet again with no illeffects except for jasons stupid grin which he often wore after a power rush the vampires looked at me non asher said no one thought of it why the hell not because ma petite she should not be able to do what she did to a master of the city even one of her own bloodline that she could do this to a master of the city that was not her bloodline would be unthinkable impossible asher added i think its like real possible i said i caught her in the act whos belle micah asked in his growling leopard voice i turned to him slowly and something must have shown on my face because merle moved in front of him and suddenly the two wererats were alert starting to move up beside me i dont know what i was about to say probably something really angry because micah beat me to it he pierced my jugular vein anita im allowed to defend myself when someone tries to eat my throat out remember im his human servant he dies so might i he stalked around merle gliding on bent legs and kittycat feet so im just supposed to let him kill me no i said no but your wound wasnt lifethreatening you proved that already theres not a scratch on you now i healed it yes but not every shapeshifter could have healed it a vampire wound is a lot like silver it can kill and most of us heal from those wounds like we were human he was standing very close to me those greengold eyes sparkling with anger he meant to kill me anita dont think he didnt he is right ma petite if he had not held me off more i would have torn his throat out i turned back to jeanclaude what are you saying i saw him on top of you and i was drowning in jealousy i meant him harm ma petite he defended himself he didnt have to do that last blow the fight had stopped jeanclaude looked past me at micah and there was something on his face respect i think if he had done to me what i did to him then i would have had no choice but to make my point he seemed to consider several words and settled for strongly strongly he damn near slit your throat after i had tried to do the same to him i was shaking my head no no i dont what ma petite are you truly saying that if someone had torn your throat out tried for your life that you wouldnt have shot them i opened my mouth to argue closed it tried again and stopped i looked at him then back at micah then back to jeanclaude well damn the nimirraj has made his point ma petite he is willing to be accommodating up to a point beyond that point there is no compromise micah nodded and the movement looked awkward in his furred body yes you have the same rule ma petite as do i the three of us merely have different places where the line is drawn but the line is there for all of us how can you both be so reasonable about this you both nearly just killed each other they looked at each other around me again and there was something in that look it was something masculine and arcane as if the fact that i was a girl meant i wouldnt get it and they couldnt explain it to me which did explain it to me oh great great you guys nearly kill each other and that makes you buddies jeanclaude gave that wonderful gallic shrug his face still covered in micahs blood let us say we have an understanding micah agreed jesus only men could get a friendship out of something like this you are friends with monsieur edward did you not both begin by trying to kill each other jeanclaude asked thats different i said how i tried to argue but stopped because i would have looked silly fine fine so what the two of you kiss and make up they looked at each other and again there was weight to the gaze but it was a different weight shit i said i think we begin by apologizing jeanclaude said i am truly sorry for my lack of control me too micah said then added and im sorry that i had to try and kill you it was interesting phrasing not im sorry i nearly killed you but sorry i had to try and kill you i was seeing micahs ruthless streak it wasnt really any bigger than my own but it bothered me anyway wasnt sure why but it did i didnt know what to do so i decided to move on we had other business are you well enough to help get damian out of his coffin i have used up all my reserves ma petite i will need to feed again he raised a hand but not the ardeur merely blood merely he says i offered to let you feed on me earlier the offer still stands micah said no micah merle said micah touched the taller mans arm its alright are you not afraid i will try and tear your throat out again i would listen to your bodyguard you said we had an understanding that is true they were watching each other and i could almost feel the testosterone rise micah smiled or tried to in the halfleopard form it was a snarl of white fangs in black fur besides the next time you bite me like that it better be foreplay or i will kill you if it pleases you my pleasure jeanclaude said he laughed then that touchable sound that caressed my skin made me shiver micah reacted to it eyes wide hed never heard jeanclaudes laugh before if he thought the laugh was something special well the best truly was yet to come i thank you for your most generous offer jeanclaude said but i prefer my food without fur no problem micah said micah released merles arm and did that magically quick change his tanned skin seemed to absorb the fur like rocks sinking into water he stood naked and perfect no mark of the fight on that smooth skin neither his clothing nor the tie in his hair had survived the change but strangely the hair fell straight around his face as if it were affected by the fact that hed pulled it back tight while it was still wet the hair was still thick but it framed his face better was less overwhelming so that you could still see the delicate bone structure those wondrous eyes i heard someone catch their breath and it wasnt me i dont think it was jeanclaude but i wasnt sure didnt matter didnt want to know you are not even dizzy are you jeanclaude asked micah shook his head jeanclaude raised his eyebrows lowered his eyes fought to control his face until he could give a perfect blank expression but it took him a few seconds i will clean this he made a vague motion at his goresoaked clothes before taking such a bounty if that is alright micah gave a small nod you are not taking a bath i said i will be quick ma petite you have never taken a quick bath in your entire life asher laughed then tried to smother it but was only partially successful he spread his hands mon cheri she is right would i touch that for the first time covered in this ashers face sobered instantly like someone had thrown a switch he turned that serious blank face to stare at micah who stared back if he was uncomfortable under the scrutiny it didnt show asher sighed i suppose not and what are we supposed to do for the hour that it takes you to soak in the tub i asked i will be quick ma petite my word on it i crossed my arms over my stomach ill believe it when i see it ma petite i have given my word on important stuff your word is great but when it comes to primping you have no sense of time i thought that was the mans line bobby lee said i glanced at him then back to the vampire couldnt prove it by me bobby lee laughed but no one else did i sat on the white couch with its brandnew bullet hole micah sat down beside me and since he was naked that was interesting uncomfortable and sort of titillating all at the same time he kept insisting on trying to talk to me and i found it hard to keep eye contact and that was embarrassing bobby lee and cris stayed near me hovering behind and to one side because i made them move from right behind me i just dont like armed people at my back not unless i know them really well the wererats were there to protect me i believed theyd do the job because rafael told them to but i still didnt want them standing armed at my back merle lounged near the fireplace keeping an eye on micah and the other bodyguards gil was actually hiding in the corner or nearly not a stable guy the others milled around the room except for asher he sat in the chair opposite the couch and watched us he had shaken that glorious hair over his face so that only the perfect side was visible and only one pale blue eye looked at us his face showed nothing but i could still feel the weight of his gaze like a hand pushing his face may have shown nothing but he was giving us way too much attention i might have asked why but jeanclaude walked back through the gap in the drapes i had to check my watch only twenty minutes had passed id dated him off and on for nearly three years a twentyminute cleanup was nothing short of miraculous of course his black hair was still wet and heavy he hadnt taken time to blowdry it he was wearing one of my favorite robes the black one with the black furred edging the fur outlined a wonderful expanse of pale perfect chest the robe was open enough that the crossshaped burn scar showed and as he glided into the room you caught glimpses of his upper stomach through the fur the robe was very loosely tied not at all the way he usually wore it he had that smile on his face that said he knew he looked wonderful and he knew just what effect he had on me then his gaze slid to micah i was close enough to see micahs pulse speed up jumping under the skin of his neck he tried to meet jeanclaudes eyes but finally had to look down and he blushed his reaction made my pulse speed up i looked back at jeanclaude gliding towards us catching a glimpse of his pale feet under the black robe against the white carpet the look on his face was all for micah it made me go up on one knee my butt against the arm of the couch i felt oddly possessive almost jealous as if i should be defending micahs honor id never felt like this with richard and jeanclaude but then jeanclaude had never looked at richard in quite that way because richard would have hurt him micah had nearly killed jeanclaude over an insult that richard would not have fought back over yet here he sat blushing uncomfortable but not angry jeanclaude was standing in front of us so close that the furred hem of the robe brushed micahs bare leg have you changed your mind mon minet micah shook his head then raised his face up to look at the vampire there was both vulnerability and warning in that look i havent changed my mind bon jeanclaude went to his knees in front of him you are powerful in your own right and you are not my animal to call i may not be able to cloud your mind and make this tasting a pleasure you may be able to keep me out of your mind micah nodded thick hair falling around his face i understand do you have a preference on where the blood is taken from the neck hurts less micah said jeanclaude raised an eyebrow youve done this before micah gave a smile that managed not to be happy ive done a lot of things before jeanclaude raised both eyebrows at that and looked at me i shrugged very well mon minet he stood in one graceful movement swinging the robe around him like a dress giving the slightest glimpse of bare legs as he stalked behind the couch he stopped just behind micah putting a hand on either of his shoulders he didnt caress or squeeze just rested his hands on that smooth warm flesh for a moment get on with it merle said micah turned his head to look at the other wereleopard merle one word but it made the big man lean back harder on the fireplace arms crossed over his chest face sullen a very unhappy bodyguard but he did what he was told jeanclaude slid one arm around the front of micahs shoulders across his very upper chest he used his free hand to smooth micahs hair back exposing the side of his face and the long clean line of his throat micah moved his head a little to the side giving jeanclaude a better angle the small movement was like a woman coming to her tiptoes for a kiss a helpful movement maybe we could have a little privacy i said and it made both men look at me as you like ma petite everyone left except merle bobby lee and asher they were the minimum that might be needed to keep us from killing each other after what had just happened i really couldnt work up a good argument for leaving us completely alone when everyone had settled down jeanclaude turned back to micah jeanclaudes fingers stroked micahs hair so that it fell behind his ear exposing the entire side of his face the shape of his ear he pressed the back of micahs head gently against his chest drawing the exposed neck in an even longer line micah was utterly passive eyes closed face peaceful only the pulse in his neck beating like a trapped thing gave lie to all that calmness jeanclaude bent over him mouth open lips going back but even this close i got only the barest glimpse of teeth he bit down sharp sudden micah gasped breath catching in his throat jeanclaudes grip tightened at micahs head his shoulders pressing him in against his body i could see the muscles in jeanclaudes jaws working his throat swallowing convulsively one of them was making small noises low in his throat and i wasnt sure who it was jeanclaude reared back bringing micah with him drawing him half over the couch micah cried out his hands going to jeanclaudes arm holding on as the vampire rocked his body backwards jeanclaude moved his hand from micahs face to his waist as if he knew the other man wouldnt move away now he held micah arms across his chest and waist micahs hands on jeanclaudes arm he stretched micahs body backwards as hed lengthened the mans neck earlier so that micahs body showed in a long clean line back curved against jeanclaudes body so that both of them were bowed backwards i was left kneeling on the couch staring up the line of micahs nude body seeing without doubt that what was happening was making his body happy his face was slack with need pleasure his hands convulsed over jeanclaudes arm and he halfscreamed halfshouted god jeanclaudes body began to straighten up slowly he eased micah back over the couch he raised his mouth from micahs neck his eyes were drowning blue sightless inhuman his lips were full red but not with spilled blood red like someone whos been kissing too much he released micah slowly letting his body slide against the back of the couch until the wereleopard halfcollapsed on his side his head spilled into my lap and i jumped micah raised his head slowly heavy he propped himself up on one arm and turned unfocused eyes to me his pupils were enormous drowning black in the circle of his greenyellow eyes i watched his pupils spiral downward to small dots so that the color almost overwhelmed them like a vampires eyes i could feel him staring at me the weight of his gaze like something pushing against me he leaned in towards me slowly lips halfparted i stayed where i was frozen unsure what to do it wasnt that he was any less lovely than he had been it was just oh hell i didnt know what to do i didnt even know what i wanted to do didnt you need to get damian out of his coffin ashers voice came dry making me draw back from micah jeanclaude snarled at him looking more inhuman than the entire time he was feeding asher stood in one smooth motion like a puppet pulled up by strings fine but if you are going to have sex then i dont have to watch i stood micahs hands sliding down my body as i moved away from the couch i faced asher look i am so far over my comfort zone right now that i cant think but ill tell you one thing i am not going to salve your male ego while the little voice in my brain is still screaming run away run away so put the attitude on ice asher i cant deal with it right now he was suddenly vibrating with anger his eyes like icy blue pools so sorry that my discomfort annoys you fuck you asher he was suddenly moving forward in a blur of speed i backed up so fast that i fell against the couch micah caught me or id have fallen to the floor i had time to draw a gun or a knife but i didnt even try asher wasnt trying to hurt my body just my feelings he bent at the waist looming over me and micah though i think that part was accidental he put a hand on either side of us and leaned into my face so close that i had to pull back to focus on those chilling blue eyes dont offer things youre not willing to do ma cherie because that is annoying he stood up abruptly and stalked from the room micahs voice was soft what was all that about his hands were still on my arms halfholding me protective i shook my head ask jeanclaude i pushed to my feet im going to go get damian i will accompany you ma petite fine i started walking i could feel them following me feel them both behind me i almost turned around to see if they were holding hands but if they were i wasnt ready to see it bobby lee trailed behind without a word smart man the room was bare stone walls there was no pretense of comfort it was the vampires version of prison and it looked like one there were half a dozen coffins sitting on bare raised platforms with silver chains around them waiting to be raised and locked in place with crosses the only crosses in the room were on the two closed coffins two two chained coffins damian was in one who the hell was in the other which one is your boy bobby lee asked i shook my head dont know i thought you were supposed to be this boys master thats the theory then shouldnt you be able to tell which box is which i glanced at him gave a small nod point i looked back at the door but it was still empty just us i didnt know where everyone had gone to and i was so trying not to speculate on what might have distracted micah and jeanclaude i tried to concentrate on who was in the coffins but i couldnt once upon a time i could sense damian even before he woke in his coffin but i got nothing from either coffin except that there were vampires in them i went to the closest coffin the wood was pale and smooth not the most expensive but not cheap either heavy well made i passed my hands across the smooth wood fingers caressing the coolness of the chains something banged against the lid of the coffin i jumped bobby lee laughed i frowned at him then turned back to the coffin but i wasnt touching it anymore i knew it wasnt possible with a blessed cross attached to the lid but id had this sudden image of an arm tearing through the wood and grabbing me damian was supposed to be homicidally crazy better cautious than dead i put my hands just above the coffin not quite touching i drew my necromancy like drawing a breath and breathed it out through my body not exactly through my hands but everywhere the necromancy was part of what i was not just who i was i started to push my power into the coffin but it was pulled in like water pouring into a hole the water falls down because gravity pulls it down and there is no stopping it its natural automatic my necromancy spilled into that coffin and into damian i felt him lying in the dark his body pressed against the thin satin i saw his eyes stare up into mine felt something flare inside him something that recognized my power but i couldnt feel him there was no personality there no damian i knew it was him but there was no thought in him nothing but that tiny spark of recognition and barely that i tried to reconcile the thing i felt to what i knew damian had been and it was like he had become something else i said a quick prayer and i didnt even feel odd praying to god about a vampire id had to give up my narrow ideas of god a long time ago or give up church and everything i held dear about my religion the deal was if god was okay with what i was doing then i had to be too where is everybody i asked it aloud so bobby lee answered i dont know but if you come with me well go look i shook my head staring at the other coffin who was in there locked in the dark i had to know and if i could id get them out i didnt approve of torture and being locked in a coffin where you would never starve to death but always go hungry never die of thirst but burn with the need for liquid be trapped in a space so small you couldnt even turn onto your side were all good definitions of torture in my book i liked most of jeanclaudes vamps and i wouldnt leave them like this not if i could persuade him that theyd been punished enough i was pretty stubborn about things like that and jeanclaude was wanting to please me right now i could probably get whoever it was out id do my best but who was it admittedly there were vampires that id make more of an effort to save just like people i went to stand beside the other coffin and pushed my magic into it i had to push this time it wasnt like damian whatever was in this box didnt welcome me in it wasnt anyone i had a connection with i felt something and i knew it was a kind of undead but it didnt feel like a vampire it felt emptier than that it was fully dark outside there should have been movement life of a sort but there was nothing i pushed farther into the thing and found the faintest answering pulse it was as if whatever was in there was a lot more dead than alive yet not truly dead a sound turned me towards the door jeanclaude glided into the room his robe tied tight now like a signal that he was ready to get down to business he was alone wheres micah i asked jason has taken him to get some clothing they should be able to find something that will fit him who is in this coffin id almost said what but i was betting it was a vampire just not like one id ever sensed before his face was already careful neutral i would think ma petite that you have enough to be concerned over with damian you know and i know that i am not moving until i know whos in here he sighed yes i know he actually looked down at the floor as if he were tired and because his face showed nothing the gesture looked halffinished like bad acting but i knew that for him to be working so hard at keeping anything off his face only to let his body betray him meant he was very unhappy which meant that i was really not going to like the answer who jeanclaude gretchen he said finally meeting my eyes his face told me nothing the one word empty once upon a time gretchen had tried to kill me because she wanted jeanclaude for herself when did she get back in town back he gave it that little lilt that made it a question dont be coy jeanclaude she came back to town still out for my blood and you put her in here so when his face became like a sculpture except with less movement in it he was hiding as much of himself as he could and the shields were like armor i say again ma petite she had gone nowhere whats that supposed to mean he looked at me with that perfect face so unreadable it means that from the moment you watched me put her in the coffin in my office at guilty pleasures she has always been here i blinked frowned opened my mouth closed it tried again failed i must have looked like a landed fish because i couldnt think of a damn thing to say he just stood there not helping i found my voice and it was breathy youre saying that gretchen has been in a coffin for two no three years he just looked at me hed stopped breathing there was no sense of movement to him at all as if if i looked away id never find him again hed be invisible answer me damn it has she been in a coffin for three years he gave the smallest of nods jesus jesus i paced the room because if i didnt do something physical i was going to hit him or start screaming i finally ended up standing in front of him hands in fists at my sides you bastard my voice was a hoarse whisper squeezed out of my throat because to do anything else would have had me ranting at him she tried to kill my human servant who i also loved most masters would have simply killed her that would have been better than this i said voice still a hissing whisper i doubt gretchen would agree lets open the coffin and see i said he shook his head not tonight ma petite i knew you would feel this way and we can try and release her though i have poor hope for it whats that supposed to mean she was not the most stable of women when she went in this will not have strengthened her grasp of reality how could you have done this to her i told you before ma petite she earned her punishment not three years i said my voice was beginning to sound normal again i wasnt going to hit him great three years for nearly killing you i could leave her in for three more years and it would not be punishment enough im not going to argue whether the punishment was justified or excessive or anything all i can say is that i want her out of there i wont let her stay in there another night theres barely anything left now he glanced at the coffin you have not opened it how do you know what is inside i wanted to know how damian was i used a little magic to explore what was inside both coffins and what did you discover he asked that my necromancy recognizes damian that damian isnt there its like his personality is missing whatever made him him is missing jeanclaude nodded with the vampires that are not master strength and never will be it is often the master of the city or their creator that enables them to exist as strong presences cut off from that they often fade fade he called it like he was talking about curtains that had been in sunlight too long instead of a living being well a sortofliving being well gretchen is way past faded theres almost nothing left we leave her in even one more night and she may not be there she cannot die maybe not but the damage i shook my head we have to get her out now tonight or we might as well put a bullet in her leave damian in for one more night and i will agree to release gretchen no i said damian is like one of those feral vamps the longer hes like this the greater the likelihood that hell never be anything else do you really believe that one more night will damage him irreparably jeanclaude asked i dont know but i know that if i wait until tomorrow night to get him out and the damage is permanent ill always wonder if that one extra night made the difference then we have a problem ma petite a hot bath is being run now in preparation for one released vampire we only have one place suitable here at the circus for such a recovery why a bath i asked they must be brought back to life to warmth the process must be done carefully or the risk is one of true death wait a minute a vamp can be in the coffin locked away forever and never die but getting them out can kill them that doesnt make sense they have adjusted to the coffin ma petite to bring them out after a length of time is a shock to their system i have seen vampires die of it i knew he wouldnt lie he was too unhappy about having to say it so we throw them both in the same tub no big but it is a big ma petite the attention and power needed to bring one back must not be divided between them it will take all that i have to bring one at a time back i cannot divide my efforts without risking them both i know that you made gretchen but you didnt make damian his ties to you as master of the city broke when he became mine so you arent his master in any way i am yes he said then isnt it my job to bring damian back my mystical connection with him not yours if you were truly his master another vampire i would agree but you are for all your talents still human there are things you cannot do for him and there are many things you will not know to do for him like what he shook his head it is a complex process requiring specialized skills and you have those skills i said do not sound so skeptical ma petite i was part of our mistresss emergency crew he said she would punish others and we would be left to deal with the aftermath it was often her way we i asked asher and myself so asher knows how to do this i said oui but he is not damians master either no but i am if damian still has one im it so you take care of gretchen you loan me asher and he tells me what to do for damian after his little display in the other room you would trust him id trust him with my life and so would you but not our hearts jeanclaude said why did it bother him so much to see you with micah i asked hes seen almost as bad with richard and me i believe that you as my human servant and richard as my wolf to call were possessions mine by right and you were already in place when asher arrived in st louis micah is not my animal to call he has no ties directly to me he is your nimirraj but nothing to me and i asked asher was willing to share me with you and richard because you were mine but this nimirraj is simply another man that has my favor when asher does not micah doesnt have your favor exactly yet jeanclaude gave a small smile true but asher does not see it that way if it werent for my social qualms would you be doing asher right now he laughed an abrupt sound that didnt dance along my body it just filled his face with glee the closest id ever seen to real laughter from him social qualms ah ma petite that is precious i frowned at him just answer the question the laughter faded almost like a person instead of that abrupt change he usually did asher and i would likely have come to an understanding if it would not have cost me you ma petite an understanding now whos being coy i said he gave that gallic shrug that meant everything and nothing you would not be comfortable with brutal honesty ma petite fine if i could have stomached it would you have taken asher back as your lover by now he thought about it then finally i do not know ma petite i know you love him oui but that does not mean we could be lovers again when he and i were happiest it was with julianna you might be able to stand us as lovers out of your sight as long as we did not act like lovers in front of you i do not think you would like watching asher and me hold hands in front of you put that way he was right what are you saying i am saying that asher deserves better than a hidden relationship where we could never show public affection for fear of hurting you i would rather give him up completely to someone else male or female than force him to play second or lower to you forever i opened my mouth to say that i liked asher even loved him in a way but i didnt because i didnt want to raise the possibility of a true mйnage а trois what id seen with micah and jeanclaude had already bugged me a lot i just couldnt deal with two men and me yeah yeah it was the midwestern middleclass value system but it was the way i looked at the world i couldnt change that could i and if i could did i want to i didnt know i just didnt know the fact that the thought didnt make me run screaming into the night bothered me but not as much as i thought it should have jeanclaude gave jason the keys to the locks on the silver chains hed spent the last hour explaining everyones job jason would be the appetizer oh sorry gretchens first feeding it couldnt be someone human because the first feeding after being in the box could be quite traumatic jeanclaudes choice of words not mine so basically jason got to be point man and take the first damage then it was jeanclaudes turn to donate blood the vamps master gave a feeding and rebound the vamp to the blood oaths that connected them either to the master of the city their bloodline their maker or in jeanclaudes case all three all three was better the stronger the original connection the greater chance the vampire had of healing the damage that last part made me worry for damian i wasnt his maker i wasnt his bloodline or his master of the city i wasnt sure exactly what i was to him to that question jeanclaude had said you are his master ma petite whatever that means for a necromancer that is what you are to him if taking blood from you doesnt reconnect him then asher will try failing that they will fetch me from gretchen damian must rebind his ties to one of us or he is lost define lost i said the madness may be permanent shit oui but first gretchen so that i could see it done understand the process better jason unlocked the chains they fell off the coffin and clunked against the wood a dull harsh sound it made me jump gretchen had tried to kill me when she only thought i was dating jeanclaude she might rise from the coffin bent on killing me id been her advocate demanding jeanclaude let her out now as jason undid the locks on the lid itself my chest was tight and i had to fight to keep my hand away from my gun it would be stupid not to mention ironic if i had to kill her the moment she rose i could just hear jeanclaudes dry and this is an improvement ma petite i said a quick prayer that it wouldnt come to that i didnt want to kill her i wanted to save her wanting to do the last didnt mean i wouldnt do the first but it did mean i would try to avoid it jason raised the lid slowly not because it was heavy but because i think he was scared too the idea of being gretchens first meal had made him laugh that anticipatory sound that is half grownup male and half little boy the sound that men reserve for things that combine sex and usually sports cars technology or danger depends on your man im sure there are men out there that would give that purring excited laugh at the thought of gardening of poetry but i havent met them might be an interesting change though the lid went back in that halfway position that coffin lids do nothing moved there was just jason standing there in his cutoff jean shorts bare back to the room gretchen didnt come bounding out and eat anybody and i let out a breath i hadnt known i was holding jason stayed there gazing down unmoving hands frozen on the lid he finally turned towards the rest of us and there was a look on his face that id never seen it was a mixture of horror and pity his spring blue eyes were wide and there was a glitter of tears i thought jason and gretchen hadnt been close the reaction couldnt be personal what was in that coffin to put that look on jasons face i was moving forward without realizing it ma petite do not go closer i looked at him whats the matter with her why does jason look so stricken jason answered ive never seen anything like this i had to see now i had to i kept walking towards the coffin jeanclaude met me blocked my path please ma petite do not go closer im supposed to watch the process right im going to have to see what she looks like sooner or later jeanclaude might as well be sooner he studied my face as if hed memorize it i did not anticipate that she would be so he shook his head you will not be happy with me after you see her you dont know what she looks like either i said no but jasons reaction tells me many things i do not wish to know whats that supposed to mean he just stepped aside gaze upon her ma petite and when you have forgiven me come back to me forgiven him i did not like the phrasing id been scared of gretchen pouncing out and trying to kill me now i was more frightened of looking at her of what horror awaited me inside that coffin my pulse was trying to climb out my throat and i couldnt breathe past it jasons face jeanclaudes sorrow and the utter stillness from the coffin had left me so scared my mouth was dry jason moved to one side turning away from the coffin leaning his butt against it arms hugging his sides he looked pale and ill i wondered if hed changed his mind about letting gretchen touch him i stood just far enough back that i couldnt see into the coffin i didnt want to see something so horrible that it made jason pale i didnt want to see it but i had to i stepped up to the coffin like stepping up to the plate knowing that the ball coming at you is going a hundredplus miles an hour and you have no chance to swing my eyes couldnt make sense of what i saw at first my mind simply refused to understand its a safety feature that we all have if something is too horrendous sometimes our brain just says nope not going to see this not going to record this nope it would break us but if you stare long enough the mind says well damn were not turning away and finally finally youll see it and once you see it youll never be able to unsee it it lay against white satin so that the dry brown color was very stark painfully outlined it looked like a wizened mummy one of those bodies they find every once in a while in the desert where the dryness makes natural mummies the brown skin had molded to the bones there was no muscle under it just bones and skin the mouth was open wide as if the jaw hinge had broken the fangs were dry but white like a skull the entire head had dried down to just the skull covered by a light coating of brown skin patches of bright blond hair clung to that skull and the bright color made it worse more obscene somehow the eyes opened i jumped but the eyes that stared back at me were filled with something brown and dried like big raisins they blinked once slowly and a sound like wind sighing came out of the mouth i fell back from the coffin fell to my knees jason grabbed my arm drew me to my feet i shook his hand off and went for jeanclaude he stood there face patient empty i hit him without ever breaking stride maybe he expected me to stop take a stance but i hit him in the face closed fist like it was a continuation of the movement of my body i twisted my fist my whole body into it and he was suddenly on the floor looking up at me with blood on his face you bastard you fed off her energy while she was in there i had to stalk away from him to keep from kicking him some things you did not do some lines you did not cross he touched the back of his hand to his mouth what if i had nothing to do with it what if i came to stand over him what if are you really going to try and tell me that you didnt feed off of her i pointed back towards the coffin and must have glanced back because the next thing i knew he had my legs and i was suddenly falling towards the ground i slapped the hard stones with my arms like id been taught in judo that took some of the impact kept my head from hitting the stone floor but it took concentration by the time my body hit the ground jeanclaude was on top of me pinning my arms to the floor with his forearms the rest of his body trapping the rest of mine get off of me non ma petite not until you hear me out i tried to raise my arms not because i thought i could outmuscle him but because i had to try ive never been able not to struggle even when i know its a lost cause i was able to raise my arms a little not enough to get away but enough to make him bear down enough to widen his eyes enough to make him tense good to know the marks were helping me gain useful things like strength and not just crap blood was a bright surprise against that pale skin the blood dripped from an open cut on his mouth how do you know that this is not what all vampires would be reduced to after years i glared up at him because i couldnt do much else liar how are you so certain he pressed himself harder against me for emphasis i think because he wasnt happy to be there his body was all about anger not sex how do you know anita hed used my real name im a necromancer remember his face clearly said he didnt believe the answer was that simple and he was right i was remembering my visit to new mexico and what id learned there a monster rising above the bar in a club in albuquerque it rose above the bar in a thin line of pale flesh like the rising of a crescent moon then a face came into view it was a womans face with one eye gone stiff and dry like some kind of mummy face after face rose brown and withered like a string of monstrous beads strung together with pieces of body arms legs and thick black thread like gigantic stitches holding it all together holding the magic inside it rose up and up until it towered against the ceiling curving like a giant snake to stare down at me i estimated forty heads more before i lost count or lost the heart to count anymore there had been another club in that town and it had been worse in some ways because the torture was part of the entertainment lines had appeared on the mans skin the muscles under his skin began to shrink as though he had a wasting disease but what should have taken months was happening in seconds no matter how willing the sacrifice it can still hurt the man started screaming as fast as he could draw breath his lungs were working better than the first mans and he drew breath so fast it was like one continuous shriek his skin darkened as it drew in and in like something was sucking him dry it was like watching a balloon shrivel except there was muscle and when the muscle vanished there was bone and finally there was nothing but dried skin over bones and still he screamed the last insult or gift or horror had been the master of the city of albuquerques power her power had beat against me like frantic wings birds crying that theyve been shut out in the dark and they want inside to the light and the warmth how could i leave them crying in the dark when all i had to do was open and they would be safe id fought it but in the end the wings erupted into a torrent of birds my body seemed to open though i knew it didnt and the winged things only halfglimpsed spilled into that opening the power flowed into me through me and out again i was part of some great circuit and i felt the connection with every vampire shed touched it was as if i flowed through them and they through me like water coming together to form something larger then i was floating in the soothing dark and there were stars distant and glittering images then and they had force to them like things slamming into my body i saw the master of the city standing on the top of a pyramid temple surrounded by trees jungle i could smell the rich greenness of it and hear the night call of a monkey the scream of a jaguar her human servant knelt and fed from the bloody wound on her chest he became her servant and he gained power many powers and one of them was this how to take the life force of something someone and feed upon it without killing it and i understood how hed taken the mans essence during that terrible entertainment more than that i understood how it was done and how it was undone i knew how to unmake the creature in the bar though what had been done being sewn together into a frankenstein nightmare might mean that to bring them back to flesh would kill them i didnt need the necromancer who had trapped them to undo the spell i could do it myself the memories were so vivid it was like reliving them i came back to the present almost with a jolt staring up into jeanclaudes eyes still trapped under his body still in the punishment room thousands of miles away from obsidian butterfly and her small army but it was the look on jeanclaudes face that caught my breath in my throat his eyes were wide and i knew in that moment that hed seen my memories that hed shared them the way i sometimes shared his fuck his voice had a shakiness to it that i rarely heard ma petite you were a busy girl while you were away from us you saw what i saw and you know how i feel about what you did to gretchen his hands tightened on my arms fingers digging into my skin just a little i know how you feel ma petite but i will not take this blame gently i am the master of the city my vampires live through me unless they are masters themselves their life force comes through the line that bred them until they take blood oath to a master of the city then that master makes their hearts beat if i run short of power then some will simply not wake in the night or they will become revenants animals to be destroyed as damian has become i moved under him i dont shhh ma petite i will not be condemned without a hearing not this time perhaps you can save damian but he is over a thousand years old even though not a master that is a long time long enough to accumulate power enough to survive but vampires like willie and hannah who are not masters and not that old they would fade or go mad and there would be no saving them he shook me digging into my arms raising his elbows so that i could have gone for a weapon if id wanted but i just watched him and listened is that what you want anita which of them would you sacrifice to save gretchen gretchen whom you hate i took power from her because you denied it to me dont blame this on me i said he moved suddenly sitting up on his knees his body straddling my legs he lifted me into a sitting position fingers brushing against my arms the system of master and servant has worked well for thousands of years but you keep fighting it and you keep forcing me to do things i do not wish to do he raised me up close to his face and i watched his eyes bleed to burning blue from inches away he shook me more violently this time almost hard enough to scare me if i could have fed the ardeur as it was meant to be fed then this would not have been necessary if i could have fed through my human servant this would not have been necessary if i could have fed through my animal to call this would not have been necessary but you and richard bind me round with rules you cripple me with your morality and you force me to do such as i swore i would never do i have been in the box and been food for my master and it was the worst thing i have ever endured and now because you and he had your moral high ground to keep you pure you have forced me to be more practical than i have ever wanted to be he released me so suddenly i fell back against the floor slamming an elbow into the stones he stood over me as angry as id ever seen him and i had no anger to give back i finally said i didnt know that is becoming a poor excuse ma petite he went to the coffin and gazed down at what lay inside i gave her my protection once and this is not protection he turned and glared at me i do what i must ma petite but i take no pleasure from it and i tire of the necessity of it if you would but meet me even halfway we could avoid so much pain i sat up fighting the urge to rub my elbow do you want me to say im sorry i am do you want permission to feed off of me is that it the ardeur yes he said but in truth if you are in the mood for it simply having the marks open and married gains me much he held his hand out to jason and for one of only a few times i saw jason hesitate before taking jeanclaudes hand jeanclaude didnt even look at him as if his obedience was simply a fact like gravity if she were stronger it would be a more dangerous feeding but she is very weak so it will not be so very bad the words were comforting but he never looked at jason as he lowered the younger mans wrist towards what lay in that coffin i got to my feet watching jasons face he was pale eyes wide breath coming too short too fast he didnt normally have a problem letting vamps feed on him but i understood what lay in that coffin was something out of a nightmare most of the time if you saw a vamp looking like something made of dried sticks it was well and truly dead jason pulled on his arm keeping himself just out of reach i think jeanclaude turned to him but there was no anger he kept the one hand on jasons arm and the other he touched to his face gently would you have me take your mind before she strikes jason nodded wordlessly jeanclaude cradled his hand against jasons face they stared into each others eyes one of those long lingering stares like lovers except i felt the moment that jason slipped away i felt his mind release his will evaporate his face went slack his mouth halfparted eyes fluttering jeanclaude kept his hand on the other mans face as he guided the wrist into the coffin jasons body tensed and i knew that gretchen had bitten him but his eyes stayed closed his face pleasant i found myself beside the coffin without meaning to be the dried stick hands raised as i watched clutching at jasons arm holding him against the mouth jeanclaude moved his hand back as the thing in the coffin pressed jasons wrist to its mouth blood flowed over that brown skin soaked the white satin pillow and still that lipless mouth fed the room was suddenly too warm almost hot i turned away and found micah watching me i couldnt read his expression wasnt sure i wanted to i looked away from whatever was in his eyes i didnt want to meet anyones eyes right now id fought so long and so hard not to be what i was not to be jeanclaudes human servant not to be richards lupa not to be anything to anyone everyone seemed to be paying the price for that i hated having other people pay the price for my problems it was against the rules somehow jeanclaudes voice drew me back to the coffin drink gretchen drink of my blood i gave you life once let it be so again jason was sitting slumped beside the coffin cradling his bloody wrist with a beatific expression on his face the dried thing was sitting up with jeanclaudes arm behind its shoulders it looked better but still not alive not even quite real he offered the pale flesh of his wrist to that lipless mouth still red with jasons blood and it bit down i heard jeanclaude sigh but that was the only sign that it might hurt blood to blood flesh to flesh jeanclaude spoke the words and with each word with each suck of blood i felt the power grow felt it curl in my stomach shorten my breath gretchens body began to stretch and fill the pieces of hair thickened and began to flow around her the dried things in her eye sockets filled and began to have a hint of blue to them when jeanclaude moved his wrist from her mouth they were fullpouting lips she had blue eyes and a wealth of yellow hair she was thin her bones showing under the near translucent paleness of her skin her eyes were filled with fire nothing human her hands were still painfully thin her body fragile but she looked almost like the vampire that had tried to kill me years ago he picked her up in his arms her body didnt fill out the clothes that hung from her frame breath to breath he said and leaned in towards her they kissed and i felt the power pass between them i knew that that kiss could have drained her life away again but it didnt when he raised back from her her face was full and rounded human looking it was like prince charming waking sleeping beauty except that this beautys eyes found me and the hatred in them was a burning thing i sighed some people never learn i met that hateful gaze and said gretchen i promise you two things youll never have to go back in that box and if you try to hurt me or mine again ill kill you and that would be a damn shame since im the one who persuaded jeanclaude to let you out in the first place she just looked at me the way that tigers behind bars watch the visitors biding their time jeanclaude hugged her to him if you try and harm my human servant again i will see you destroyed gretal gretal had been her original name so id been told i hear you jeanclaude her voice sounded rough as if the time in the coffin had damaged it come jason we need to warm this one jason got to his feet like an obedient puppy still bleeding still happy jeanclaude paused in the doorway looking not at me but at asher i must take this one to the bath or all the work will be undone but damian is a revenant now asher raised a hand which had been hidden along his body he had a gun a millimeter browning the big brother of my own gun i will do what needs doing we are not going to kill damian i said jeanclaude looked at me then at micah and nathaniel and gil and the other wereleopards and even the bodyguards his gaze seemed to take everyone in then he looked at me again i ask again ma petite who will you sacrifice for your high ideals you think he cant be saved dont you i know that once the madness takes a vampire even the master who bore him cannot always bring him back to his senses is there anything i can do that might bring him back to himself let him feed try to see he does not kill that which he eats and hope when he tastes your blood he regains his senses if your blood does not sate him then asher will try to feed him if that fails he gave that shrug that meant everything and nothing even holding gretchen it looked graceful i dont want him to die because of me if he dies ma petite it will be because he tried to kill someone in this room with that he walked out jason trailing behind i think perhaps id used up jeanclaudes patience with me or maybe seeing what hed done to gretchen had bothered him that much whatever the cause he left me in the room with everyone looking to me as to how to proceed and i didnt have a clue who was i willing to put next to the coffin who was i willing to risk the answer of course was no one but we finally decided who got to be the first victim i was pretty useless for the discussion because i would have put myself first in line never ask of anyone what youre not willing to do yourself but asher pointed out that i couldnt be the first feed if i had any chance of being damians master so they decided among themselves and it was zane left standing next to the coffin everybody but me that had a gun had it out with a round chambered i needed my hands free to offer up a body part to get gnawed on come to think of it i didnt much like that job description either but it wasnt watching zanes pale back as he unfastened the chain that bothered me it was watching cherrys face as she watched him do it that much fear for someones safety that much importance attached to one other being meant that it was love for her too they loved each other and he was about to cry cry for help and loose the carrion birds to feed and feed and feed the lid of the coffin was only half raised when zane jerked forward and pale hands showed around him holding him blood sprayed the white satin of the coffin spattered over zanes shoulders and the only thing we could see of damian was pale hands and arms latched around zanes back there was no shot to take someone was screaming i think it was cherry i had my gun out but there was no way to fire without killing zane first micah and merle were at the coffin trying to pry zane free zane fell back his throat a gaping wound and something that was all bloody fangs and wild red hair grabbed merle and folded around him tearing at the big mans throat the wererats and asher were standing back waiting for a clear shot but there wasnt going to be one not before someone else died i pushed forward trying to shove micah out of the way while i pressed the gun to damians face but micah was trying to pry the vampire off of merle and in the struggle i couldnt get my gun steady the barrel slipped in the blood against damians skin and suddenly green eyes turned to me and there was nothing in them but hunger damian was already dead i just hadnt pulled the trigger yet then he was on me faster than anything id ever seen i was pressed back against the satin of the coffin my hips and legs sticking out he didnt go for my neck he buried his fangs in my upper chest i screamed past the pain and pressed the barrel of the browning against his temple asher was yelling don t fire youll hit anita i screamed again and had to adjust the angle of the gun because if id pulled the trigger the bullet would have gone through his head into my chest i moved the gun a fraction while he savaged me my finger curled on the trigger when he raised his green eyes to me i watched his eyes fill up with knowledge intelligence with him he raised his mouth back from my chest he looked scared anita whats happening he seemed to see my bloody chest for the first time and his eyes went wide whats happening to me the moment he spoke the moment there was something in him besides monster i felt the connection between us click into place like a perfectly tuned string on a harp the power flowed between us like warm water filling him up filling me up and i drew him down to me my blood still on his lips i heard asher saying stay back its alright let her finish i whispered as i drew damian down to me blood of my blood flesh of my flesh breath to breath my heart to yours and just before our lips met and his fate was sealed he whispered yes oh yes i was shoulderdeep in water so hot it made my skin pink i was so hot i was almost ill because i was still fully dressed including all my guns damian leaned up against the front of my body my arms wrapped around him holding him close his body folded in against mine his arms holding mine across his bare chest how did i end up being guardian of the bathtub for damian once we reached my house hed gone into convulsions and only my touch had calmed him wed gotten him to my house with nathaniel riding in the back cradling damian theyd filled the bathtub with hot hot water and id left asher in charge of damians care id done my part id brought him back to himself i had a bandage over my left breast to prove that id donated my piece of flesh and blood for the night zane and merle were on their way to the lycanthrope hospital with micah and cherry to oversee them everyone else had trooped back to my house and everything had seemed fine until screams from the bathroom brought me running damian had been beating himself against the floor convulsing like hed tear himself apart vomiting blood on the tile asher and nathaniel had been fighting to hold him down to keep him from hurting himself but they couldnt hold him i knelt to help and the moment i touched him he quieted id withdrawn my hand and his body had bucked again hands scrambling at the slick tile id touched his shoulder and he calmed wed tried letting him take blood from caleb but the moment i stopped touching him his body rejected the blood and everything else the last time id stopped touching him damian had simply gone quiet and i had felt him beginning to fade to die wed dragged damian into the steaming bath water and id held him he had recovered but only with me holding him while my clothes stuck to my body whats wrong with him i asked asher had answered ive only seen this reaction between master and servant im damians master so what it shouldnt cause this should it no ma cherie not merely master but master vampire and human servant damian is not my master i said damian is no ones master asher said quietly gazing down at us from the edge of the tub he was sitting in a pool of the blood that had poured out of damian what are you saying asher you have made him your servant he cant be a human servant hes a vampire i said i did not say human servant ma cherie then what are you talking about a vampire servant for a master necromancer i think you think i made it a question we are dealing with things of legend ma cherie things that should not be possible i am having to guess at this guess i said he sighed if i said that i knew for certain what has happened it would be a lie i would never lie to you on purpose i had protested demanded but nothing i could do or say made it untrue i had a vampire servant and that was impossible but impossible or not damian lay against my body clinging to me like i was the last hope he had asher glided back into the bathroom wearing a beach towel wrapped around him the towel was big enough to cover him from armpits to midcalf effectively hiding his body hiding the scars my clothes are covered in blood i hope you do not mind i hated wearing bloody clothes myself so fine glad you found a towel you liked he glanced down at the colorful towel i do not fit in your robe i was sorry asher felt like he had to hide himself away but i had other things to worry about i think if i dont get cooler soon im either going to throw up or pass out he knelt by the tub smoothing the long towel under his knees in a gesture that you dont see much in men he touched my face lightly you are flushed he touched damian his skin is still cooler than it should be he frowned you need to take off some of your clothing especially the jeans i would think normally i go to great lengths not to be unclothed in front of all the boys but tonight i was willing to strip down a little how do i undress and still hold him i believe that one of us could hold him against you while you disrobed you really think that hell go into convulsions again you could release him and we could find out asher said voice soft i shook my head im tired of cleaning up blood just help me hold him ashers eyes went a little wide i will call nathaniel the heat had gone to my head in a pounding headache just jump in asher i promise not to peek he curled beside the tub tucking every piece of him he could underneath the towel if i dropped this towel to the floor would you really not look his question stopped me i opened my mouth closed it and tried to think through the heat the headache the growing nausea and finally just said the truth i wouldnt mean to look but no youre right if youre naked im going to look i dont think i could stop myself like a car accident you cannot turn away he said i looked up then and found hed turned away hiding his face with that fall of golden hair damn it i didnt have time to hold everybodys hand asher please i didnt mean that he wouldnt look at me i extracted one arm from damian who moved around the remaining arm like a child settling in his sleep around his favorite teddy bear i grabbed ashers arm through the towel yes id look just for sheer curiositys sake how could i help it youve teased and taunted about how bad your injuries are youve set it up so that ill have to look have to see he was looking at me now those pale eyes empty hidden from me i dug my fingers into his arm trying to grip him through the towel and finding mostly cloth but if you dont know by now that i just want to see you nude then you havent been paying attention his face told me nothing that blank politeness that both he and jeanclaude could pull off when they wanted to now help me get some of these clothes off before i melt he gave a low chuckling laugh that danced over my skin and brought my pulse to my throat i was too hot to have goosebumps you offering to disrobe without any magic to push you i believe that is a first i had to laugh because he was right but the laugh forced me to close my eyes because it felt like the pulsing of the headache was going to shove my eyeballs out of their sockets i let go of his arm and pressed my hand to my forehead to try and keep my head from falling into pieces please asher i am going to be sick i heard the water splashing felt it push against me as someone climbed into the tub i opened my eyes slowly trying to hold the headache inside and found nathaniel kneeling in the water his hair was still bound in a loose braid that trailed behind him curling through the water like something separate and alive the swirling braid brought my gaze low on his body and i had a peripheral sense that nathaniel wasnt getting any clothes wet whatsoever but i didnt care the headache had reached a point where i was afraid i was going to start throwing up if i didnt get cooler he answered my question without me asking it asher wants damian to try to take blood again see if it will stay down asher was still perched on the edge of the tub wrapped in the towel damian must be able to keep down blood or he will perish i believe that if you stay in constant contact with him that he will be able to keep a feeding down if i have to stay in constant contact then i have to get cooler first nathaniel will help you he said i glanced up at asher and even in the dim glow of a night light it hurt my head fine damian made small protesting movements as nathaniel tried to take some of his weight off of me we finally leaned him up against the edge of the tub with asher supporting some of his weight but letting him keep my arm pressed to his chest nathaniel undid my belt and helped me slip the shoulder holster off one arm but i needed the other arm free to slip it out of the other strap damian fought us slowly stubbornly as if he were sleepwalking but he was a vampire he could have torn his way through the wall of my bathroom with his bare hands if he didnt want to let go of my arm we couldnt make him not unless we were willing to break his fingers one at a time and we werent willing to do that what do we do nathaniel asked i have to get out of this heat i said can we like run cold water in the tub or something no asher said we must keep him as warm as possible until after he has retained some of the blood we dont dare allow him to be chilled then get these clothes off me i felt rather than saw the two of them exchange glances how do you want me to do it nathaniel asked i leaned my head forward resting against the top of damians wet hair his skin was the coldest thing in the tub i was so hot i was about to be sick yet damians skin was still cool to the touch the headache overwhelmed me and spilled out my mouth i did my best to crawl out on the edge of the tub before i vomited damian had managed to miss the water every time he threw up at least i could do the same but he clung to me and only ashers hand on my arm kept me high enough from the water to keep it clean my head was screaming the pain so strong that it impacted my vision in explosions of color asher got me a cool cloth and wiped my mouth he laid another cool cloth across my forehead then nathaniel gripped the back of my shirt and ripped he tore it off of me in pieces asher draped a wet towel over my shoulders that was so cold it made me whisper shit asher and nathaniel took my weight and damians and moved us back to the far edge of the tub as gil came in and started cleaning up the mess gil had cleaned up a lot of messes tonight and hed never bitched not once he did a double take at the pieces of my shirt floating in the water but never commented aloud he made a good flunkie did what he was told and didnt ask questions nathaniel tried to tear my jeans off the way hed done the shirt he managed to rip the top but damians weight kept pushing me under the water and he couldnt get the leverage he needed asher fastened the towel as securely as he could and climbed gingerly into the water he knelt and slid his arms around damian and me and lifted standing holding us both upright i was still touching bottom but he was still holding both our weights because my legs still werent working quite right he held us both effortlessly nathaniel put a hand on either side of the rip hed made in my jeans and pulled the heavy wet cloth came apart under his hands with a sound like tearing flesh but heavier a wet harsh sound the force of it jerked my body and only ashers strength kept me standing i felt the air on my bare skin and realized that in ripping away the jeans hed taken my undies with them but i didnt care the air on my skin was still suffocatingly hot i couldnt breathe the last thing i remember thinking was im going to pass out then nothing i woke lying on the edge of the tub with only one arm in the water with damian cold towels covered me from head to foot the one on my face lifted and i saw that nathaniel was in the water holding damian upright i blinked up through a strand of wet hair and found asher spreading a fresh cold towel against my face he left enough of my face uncovered so i could look at him sideways how are you feeling i had to think about that better he replaced the towels down the length of my body and i realized i was completely nude i shivered with the cold cloth and didnt care about anything except that i was finally cool how long was i out not long asher said smoothing the towel so that it molded to my legs i looked at nathaniel kneeling in the tub pinning damian to the edge so the vampire could hold on to me ive never seen a shapeshifter pass out from heat exhaustion before he said a first time for everything i said damian turned his head slowly to look at me his eyes were clear bright alive again his eyes were the color of emeralds and it wasnt caused by vampire powers it was his natural eye color as if his mother had fooled around with a cat to get him here people just didnt have that color of eyes i smiled at him you look better i fed i glanced at nathaniel he turned his head so i could see the neat bite marks in the side of his throat i think i can support myself damian said nathaniel looked a question at asher who must have nodded because nathaniel backed off damian settled against me still holding my arm across his chest but lightly now one hand gently on my wrist the other hand stroked my arm i hear youre my master i looked into those calm eyes you dont seem upset he rubbed his chin and cheek against my arm it was catlike and intimate a lovers gesture i studied his face tried to read past those peaceful emerald eyes then i realized i didnt have to read his face the barest thought and i knew that the peacefulness in his eyes went all the way through he was filled with a great calmness a sense of rightness calm and peace had never been my reaction to jeanclaude binding me closer to him i could feel what damian was feeling knew his heart almost better than my own but i didnt understand him in that moment staring into those beautiful peaceful eyes i simply had no clue i would have run for the hills fought screamed hated i would not have gone quietly into any kind of servitude no matter how potentially beneficent the ruler truthfully i wasnt a hundred percent sure i was a beneficent ruler i mean i was easy to get along with as long as everything went my way but cross me and i wasnt easy i was close to being the hardest person i knew and i know some hard people i was trying to be softer lately but trying to be softer and actually being softer arent the same i looked into damians eyes and knew that if it were me tied to me as master id be scared damian turned in the water kneeling at the tub edge he leaned in and laid a gentle kiss on my forehead you saved me again he was right but as his lips touched my skin i wondered how long hed be grateful and when hed finally realize how screwed we both were asher took damian down to the basement for the day settling them both in just before dawn micah had called saying that both merle and zane would survive cherry was going to stay there with zane and he had to go check on the rest of his wereleopards i invited him to bring his leopards over to my house and he said hed ask we didnt say i love you at the end of the conversation which was unnerving i wasnt used to sleeping with someone that i didnt love or didnt say i love you to but i was too tired to think that hard so i pushed it down where all the other things i dont want to think about live the place is getting damned crowded nathaniel helped me dress in the coolest jammies i had a silky spaghetti strap nightshirt that would have been too revealing if i hadnt been so damn short then nathaniel cuddled in beside me in a pair of jogging shorts gil slept in the guest room the two wererat bodyguards divided the night up between the couch and sleeping on the floor in front of the door of my bedroom which meant if i had to go to the bathroom after we bedded down id have to step over them bobby lee said itll wake us up make sure you dont go wandering around alone i couldnt persuade bobby lee or cris that i didnt need that much watching but truthfully i was too tired to do much arguing so we all settled down for a long summers nap nathaniel had closed the heavy curtains so that the room lay in a heavy gray twilight i settled down in the airconditioned hush of the bedroom with nathaniel curled up against my side and fell almost immediately into a deep dreamless sleep when the bedside phone shrilled i knew what it was but it took me several seconds to wake up enough to move nathaniel had actually reached across me and answered blake residence before i opened my eyes he was quiet face very serious then he cupped his hand over the receiver and said its ulysses narcissuss bodyguard he wants to speak with you i took the phone still lying flat on my back this is anita what do you want my oba wishes to meet with you i moved my head enough to see the clock and groaned id barely had two hours of sleep i could manage an hour nap and feel okay or go without sleep but somewhere between two and three hours just felt worse i work the night shift ulysses whatever narcissus wants can wait until later in the day the word went out yesterday that any information about the missing lycanthropes was to go through you that woke me up a little i blinked and tried to be more awake than i felt what information he will only talk directly to you then put him on the phone im all ears he insists that you come down to his club now i have had less than two hours of sleep ulysses i am not dragging my ass over to the illinois side of the river at the crack of dawn if he has information that can help us save shapeshifters lives just give it to me and ill see that the info gets to where it needs to go my oba insists that if you do not come down to the club now he will not share the information at all i sat up leaning against the headboard closing my eyes why now it is not my way to question my orders maybe you should work on that i said there was silence on the other end of the phone i didnt know if he was puzzled and didnt get my comment or if it had struck too close to home he finally said in a quiet voice right now the lions rex is alive that may not be the case in a few hours i sat up eyes wide completely awake at last how do you know that my oba knows many things narcissus would really let the lions rex die just because i wont come down to the club at the ass crack of dawn my master is very insistent shit i said softly and with feeling tell him ill be down but tell him this too the next time hes in trouble maybe no one will help him either this is more help than he has ever been to any other animal clan there was something in ulyssess voice now something he was lying i could hear it in his voice i didnt know if it was vampire powers or werewolf or wereleopard and i didnt care the question was why lie about the fact that the werehyenas had helped no other shapeshifter group more than this why was that worth a lie at all narcissus helps out more than he wants people to know doesnt he i said what makes you say that there was a thread of fear almost panic in ulyssess voice what would it hurt if the lycanthrope community knew that the werehyenas were helping other animals out i asked his breath came out in a long sigh narcissus would never want anyone to think that about the werehyenas it would he hesitated be bad for business if narcissus is so concerned about joseph the lion then why not give me the info over the phone ulysses laughed abrupt amused narcissus has never given anything away for nothing theres always a price with him so my dragging down to his club on no sleep is the price something like that can i bring my people my master would love to see any of your people you care to bring i didnt like the phrasing on that how big of him when will you be here ulysses asked how do you know im coming because you know that hes enough of an egotist that if you dont come now he may not share the information at all you know hed let the lions rex die just because hes not the same animal we are and you not coming down now would be an insult this clannish shit has got to stop ulysses we need to start helping each other more not my place to change the system anita im just trying to survive in it he sounded sad i dont mean to yell at the messenger ulysses im just tired of the system he laughed again but not like he was happy youre tired of the system jesus you have no idea when can i tell him to expect you an hour less if i can manage it i want joseph alive to see his baby his mate will probably lose it like all the others i thought you hyenas didnt talk to the lions or anyone else how do you know about josephs baby woes narcissus keeps track of things like that why would he care he wants a baby that made me raise my eyebrows ive never pictured narcissus as the paternal type try maternal what well be waiting for you anita dont keep him waiting he doesnt like to be kept waiting i heard sorrow in his voice sorrow bordering on grief i almost asked what was wrong but hed already hung up what had narcissus done to him to put that tone in his voice did i really want to know probably not not unless there was something i could do about it and there wasnt if i started a war with every harsh lycanthrope master in town id have to kill them all or almost the only one who wasnt harsh was richard and that was going to get him killed i complained about narcissus being too harsh and richard being too soft i guess i was just never satisfied i hung up the phone and told nathaniel what was happening while i picked out clothes nathaniel threw a tank top over the jogging shorts hed slept in added jogging shoes no socks he knew better than to try and dress because hed insist on unbraiding his hair and combing it out which would take all the time the rest of us would need to get dressed i was wrong nathaniel wasnt even close to done with his hair when the rest of us were dressed and ready to go bobby lee and cris just threw on their shirts and shoes ran fingers through their short hair put the holsters back on and they were ready to go gil came down in jeans jogging shoes and an untucked mens dress shirt the shirt looked new but he didnt keep us waiting caleb came down in jeans and nothing else i didnt bother to tell him to throw a shirt on or shoes somehow i didnt think that narcissus would deny us service because caleb was underdressed i actually took the longest getting dressed black jeans red polo shirt black nikes every blade i had including the new back sheath id had made for the largest knife that ran along my spine the first sheath had gotten cut to pieces by emergency room personnel while they were trying to save my life i also brought my two handguns though i wasnt sure that any of us would be allowed to bring guns into the club but just in case i brought them and i warned cris and bobby lee about the noguns rule they flashed their own set of wickedlooking blades about three apiece and we were ready to go i thought about calling christine the weretiger but figured since it wasnt quite seven that id let somebody sleep in today besides i didnt know shit yet when i knew something worth sharing id share i was halfway to the club when i realized that the ardeur hadnt set in it was morning i was awake there wasnt a stir from the ardeur hope flared through me in a warm fuzzy wash maybe the ardeur was going to be temporary dear god i hoped so i said a brief prayer of thanks and kept monitoring myself for the first hints of unbridled lust we arrived at narcissus in chains with me grumpy but not the least bit lustful it was a good day i was able to park right in front of narcissus in chains not only was there no line at am there were no other people in front of the club the wide sidewalk stretched empty almost golden in the early morning light if id had time for coffee i might even have said it was pretty but i hadnt had time for coffee so the sunlight was just bright i had finally broken down and bought sunglasses a few weeks ago i huddled behind them wishing i was still in bed i was so tired i felt fuzzyheaded im usually pretty good at going without sleep the only thing i could blame the fuzziness on was the heat exhaustion from the night before maybe i needed more than three hours to recover from it it made me wonder how bad off id have been if i hadnt had all my preternatural powers a person can die of heatstroke nathaniel was at my side bobby lee and cris a step behind and to either side gil and caleb brought up the rear the door opened before we could knock ulysses ushered us into the darkened club he was still wearing his leather and metal harness the smell of it made me wonder if it was the exact same outfit hed been wearing was it five or six days ago the tall dark and handsome man that id met looked holloweyed his strong hands gripped his elbows hugging his body when he moved a hand to motion us inside it shook what the hell had been going on half a dozen other muscular men of varying races and heights stood in the shadows waiting for ulysses to tell them what to do the tension in the room was so thick you could have choked on it cris made a hissing sound at my back and i couldnt blame him i decided then and there that unless we got some really good explanations we were keeping the guns there was an air of desperation about all the werehyenas as if something really bad had happened the door was shut behind us but we were close to it and no one was between us and it i wanted to save the lion joseph but not enough to risk myself and my people if it was a choice i knew who id choose cold maybe but id never met joseph the werelion he wasnt real to me yet and everyone with me was ulysses must have seen or smelled something on us because he explained our master has seen fit to punish us what for i asked he shook his head that is personal fine lets talk to narcissus and you guys can get back to punishing yourselves we are not punishing ourselves ulysses said i shrugged look i dont believe in letting anyone push me around to this degree but its not my deal its yours so lets share information and let us get out of here something crossed ulyssess face some emotion that i couldnt read no guns in the club thats the rule i think well keep our guns bobby lee said i glanced at him and the look was enough he shut up but smiled at me actually i agree with him were not giving up our guns today ulysses shook his head i cant fail my master in this anita you have no idea what hell do to us if we let you inside with guns i glanced at the men standing around in the shadowed room fear rolled off of them in waves their bodies were tight with tension id never seen so many men so thoroughly whipped before they would do exactly what they were told to do because they were terrified to do anything else id been told that a good dominant was a caring partner maybe narcissus wasnt a good dom maybe he was a bad one im sorry ulysses really i dont want to cause you pain but if narcissus has gone crazy enough to make all of you this scared then we keep the guns please anita please he must have seen something on my face that let him know i wasnt going to give in because he dropped to his knees in front of me the sound of his knees hitting the floor was sharp made me wince hed kept his hands wrapped on his arms so that he just dropped without catching himself at all please anita i shook my head staring into those haunted eyes tears glimmered down his cheeks please anita please you dont know what hell do to our lovers if we fail him lovers i made it a question it took him two tries to say ajax is my lover weve been together four years please anita i dont have any right to ask this but please give up your guns i shook my head im sorry ulysses really i am but the more you talk the more i want to keep my guns he moved so suddenly that i didnt have time to react and cris and bobby lee both cleared their guns but ulysses wasnt trying to hurt me he wrapped his arms around me buried his face in my chest and wept and begged he stank of fear and blood and worse things put up the guns boys hes not trying to hurt me they put their guns up but they didnt look happy but then neither i suppose did i i touched ulyssess head but he just kept saying please please please you guys can all come with us just walk out with us bobby lee whispered this is not a good idea i dont care nobody deserves to be treated like this whatcha gonna do anita offer them all sanctuary we didnt bring that many guns he said if the other werehyenas object we leave them i didnt bring us out here to get killed but if we can we take them with us bobby lee shook his head you make your life hard anita you make your life very hard so ive been told ulysses just clung to me crying begging i had to grab his face and make him look at me and even then his eyes didnt focus it took almost a full minute for him to see me you can come with us ulysses all of you just walk out he shook his head they have our lovers you dont know what theyll do you cant know they a rifle shot exploded from somewhere in the room i had the browning halfway out of its holster when cris staggered backwards blood sprayed out his back onto caleb and gil gil started screaming i had to turn away before cris hit the floor bobby lee said three on the catwalk with rifles fuck girl weve walked into it i looked where he was looking and could barely make out the shapes if i was supposed to be the kittycat why did the rat have better night vision ulysses was whispering over and over im sorry im sorry im sorry i put the barrel against his forehead whatever else happens ulysses you die next a mans voice came out of the darkness he was speaking over a sound system that much i could tell if you pull the trigger we will kill your other bodyguard rifles with silver shot ms blake and i assure you that my people are dead shots now put your guns down and well talk i kept my gun and told ulysses get away from me now he crawled away still crying i picked out the shadowy form on my side of the catwalk bobby lee was aimed to the other side which left one man in the middle without a gun on him but from this distance with them above us we had to make each shot count which meant that we had to kill what we could then hope we could do something with the last one who the hell are you i asked drop your guns ms blake and ill tell you we keep our guns girl bobby lee said hes going to kill us either way i agreed we dont want you dead ms blake but we dont give a shit about your friends we can just keep picking them off until you change your mind i moved to stand in front of everyone so that the middle shot was harder from the above angle i couldnt block them completely but it was the best i could do everybody get down only bobby lee hesitated they dont want me dead and i need your gun he glanced at me then dropped to one knee using me to shield himself from the middle gunman hed grasped my plan everyone else was hugging the floor there was no cover and the door was close but not close enough what with three rifles on us what are you doing ms blake the voice asked just testing a theory i said dont be stupid ms blake bobby lee i said yes maam how good are you give the word well find out i felt my body go very very still so that the world narrowed down to the end of my gun and that shape crouched on the catwalk it was about ten yards id hit targets farther away than that but that was target shooting id never tried to drop a man with a handgun from this distance i let out the last of my breath so that i was just stillness just the gun just the point of the gun just the aim of the gun and with the last barest touch of my voice i whispered word our guns went off almost simultaneously i didnt shoot just once i fired as fast as i could pull the trigger my figure jerked the target came out of his crouch then fell slowly off the catwalk i turned my gun before the body hit the ground and found the man in the middle standing up i saw the shadow of his rifle i heard the voice shouting over the explosion of gunshots dont hit her dont you dare the rifle plowed up floor inches from me two shots trying to get me to move and give him a shot at bobby lee but i stood my ground and fired back bobby was firing with me and the shadow form jerked staggered then slumped forward his rifle falling to land on the floor with the other two bodies of the nowdead riflemen the voice said boys do not disappoint me the werehyenas rushed us bobby lee and i started shooting we divided the six werehyenas up between us smooth no cross fires no taking the others hit my side of the room his side of the room i took two i think he took one and we both clicked empty i drew the firestar lefthanded which made it about two seconds slower than it needed to be but it was probably faster than popping the clip on the browning and reloading if i survived id have to time which one was faster it was ulysses who was almost upon me like a dark shape of doom a gun exploded at my back and ulysses fell backwards onto the floor i whirled to find nathaniel with a gun his eyes were wide his lips parted a look of astonishment on his face hed picked up criss dropped weapon movement turned me back to the fight metal flashed as bobby lee waded into the last two werehyenas the fight was too intense i couldnt get a clear shot the far doors opened and men poured out i rushed the fight around bobby lee and fired almost point blank into someones back the man shuddered and dropped putting me facetoface with bobby lee it had startled him and i had to fire across his body into the last of the fightees i pointed the firestar at the werehyenas pouring towards us i emptied the gun into them as we all started backing for the door i wasnt as good lefthanded i dont think i killed anyone but i wounded someone with every shot and it slowed them made them hesitate gil caleb and nathaniel were already at the doors daylight spilled in and i was dazzled for a second because my sunglasses were still tucked across the front of my shirt i dropped the firestar popped the empty clip from the browning and had the second clip pounded home before we made the sidewalk i still couldnt hear the noise of the clips hitting home but i saw bobby lee making the same movement with his gun that id made with mine i knew he was locked and loaded i yelled nathaniel jeep get it running i knew he knew where the extra set of keys were i remembered narcissus saying that there were over five hundred werehyenas we had to get out of there before they decided to pick up more guns or just overwhelm us with numbers shooting them would slow them down but whoever that voice had been he had them terrified i could kill them but i couldnt terrorize them whether they poured out of that door in a wave would depend on whether they feared death or terror more i glanced back to find nathaniel in the jeep with caleb and gil in the back the engine roared to life bobby lee and i started for the jeep and the werehyenas rolled out into the sunlight too many to count almost too many to aim at i fired into the mass of bodies and i yelled run bobby lee and i were running for the jeep which meant our aim wasnt what it should have been but the men were packed so tight that we kept hitting them anyway theyd fall then thered be screams sounds a chittering laughter that raised the hair at the back of my neck and the wounded rose as hyenamen muscled palefurred spotted with a muzzle full of fangs and claws like black knives we werent whittling them down we were giving them better weapons to use against us nathaniel yelled get in i glanced back to find the doors open front and middle i slid into the rear seat bobby lee slid in front the doors were shut locked and nathaniel was pulling away from the curb when they poured over us they swarmed the car covering the windows nathaniel hit the gas and the jeep roared forward an arm smashed through the window beside me the sound of breaking glass was everywhere they were trying to hold on and get inside i fired through my window into the man beyond and he fell away bobby lee was firing into the hyenaman that was trying to crawl through the windshield but there were at least three others smashing at the glass trying to crawl through i fired the browning into the one on the opposite window from mine it took four shots before he fell away the browning had to be close to empty but id lost count the last two werehyenas were halfway through the windows one of them spilled into the back of the jeep he launched himself at me and i fired two more bullets almost point blank into him the gun clicked empty the man fell apparently dead at my knees because i was kneeling in the back of the jeep which meant that id crawled over the seat to meet his charge i didnt remember doing it the last one was in halfman form he was having trouble tearing his way through the window i think hed caught something painful on the glass i drew the blade that i wore down my back my right knee was down leg flat to the floorboard my left raised on the ball of my foot it was a swordsmans stance for when you couldnt stand balanced i struck in a blur of speed feeling the strength in my body like nothing id ever felt before he looked up at the last second just before the blade bit into the side of his face and split his head open blood splattered on my arms across my face the body slumped forward most of its lower parts still dangling out the window the upper part of his head from just above the jaw was gone spilling out onto the carpet soaking into the leg of my jeans i had a heartbeat to think holy shit then i heard the sounds on the roof bobby lee said persistent bastards i didnt answer just knelt by the wheel well opposite the bodies edward assassin to the undead and the only person i knew of with a higher kill count for monsters than me had talked me into letting a friend of his remodel my jeep the wheel well held a secret compartment inside there was an extra browning hipower two extra clips and a miniuzi with a mushroom clip the clip barely fit inside the compartment but it nearly tripled the round capacity so it was worth the tight fit claws ripped through the roof of the jeep and started peeling it back like opening a tin can i threw myself onto my back and fired up into the roof animal howls one body fell past the windows but the other one stayed on the roof the halfanimal arm shoved through the metal i went to my knees firing just in back of the arm the hyenaman rolled off the back of the jeep and bounced in the road the arm stayed in the hole in the roof caught on the metal when the ringing in my ears toned down enough for me to hear something besides the pounding of my own blood i could hear caleb saying fuck fuck fuck over and over gil was huddled beside him on the floorboard screaming a high piteous sound his hands over his ears eyes closed i leaned on the seat but didnt try to climb back over my back was covered in blood and worse things from rolling around on the floor i yelled gil gil he just kept screaming i tapped the top of his head with the gun barrel that made him open his eyes i pointed the gun at the ceiling while he stared at me stop screaming he nodded hands lowering slowly he kept nodding over and over again caleb had stopped cursing under his breath he was breathing so hard i thought he might hyperventilate but i had other things to worry about what kind of clip ya got on that uzi bobby lee asked its called a mushroom clip it about triples the ammo capacity he shook his head damn girl where have you been living that you need that kind of firepower welcome to my life i said i looked down at gil next time i tell you to stay home stay home yes maam he whispered slow it down boy bobby lee said we dont want to get picked up by the cops with bodies in the car the damage may be a tipoff i said the arm dangling from the ceiling had changed back to human shape it flopped bonelessly as nathaniel turned a corner i looked away from it and found the nowhuman with his head bisected his brains had leaked out in pieces i was suddenly hot dizzy i couldnt remember what id done with the big blade i must have dropped it but i didnt remember doing it i wedged myself into a corner the uzi raised to the ceiling my body held on three sides by metal and the seat back it was as close to being held as i could manage i closed my eyes so i couldnt see what id done but the smell was still there fresh blood butchered meat and that outhouse smell that let you know someones bowels had let loose i started to choke and the jeep pulled off the road that made me look up gave me something else to concentrate on nathaniel was pulling onto a gravel road in the middle of nowhere there were trees a floodplain green grass and beyond that the shine of the river it was a peaceful spot he drove until we werent easily visible from the road then stopped whats going on i asked bobby lee answered i think if we drive around in traffic with legs sticking out someone will notify the police i nodded it was a good point i should have thought of it i said no youve done your work for the day let me do the thinking til your head clears my heads clear i said he climbed out of the car and spoke through one of the broken windows as he moved towards the legs i know pangs of conscience when i see them girl stop calling me girl he grinned at me yes maam he grabbed the legs and shoved the body through the glass it landed with a thick sound on top of the first body a sound came out of the body on the bottom it might have just been air escaping it happened sometimes but then again i was on my knees uzi pointed at the bodies bobby lee said dont hit the gas tank maam we dont want to blow ourselves up he had his gun back out i shifted my angle so that id shoot through the dark head that lay at the bottom of the pile did two bodies constitute a pile did it matter something brushed my hair and i jerked the gun up only to find that id brushed the fingers on the arm hanging from the ceiling it was coming loose sliding lower on its own great i pressed the barrel of the uzi against the top of the head if youre alive dont move if youre dead dont worry about it bobby lee opened the back of the jeep his gun angled down for a shot at the body if i fire into the top of his head the bullets may cut your legs out from under you he moved off to one side gun steady my deepest apologies maam i know better than that i pressed the gun barrel more securely into the top of the head and began to reach slowly towards the neck that was just visible under the very dead top body im alive the voice made me jump and nearly made me squeeze the trigger shit i said why dont you finish it the man asked his voice was painfilled but not thick id missed heart and lungs careless of me because that wasnt narcissuss voice over the speaker system and ulysses said they had your lovers that we didnt know what theyd do to your lovers if you guys failed them who is the guy over the speaker who is they where the fuck is narcissus why would the werehyenas let anyone take them over like this youre not going to kill me he made it a question you answer our questions and i give you my word that we wont kill you may i move if you can he moved slowly painfully onto his side his hair was curly dark cut very short skin pale he turned until he could see my eyes and the effort left him shaking his lips blue which made me think maybe we didnt have much time to ask our questions that maybe wed already killed him just not fast enough his eyes were a strange shade of gold im bacchus he said in that painfilled voice nice to meet you im anita thats bobby lee now start talking ask me anything i started asking bacchus started answering he didnt die by the time we crossed the bridge into missouri his lips were pink and healthy and the dazed look had left his eyes i was really going to have to start packing better ammo bacchus actually didnt know all that much narcissus had introduced his new gentleman fair chimera and theyd seemed to be having a wonderful time together if not true love then the rough trade they both wanted then narcissus had gone into one of the rooms and not come back out for twentyfour hours the werehyenas had thought it was just sex but after that they stopped believing chimeras assurances that narcissus was alright ajax had managed to get inside and thats when it went bad ajax told us narcissus was being tortured really tortured why didnt you rescue him i asked chimera came with his own bodyguards they took bacchus had to stop and fight to take a deep breath as if something inside him was hurting you dont know what theyve done to our people you dont know what theyve threatened to do to them if we fail them tell us then well know i said have you met ajax he asked i nodded they cut his arms and legs off and burned the ends of the wounds so he couldnt heal the damage chimera said theyd put him in a metal box and just get him out on special occasions bacchus choked and i wasnt sure if it was from injuries or horror bobby lee said hes upset enough that i cant tell if hes lying or not but i think hes telling the truth his voice was a little hoarse as if he were seeing the images in his head that i was trying very hard not to imagine id gotten better lately at simply refusing to let my imagination run away with me maybe it had something to do with being a sociopath if so lets hear it for dementia i sat there in the jeep my mind carefully blank no visuals bobby lee looked ill how many bodyguards does this chimera have i asked about twentyfive before you started killing them i thought there were like five hundred of you guys how could twentyfive men keep you down bacchus looked at me with stricken eyes if someone had your ulfric richard and was cutting pieces off of him crippling him wouldnt you do anything to save him i stayed quiet and thought about that one i gave the only truthful answer that i could i dont know it would depend on what anything covered i see your point but why didnt you just rush them bacchus propped himself up against the side of the jeep nathaniel took a corner a little fast and bacchus tried to grab something so he wouldnt slide i gave him my hand caught him and he looked both grateful and uncertain he kept hold of my hand and gave really good eye contact we didnt have an alpha ajax and ulysses were the next in command and once they started cutting up ajax ulysses told us to do what they said he squeezed my hand not too tight the rest of us arent leaders anita our alphas were all telling us to cooperate with chimera were followers thats it thats all we need an alpha with a plan my eyes widened what are you saying bacchus he drew me close to him with our clasped hands there are still almost one hundred and fifty ablebodied hyenas god knows what theyll do to the prisoners now that weve failed them why do they want ms blake bobby lee asked chimera wants anita for his mate that raised my eyebrows what are you talking about hes got a real hardon where youre concerned i dont know why i tried to draw my hand out of bacchuss grip but he kept me close hes tried to kill me at least twice that doesnt sound so friendly he wanted you dead now he doesnt i dont know why chimeras crazy he doesnt need a reason to change his mind he gazed up at me still holding my hand please help us can you guarantee that the other hyenas will follow ms blake bobby lee asked bacchus looked down his grip loosened then it tightened and he looked up again i know that if wed had any alphas that would have stood up for us all wed have taken these guys out by now but ulysses loves ajax really loves him he didnt know what to do what about narcissus hes not still all mushy about chimera right i said no but the only time weve been allowed to see narcissus he was gagged narcissus has a reputation bobby lee said of being a tough bastard i dont think he would have rolled over for them bacchus shrugged and i finally freed my hand i dont know the werehyena said but he couldnt tell us to attack them for all i know chimera may have taken his tongue he did that to dionysus my lover he hugged himself head down eyes closed he gave me the tongue in a box wrapped with a ribbon id been given a box once with pieces of people i cared about in it id killed the ones whod hurt them killed them all but the damage done to my friends had been permanent nothing i could do would fix it because theyd been human they didnt grow back lost body parts bacchus kept his eyes closed his face very still as if he were holding himself tight afraid to lose control i didnt know what to say in the face of his pain how did i go from trying to kill him to feeling bad for him maybe it was a girl thing or maybe id been oversocialized as a child whatever the reason i found myself wanting to help him but not wanting to risk any of my own people cris was dead on the floor of narcissus in chains i hadnt known cris long his loss wasnt that great to me it just wasnt but if i went in there in force id be risking people i would miss still can you draw a plan a layout of the club mark where everybody is being held he opened his eyes his expression surprised the tears hed been holding back trailing down his cheeks forgotten youll help us i shrugged uncomfortable at the frantic relief in his eyes im not sure yet but it doesnt hurt to find out what wed be up against bacchus took my hand again pressed it to his cheek i thought at first it was going to be some kind of hyena greeting but he laid a soft kiss on my hand and let me go thank you dont thank me yet bacchus dont thank me yet i didnt say out loud that if the club looked too hard to take like it would cost too many lives i wouldnt do it i kept it to myself because he might lie make it seem easier the person he loved was being tortured people will do a lot of things for the person they love even stupid things bobby lee insisted on calling rafael first thing nathaniel and caleb helped me get bacchus settled in the kitchen he was still walking like things hurt gil had sat down at the end of the couch first thing huddling hed been withdrawn since i told him to stop screaming normally id have asked what was wrong but screw it i didnt have time to babysit him right now the kitchen was dim and depressing with all the windows and the sliding glass door boarded over we had to turn on all the lights my sunny kitchen had been turned into a cave an hour later we had a fair map of the inside of the club bacchus knew the guard schedule for the hyenas but not for chimeras men he did the best he could but said chimera changes his routine sometimes every day at least every three days one day he kept changing his orders every hour or so it was weird weirder even than normal for chimera how unstable is he bobby lee asked bacchus actually seemed to think about that for a second or two id thought it was a rhetorical question maybe i was wrong sometimes he seems fine sometimes hes so crazy it scares me i think it even scares his own people bacchus frowned then said i heard them say things like he literally was getting crazier and they were afraid of him too the doorbell rang it made me jump nathaniel jumped off the kitchen counter where hed been sitting ill get it check and see who it is first i said he looked back over his shoulder the look on his face clearly saying that i was telling him something he already knew after months of sharing room and board with me he knew to check the door before he opened it you used to just open the door i said i know better now he said and vanished into the living room he came back almost immediately its the werewolf that was at narcissus in chains the one called zeke nathaniel looked a little pale bobby lee and i both had guns in our hands i didnt really remember drawing mine i was looking at the boardedup windows the wood was a little more protection than the glass had been but we couldnt see through the wood either the bad guys could sneak up on us better is he alone i asked hes the only one standing on the porch nathaniel said but that doesnt mean hes alone his eyes were a touch wide when he said i dont smell snakes or lions i could see the pulse in his neck jumping under his skin its going to be alright nathaniel i said he nodded but the look on his face told me he wasnt convinced gil joined us in the kitchen whats happening bad guys i said more of them he said voice plaintive you might have been safer on your own gil i said he nodded im beginning to see that his eyes were so wide it looked painful i had brought the miniuzi in from the car and had reloaded it from the gun safe upstairs i took it off the kitchen cabinet and debated between it and the browning the doorbell rang again i didnt jump this time i hung the uzi over my shoulder by its strap and settled the browning more comfortably in my hand the uzi was really an emergency weapon the fact that id even thought about answering my door with it on my person was probably a bad sign if i needed more than a mm to answer my own front door i should just leave town i peered out at the living room but there was nothing to see but the closed front door i was going to have to look out the side window to see what was waiting on the porch i approached the door with the browning in a twohanded grip staying to one side of the door i was ready in case they started shooting through the door of course last time theyd shot through the windows too but the drapes were drawn and it was the best i was going to be able to do as far as safety went i knelt by the window because most people shoot for the chest or head and on my knees im a lot shorter i eased the drape to one side and something slapped against the glass i jumped back bringing the gun up but nothing else happened i had an image in my head of what it had been and it hadnt been a gun i thought it had been a picture i eased the drape back and found myself staring at a polaroid of a man chained to a wall he was nude covered in bloody scratches blood covering most of his body so it was hard to see at first exactly who it was then gradually my eyes made sense of it and i realized it was micah i sat back abruptly on the floor almost like id fallen my hand dragged at the drape keeping it open the gun wasnt where it was supposed to be but hovered in the air halfforgotten a gag cut across that wide mouth the delicate face covered in blood and swollen flesh the long hair was mounded to one side as if it were so sticky with blood that it no longer moved freely his eyes were closed and i wondered for a second that lasted forever if he was dead but there was something about the way he hung in the chains that said alive even in a picture there is a stillness to death that the live cannot mimic or maybe id just seen enough bodies to know bobby lee was beside me what is it whats wrong then he saw the picture and i heard his breath go in sharp thats your nimirraj isnt it i nodded because i still wasnt breathing which made it hard to talk i closed my eyes for a moment took a deep cleansing breath and let it out slowly it shook as it left my body i cursed silently get a handle on it anita you can do better than this what bobby lee asked i realized id said the last aloud and shook my head letting the drape fall back into place i got to my feet let him in lets see what hes got to say bobby lee was giving me a funny look you cant shoot him until after we know whats happening i nodded i know he touched my shoulder turned me to look at him there is a look on your face girl that is as bleak as a winters dawn people kill other people while theyre wearing that look i dont want you to let your emotions get in the way of business something that was almost a smile touched my lips dont worry bobby lee i wont let anything interfere with business his hand dropped away slowly girl the look in your eyes now scares me then dont look i said and dont call me girl he nodded yes maam now open the damn door and lets get this done he didnt argue again he just went for the door and let the big bad wolf inside when we opened the door zeke had a picture of cherry in front of his chest his first words were shoot me and they both are worse than dead so he took a seat on my white couch still breathing though if he said the wrong thing i was hoping to change that what do you want i asked i was sent to fetch you for my master define fetch i said i was sitting on the low wood coffee table in front of him bobby lee was standing in back of him with a gun pressed to his spine at that range with silver ammo there wasnt an alpha in the world that would survive or at least none that id met and id met a few he wants you to be his mate i shook my head i heard that but didnt he try twice to have you guys kill me zeke nodded yes and he suddenly wants me to be his honey bun zeke nodded again the gesture looked odd in the wolfman form kind of like a golden retriever that was nodding sagely why the change of heart i asked the fact that i was asking calm questions while the polaroids of cherry and micah sat beside me on the coffee table was a testament to both my patience and my lack of sanity if id really been sane i couldnt have been calm but id hit that switch in my head that let me think when awful things were happening the same switch that let me kill without much remorse being able to divorce myself from my emotions kept me from shooting pieces off zekes body until he told me where micah and cherry were besides there was always the very real possibility that we could do it later talk reasonably first torture only if you had to conservation of energy chimera was told that you would be a panwere like himself i raised eyebrows at that panwere what the hell is that a lycanthrope that can take more than one form zeke said not possible i said bacchus spoke from the kitchen doorway hed stayed as far away from zeke as he could and remain in the room chimera can take more than one form ive seen it i looked back at zeke okay fine hes a panwere why would someone tell him that i was one too before i answer that question i have someone waiting in a nearby car i would like her to come in and speak with you who for a wild moment i thought he might mean cherry but he didnt gina micahs gina i asked zeke nodded i looked behind him at bobby lee do we trust him to go back out and come back in without reinforcements bobby lee shook his head i shook my head too sorry zeke but we dont trust you send caleb then he looked at the wereleopard who had been very quiet throughout everything caleb was sitting in the far corner of the room keeping away from zeke a lot like bacchus come to think of it but then gil was huddled in a different corner id assumed i was surrounded by scaredycats hyenas and foxes but now how did you know his name i asked i know a lot of things about caleb explain i said the doorbell rang again i didnt jump this time i was in that far away place where i didnt get nerves though the browning was pointed at the door did that count as nerves i went to the door and bobby lee stayed with his gun pressed to zekes back yall better hope that that is someone friendly bobby lee drawled zekes wide nose flared scenting the wind its gina call me paranoid but i didnt trust him i peeked out the window this time there were no nasty surprises just gina standing on the small porch a thick gray shawl hugged around her upper body it was nearly ninety outside what the hell was the shawl for i let out a deep breath the shawl was thick enough to hide all sorts of unpleasant surprises damn whats she got under the shawl i asked zeke you might say a message from chimera i glanced back at him talk like that isnt going to get the door opened zeke moved his shoulders and bobby lee must have pressed the gun barrel deeper into his back because he stopped moving abruptly shes been tortured chimera sent her with me to show what will happen to your leopard if you dont come with me why the shawl i asked again zeke closed his eyes as if he wanted to look away but was afraid bobby lee would take it wrong its to cover her anita just to cover up her nakedness he sounded weary not just tired but weary please let her inside shes in a great deal of pain he smells like hes telling the truth bobby lee said i sighed that was probably as good an assurance as we were going to get i opened the door gun at the ready staying out of the sight of anyone who might be watching from the yard because i was hiding behind the door i didnt see gina until she was well into the room i closed the door behind her and she jumped then gasped as if the sudden movement had hurt her badly when she looked at me it was all i could do to keep from gasping i thought at first she had two black eyes then realized it was just hollows under her eyes so deep they looked like bruises her skin was so pale with an undertone of gray and i understood for the first time what they meant by ashen she was ashen as if her body was covered by something thinner more delicate than skin her tall body was hunched in on itself as if standing upright would hurt her lips were nearly bloodless but it was her eyes that hurt me the most they were filled with horror as if she were still seeing whatever had been done to her as if she might always see that awful thing over and over again she spoke in a voice that was hollow hopeless i got worried i didnt need to see what was under the shawl to believe that shed been tortured i didnt need to see anything but her face can she sit down before she falls down zeke asked i nodded a little too rapidly realizing that i had been staring please sit down gina looked at bobby lee standing behind zeke have you told them i wanted you here to back up my story zeke said she nodded once then moved to sit beside him on the couch she sat close to him almost touching if hed had anything to do with what had happened to her i dont think shed have been so cozy in fact she was so cozy that i was almost certain she knew zeke knew him not just for chimeras fun and games but knew him before how did one of micahs cats end up friendly with chimeras top goon i asked you two seem to know each other alright maybe that wasnt a question but it would do they exchanged a look then zeke turned to me i wished that he was in human form even after years of dealing with lycanthropes i still had trouble reading their expressions when they were in animal form the fact that his eyes were human helped some but you never realize how much of the expression isnt really the eyes but the facial movements around the eyes until you dont have them as clues let me start by saying that chimera wants you alive and well and in his care in less than two hours or he will start doing permanent damage to micah and your leopard i felt my eyes go a little dead we have a deadline then i said talk faster shortest version that i know is this chimera has always been a harsh master but never sadistic until the last few weeks hes unstable and i believe hes going mad and will kill us all if he remains in charge this is the short version bobby lee asked i agree i said speed it up i want you to help me stage a palace revolt ms blake is that quick enough for you maybe that was a little too quick i said why do you want to revolt and why do you want my help i told you i fear that chimera will destroy us all the only way to prevent that is to kill him well that was blunt so why my help you have a certain reputation for deadly force you talk like an english professor i said or an expensive lawyer why not just kill him yourself the others that follow him fear him they would not trust that i alone could guarantee his death and i can you and your people yes my leopards are not going inside nathaniel said anita i shook my head no i wont endanger the rest of you to save one of you what kind of pard would we be if we allowed our nimirra to go into danger alone a pard that obeyed orders i said he leaned back against the wall but there was an unusually stubborn set to his face that said maybe just maybe hed been picking up more than just weapons skill from hanging around with me was stubbornness catching not your leopards but the wolves and the rats the rats arent mine and im not the wolves lupa anymore rafael is already on his way here with some of our people bobby lee said i frowned at him well nice you mentioned that he shrugged if he was getting tired of pressing the gun into zekes back it didnt show rafael is my alpha not you maam i understand that but if were going to get along you still need to keep me informed ive had enough surprises for one day amen to that he said where are micah and cherry being held i asked zeke shook his great wolfish head no not until you agree to help us chimera wanted to blackmail me into being his sweetie you want to blackmail me into helping you kill him i dont see much difference the only way to stop chimera and those still loyal to him is their death i propose that we pool our resources and accomplish that you talk awful pretty for a goon i am his goon because when he conquered my small pack of wolves he forced me into this form and kept me in it when he allowed me to try and change back this was the best i could do i looked into those human eyes only your eyes i said only my eyes the eyes were usually one of the first things to go animal if you stayed in beast form too long at a time his eyes being the only thing human was odd but i didnt ask him to explain because we were eating up our time and i wanted micah and cherry back in this form zeke said i can be nothing else but a goon an enforcer i cannot be human i didnt try to argue that he was human i let it go lets cut to the chase bobby lee will rafael help on this i think so hes coming with enough soldiers to make a good show i looked at bacchus will the werehyenas join forces with their what oppressors will you guys help zeke and his people zeke always tried to save us pain he always spoke for moderation bacchus nodded i think the others will agree to work with him but whether theyll agree to let everyone live afterwards that i cant promise if we help you destroy him zeke said then you turn around and slaughter us we have gained nothing in looking between bacchus and zeke id glanced back over the photos id spent the last few minutes not thinking about them id managed to concentrate on other things but it was as if that one glance had torn through all the barriers that usually kept me from doing stupid shit i stood up abruptly enough that everyone looked at me would you kill zeke i asked no but marco he has to die bacchus said why i asked he and the snake men have to die bacchus said agreed zeke said then he looked up at me and i think i know a way to have the wolves involved im listening chimera is wolf hyena leopard lion bear and snake hes behind the disappearances of the other alphas i said zeke nodded are they alive the lion and the dog are chimera hasnt been able to force them to change form yet he never kills anyone unless he can break them first is narcissus alive this from bacchus yes zeke said chimera has not been able to break him either how will any of this interest the wolves i asked id gone to stand on the other side of the kitchen doorway opposite bacchus i couldnt see the pictures from there chimeras never been able to find a dominant animal group that was weak enough to be taken over by outsiders before until he heard of your wolf pack i stood up straighter pushing away from the wall what do you mean jacob paris and a few others are whats left of my pack chimera couldnt send me because my condition would raise questions are you saying that as soon as jacob becomes ulfric he turns the pack over to chimera that was the plan zeke said and now i asked now either jacob and the others agree to leave your pack where it is or they die youd kill whats left of your own pack just like that i said they stopped being my pack a long time ago so let me get this straight bobby lee said you want the rats the wolves and the leopards to join forces with the hyenas and whatever people of yours will join you and destroy the rest yes zeke said and if we dont bobby lee asked you talk as if you have many choices here zeke said you do not chimera will do worse than kill your leopards what he has allowed done to the hyenas is beyond any civilized tolerance his sanity is slipping away and there are those among his people that will do terrible things without a master to tell them no it takes time to arrange an offensive like this bobby lee said zeke said i do not see a clock but time is running out anita must be in chimeras presence before two hours is over or it will go badly for micah and the leopard you keep saying micah and the leopard i said like you know micah i had an awful thought and id been slow not to think of it before jacob was supposed to get the wolves for chimera and micah was supposed to get the leopards i said it in an empty voice my body felt empty as if i were falling away inside myself drowning in that great white static that allowed me to kill and not to think we thought their alpha was dead and it would be easy enough he looked at me we didnt know about you or rather didnt understand what you were gina spoke once micah met you he knew it wouldnt work he tried to get chimera to leave you and yours alone but when you went up against jacob you became too big a threat chimera ordered you killed micah didnt find out about the order until after everyone had left to come after you he saved you i just looked at her my mind was still trying to process the thought that micah had lied to me the entire time id known him micah told chimera that you were going to be a panwere like him and he might never find another one like himself thats why you can control the leopards and the wolves both i blinked at her i guess thats one theory my voice sounded distant even to me dont you understand anita i dont think micah believed it but it was all he could think of to keep you alive and him alive and not to get the rest of us tortured she stood up and pain tore across her face zeke steadied her then she stood straight and she let the shawl fall away burns traced her pale shoulders the rest of her chest was bare and lovely and unharmed but as she turned to show her back gil gasped her back was patterned with burns no not burns brands someone had branded her over and over again the burns were fresh some of them bloody raw some with crisp blackened skin as if the pressure hadnt been even every time some of the marks were smeared around the edges as if shed moved struggled she turned back to face me tears glittering in her eyes every time chimera sent micah out he had violet or me with him if micah didnt do what he was told to do then hed hurt us she started walking towards me hands holding her arms as if to hold herself steady but every step hurt and it showed in the flinching of her eyes what would you do to keep this from happening to nathaniel i met her eyes but it took effort id do a lot but i wouldnt betray anyone the tears started slowly down her face as if she were fighting not to cry he tortured micah because micah refused to help lure you into the ambush chimera is going to kill him because he says that micah is no longer his cat but yours that the wiles of a woman have won his loyalty she sobbed and the movement must have hurt because she bent forward body spasming i caught her by the arms to keep her from falling oh god she whispered it hurts my throat was tight i held her elbows until she could stand again im chimeras message to you anita he says hell do this to your leopard if you dont come back with us youre not going back there i said he still has cherry and micah if i dont go back hell do this to her i dont think shed survive it i understood what gina meant not cherrys body but her mind she began to collapse towards the floor slowly me supporting her as gently as i could micah knew what would happen to him when he refused to help trap you but he still did it she was on her knees now her hands gripping my arms tight tight enough to hurt i would have lied and agreed to do anything to keep this from happening to me she sobbed again and i held her arms to keep her from falling backwards onto her back on the floor i held her while she shook in pain and when she quieted she said in a voice more tears than noise i would have betrayed anyone to stop him from hurting me but he didnt want anything from me nothing i could say or do would stop it chimera promised micah that only he would suffer for refusing then once he was chained up and couldnt get away they brought me in and made him watch she looked at me eyes wide full of awful things chimera would have made cherry or me take animal form he said hed never had a female beast before thats what he calls those of us trapped between forms zeke said ginas fingers dug into my arm just a little micah took our place hes alpha enough to have kept human form he risked his human form for us merle was our nimirraj but he wouldnt risk his humanity for us micah took his place our place hes our nimirraj because he loves us all of us micah offered to betray you to stop them from hurting me but chimera said he could smell that micah was lying and that he would just get away and warn you so he sent me with zeke because he trusts zeke i looked at zeke over her slowly collapsing form trying to cradle her as she slid down and not hurt her but everything seemed to hurt she was making small mewling sounds by the time i helped her lower herself to the floor there was something in zekes human eyes that didnt need facial expressions to interpret chimera must be stopped zeke said softly he must be stopped yes i said still holding one of ginas hands yes he must be stopped stopped hell bobby lee said we need to kill his ass i nodded that too we made it back to the club with a little time to spare the wererats had arrived in force at my house and id left rafael in charge of the rescue because thats what it would be i was letting zeke take me into the bad guys lair unarmed zeke would be carrying my weapons and theoretically hed give them back to me if i needed them theoretically but theory and practice arent always the same thing zeke had tried to kill me once now i was supposed to trust him with my life it seemed a bad idea but i was still going to do it with enough time maybe we could have come up with a better plan but we didnt have the time not if we hoped to save cherry and micah it seemed like id spent most of the last four years arriving too late too late to save people too late to keep the monsters away i was cleanup crew someone that came after the bodies were scattered around and mopped up the mess i killed the monsters but only after theyd done terrible things even now chimera had already butchered and tortured but i could confess to myself if to no one else that part of me didnt give a damn about the others i mean i was sorry for ginas pain and bacchuss lover and ajax getting chopped up but they were abstract to me cherry and micah were real how very quickly micah had become that real to me frightened me but if i didnt look too closely at it i could keep moving forward could keep thinking clearly could keep breathing normally thinking too much tended to make my thoughts jump around my breath come a little too fast the main part of the club had been dark and empty the party as they say was upstairs it was the room at the end of the big white hallway that wed gone down to rescue nathaniel and gregory days ago chimera waited outside the door in his black hood and his eye slits were unzipped so i could see pale gray eyes he wore a rather ordinary looking suit complete with tightly knotted tie and white shirt that met oddly with the black leather of the hood he had his hands behind him leaning against his arms he was trying for casual and failing he was nervous and i didnt need any lycanthrope powers to notice gina had needed help from two of the werehyenas to make the steps zeke and i could have helped her but he was pretending to guard me and gina had a note under her shawl to slip the hyenas the note was from bacchus asking one of them to let him in the secret entrance apparently chimera had never asked if there was a secret entrance to the club so no one had told him chimeras eyes looked past me to her gina he shook his head take her away get her some medical care the two hyenas didnt argue just turned and went back down the hallway the snake man that had been with them stayed where he was his blackandgreen striped eyes never leaving chimeras face i would have said he stood at attention like a good soldier but it was more than that there was something on his face that went beyond that as if standing there waiting for chimeras orders was the most wonderful thing in the world that look of patient adoration was creepy all on its own and i knew why bacchus had said the snakes had to die not because of what theyd done to the hyenas not revenge but because people who worship their kings as gods dont participate in palace revolts i wasnt sure youd come ms blake the voice was familiar but i couldnt quite place from where you didnt give me much choice and for that i am sorry sorry enough to let me take my leopards and go home he almost smiled but shook his head micah is not your leopard hes mine ms blake again the voice rang familiar but i couldnt place it i shrugged you got me down here with the understanding that both cherry and micah would be set free unhurt sounds like theyre both mine he shook his head again to give up micah i would have to give up all my leopards and i am not willing to do that then you lied to get me down here no ms blake he took his hands out from behind his back he wore black leather gloves join your pard to ours strengthen us i shook my head i came down here to free my people not to join your club he looked at zeke didnt you explain to her what i wanted zeke shifted beside me you told me that if she came down here unarmed you would free micah and the other wereleopard that is all you told me chimera frowned even through the hood i could see it he rubbed at his face behind the leather as if something hurt i know i told you that i wanted her to join us you have said many things over the last few weeks zeke said voice very careful how long have you been the leopards nimirra he asked the voice was normal ordinary though his hands kept rubbing at his face about a year then you must see as i do that there needs to be a joining together of all the different forms the only thing that has allowed us to move in to every city and take over the smaller groups is the fact that the larger groups wont help them theyre like city neighbors who only call the police if its their own apartment being robbed they let anyone who isnt like them go to hell i agree that the lycanthrope community could use a little togetherness but im not sure torture and blackmail is the way to get it done he clamped his hands over his eyes back bowing as if he were in pain the snake man touched him with small dark hands chimera shuddered then raised up the snake man still touching him comforting him i think chimera looked at me eyes very direct he grasped the leather hood and pulled it over his head his dark hair stood on end sweaty needing to be combed the touch of gray at the temples wasnt distinguished anymore it looked more like madscientist hair as if hed done something awful and it had changed colors over night i could see the scars at the side of his neck now orlando king alias chimera looked down at me i just gaped at him i was too surprised for anything else i see that you didnt recognize me ms blake i shook my head and tried twice before i could say i didnt expect to see you here that sounded lame even to me but what i meant was orlando king bounty hunter extraordinaire should not have been the leader of a group of rogue shapeshifters it wasnt doable somehow thats why you knew about all the shapeshifters in town because they came to you for help he nodded i have been known since my accident to hunt down rogue lycanthropes and not inform the authorities a few bad apples dont have to spoil the entire barrel i looked at him and tried to think people thought your neardeath experience had mellowed you but you contracted lycanthropy thats why you stopped being a bounty hunter it seemed wrong to hunt other unfortunates he said people who had less to do with the accident that made them what they were than i did at least i was hunting the werewolf that almost killed me i was trying to hurt it most people who survive an attack are just innocents i know that i said voice soft because knowing chimera was orlando king didnt help solve the mystery for me it deepened it i was more confused than when i walked in the damn building but my change of heart as you put it came later wolf lycanthropy showed up in my bloodstream within fortyeight hours of my attack i decided i would take out as many monsters as i could and let them take me out before the first full moon he stared past me eyes distant with remembering i took the most dangerous jobs i could find until i ended up trying to kill an entire tribe of weresnakes in the depths of the amazon basin he looked at the small dark man still at his side i decided that dozens of any animal would surely kill me and if not then at the first full moon i would be in an area devoid of any human except the people id come to kill logical i guess i said because it seemed appropriate to say something his gaze flicked to me i had planned my death ms blake but every animal i tried to kill just wasnt up to killing me by the time i had my first full moon id been infected by a great many forms of predatory lycanthropy and on that first moon i changed into what abuta and his people are then a wolf then a bear then a leopard then a lion so forth and so on he was looking at abuta and his face held some of the religious fervor that the smaller man seemed to emanate they thought i was a god because i could take so many forms they worshipped me and they sent half their tribe to accompany me back to civilization he laughed then it was abrupt and unpleasant something about that laugh raised the hairs on my arms youve killed all but three of them anita i may call you anita mightnt i i nodded almost afraid to speak because emotions were chasing across kings face emotions that didnt match his calm words as if he were feeling things that he wasnt aware of it was like watching a badly dubbed film except it was body actions that were out of step not the words a prickling rush of energy came off him like heat and his eyes turned one pale greenish leopard one wolf amber it wasnt just the colors of the irises that didnt match it was the shape of the pupils the entire set of each eye socket was slightly different from the other i hadnt noticed the bone structure shifting it had been that fast a smile curled his lips the entire expression of face body everything changed and it wasnt shapeshifting it was as if another person just settled into kings skin chimeras voice was slightly southern thick and roundvoweled it was the voice id heard over the loudspeaker when they tried to ambush us in the club poor orlando he just cant cope anymore he hates what hes become i think i stopped breathing for a few heartbeats which made my next breath harsh id dealt with sociopaths pychopaths serial killers crazies of all ilk but this was my first multiple personality chimera jerked at the tight tie tore it off unbuttoned the collar rotated his neck and smiled there thats much better dont you agree my voice came out breathy always good to be comfortable he stepped closer to me and i backed up bumping into zeke chimera stepped in very close almost touching and sniffed just above the skin of my face this close his power rode over me like thousands of ants biting along my skin you smell of fear anita i didnt think a little eye shift would spook you i licked my lips staring into those mismatched eyes from inches away the eyes dont bother me then what does he asked still hovering over me i licked my lips again and didnt know what to say or rather couldnt think of a safe thing to say i thought of several smart alec remarks but you should humor crazy people when youre at their mercy its a rule of course i also had a rule never to put myself at the mercy of sadistic serial killers suffering from multiple personality disorder i hoped we all lived to regret my breaking that rule truly insane people are often unpredictable and hard to negotiate with im waiting for an answer he said in a singsong voice i just couldnt think of a good lie so i tried mild truth the fact that i was talking to orlando king and now im not but its the same body talking at me he laughed and stepped back then he went very still as if he were listening to things i couldnt hear was it the rescue this soon it couldnt be he looked down at me smiling that unpleasant smile and ran his hands down his own body i make better use of the body than orlando does okeydokey things were not improving i looked up at zeke and tried to tell him with my eyes that he should have told me that chimera was this crazy chimera grabbed my wrist jerked me close id been so busy trying to get eye contact with zeke that i hadnt even seen it coming i was always inside orlando i was that part of him that allowed him to slaughter other human beings and feel nothing but hatred he rarely took a shifter in animal form it was safer in human form and orlando was a very big believer in safety at least for himself he drew me against his body using my wrist like a handle he wasnt hurting me but the strength in his grip was like a promise a threat he could have crushed my wrist and we both knew it king had a reputation for getting the job done i said the job was to kill other people women as well as men then hed cut off their heads burn the bodies make sure they werent coming back i was the part of him that enjoyed the work and when he became what he hated most in the world i protected him from himself how i asked softly by doing the things he was too weak to do himself but still wanted done like what i asked rescue was coming it was just a matter of stalling until help arrived it had been the original plan and the fact that chimera was orlando king and crazier than a june beetle on crack didnt really change the plan just keep him talking all men love to talk about themselves even the ones who are completely buggers being insane doesnt change that or at least it never had before it was just the multiple personality stuff that was freaking me out if i treated chimera like any other homicidal maniac wed be fine at least thats what i kept telling myself my pulse stayed too fast my chest stayed tight the fear stayed high i dont think i believed myself you want to know how i helped orlando he asked i nodded yeah you really want to know what ive done for him i nodded again but i was beginning not to like the way he kept phrasing things he smiled and just the smile promised painful unpleasant things you know what they say talk is cheap let me show you anita let me show you what ive done with that he reached behind him to the doorknob turned it and pulled me into the room beyond the room was black utterly black like being flung into blindness nothingness like a cave chimera released my arm it was like being cut adrift lost in the blackness i stumbled in the darkness i reached out blindly to catch myself and touched something i grabbed at it trying to hold on to something anything then the flesh gave under my hand and i realized it was human and not where it should have been it was too high up to be someones calf i jerked back and something else brushed my back i let out a little squeal hands out stumbling in the dark and smacked into something else that swung as i hit it i realized whatever it was was hanging from the ceiling i moved away from it and ran face first into the next surprise the solid smack of flesh on flesh let me know it was a body the scream let me know it was still alive id hit hard enough that the man swung into me again and i tried to back away and bumped into another one that one didnt make any noise i kept my hands out in front of me and fought to get free of them but my hand kept touching bodies and body parts hips thighs groins buttocks i moved faster trying to force my way out of the forest of hanging bodies but moving fast made them start to swing and crash into me screams came out of the dark as if id started them all bumping into each other men screaming in the dark by the sound of the voices i knew there were no women one body hit me hard enough that i fell and dangling feet brushed against me i tried to crawl away from them but they were everywhere touching me brushing me some struggling against my back i lay down on the floor trying to get away to get clear swatting at them with my hands frantic not to be touched i crawled on my back using my feet and hands to try and get under them but their heights were all different and i couldnt get free of them i felt a scream building in my gut and knew if i screamed once id just keep on my hand landed in a pool of something warm and liquid and it stopped me even in the dark i knew what blood felt like this was probably the point where most people would have definitely started screaming but somehow the feel of the blood calmed me i knew about blood and letting it out of a man until he died i pressed my hand into that stillwarm pool and it steadied me i lay back on the floor with my hand in blood and my head resting in god knows what and relearned how to breathe if i lay very still and didnt try and move the feet didnt touch me nothing touched me so i lay in the dark and closed my eyes and tried to use my other senses because my eyes were useless ive got pretty good night vision but even a cat needs some light and there was nothing nothing but the darkness the chains creaked as the bodies still swung heavily above me there were tiny air currents a warm drop hit my cheek all the movement had started fresh bleeding from someone i kept my eyes closed and forced myself to take steady even breaths one man was screaming god god god over and over again as fast as he could draw breath hed lost it and i didnt blame him id come damn close myself and i wasnt hanging nude from the ceiling bleeding chimeras voice came out of the darkness shut up shut the fuck up the man stopped screaming almost instantly but his breath came in whimpers as if he had to make some sound anita chimera said anita where are you even he couldnt see in the pitch blackness and the smell of blood sweat and flesh masked my odor apparently great he didnt know where i was i wished i could think of something good to do with that information but i just lay in the dark on the foul floor my hand in the pool of cooling blood another drop of fresh warm blood hitting my cheek and did nothing all i had to do was stall until the cavalry arrived id tried talking to chimera and that hadnt worked so well id try silence anita anita answer me i didnt answer if he wanted to find me he could damn well turn on the light i thought i wanted some light but then i thought maybe i didnt really want to see what hung above me in this room maybe it would be one of those sights that blasts the mind one you never really recover from but i badly wanted to see something almost anything i lay in the dark the way i used to huddle under the sheets as a child afraid of the dark afraid of what i could not see answer me anita he screamed it this time voice harsh a male voice from above me answer him if you can you dont want him angry with you another man gave a sound like a choking laugh it sounded thick as if there were blood in his mouth and throat the dark was suddenly full of voices saying answer him answer him it was like the wind had found a voice and was giving me instructions in the dark another drop of blood fell on my cheek and began to slide slowly down my skin i didnt wipe it off i didnt move i was afraid any movement would let chimera know where i was and i didnt want that shut up chimera yelled and i heard him move farther into the room the voices above me fell silent but i could still feel them hanging there like weight above me like a rock ceiling pressing down on me i took a deep breath let it out slowly my claustrophobia was trying to scream in my head that i couldnt breathe but it was a lie the dark did not have weight to it that was the fear talking if chimera wanted to let me lie in the dark for the next hour until help arrived id let him i would not panic it wouldnt help anything for me to start crawling frantically across the floor with feet brushing my back if i did that i would start screaming and i wouldnt stop for a long long time the blood oozed along my neck into my hair and i kept my eyes closed and concentrated on breathing shallow quiet answer me anita or i will start cutting on the men hanging above you chimera said his voice was closer but not too close he was still outside the forest of hanging bodies i still didnt answer you dont believe me let me prove it to you a man screamed high piteous hopeless dont i said dont what dont hurt them theyre nothing to you not your animal not your friend why do you care orlando king knows the answer to your question im asking you chimera said you already know the answer i said no no orlando knows the answer i dont i dont understand why do you care about strangers the other man screamed again stop it chimera or what he asked what will you do if i dont stop what will you do if i stand here in the dark and cut pieces off this man how will you stop me the man was shrieking no dont not that nooo the scream fell off which meant the man was either dead or hed fainted i hoped hed fainted but either way i couldnt do much about it can you taste the fear anita roll it on your tongue like the strong spice it is right then my mouth was so dry i couldnt have tasted a damn thing but i could sense their fear smell it on them all of them were afraid now fresh terror pouring out of their skin its easy to scare people in the dark chimera everybodys afraid of the dark even you i avoided the question i was told if i came down here that youd let cherry and micah go i did tell zeke that and in that moment i knew he had no intention of letting them go it shouldnt have surprised me but it did had i really expected fair dealings from him maybe it offended some part of me to know that he wasnt going to do what hed said it meant all deals were off id gone from having something to bargain with to nothing just on a whim he could kill cherry and micah before help arrived my pulse was speeding up again and i fought to keep my breathing steady i took my hand out of the cooling pool of blood i might as well move hed locate me soon through my voice i laid my hands on my stomach and tried to think of what i could do unarmed against a man who outweighed me by more than a hundred pounds and was strong enough to break through brick walls nothing useful came to mind maybe violence wasnt the way to stall what did that leave sex sweet reason witty repartee dear god a little help here you dont feel the need to talk do you he asked voice calmer than it had been more normal not unless i have something to say thats unusual in a woman most of them cant stand the thought of silence they talk and talk and talk he was sounding calmer in fact he sounded like we should have been sitting across a table in some nice restaurant on a blind date since we were in a pitchblack torture room with blood on the floor the matteroffact voice was more frightening than the ranting had been he was supposed to rant and rave but calm small talk that was really crazy his voice got calmer but it never sounded exactly like orlando kings it was as if there was another voice coming out of him another personality maybe i didnt know and i didnt care if it kept him from cutting people up then yea would you like to see your leopard now the calm voice asked yes the lights exploded across my vision and i was as blind with the brilliance as i had been with the dark i put a hand over my eyes to shield them then slowly lowered it as my spotty vision cleared i was staring up at a pair of feet legs my gaze went up the line of the mans body to find fresh claw marks on his buttocks and thighs another drop of blood trailed from his bare foot to land on my hand my gaze went slowly to the next pair of legs and the next and the next dozens of men hung like obscene ornaments for the first time i let myself wonder was micah hanging somewhere in the forest of bodies do you want to stand up or are you enjoying the view from there the calm voice spoke from only about two feet away from me it made me jump badly i rolled my head back to see chimera standing two hanging men away from me ill stand if you dont mind allow me to help you he pushed one of the hanging men to the side like youd move a drape like the pale blue eyes werent open staring like the man didnt shudder as chimera touched him i was on my feet carefully avoiding the body nearest me before chimera could push aside another one and help me stand i really didnt want him to touch me chimeras eyes had bled back to human gray his face was blank ordinary that nearly diabolical smile was gone but i wasnt looking at orlando king either it was somebody else the question was was the new personality going to be more helpful or more dangerous he pushed back the bodies like holding open a door so i could walk out i let him do it but i kept my attention on him as if i expected him to try and grab me i guess i did when i stepped out into a clear space a breath went out of me that i hadnt even known i was holding chimera stepped beside me and i moved just a little away from him movement caught my attention but it was only the hanging men swinging slowly from where chimera had moved them all of them bore marks of some kind claws blades burns one of them was missing his legs below the knees i turned back to the man in front of me and i knew i looked pale i couldnt help that i hadnt screamed i hadnt panicked much i couldnt control the involuntary stuff i was having enough trouble with the voluntary where are my leopards i asked and my voice sounded almost normal i got a zillion brownie points for that your leopard is here he said and moved to a heavy white curtain that took up almost all of the near wall he pulled on a cord and the curtain parted behind it was an alcove and cherry was chained by her wrists and ankles to the stone wall a leather ball gag filled her mouth her pale eyes were wide tears stained the dried blood on her face her face looked untouched but the blood had come from somewhere shes healed everything we did to her chimera said abuta the snake appeared at chimeras side as if hed been summoned the bigger man stroked the snake mans head like youd pet a dog that you liked a lot abuta has shown quite a talent for this sort of thing i swallowed hard and tried not to get angry anger wouldnt help anyone help was coming i just had to stall until it got here i glanced around the room there were men chained to the wall all the way around i didnt recognize any of them there was a certain uniformity to them youngish or at least not old well built some slender some muscular all races all physical types all attractive i wondered how long it had taken narcissus to find this many goodlooking men micah wasnt along the wall the room in the polaroid had looked more like the alcove that cherry was in i glanced at the still unopened part of the curtain was he behind there i had moved closer to cherry without realizing it because she made a small movement in her chains and i startled i turned back to find her looking at chimera not me he hadnt moved as far as i could see but something hed done had frightened her and i finally realized what his eyes has gone animal again and that eerie smile was back it was chimera again and call it a hunch but i was betting he did most of the pain work for the other two personalities unchain her i said like i was positive hed do what i asked i so wasnt sure he reached out a hand towards her face and i grabbed his wrist unchain her he smiled that unpleasant smile at me id hate to lose one of the only women weve got up here narcissus may go both ways but he keeps the women out of his pack real spotted hyenas are matriarchal hes afraid if he brings women in that instinct will take over and hell lose his pack because hes not woman enough to keep it i always enjoy learning new zoological facts i said but lets unchain cherry and get her out of here but what of your lover what of micah i met those mismatched animal eyes and fought to keep the fear out of my face i figured you were saving him for last a sort of finale my voice had gone from calm to jaded from the tone youd have thought that it didnt matter to me one way or another but i couldnt stop my pulse from jumping in my neck his smile deepened and i watched a human expression fill those animal eyes anticipation anticipation of my pain i think he opened the curtain slowly revealing micah chained by his wrists and ankles to the wall just like cherry but unlike her his wounds hadnt healed the right side of his face had been beaten badly his eye was swollen completely shut encrusted with dried blood that delicate curve of jaw was so swollen it didnt look real the swelling had twisted his lip to one side it was so swollen that i could see the pink inside of his mouth and glimpse teeth where his mouth no longer closed completely i heard a small sound and it was me it was close to a sob and i couldnt afford that if chimera knew how much this cut me up hed just hurt micah more i couldnt stop myself from touching him i had to touch him because only then would he be real to me seeing was never quite believing with me i touched my fingertips to the whole side of his face his good eye fluttered open there was a moment of relief then i think he saw chimera and his eye widened he tried to speak but couldnt open his mouth he made small hurt noises chimera touched his bruises lightly but micah winced anyway i grabbed his wrist as i had for cherry and moved my body in between the two men unchain him i broke his jaw personally for lying to me he didnt lie to you i said he told me you were going to be a panwere like me but youre not he leaned into me sniffing id smell it if you were youre something and its not human it smells of leopard and wolf he took a deep breath just above the skin of my face but it also smells like vampire you arent what i am anita he looked at micah he was just trying to keep me from hurting him or his cats after he saved you from my people when they came to your house so im not a panwere does that mean you dont want me for your mate he laughed then oh i dont know i enjoy rape adds spice i think he said it just to shock me but i wasnt sure had he raped cherry had he touched her i tried to keep the thought off my face because with the thought came a white hot wash of anger oh you dont like that idea do you he tried to touch my hair and i stepped away from him out of the alcove so id have room to maneuver help was on its way but a glance at my watch showed another twenty minutes of the hour still left maybe the troops would come sooner maybe they wouldnt i couldnt afford to count on it he didnt try and follow me just let me inch away i could rape you in front of micah i dont think either of you would like that though truthfully i might prefer it the other way around orlando is homophobic i wonder why that would be i spoke as i inched down the curtain drawing him away from cherry and micah we dislike most in others what we hate most in ourselves i said bravo chimera said yes i keep a lot of orlando safe from orlando that must be hard i said what he asked keeping secrets when you share the same body he followed me slowly around the edge of the wall at first he didnt want to know what we did but lately hes become unhappy with us i think hed have done himself harm if i hadnt stopped him chimera motioned towards the hanging men he woke up in the dark in the middle of them he screamed like a girl chimera put his fingers to his lips and said oops excuse me you didnt scream at all he screamed like a baby until i came and rescued him but he didnt seem all that grateful like he blamed me chimera looked puzzled and again i had that impression that he was listening to things i couldnt hear he stared at me do you hear that i widened my eyes at him and shrugged what he looked off past the hanging men and i looked around for a weapon all this damage and cutting people up there had to be a blade around here somewhere but the room stretched white and empty except for the chained men werent there supposed to be pokers maces fucking weapons what kind of dungeon was this victims but no instruments of torture i heard it then screams fighting the battle was on though it was still distant the good news was that help was on its way the bad news was that chimera knew what was happening and i was alone with him alright not alone but nobody chained to the stone was going to be able to help me he turned a face so full of rage to me that it was almost bestial without any shifting of form why did you take all the alphas i asked i was still going to try and keep him talking it was all i had so i could rule their groups his words came out low and growling through clenched teeth your snakes are anacondas the alpha you took was a cobra you cant rule over a type of snake youre not why not he asked and he started to stalk towards me still in human form but with that tense grace that is more animal than human i didnt have a good answer for that one are the alphas alive he shook his head i hear fighting anita what have you done i havent done anything youre lying i can smell it okay maybe truth would help the sounds you hear are the cavalry riding to the rescue who he asked voice almost pure growl he was still stalking towards me and i was still backing up rafael and his wererats probably the werewolves by now there are hundreds of werehyenas in this building your cavalry cannot get through them in time to save you i shrugged afraid to tell the truth afraid hed take it out on the werehyenas lovers and i didnt dare try to lie hed smell it so i just kept backing up we were almost to the door if i could get it open maybe hed chase me maybe i could lead him into an ambush of my own abuta moved in front of the door id forgotten him and that was careless not fatal not yet but careless i pressed my back to the wall so i could keep an eye on both of them abuta stayed by the door the message clear that if i kept away from the door hed keep away from me chimera on the other hand kept stalking closer i was between a panwere and a snake not actually a rock and a hard place but close chimera flowed into his other form ive seen shapeshifters change for years and it was always violent or messy but this this was almost breathtaking scales flowed over him as if they were water there was no clear fluid no blood nothing but the change as if he stepped from one form into another like clark kent changes into superman it was so quick it was almost instantaneous he didnt even miss a step his clothes folded away like the petals of a flower falling to the earth and he stepped out in the snake form of coronus the big snake man stopped moving he froze in that stillness that reptiles love i froze when he did he finally turned his head so he could look at me with a copper eye it must have played hell with his depthperception having to do that i remember you chimera told us to kill you he looked around at the dark room and said slowly where are we then he bent over as if in pain and the next form was human but not orlandos body he was boone and before boones eyes had lost their confused look he was a lion man for a second i thought it would be marco but of course he couldnt be both marco and coronus not even chimera could pull that one off he was golden tawny muscled masculine with a mane around his halfhuman face that was almost black the claws on his hands were like black daggers this form is truly mine he growled the snake and the bear are like orlando they still believe in themselves but i am all there is and there is nothing but chimera he reached for me and i bolted i ran towards the hanging men because i knew theyd slow him down then turned at the last second so fast i fell on the ground and skittered away on hands and feet like a monkey they would slow him down but hed cut them up to get at me i couldnt let that happen he cornered me on the far side of the room farthest away from the door and micah i think he could have caught me sooner but he wasnt rushing i dont know why the sounds of fighting were closer but not close enough chimera came at me like grace contained in violence a mountain of tawny muscle and fur that gleamed in the lights he opened his mouth and roared a sound id never heard outside of a zoo before that coughing roar made me stand a little straighter zeke and bacchus had promised to come get us out of here before the rest of the fighting started theyd failed or lied but i wasnt going down without a fight and i wasnt going down screaming i watched him come towards me like a slowmotion nightmare beautiful and terrible like some kind of beastial angel suddenly the ardeur rose inside me like a warm wave spilling along my skin drawing a gasp from my throat the last time it had risen because of richards nearness this time maybe it was just time to feed again the moment i thought feed i knew jeanclaude had awakened and with his rising down in the depths of the circus the ardeur had risen inside me chimera stopped where he was shaking his great maned head what is that he growled my voice came breathy the ardeur the what the ardeur the fire the need i said with each word the ardeur grew like a weight and that weight brushed against my beast it spilled upward from that tight curled place inside me and the two separate heats rose up inside spilling along my body drawing me forward towards chimera i wasnt afraid of him anymore because i could smell his fear you never had to be afraid of anything that was afraid of you part of me knew that wasnt true that a scared man with a gun is more likely to shoot you than a brave one but the parts of me that were able to think were sliding away leaving behind only instinct what was left liked the smell of fear it reminded me of food and sex chimera backed away and we began a slow walk back the way wed come this time with me advancing slowly on him i stalked him as hed stalked me and part of me noticed that i was placing my feet one atop the other almost stepping in my own footsteps like a cat the walk was oddly graceful swaying my hips my spine was very straight shoulders back arms almost motionless at my sides but there was a tension running through my upper body an anticipation of action of violence always before the ardeur had overridden the beasts hunger but as i stalked chimera watched that huge muscular form back away from me it was meat i was thinking of teeth and claws flesh to rend to bite to tear i could almost taste his blood hot almost scalding in my mouth down my throat it wasnt just my beasts hunger but jeanclaudes blood thirst and richards craving for flesh it was all that and the ardeur running through all of it so that one hunger fed into the next in an endless chain a snake eating its own tail an ouroboros of desires chimera stopped running pressing himself up against the white curtain we were almost back to cherry and micah there was solid wall behind chimera behind the curtain what are you he asked in a voice that was strangled full of the fear that rose off of him in waves he scented the air nostrils flaring you dont even smell the same what do i smell like i touched his chest with just my fingertips not sure what hed do but he didnt pull away i pressed my palm over his heart and felt that thick heavy beat rise against my hand as if i could have caressed it like running your hand over the head of a drum i knew in that moment what he wanted most of all he wanted to die whoever was at the core whatever was left of who orlando king had been he wanted to end it hed been trying to kill himself since the moment he learned he was going to be a werewolf hed never changed his mind he just couldnt bring himself to commit suicide not directly anyway i leaned in close to him pressing our bodies together lightly both hands on his chest ill help you i whispered help me how but his voice was fearful as if he already knew pain lanced through my chest my knees collapsed and chimera caught me carefully in those clawed hands i think it was an automatic gesture i saw through richards eyes for a moment saw a werehyena snarling in his face felt the claws ripping through his chest the pain was sharp bones breaking then numbness and richard didnt fight it he let the numbness roll over him i knew in that instant that richard wanted to die or rather he didnt want to live as he was the pain had made him reach out for me but his hands were slow slow to defend himself he would never admit hed let himself die but he wanted it and it made him slow slow enough to have the hyena man carve his chest open like cracking a melon shangda was there pulling the hyena off of him then i was back in my own body airborne thrown into the curtain and the alcove beyond the curtain cushioned some of the fall and the last remnants of richards numbness made my body limp so it didnt really hurt i lay for a second in a spill of curtain my hand brushed outward and hit metal i raised the edge of the curtain and found that this alcove was full of weapons id found the blades chimera had thrown me into them and the shock of richards injury had squelched the ardeur my hand closed on a knife that was longer than my forearm i raised it to the light and knew silver when i saw it the ardeur was gone without my feeding it and i was armed life was good then i heard the sound of claws or blades in flesh a thick tearing sound of something sharp going through meat you hear the sound often enough you know what it is i could see the hanging men from here and they were untouched my stomach clenched tight and cold because i knew where chimera was i just didnt know which of them he was cutting up i pushed the curtain away from me started to stand and abuta was in front of me i kept one hand balled in the curtain and flung it at him he did what anyone would do he flinched and i drove the silver blade through the middle of his body angling up hunting for the heart abuta screamed hand reaching back towards where chimera was cutting up my people he said something in a language i didnt understand as his body collapsed i kept twisting the blade trying to find his damn heart but the blade was stuck on his ribs and wider than my usual knives it wouldnt move where i wanted it to go i got a glimpse of a goldencolored blur moments before chimera smashed a hand into me and sent me flying back into the hanging men i hit solid and they cried out then i was on the ground trying to relearn how to breathe his arm had taken me across one shoulder and it was numb from the impact chimera knelt over the snake man cradling him in his arms movement turned my gaze towards micah and cherry the front of cherrys body was bloody ribbons as if hed racked claws down either side of her as deep as he could go as much damage as he could do in as little time as possible her ruined chest rose and fell frantically she was alive micahs body was spilled open like something ripe that had been thrown against a wall his intestines glittered like something separate and alive i could see things inside his body that were never meant to see the light of day he convulsed jerking against the chains i screamed and something about my panic opened me to richard again he was lying on the floor downstairs and he was dying and more than that i felt that his giving up had hurt the wolves he was their ulfric their heart and their head and his will was weak and it made them weak the hyenas and the halfmen that fought for chimera were fighting for what they believed in or fighting for the ones they loved the wolves had nothing but richards willingness to die and i knew in that moment that if he died like that it wouldnt just be jeanclaude and me who would join him it would be all the wolves something had gone terribly wrong with bacchus and zekes plan the hyenas and the halfmen would slaughter our pack all of them all of them would die i screamed again and chimera was in front of me one hand balled in my shirt his claws ripping shallow wounds in my upper chest he drew the other hand back and time seemed to slow i had all the time in the world to decide what to do and yet i had no time left i felt richards breath rattling in his chest felt him begin to die micahs body gave one last shudder then he went very still i screamed wordless reaching for something anything to save them my power came my power and the one thing i could do to save us all it was one of the worst things id ever seen done and i didnt hesitate i didnt call my power there was no time i became my power it flowed up through me instantly spilled into my hands i touched one hand to the furred arm that held me then blocked his other arm as it swept down towards me in a blur of motion blocked the blow and swept my free hand up over chimeras arm so that both my hands touched his arms the moment enough of me touched enough of him i called the power id learned in new mexico when i raised a zombie i put energy into the corpse helped what lay in the grave to be solid and real this was the reverse of that i took energy out sucked it away made the lion man less real less alive the fur flowed under my hands until i touched human skin it was orlando kings body that collapsed to its knees in front of me orlandos eyes that raised horrified gray to search my face to beseech me maybe but he never asked me to stop and truthfully i wasnt sure i knew how to stop he started to scream just before his skin began to run with fine lines like watching decades catch up with him in one fell swoop i fed on him fed on his essence fed on what he was it rushed through my body thrilling along my skin singing through my bones cascading in a rush of joy through every fiber of my being and beyond i felt the energy flow outward to micah down that link that made me want to touch him every time we were close the power found richard and made him breathe it spilled outward to all the wolves and they were no longer dependent on richards broken will they had mine and i wanted to live i wanted us all to live we would live we would live and our enemies would die i willed it so i made it so i used orlando kings life to fill my leopards my wolves and distantly my vampires with will will to live to fight to survive and through all of it orlando king shrieked he screamed as his body drained away into my hands his skin was like dirty tissue paper on skeleton sticks when i finally let him go he collapsed on his side that large body turned to something light as air but still he screamed one ragged horror of a sound after another and i felt no pity i felt only the rush of power like a flight of bird wings inside my head micah was beside me in black furred leopard man form the center of his body was whole healed only partially due to his shifting a huge spotted leopard the size of a pony stalked around us hissing at what was left of orlando cherry was whole in her furred coat not even bloody i must have stood there longer than i knew draining orlando kings life away long enough for them to tear the chains off long enough for them to shapeshift and heal the hanging men were changing form too and with the change they broke their chains healed most of the damage that had been done to them and dropped to the ground in spotted fur and claws they sniffed around what was left of orlando they gave strange barking sounds as the thing continued to scream micahs voice came furry rough with his new shape your eyes are like a nightfilled sky with stars in it i didnt need to see a mirror to know what he meant my eyes were black swimming and dark with the distant glow of stars in that darkness obsidian butterflys eyes had been like that and my eyes had mirrored hers after she touched me with her power the far door opened and the wolves poured in shangda and jamil were holding richard between them he was still in human form still refusing to shift and help the power heal him the wolves some in human form some not came to touch me lick me abase themselves before me they growled and snapped at the dried thing that still screamed on the floor jamil and shangda helped richard around the room until he stood facing me and micah it was only when he was that close that i realized his eyes were black with the play of cold stars in them too i wondered if jeanclaudes eyes looked the same and a thought let me know that it was so jeanclaude was basking in the rush of power richard stared at me like id run over his mother the pain on his face had nothing to do with the healing wounds id taken just a little bit more of his humanity or so he felt he gazed down at the screaming thing on the floor with those black starfilled eyes and said how could you do it i did what i had to do i said he was shaking his head i didnt want to live this badly i did micah said the two men looked at each other yellowgreen eyes to black something seemed to pass between them then richard looked back at me is he dying not exactly he closed his eyes and i got a glimpse inside him before he threw up his shields it wasnt the horror that made him blanch it was the fact that the power rush had felt better than almost anything else hed ever experienced then the shields tightened but his eyes stayed a swimming blackness get me out of here he said change shape richard heal yourself i said he just shook his head no damn it richard he just said no then jamil and shangda helped him towards the door i watched him go but didnt try and call him back i did my best to ignore him as i knelt by the skeletal thing that id made out of orlando king i knew how to give him back his energy and that too would have been a rush in its own way but orlando wanted to die and chimera was too dangerous to be kept alive i did what orlando wanted and i passed judgment on chimera i called my magic one more time and spilled it into that struggling screaming thing and i released the soul it fluttered past me like an invisible bird and the body gave that long harsh breath that is often the very last sound orlando king died unrecognizable unless you had dental records micah helped me to my feet he was back in human form before id seen chimera i would have said that micahs change was smoother than anyones id ever seen he pulled me into the circle of his arms and i pressed my face against the bare skin of his neck caught the scent of his skin and the ardeur welled up inside me as if it had been waiting goosebumps ran up his bare arms and he gave a nervous laugh i dont know if im up to it ive had a hard day i wrapped my arms around his back pressed my face against his chest to hear the beating of his heart strong and steady and for no reason that i could figure out i started to cry and the ardeur flowed away on a wash of tears and hands hands not just micahs but hands of wolves hyenas and the leopards that had disobeyed me and come for the fight and finally zeke and the halfmen who had joined him they all touched me marked me with their scent their tears their laughter we laughed and cried howled and roared made every noise you could make richard missed a hell of a victory party epilogue richard did make me his bцlverk but i was no longer his girlfriend im not even sure im upset about that hes free to find another lupa though im not sure the pack will agree with him they seem to like me just fine as bцlverk of the thronnos rokke clan my first order of business was to execute jacob paris is still alive at richards insistence i think its a mistake but he is ulfric oh well i did not turn furry with the full moon apparently jeanclaude was right about the leopards being my animal to call just as damian is my vampire servant im gaining powers like a master vampire go figure the snake men and marco died during the fighting the remainder of chimeras people have joined their appropriate animal groups we have a shapeshifter coalition to promote better understanding among the groups im chairman though i tried not to be micah and his pard stayed in town micah and i are still dating if you can call sharing a bed and my house dating but i havent left jeanclaude im dating them both i am jeanclaudes human servant and i cant hide from that anymore jeanclaude wasnt horrified by what i did to orlando king either he was pleased pleased we won pleased we all survived he and micah seem to be getting along so far i keep waiting for the other shoe to drop and all hell to break loose between them but so far so good we rescued joseph the lions rex and his wife is still pregnant four months and counting a record narcissus turned out to be a hermaphrodite and hes pregnant too im not sure narcissus should be breeding especially knowing who the father is but its not my choice the cobras king and son were both dead killed after chimera had broken them i wake up pressed between micah and nathaniel you cant feed the ardeur off of the same person every day not even a lycanthrope thats why they used to say that succubi and incubuses killed their victims you can literally love someone to death so i feed on micah and nathaniel micah as my nimirraj and nathaniel as my pomme de sang no im not having intercourse with nathaniel both of them seem peaceful with the arrangement though im still a little weirded out by it im still hoping the ardeur is temporary belle mortes people contacted jeanclaude theyre negotiating for musette one of belles lieutenants to come for a visit the mention of musettes name made asher and jeanclaude go pale ronnie is horrified that i came so close to getting killed but it hasnt made her any more reasonable on the subject of my love life were back to not seeing a whole lot of each other maybe micah can be my new workout partner no pun intended i still love richard but it doesnt matter it wont work he cant accept what he is or what i am neither of us can change our nature and i dont even want to anymore micah accepts me for what i am all of me he loves me from my toy penguin collection to my coldblooded practicality he doesnt mind bodies on the ground and neither does jeanclaude i hope richard makes peace with himself someday but its not really my problem anymore ill keep the pack safe with or without him as for the rest if i wake up to silk sheets i know im at jeanclaudes place if i wake up on pure cotton sheets im at home but wherever i am micah is beside me i go to sleep against the smooth warmth of him breathing in the honeyed sweetness of his skin sometimes the sheets smell of jeanclaudes cologne sometimes they dont sometimes micahs body bears two neat fang marks and i feel jeanclaude in his coffin settling down for the day content and wellfed full of my sex and micahs blood life really is good even if you are dead
