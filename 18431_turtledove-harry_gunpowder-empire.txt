harry turtledove gunpowder empire one when jeremy solters found a note from his mother in his lunchbox he started to laugh he couldnt help it so many ways she might have got hold of himemail to his handheld email to his desktop voicemail to his phone a tingle on the implant behind his ear but what did she pick the most primitive comm mode she could find and the one most likely to go wrong that was mom all right maybe shed spent too much time out in the alternates she forgot to use technology when she had it at her fingertips he unfolded the note and made sense of her scrawl stop at the store on the way home and pick up two kilos of apples she wrote jeremy laughed again and reread the note to make sure he had it right he supposed he should have been glad she hadnt talked about pounds and ounces he never could remember which was bigger and he supposed he should have been glad shed remembered to write in english he could have read neolatin but if shed used koine or great serbian or any of the indic languages she wouldnt have got her precious apples whats that michael fujikawa asked as jeremy wadded up the piece of paper and tossed it in the direction of the trash can note from my mom if you can believe it jeremy told his friend the crumpled note bounced off the front of the trash can jeremy sighed he unfolded from his perch on a concrete bench picked up the paper and threw it out he was tall and skinny but hed never made the canoga park high basketball team this wasnt the first time hed proved he couldnt shoot michael only nodded oh yeah he said he was short and kind of round most of jeremys friends were short and kind of round he sometimes wondered if that meant anything before he could do more than start to wonder now michael went on my dad will do the same thing when he comes home from an alternate its like he has trouble remembering hes at the end of the twentyfirst century not stuck in a fifteenthcentury equivalent or whatever maybe thats it jeremy agreed i was thinking the same thing about mom the sun beat down on him it was only may but it was supposed to get up past thirty today the valley was like that when real summer came it could climb over forty for a week at a time jeremy ate his sandwich and his yogurt and an orange from a palestine that hadnt seen a century and a half of murder and war that palestine was a sleepy turkish province where nothing much ever happened the oranges and lemons were especially fine there he didnt know whether that was better or worse than the palestine in his own world it sure was different though michaels lunch had a couple of golden plums of a sort jeremy hadnt seen before he pointed to the one his friend was eating whered that come from he asked safeway michael said unhelpfully thanks a lot jeremy told him which world did it come from i mean its not one of ours is it i dont think so michael said but i dont know which alternate its from all i know is dad brought it home when he did the shopping the other day half the time the store labels dont tell anyhow theyre supposed to jeremy said the epa gets on em if they dont well the epas pretty dumb if it bothers about these theyre good michael ate all the flesh off the plum he tossed the pit at the trash can it went in he was a good shot he took the second plum out of its plastic bag jeremy hoped for a taste but michael ate it all he liked his food which was no doubt why he stayed round the lunch bell rang just after michael finished the plum he jumped up i have to go to my locker i left my history paper in there and ms mouradian doesnt let you print new ones in class jeremy nodded sympathetically shes strict all right ive got mine he slung his notebook and his handheld under his arm and headed off for us history see you there his grandfather told stories about lugging around a backpack full of ten or fifteen kilos worth of books when he went to high school it wasnt so much that jeremy didnt believe him he just thought old people remembered things as being much better or much worse than they really were depending on what kind of message they wanted to get across boys and girls hurried through the dark narrow halls canoga park high was almost years old some of the buildings were newer replacing ones knocked down in the earthquake of or the bigger one of but a lot of them went all the way back to the s as far as jeremy could see they hadnt known much about how to make schools back then of course compared to what people in the alternates had this was heaven but that wasnt how most kids looked at it jeremy didnt look at it like that most of the time himself he compared canoga park high to new schools fancy schools next to them it didnt make the grade michael fujikawa slidskidded reallyinto his seat just ahead of the late bell ms mouradian sent him a fishy stare that was all she could do though he had beaten the bell she said now that were all hereanother fishy look for michaelwe need to push only a couple of weeks left in the semester and we still have a lot of ground to cover first things first pass your homework papers to the front of the room jeremy pulled his paper from his notebook he sent it forward looking relieved that hed remembered his michael did the same ms mouradian snatched up the homework with impatience she couldnt hide jeremy almost laughed but managed to hold it in hed never had a history class where they didnt cover the last part of the material at a mad gallop ms mouradian said yesterday we talked about how energy problems started showing up as early as the s jeremys desktop came to life it showed him a long line of incredibly oldfashionedlooking cars in front of a gas station just as far outofdate the history teacher went on things only got worse as time went on by the time we reached the s our oil reserves really did start running dry the way people had said they would for years nobody knew what to do many feared that civilization would collapse from lack of energy lack of transport lack of food the desktop showed skinny people plundering a truck outside a supermarket jeremys grandfather talked about those days too jeremy hadnt taken him too seriously till he found out on his own how bad things had been the video on the desktop looked a lot better than the stuff from the s it had started out digital it wasnt so grainy and the color and sound were better jeremy felt more as if he were really there not watching something from ancient history what caused the change ms mouradian asked why dont we have troubles like those now a dozen hands shot into the air at the same time jeremys was one of them behind him a girl said why doesnt she ask easy ones like that all the time two or three people couldnt stand knowing and not saying before ms mouradian could call on anybody they shouted out the answer the alternates she nodded thats right the alternates without the work of galbraith and hester the world would be a very different place when she suddenly smiled she didnt look a whole lot older than the kids in her class and thats what the alternates are all about isnt it look at your desktops please jeremy did even though hed already seen this video a million times there were samaki galbraith and liz hester announcing their discovery to a startled world he was tall and black and dignified she was a little redhead who bounced and squeaked excited at what theyd found considering what it was shed earned the right too then the desktop cut away from the chronophysicists it showed some of the worlds theyd foundworlds where things had gone differently from the way theyd happened here jeremy had seen a lot of these videos too here was footage from a world where the vikings had settled north america here was one where successors of alexander the great ruled half a dozen empires that stretched from spain to the borders of china here were gaudy pictures from a world where civilization in the old world had got off to a later start than it had here so the native american cultures were the most advanced anywhere here was a triumphal procession through the streets of rome in a world where the roman empire hadnt fallen jeremy smiled when that one came up his folks spent a lot of their time trading there he and his sister went there too sometimes the locals needed to see a whole family it added realism and here quickly one after another were worlds with breakpoints closer to hereandnow here were spaniards with bayoneted flintlocks swaggering through a town on the border between their empire and russia in a world where the armada conquered england here was a race riot in a town that didnt look too different from the ones jeremy knew but where the confederate flag flew and here was one in a world where nobody had discovered atomic energy the united states and the soviet union were fighting world war vi there right this minute the desktop went blank jeremy knew how many more alternates it might have shown the one where the chinese had discovered the americas the one where the united states was a contented part of a british empire that covered threequarters of the globe the nasty one where the germans had won world war i the even nastier one where theyd won world war ii and on and on ms mouradian said how did finding the alternates change things for us again a lot of hands went up again jeremys was one of them nobody yelled out the answer this time though it wasnt so simple the teacher pointed at him jeremy we arent limited to the resources of one world any more he answered we can get food and raw materials and ideas from a lot of different places a little from here a little from there we dont take enough from any alternate world to hurt it hed known all that stuff long before he took this class with his mom and dad both working for crosstime traffic he had to ms mouradian knew where his folks worked maybe that was why shed picked him to answer she nodded when he was done thats good she said and what are some of the problems weve had since we started traveling to the alternates jeremy raised his hand one more time he didnt want ms mouradianor anybody elseto think he didnt know there were problems she didnt call on him again though she picked michael fujikawa instead his folks worked for crosstime traffic too he said probably contamination is the worst one thats right the history teacher said please look at your desktops again jeremy looked down he saw the video he thought he would there were long lines of people waiting to get shots for hruskas disease an early explorer had brought it back from a world that was offlimits now there were also pictures of the blank idiotic stares on the faces of people whod come down with the illness then the desktop showed some of the plant and animal diseases and parasites that had come back here from other alternates a girl named elena ramos raised her hand when ms mouradian called on her she said the other big problem is keeping people in the alternates from knowing were visiting them oh yes the teacher nodded again that is the other important one wherever we go where theres civilization we have to keep the secret thats why we always pretend to be part of the world where we trade some alternates are advanced enough that they might be able to use the technology if they got their hands on it that could be very very dangerous the desktop showed another clip from the world where the nazis had won the second world war it wasnt pretty ms mouradian went on that rule is also why we drill for oil and do our mining on alternates where there are only hunters and gatherers or else worlds without any people at all on worlds like those we dont have to hide on the desktop oil rigs stood like steel skeletons in the middle of a vast golden desert antelope with enormous horns watched wondering what the fuss was about an oil worker in grimy coveralls walked up to one and stroked its nose it stood there and let him it had never learned to be afraid of men in that alternate there were no men to be afraid of the antelope disappeared from the desktop jeremy sighed and he wasnt the only one ms mouradian said now were going to go over some of the supreme court decisions that center on crosstime travel jeremy sighed again on a different note again he wasnt the only one amanda solters stood under the awning at canoga park high she stayed out of the sun while she waited for the bus and for her brother to show up she hoped jeremy would get there before the bus did his last class this year was on the far side of campus so sometimes he cut things close while she waited she checked her handheld to see what she had to do tonight she made a face at the thought of algebra homework that was oldfashioned boring drill and practice she had to understand what she was doing to get it right it wasnt like a foreign language where she could soak it up in a few sessions with the implant shed learned spanish that way and french and neolatin and classical latin for trips out to the alternate with her parents and jeremy here he came as usual half a head taller than most of the kids around him hed tried out for the basketball team the autumn before but he hadnt even got onto the jvs being tall wasnt enough you had to be able to run and shoot too he spotted her and waved amanda was tall herself for a girlone meter seventythree centimeters her grandfather who was oldfashioned as well as old sometimes said she was five feet ten that meant next to nothing to her any more than pounds or quarts or degrees fahrenheit did weve got to stop at the store and get apples amanda said importantly when her brother came up he started to laugh she scowled at him whats so funny did mom leave a note in your lunchbox too he asked she left me one all right amanda said you mean she gave em to both of us her brother nodded she sure did why didnt she just carve the message on a rock and leave it here at the bus stop amanda said sometimes i think shes even more stuck in her ways than grandpa is i wouldnt be surprised jeremy pointed up the street here comes the bus it was oldfashioned too the school district couldnt afford anything newer and cleaner it burned natural gas which meant it spewed carbon dioxide into the air most vehicles these days were either electric or ran on fuel cells that gave off only clean water vapor global warming hadnt stopped but it had slowed down they got on the bus as soon as it was full the driver pulled off the side street where shed picked up her passengers and turned north onto topanga canyon boulevard the bus rattled almost enough to drown out the trills of telephones as friends on other buses and in cars started catching up with people here kids on the bus made calls too back in the old days amandas grandfather said everybody could listen to everybody else talking she had trouble imagining that it sounded like an amazing nuisance throat mikes let people keep conversations private the way they were supposed to be jeremys phone trilled as the bus rolled past the green of lanark park on one side of the street and the rival green of an old old nursery on the other his lips moved his adams apple bounced up and down all amanda could hear was a faint mumbling with no real words like everybody else she and jeremy had learned to use throat mikes before they got out of elementary school she had to poke jeremy when the bus stopped in front of the safeway apples she said he nodded and got up he kept right on talking while they got off the bus probably michael amanda thought he and her brother had been best friends since the second grade when she and jeremy went into the store he asked did moms note to you say what kind of apples she wanted i wish amanda exclaimed nowere on our own you could have too many choices amanda saw that when she walked into the produce department this was a big store even for a safeway it tried to stock some of everything as far as fruits and vegetables were concerned it couldnt it couldnt even come close still as amanda peeled a plastic bag off a roll she looked at a couple of dozen different kinds of apples all in neat bins she eyed red ones golden ones green ones golden ones with reddish blushes red ones streaked with gold green ones streaked with gold the sign above one bin said raised right here so you know what goes into them other signs announced the alternates from which those apples had come amanda pointed to a bin full of apples that were almost the same color as the navel oranges across the aisle from them what are these theyre weird jeremy said he was suspicious of unfamiliar food amanda wasnt lets try them she picked out two nice ones and dropped them into the bag even though petroleum didnt get burned much any more it still had a million uses making every kind of plastic under the sun was one of the most important as if to make up for the orange apples strangeness jeremy chose two golden deliciouses from the raised right here bin he pulled off a bag of his own in went the apples even so he pointed at the sign and said thats really lame were so mixed up with the alternates by now who can tell what started out here and what didnt and who cares anyway some people dont like anything new some people probably didnt like tv and telephones when they were first starting up amanda said she took an apple from a different bin her brother grabbed another one too i know i know they ought to look at what things are like in some of the alternates that would teach them a lesson i doubt it amanda said people like that dont learn lessons dont i wish you were wrong jeremy put another apple in his sack how much have we got they set both bags of apples on the tray of a produce scale and added fruit till they had two kilos then they took the bags to the express checkout line the checker gave them a dirty look why didnt you buy all the same kind he said because we like different kinds amanda answered but they all have different prices per kilo the checker grumbled jeremy probably would have got angry by himself amanda only smiled which worked better the checker muttered something but he pulled out his handheld so he could see which kind cost what he looked at the total on the register it comes to dollars here amanda gave him five benjamins a fiftydollar piece and a smaller tendollar coin he ran the benjamins through a reader to make sure they were genuine then put them and the coins in the register he gave her back three little aluminum dollars she stuck them in the hip pocket of her shorts jeremy grabbed the apples come on he said looking at his watch therell be a northbound bus in five minutes they crossed the street and caught the bus it wasnt a school bus so they had to pay dollars each for the ride from the stop where they got off it was two blocks to their house a squirrel was nibbling something under the mulberry tree in the front yard fafhrd watched it wistfully from a window the big red tabby was an indoor cat that kept him safe from cars and dogs and the occasional raccoon and coyote to say nothing of fleas and other cats with bad tempers he still knew what he was supposed to hunt though every line of his body said if i ever get the chance that squirrel is dinner poor thing amanda said as she walked up the brick path to the front door she didnt mean it fafhrd was an indoor cat because the last one theyd had hadnt looked both ways before he crossed the street she opened the door she and her brother hadnt even got out of the front hall when their mother called from the kitchen did you remember the apples yes mother amanda said and then under her breath i knew she was going to do that jeremy nodded raising her voice again amanda went on why didnt you call when we were on the bus to make sure shed intended that for sarcasm her mom took it literally well i was going to she said but your aunt beth called me just then and i got to talking with her i forgot what time it was till i saw you out front im glad you remembered all by yourselves shed never believe they werent still four years old as they took the apples into the kitchen fafhrd rubbed against their ankles and tried to get them to trip over him amanda bent down and scratched behind his whiskers he purred for fifteen seconds or so then trotted away yes she still adored him that was all hed needed to know what kind did you get their mother asked when they plopped the apples on the kitchen table melissa solters looked like an older shorter version of amanda jeremy got his lighter brown hair and eyes that were hazel instead of brown from their father you didnt say you wanted any kind in particular so we bought a bunch of different ones he said now dont be ridiculous mom said apples dont grow in bunches amanda waved a finger at her i knew you were going to do that mom made silly jokes dad on the other hand made puns amanda had never decided which was worse havent seen these funnycolored ones before mom said peering into the bag they must be from a newly opened alternate orange you glad we got them jeremy asked deadpan he took after dad in more ways than looks amanda felt like taking after him preferably with a baseball bat how was school today mom asked either she hadnt noticed what jeremy had said or she was pretending she hadnt sometimes it was one sometimes the other amanda could never be sure which okay she answered i got an aminus on my lit paper in my day mom shook her head theyve tightened up since my day most people got as then an aminus meant you werent doing so well whats the point of having grades if everybody gets the same thing amanda asked i dont know i guess thats why they tightened up its not the first time theyve had to do it either mom said getting rid of grade inflation they call it the other kind of inflation the kind with money just goes on and on when your grandfather was little a dollar was worth almost as much as a benjamin is now amanda thought about bygone days when people got good grades without working hard she thought about even more distant days when dollars were real money instead of afterthoughts in small change the only answer she could see was that shed been born in the wrong time the last day of school was always a halfday when the final bell rang at twenty past twelve soft whoopsand a couple that werent so softcame from every corner of jeremys homeroom have a great summer the teacher said see you in september out trooped the students they were saying have a great summer too and see you senior year and see you online and all the other things jeremy had said and heard ever since the first grade somebody from another class started singing no more stylus no more screen no more teacherstheyre obscene other boys and girlsmostly boysjoined in right away people always did jeremy couldnt see why kids escaping school had probably sung that song since the days of the pyramids jeremy waved to michael fujikawa who was coming out of a room a few doors down when they were smaller theyd got together almost every day during summer vacation not now now it was see you in september they both said it at the same time and not just because they didnt live two houses apart any more good luck in your alternate jeremy added same to you michael said his parents traded in an asiandominated alternate world the same as jeremys did in agrippan rome in the alternate where the fujikawas worked chinese fleets had kept europeans out of the indian ocean trade patterns and all later history were very different there these days japanese warlords dominated china in that alternate as german warlords had dominated the roman empire here michael went on itll be good getting back im starting to know people over there too jeremy nodded so am i but its not the same it cant be the same too many things we know but we cant tell them yeah michael walked on for a few steps then he said friends are one thing i wonder what happens if you fall in love in an alternate people have jeremy said they say people have anyway its usually supposed to be a mess i dont see how it can be anything else he didnt even want to think about that instead he changed the subject i miss the days when we could fool around together all summer long me too text messages just arent the same michael said i wish there was bandwidth enough for video between alternates there isif youre a gazillionaire jeremy said that disgusted him if you were rich enough you could get whatever you wanted if you werent you had to put up with email as primitive as it had been a hundred years earlier even stillphoto attachments were iffy well be glad to see each other when school starts thats all michael said sure jeremy nodded again you be careful you hear that wasnt idle advice michael was going to a violent place what warlords there wanted they reached out and took people who didnt like it could easily end up dead you too michael told him me dont worry about me ill be fine jeremy laughed hardly anything ever happens in agrippan rome the empires more than two thousand years old there and theyve spent all that time making it more complicated you have to fill out sixteen different forms before you can swat a fly let alone catch a mouse he was exaggerating but only a little be careful anyway michael said if youre not careful you get in trouble jeremys folks always said the same thing he didnt mind it so much from his friend michael pointed theres your sister he waved hi amanda when he and jeremy were smaller hed done his best not to notice her now he was polite hi michael she said and then started no more stylus no more screen not you too jeremy broke in why not amanda said they sing the same kind of song in polisso where were going she started a chant in neolatin in my alternate too michael said and sang in the japanesechinese pidgin merchants used there that didnt mean anything to jeremy whod never soaked up the language through his implant michael had taught him a few phrases most of them dirty but he didnt hear any of those hed done the same for his friend with neolatin which was an excellent language to swear in here comes our bus jeremy amanda said last time this year i like that everybody likes that michael said jeremy grabbed his hand before getting on the bus with amanda well message back and forth all the time sure michael said see you so long amanda so long amanda said as she and jeremy climbed into the bus she added in a low voice i didnt used to think much of michael but hes okay he is the best of men jeremy said in neolatin his sister poked him in the ribs she sat down with a girl she knew jeremy sat in the seat right behind her somebody in the back of the bus sang out no more stylus no more jeremy stuck his fingers in his ears the guy whod sat down beside him laughed people called goodbyes as their friends got off the bus they waved through the windows the ones whod left waved back and then headed home some would go out to the alternates for the summer some would work here some would just take it easy till september lucky jeremy thought jeremy and amanda got out at their stop he hurried up the street toward their house whats the rush amanda called dont you want to finish packing so we can leave jeremy asked he wished they could have left weeks ago amanda didnt need to think very long she caught up with him in three long strides they went on together amandas stomach didnt have time to do more than lurch on the suborbital hop to romania then weight returned the sky went from black to blue once more and down they came outside of bucharest now for customs jack solters said thatll take longer than getting here did amanda thought her father was exaggerating he turned out not to be they stood in line for an hour and a half before a man in a muddy brown uniform examined their passports with microscopic care he took their thumbprints and retinal prints and compared them to the data in the passports purpose of your visit he asked he spoke with a thick accent romania wasnt a wealthy country not many people here had implants the customs man had learned english the hard way the oldfashioned way it showed we are in transit dad answered we are doing business in an alternate papers the customs man said right here amandas father handed him a thick sheaf of them some were in english others in romanian the official called over another man in a fancier uniform they put their heads together and talked in their own language amanda thought she recognized a word here and there romanian and the neolatin she knew both sprang from classical latin though theyd gone in different directions dad spoke up in fluent romanian hed learned it through his implant the man in the fancier uniform answered him they went back and forth for a minute or two the romanian gestured he and dad stepped off to one side they talked some more then they smiled and shook hands after that everything went smoothly the junior customs man stamped the solters passports no one searched their bags they went on to the rentalcar counter as they drove the little natural gaspowered fiat north and west up highway e jeremy said what did you do dad slip him a couple of hundred benjamins of course not their father answered that would be illegal at the same time mom pointed to the dome light jeremy looked blank amanda got it right away she grabbed her stylus and scribbled on the screen of her handheld she showed it to jeremy the cars bugged dummy he stared at the dome light amanda couldnt figure out why he would do that for somebody who was smartand jeremy was no doubt about ithe could act pretty foolish sometimes a microphone right out there in the open where anybody could see it wouldnt make much of a bug oh jeremy saidmuch later than he should have sure from bucharest to moigrad the little town by the site of what was polisso in the alternate and had been porolissum in ancient days was a little less than four hundred kilometers the fiat wheezed and chugged going over the transylvanian alps they drove through cluj the only goodsized town between bucharest and moigrad an hour before they finally got where they were going in this world porolissum was a ruin a place where archaeologists dug a hundred years earlier theyd rebuilt one gate to look the way it had back in roman days amanda supposed theyd been trying to lure tourists they hadnt had much luck if moigrad wasnt the middle of nowhere you could see it from there the reconstructed gate didnt look much like the one in polisso that had bothered amanda when she saw first one and then the other it didnt any more in the alternate polisso had been a going concern for two millennia people there must have repaired or rebuilt the gate half a dozen times with a sigh of relief dad parked in front of the crosstime traffic office in moigrad two men in the white grays and black of urban camouflage came out of the building they both carried assault rifles are they guards or bandits jeremy asked guards dad said in a low voice he went on romanias poor and its proud not everybody here likes multinationals amanda eyed the rifles that sounds like an understatement she thought her father rolled down his window he spoke to the guards in romanian they smiled but the smiles didnt reach their eyes one of them said something dad handed him his passport the guard studied it nodded and gave it back he spoke again show him your passports too jack solters said mom and amanda and jeremy got out the documents they handed them to dad who gave them to the guard he looked them over then returned them he nodded again he and his partner stepped back and waved toward the office looks like were okay mom said she opened the car door as she got out and stretched the second guard said something dad translated our luggage will have to go through the sniffer he knows we are who we say we are but they arent making any exceptions i dont mind amanda said have they had trouble here after some backandforth with the guards in romanian dad shook his head he says they havent and they dont want any either theyve got some hotheads some big talkers and they arent taking any chances dont people realize what a mess wed be in without the alternates amanda said in a word dad answered no two going from the home timeline to an alternate should have been dramatic it should have been exciting jeremy had seen video of a saturn rocket blasting off for the moon this should have been something like that all noise and flame why not he and his family were traveling between worlds too no drama here though they sat in the same kind of seats as they had for the suborbital hop from los angeles to bucharest they got even less leg room here than theyd had in the shuttlecraft they couldnt see out jeremy had always wished you could see things change as you passed from one alternate to the next things didnt work out that way though when you traveled between alternates you werent properly in any of them till you stopped that meant there was nothing to see and no point to a window one by one the family changed into clothes that wouldnt look out of place in polisso tank tops and shorts wouldnt do sandals would but not sandals of bright blueandred plastic jeremy and his father put on kneelength woolen tunics jeremys was undyed his fathers a dull blue both tunics had embroidery around the sleeves and the neck opening dads more than jeremys jeremys socks were also of wool handknitted his sandals were leather with bronze buckles his underwear came down to his knees it was wool too it itched a plain floppy felt hat finished his outfit dads hat boasted a braided leather band and a bright pheasant feather sticking up from it mom and amanda wore tunics that fell all the way to their ankles amandas was blue like dads moms was saffron yellow which showed the family had money so did her shiny brass belt the gold hoops in her ears and her lace headdress amanda wore a brass belt too but not such a wide one her headdress was lower and flatter than moms that meant she wasnt married a computer guided the transposition chamber an operator sat in the chamber with the travelers he didnt change and looked like the odd man out he had manual controls in case of emergency fortunately emergencies were rare emergencies where the manual controls would do any good were even rarer jeremy chose not to dwell on that he tried to tell when the chamber reached the right alternate he tried whenever he went crosstime and he always failed if hed been waiting for the chamber he would have seen it materialize inside it he might as well not have left the home timeline the trip to the alternate seemed to take about fortyfive minutes when he got out and looked at the sun though it would be in the same place in the sky here as it had in the home line duration across timelines was a tricky business quantum physics seemed simple beside it out of the blueor so it felt to jeremythe operator said okay youre here jeremy muttered to himself caught by surprise again he got up and stretched the ceiling of the chamber was only a few centimeters above his head tall in his own timeline he would seem taller in the alternate the locals werent as well nourished as people back home id make the basketball team here he thought id play center too somebody had scribbled something on the wall by the door he leaned closer to get a better look the one and only homemade time machine it said he grinned that hadnt been there the last time he came to agrippan rome odds were it wouldnt be there when the chamber came back for his family the company usually made that kind of stuff disappear in a hurry here you go the operator opened the door the way a steward would on a shuttlecraft the air theyd brought with them from the home timeline mingled with what the locals breathed that was cool and damp the transposition chamber had materialized in a cave two or three kilometers from polisso the cave overlooked the road to the west that road never had a whole lot of traffic when video cameras in the cave showed it was clear in both directions people could go down and head for town with the locals none the wiser dad was the first one out the door time to make the best deals we can he said in neolatin he used english as little as he could while they were in the alternate so did everybody else what people in polisso didnt hear they couldnt wonder about jeremy and amanda followed their father around to the cargo compartment the first things dad got out were two swords in leather sheaths he gave jeremy one and buckled the other one on himself no one here traveled crosscountry unarmed then he pulled out four packs full of trade goods everybody in the family got one of those a good thing bandits dont know were coming or wed really have things to worry about mom said as she slung her pack on her back need more than swords to keep off bandits dad agreed jeremy put on his own pack like the others it was full of windup pocket watches almost the size of a fist mirrors in giltmetal frames straight razors swiss army knives and other examples of what would have been thoroughly outdated technology in his world here though no one could match it no one could come close traders from crosstime traffic got wonderful prices if theyd been limited to what they could carry on their backs they would have lost a lot of business but they werent another transposition chamber brought more trade goods to a subbasement under the house they used in polisso people hardly ever traveled through that one if strangers appeared in polisso from nowhere the locals would wonder how they got there walking in and out through the west gate was a different story anybody could understand that dad was checking the monitors to make sure nobody could see the family when they came out of the cave jeremy went over to look at the screens too they showed grassy hillsides motion and an infrared blip drew jeremys eye it was only a rabbit hopping along he relaxed the roman military highway arrowed off toward the west as scornful of the landscape it crossed as any american interstate looks good jeremy said dad nodded yes i think so too he raised his voice a little come here melissa see anything you dont like mom took a long careful look at the monitors she shook her head no everything looks fine lets go then dad said the mouth of the cave wasnt wide enough to let anyone in or out a camouflaged trapdoor nearby took care of that jeremy and amanda hurried down the hillside to the highway when jeremy got to it the soles of his sandals slapped against the paving stones that road had been there for two thousand years it wasnt heavily traveled but still how many others had walked it before him the breeze blew from out of the west the grass on either side of the road rippled like seawater a starling flew by overhead it made metallic twittering noises jeremy didnt hate starlings here the way he did in california they belonged here they werent imported pests cooler here than when we left mom said jeremy nodded she was right it didnt mean much though weather changed randomly from one timeline to another lets go dad said they started east toward polisso which lay not far past the curve of the next hill amanda could see the walls of polisso ahead when the wind shifted she wrinkled her nose dad broke a rule he dropped into english to say ah the sweet smell of successpool the pun wouldnt work in neolatin funny amanda said meaning anything but horse manure garbageold old garbage sewage wood smoke thick enough to slice people who hadnt bathed for a long time those were some of the notes in the symphony of stinks the scary thing was it could have been worse people here knew about running water there were public baths but the pipes only went through the richer parts of town the baths were cheap but they werent free not everybody could afford them after coughing amanda said those who travel across time learn things about smells that those who stay home never imagine it sounded more impressive in neolatin it would have been true no matter what language she spoke in a few days you wont even notice mom said that was also true amanda wouldnt have believed it the first time she came to polisso shed wanted to throw up she hadnt quite some people did when they first went crosstime living in cultures that knew little about sanitation and cared less took work sandstone walls lit by the sinking sun seemed to turn to gold the long black barrels of cannon stood on wheeled carriages atop the wall more big guns poked out from the tall narrow windows of siege towers that strengthened the fortifications some of those towers and parts of the wall were visibly newer than others polisso had stood siege before a wagon drawn by half a dozen horses came rattling and squealing out of the gate the horses ironshod hooves and the iron tires on the wagon wheels banged and clanked against the paving stones of the highway the horses strained against their harness the wagon was full of sandstone blocks pulling it couldnt have been easy for the animals the driver was a swarthy little man with a big black mustache he wore a tunic like jeremys but shabbier and with less embroidery gods look out for you he said as amanda and her family stepped off onto the grass by the side of the road to give the wagon plenty of room to go by and for you as well dad answered politely thanks friend the driver said his neolatin had an accent a little different from what amanda had learned through her implant that guttural undertone said he came from the province of daciaprobably from right here in polisso amanda sounded as if she came from italy or perhaps illyricum or southern gallia with a leer for amanda or for mom or maybe for both of them the local flicked the reins men here werent shy when they liked somebodys looks amanda stuck her nose in the air so did her mother the driver just laughed you couldnt discourage them that way the solters family walked on toward polisso a gate guard yawned showing two broken teeth he and his comrades wore surcoats of dull red linen over light mailshirts they tucked baggy wool trousers into rawhide boots that rose almost to their knees their helmets had a projecting brim in front and a downsweeping flair in back to protect their necks they all wore swords on their hips some of them carried pikes twice as tall as they were the rest shouldered heavy clumsylooking matchlock muskets a lot of them had nasty scars theyd seen action somewhere god look out for you dad called to the guards gods look out for you as well answered the guard with the broken teeth he had a small plume of red feathers sticking up from his helmet that meant he was a sergeant it also meant he could read and write which many of the other guards couldnt do and it meant he was going to ask nine million questions and write down all the answers sure enough he pulled out an enormous book with pages made from parchment a reed pen and a brass bottle of ink your names i am ioanno soltero called acuto dad answered scratch scratch scratch went the pen they call you clever eh the sergeant said should they with a wry shrug dad answered if i were as clever as that would i let people know i was clever huh the sergeant said and the people with you my son ieremeo soltero called alto dad said the sergeant nodded as he wrote that down jeremy was tall dad went on my wife melissa soltera my daughter amanda soltera women didnt have semiofficial nicknames tacked on after their family names occupation the sergeant asked we are merchants dad replied we work with marco petro called calvo whom you will know if you do not recognize us some of your men will several guards nodded one said i remember the solteri from last year and the year before that dont you sarge of course i do you think im stupid the sergeant snapped but that doesnt matter weve got to have the records he turned back to dad nature of your trade and merchandise hourreckoners mirrors knives with many attached tools razors and other such small things of great use all at best prices dad got in a quick sales pitch scratch scratch scratch the sergeant wrote it down without changing expression he paused to reink the pen then asked declared value of your merchandise nine hundred aurei dan answered merchants bringing more than a thousand goldpieces worth of goods into a town had to pay a special tax nobody admitted bringing in more not if there was any way around it the sergeant grunted he knew the rules at least as well as dad if he wanted to be difficult he could search the solters packs his broadshouldered shrug made his mailshirt clink merchants whose goods were worth more than a thousand aurei were rich enough to land a nosy sergeant in hot water he seemed to decide snooping beyond what the law required was more trouble than it was worth religion he asked your greeting and your names make you christians or jews were imperial christians dad said were peaceful people we dont cause trouble another grunt yeah thats what they all say the sergeant wrote it down though nowyour home province and birthplace it went on and on agrippan rome floated on a sea of parchment papyrus and in recent years paper the empire had been a going concern for more than two thousand years amanda wondered if anyone had ever thrown anything out in all that time somewhere in polisso were there records of travelers whod come through this gate five hundred or a thousand or fifteen hundred years before she wouldnt have been surprised had anybody looked at them since a bored guard took them down that would have surprised her after what seemed like forever and was almost half an hour the sergeant said all right everything seems in order entry tax for a gradethree town a family of four merchant class is let me see he had to check a sheet of parchment nailed to the guardhouse wall once he had checked it he did some figuring on his fingers eighteen denari dad grumbled grumbling was good form it said you werent too rich to worry about money grumble a lot though and you risked annoying the guardsmen here dad handed over the small silver coins they werent all quite the same size or shape but they all weighed the same the empire was careful about its coinage the sergeant counted the denari twice then he nodded you have paid the entry tax he said formally you do not have the seeming of lietuvan spies enter therefore into the city of polisso may your dealings be profitable you will report to the temple of the spirit of the emperor for the required sacrifice if not your failure will be noted he sent dad a hard look in this paperworkmad society not sacrificing would be noticed but dad only said we will i told you were imperial christians christianity here had the same name as it did back home but it wasnt the same thing in this world it never had become the most important faith in the roman empire the empire here hadnt gone through the troubles it had in amandas world it had stayed strong and mostly prosperous people hadnt worried so much about the next world for most of them this one had seemed enough the new belief and the old ones had mingled much more here even the christians who didnt call themselves imperial were less strict about other gods than the ones in the home timeline judaism here wasnt as different as christianity but it wasnt the same either jews here didnt believe the emperor was divine the way most people did but they did think of him as gods viceroy on earth they would sacrifice to his good health and good fortune but not to his spirit in this world muhammad had never been born it was a different place with a different history finding things in it the same as they were back home would have been the real shocker come on jeremy said lets get moving why are you in such a hurry mom asked he didnt answer but pushed on into polisso the rest of the family followed once upon a time the town had been a camp where a roman legion stayed it still kept the square layout and grid of main streets it had had then in between those streets that joined at neat right angles little lanes and alleys wandered every which way houses had their lower story of stone or brick the upper floors of timber some of them had balconies that reached across the lanes toward balconies reaching from the other side amanda wondered how sunlight ever trickled down there by the damp nasty smell it often didnt a triumphal arch sprouted in the middle of a square men on horseback ox carts and people on foot went past it or under it they didnt look at it twice why should they to them it was just part of the landscape amanda pointed to the figure in relief above the keystone theres agrippa even after almost two thousand years of weathering even with bird droppings streaking his face and his ceremonial armor marcus vipsanius agrippa still looked tough the sculptor showed him as a burly muscular man with bushy eyebrows a big nose and a chin that stuck out here as in amandas world hed been a lifelong friend and helper to augustus the first roman emperor in both worlds augustus had married his daughter to agrippa hed given agrippa his ring during an illness showing he wanted agrippa to be his heir augustus was always getting sickand always getting better agrippa was the picture of healthtill in amandas world he died in bc he was only fiftyone augustus kept right on getting sickand getting betterfor another quarter of a century before he finally died too in this world agrippa had stayed healthy it made an enormous difference augustus tried to conquer germania the way his greatuncle julius caesar had conquered gallia when the germans rebelled in amandas world augustus had had to send a bad general against them agrippa was already more than twenty years dead the other generalhis name was varusgot three roman legions massacred the german revolt succeeded in amandas world the roman frontier stopped at the rhine till the empire fell things werent the same in this world here augustus had had agrippa to use against the germans agrippa was old by thenhe was the same age as augustusbut he knew his business he beat the germans and killed their chief settlers from the empire came in as they had in gallia germania became a roman province here it still was a roman province and when augustus finally died here who succeeded him agrippa my hair is white but i am still strong he said when he became emperor he proved it too he reigned for twelve years on his own and he conquered daciathe land that had become romania in amandas world the romans had conquered it in her world too but not for almost another hundred years theyd never held it very firmly there here it was still called dacia and it still belonged to rome one man amanda thought looking up at agrippa one man made all that difference in her world the german invasions helped bring down the roman empire in this one the people of germania became romanized they came to speak and read and write latin cities sprang up there roman cities some great roman emperors and some great scholars and writersand a lot of good soldiershere had had german blood the same held true for dacia though not quite to the same degree with the lands and people it hadnt had in her world the roman empire here never fell it went on and on staying itself and not changing much the way china had in her world it had known a couple of dynasties of nomad conquerors from off the steppe but in time it had swallowed them up they were like a drop of ink in a lake they couldnt turn all that water black there werent enough of them dad pointed to a sign lucernarius it said lampseller sure enough the little shop stocked lamps of pottery and polished brass theres a man trying to rise above his place here dad remarked how come amanda said and then oh the signs in classical latin you bet it is dad said in neolatin itd just be lucerno the sounds of neolatin had changed less from the old language than those of italian or spanish or french but its grammar worked like theirsand like englishs too come to that word order told who did what in a sentence man bites dog meant something different from dog bites man classical latin had another way of doing things you could use almost any word order you wanted because word endings were what counted if a lampseller bit a dog he was a lucernarius if the dog bit him he was a lucernarium if you gave him a dog you gave it to a lucernario after that it was his dog canis lucernariior if you preferred lucernarii canis and if you wanted to speak to him about it you called out lucernarie all nouns changed like that adjectives changed with them verbs had their own forms it made for a language more compact than english classical latin didnt need a lot of the helping words english used its word endings did the job instead if you didnt have an implant classical latin was probably harder to learn than english and classical latin wasnt dead in agrippan rome far from it people spoke neolatin in their everyday business but the men who matteredthe bureaucrats who kept the empire going whether the ruler was a genius or a maniac or a murderer or all three at oncewrote in the classical language so did scholars and historians and poets they looked down their noses at neolatin learning the old tongue learning to be elegant in it was a big part of what raised a man to the higher classes of society here sometimes the upper crust even spoke classical latin among themselvesusually when they didnt want ordinary people to know what they were talking about in amandas world the catholic church had used latin the same way into the twentieth century the lampseller wont get in trouble for writing his sign like that will he jeremy asked dad shook his head its not against the rules justsnooty maybe he sells to rich people maybe he wants poor people to think he sells to rich people so he can get away with charging more snob appeal mom said agrippan rome had its share of real snobs its share and then some aristocrats here carried on an old old tradition and boy did they know it they looked down their noses at anybody who wasnt one of them in a way that made amanda want to laugh for all his gold and all his slaves even the richest aristocrat here didnt have a car or a phone or a computer or a refrigerator or airconditioning or a doctor who knew much or any of a million other things she took for granted when she was home but people were people in her timeline or any of the alternates knowledge changed customs changed human nature didnt people still fell in loveand out of love too they still schemed to get rich they squabbled among themselves and they needed to feel their group was better than some other group maybe they had more money maybe they had blond hair maybe they spoke a particular language maybe they had the one right religionor the one right kind of the one right religion it was always something though and they showed off a woman stood in the middle of the street holding up a puppy her friends gathered to pet it it snapped at one of them she smacked it in the nose it yipped the woman who owned it smacked it too people here didnt worry about cruelty to animals that was custom not human nature too bad amanda thought she and her family went up the main street that led into polisso from the west gate at the third goodsized cross street they turned left all the houses and shops and other buildings had numbers on them that let the vigilithe policefind any place in town in a hurry it let the city prefect collect taxes more easily too the numbers didnt look just like the ones amanda was used to but they used the same system what she thought of as roman numerals were for display here the same as they were in her world dad turned right on the next big cross street the important streets like that one were paved with cobblestones you had to be careful when you walked or you could turn an ankle the lanes and alleys that branched off from the main streets werent paved at all they were dusty when it was dry and streams of stinking mud when it rained here we are victorious emperor dad looked pleased with himself for remembering the way the housean upper story of whitewashed wood above a lower one of whitewashed stoneshowed little to the street only narrow windows with stout shutters and a door with heavy iron hinges interrupted the stonework all the display would go on the inside in the rooms and in the courtyard the door also had a heavy iron knocker before dad could grab it jeremy did he raised it and brought it down three times bang bang bang welcome welcome three times welcome marco petro called calvo was a stout man with blue eyes and a big nose his bald head gave him his nickname in jeremys world his name was mark stone he clasped hands with dad and jeremy and blew kisses to mom and amanda come in come in come in people here liked saying and doing things in threes they thought it was lucky that way why jeremy had knocked three times thank you thank you thank you dad answered jeremy shot him a suspicious look marco petro had sounded normal he was just talking the way dad said it he might have been poking fun at the custom he was following or then again he might not have you never could tell with dad by the way marco petro boomed laughter he thought dad was sending up local customs he stood aside to let the solters family come in then closed the door behind them it was close to ten centimeters thick of solid oak he set a stout iron bar in brackets to lock it closing the door cut off most of the light in the entry hall jeremy blinked trying to help his eyes adapt marco petro laughed again on a different note now he too sounded like somebody gentlyor maybe not so gentlymocking the culture in which hed been living good to see you folks he said he kept on using neolatin but in a way that suggested he would rather have spoken english messages by thinking machine are fine but real live people are better mom curtsied thank you so much for the generous praise better than a thinking machine she couldnt come out and say computer it wasnt just that the word didnt exist in neolatin the idea behind the word didnt exist either marco petro bowed to her more sarcastic than a thinking machine too take your packs off make yourselves at home you will be at home for the next three months come out into the courtyard why dont you well get you something wet bees buzzed among the flowers in the courtyard garden a fountain splashed gently this house had running water it was cold and the germs in it would give you stomach trouble in nothing flat if you werent immunized but it ran a statue of agrippas son and successor the emperor lucius stood not far from the fountain it was a small recent copy of a famous piece in rome it wasnt all that well carved but the gilding on the armor and the lifelike paint on the flesh and face helped hide flaws jeremy thought painted statues were gaudy to say nothing of tacky but the ancient greeks and romans had always done that in jeremys world the custom had died out it lived on here when in agrippan rome you did as the romans did lucinda marco petro called as he hurried into the kitchen bring out some wine will you dear the solteri are here he wouldnt serve the guests himself he was the head of a family that would have been beneath his dignity he had his daughter do it instead in most households this wealthy a servant or a slave would have brought the wine but crosstime traffic rules prohibited owning or dealing in slaves even if they hadnt jeremy shook his head hed seen slavery here and it sickened him how could one person buy sell own another the locals did though and it bothered them not a bit somenot all but someslaves seemed contented enough that puzzled jeremy too servants also werent a good idea here along with the transposition chamber in the subbasement this house had other gadgets and weapons from the home timeline the locals thought the merchants who lived here were eccentric for doing their own housework but there was no law against being eccentric marco petro came back out into the courtyard his wife came out too from another door her name was dawn here she went by aurora which meant the same thing welcome welcome three times welcome she called marco are you getting something for them lucindas taking care of it dear marco petro answered he sounded like someone holding on tight to his patience his wife nagged jeremy had seen that before the merchant turned toward the kitchen how are you coming lucinda ill be right there father lucinda petra came out carrying a big tray of hammered copper on the tray were an earthenware jar of wine seven handblown glass cups a loaf of brown bread and bowls of honey and olive oil for dipping in this world only lietuvans and other barbarians ate butter lucinda was jeremys age she had blue eyes like her father she didnt have a big nose though or as far as he could see anything else wrong with her she was the main reason hed hurried into polisso he never had got up the nerve to tell her how cute he thought she was even without his saying anything amanda could tell what he was thinking stop staring she whispered stifle it jeremy answered sweetly after lucinda set the tray on a table she poured wine for everybody agrippan rome thought of wine the way a lot of europeans did in jeremys world babies here started drinking watered wine as soon as they stopped nursing as children got older they watered it less and less it was probably safer than drinking the water in his own world there were good reasons not to let kids drink wine they had plenty of other things to drink water and milk that wouldnt make them sick fruit juices soda they could get behind the wheel of a car and kill themselves and other people and they were just starting out in life who his age or amandas was ready to take a place in the grownup world there wasnt much else to drink here there were no cars people started working at twelve or thirteensometimes at eight or nineand worked till they dropped the line between children and adults blurred it was a different world one whiff of the ripe ripe air told how different it was marco petro splashed a little wine on the paving stones of the courtyard to the spirit of the emperor he murmured everyone else imitated the ritual the traders would have done it with their customers they did it among themselves too to stay in practice the paving stones showed plenty of stains some old some new if they hadnt the locals would have wondered why the most obvious answer was that the people here didnt wish the emperor well that would have been dangerous by what youve sent back home business has been good here dad remarked dipping a chunk of the brown bread into olive oil not bad at all marco petro agreed hourreckoners and mirrors especially everybody whos anybody wants to pull out an hourreckoner and see what time it is all the people with hourreckoners want everybody else to see them seeing what time it is they want to show off you know and if youve been looking at yourself in polished bronze or not looking at yourself at all a real mirror seems like a miracle lucinda smiled they do wonder why wed rather have grain than gold they always have jeremy said talking about trade with lucinda was easier than talking about other things as long as they dont wonder where it goes everythings fine we make sure of that aurora petra said jeremy nodded most of the grain went back to the home timeline through the transposition chamber in the subbasement some went out in wagons though enough to make it look as if more did that grain didnt go any farther by road than the chamber outside of town the locals saw it leave polisso that was what counted itll be funny going back to cincinnati after living here for a while lucinda said do without things for a while and they dont seem real any more its like jet lag only more so jeremy said thats just what its like lucinda agreed jeremy felt proud his sister made a face at him he ignored her i hope things stay quiet with lietuva mom said the guard at the gate was talking about lietuvan spies amanda put in they arent keeping lietuvan merchants out of the empire so it should be all right marco petro said the kingdom to the north and east ruled what were poland and belarus and ukraine and the baltic countries and some of european russia in jeremys world every generation or two it fought a war with rome neither side ever gained much but they both kept trying no human nature didnt change much across timelines three safe trip god go with you amanda called as marco petro and aurora and lucinda petra left the house and strode toward the west gate of polisso they would leave agrippan rome through the other transposition chamber as long as they were seen to leave the town and werent seen to go out of this alternate everything was fine thank you see you before too long marco petro answered he had a sword on his belt and carried a bow he wore a quiver of arrows on his back a leather pouch on his hip hid a pistol that was for real emergencies though they had pistols herelong clumsy singleshot pistols his neat little automatic was something else altogether a couple of skinny little boys in ragged tunics watched the traders leave no one else paid much attention they looked like ordinary people why get excited the petri tramped down the street they walked carefully because of the cobblestones tripping and breaking an ankle just when they were leaving would have been awful the surface would get better on the flat paving stones of the highway still the petri didnt have to go very far next to amanda jeremy blew lucinda a kiss her back was turned so she didnt see it amanda sighed jeremy was socially challenged he even knew it but knowing it and doing something about it were two different beasts mom called safe journey too marco petro turned and waved so did his wife they rounded a corner marco petro started singing a song amanda could pick it out for a little while the the noise of polisso swallowed it up just us now dad sounded cheerful about it amanda wasnt so sure she was cheerful maybe dad hadnt intended to but hed reminded her how alone they were here jeremy seemed to have the same feeling he went into the house without looking at anybody else a gray cat darted up the street it gave amanda and her parents a wary green glance and kept on running mom said maybe ill leave some scraps in front of the door and see if we can make friends good luck amanda said cats here were more like wild animals than pets they lived in towns because towns were full of rats and mice they didnt want much to do with people it could happen mom was a born optimist lets go in and set up dad said its late now so we may not have any new business today if we dont we will tomorrow they took a few watches and mirrors and razors and swiss army knives and arranged them on a display stand in a room near the front door most of the trade goods went into a strong room by the kitchen a lot of houses in polisso had strong rooms this one was special local thieves couldnt come close to winning against technology from the home timeline burglar alarms with infrared sensors meant traders were waiting for them even before they tried beating modern alloys and locks that read thumbprints wed better get supper started mom told amanda amanda made a face but she went off to the kitchen like most alternates agrippan rome had rigid gender roles at home dad and jeremy did at least half the cooking not here even though the work was a lot harder here supper was barley porridge it had mushrooms and onions and carrots chopped up in it it also had bits of sausage the sausage came from a local butcher shop amanda carefully didnt think of what all might have gone into it whatever it was made of it didnt taste bad it had a strong fennel flavor like italian sausage on a pizza only more so since the rest of the porridge was bland that perked it up washing dishes was another pain you couldnt get anything clean not the way it would have been back home scrubbing a bowl with a rag in cold water without soap would have frustrated a saint going back to the home timeline for most of the year had let amanda forget how tough things were here the first evening reminded her in a hurry after the sun went down the only lights in the main part of the house were oliveoil lamps and candles the traders couldnt show anything different from what other people in polisso had trouble was those lamps and candles didnt give off a whole lot of light shadows lurked in corners they reared when flames flickered and when a lamp ran dry or a candle burned out they would swoop amanda found herself yawning you didnt get sleepy right after sundown back home electric lights held night at bay not these feeble lamps here night was night the time to lie quiet like somebody out of a fairy tale amanda carried a candle to bed it gave just enough light so she didnt trip and break her neck but not a dollars worth more she yawned again when she got to the bedroom the bed she remembered was all right leather lashings attached to the frame werent as good as a box spring but they werent bad the mattress was stuffed with wool it got lumpy but you could sleep on it the blanket was wool too no one here knew about sheets the pillow now the pillow was full of goose down that would have cost a pile of benjamins back home before amanda went to sleep she rubbed on insect repellent it came in a little pottery jar so it looked like a local medicine unlike local medicines it really worked bedbugs and fleas and mosquitoes were bad enough lice amanda shuddered and slathered on more repellent shed found out the hard way why lousy meant what it did she blew out the candle the darkness that had been hovering poured down on her she could hardly tell the difference between having her eyes open and closed she didnt keep them open very long anyway sleep hit her over the head like a rock next thing she knew the new days first sunlight was trickling in through the shutters that wasnt what woke her though the new days first wagon was clattering past outside a second one followed and a third and a fourth like a lot of towns in agrippan rome polisso had a law against wheeled traffic at night that let people sleep but as soon as it got light shed slept in her tunic on a hot night she would have slept nude nude and regular clothes were the only choices you had here nobodyd thought of pajamas or nightgowns or anything of the sort for breakfast amanda ate leftover porridge from the night before it had sat in the pot all night pease porridge in the pot nine days old wasnt a nursery rhyme here it was a way of life no refrigerators in agrippan rome no ice at all in summertime no ice cream either she sighed thinking of food could make her homesick like nothing else no one had finished eating before somebody knocked on the door jeremy said something rude in english try that in neolatin dad said the knock came again it was louder and more insistent he muttered a few words that might have been neolatinor might not too people go to bed with the sun here they wake up with the sun and theyre ready to do business bang bang bang whoever was out there sounded ready to break down the door amanda rose from her stool ill get it she said im almost done here when she opened the door the man outside was reaching for the knocker to pound some more he dropped his hand he also gave back a step in surprise people in polisso often did the first time they saw amanda she was five or six centimeters taller than this fellow for instance bono diurno she said sweetly what can i do for you sir he didnt return her good day instead still staring he blurted youre not marco petro a moment later he added youre not even part of his family which made a little more sense no sir she agreed still polite the man was oliveskinned but he still turned red sometimes the best way to make someone feel foolish was to pretend not to notice how foolish he was she went on the petri have taken a load of grain out of polisso im amanda soltera we solteri are from the same firm well be staying in town for a while she waited when the man kept on standing there with his mouth hanging open she prompted him by repeating what can i do for you sir hearing it a second time seemed to make him notice her as a person not just a phenomenon he said i am here to do business let me see your father then he paused and asked in a small voice is he nine feet tall the roman foot was a little shorter than the one the usa had used till it went metric even so nobody in the world was nine roman feet tall amanda didnt like the rest of what the local had said either you can do business with me sir what do you need an hourreckoner a razor a knife with many tools one of the special mirrors we sell you do business the man asked in polisso women didnt except those on their own or too poor not to amanda didnt fit either of those categories he could see that much under his breath he said well you are an amazon in size why not in manner amanda pretended not to hear that if she didnt hear it she didnt have to decide whether it was compliment or insult she said please come in and then as he walked past her whose man of affairs are you he stopped and gave her a funny look not only was she a person she was a person with a brain how do you know i am anyones man of affairs by the way you dress by the way you talk if you were a merchant on your own you would have a different way of speaking if you were a noble your tunic would have more embroidery it would be of finer wool too but amanda didnt mention that well girl you are right the local said he tried to get some of his own back with that faintly scornful girl and with the way he went on i am lucio claudio called fusco i have the honor to serve the most illustrious gaio fulvio called magnoand he is great indeed amanda knew who gaio fulvio was he had probably the largest estate of any noble who lived in polisso hed dealt with crosstime traffic traders before but never with the solters family we are pleased to have the most illustrious gaio fulvio for a customer she said i ask you again what would he like an hourreckoner lucio claudio answered he has seen those that other men in the city have they are more convenient than water clocks he can carry one with him and he does not have to keep a slave boy filling and emptying basins true amanda said gravely so it was a lot of nobles in polisso had figured out the same thing years before some still hadnt though if their grandfathers hadnt had watches they didnt want them either things changed slowly in agrippan rome that made people want to think they didnt change at all but things always changed whether people wanted them to or not she led gaio fulvios man to the room where the trade goods were on display his eyes went from one big pocket watch to another before he spoke or pointed she told herself she knew which one hed choose when he said that one she almost hugged herself with glee shed hit it right on the money hed picked the biggest gaudiest watch the merchants carried to amanda it looked like a bright blue enamel turnip with gilding splashed here and there the back had a gilded relief of cupid shooting an arrow into paris as he gazed at helen of troy it couldnt have been more tasteless if it tried for a week but it was popular as could be in polisso people here liked things that were big and bright and overdecorated they admired them two hundred years before amandas time the victorians in her world had been the same way she took the watch off the stand and wound it it started to tick lucio claudio heard the noise too he leaned forward you should wind it once a day amanda told him this is how you set the hour it is now near the end of the first hour of the day in agrippan rome the first hour of the day began at sunrise the first hour of the night began at sunset day and night always had twelve hours each daytime hours were longer in summer nighttime in winter water clocks measuring steady bits of time had already begun to dent that idea mechanical clocks would probably kill it the way they had in amandas world lucio claudio held out his hand amanda gave him the pocket watch he held it up to his face to look at the dial it had roman numerals on it which was as oldfashioned here as it would have been in the home timeline and listen to the ticking there are gears and springs inside to make it work he asked thats right amanda said the locals knew about such things the ones in the watch were smaller and finer than any they could turn out for themselves though how is it that no one else can make such things lucio claudio inquired thats our trade secret amanda answered not quite comfortably everyone who makes or sells things has trade secrets others would steal if we didnt people stole in the home timeline they stole in every alternate ever found they were people after all they had an easier time here than some places no one in agrippan rome had ever thought of patent laws only you the local said musingly how very lucky for you i wonder if we should not ask for a reportan official report mind youon how you came to be so lucky alarm trickled through amanda official reports were trouble they meant the ponderous bureaucracy of agrippan rome had noticed the crosstime traders amanda supposed that was bound to happen sooner or later she wished it hadnt happened while she was here it would make life a lot more complicated letting lucio claudio see that wouldnt help if the city prefect asks us for an official report im sure well give him one amanda said in the meantime do you want to buy the hourreckoner for the most illustrious gaio fulvio lucio claudios nickname meant dark his scowl certainly lived up to it why had he hoped the threat of an official report would scare amanda it did even if she didnt show it he looked at the pocket watch again yes the most illustrious nobleman does want it he said he wasnt nearly so good at hiding unhappiness as amanda was what is your price you know youve chosen the finest hourreckoner we have amanda said she vastly preferred a plain old fivebenjamin wristwatch herself but nobodyd asked her that one costs five hundred modii of wheat a modioin classical latin a modiuswas a little less than nine liters that is too much gaio fulvios man said the most illustrious nobleman will give you two hundred fifty modii haggling was a way of life here offering half the opening price was a standard opening moveso standard it was boring but amanda shook her head i am sorry sir our prices are firm you will have heard that i think lucio claudio scowled again which meant he had heard it he just hadnt believed it amanda added we have fixed prices for all our hourreckoners if the most illustrious gaio fulvio would like something cheaper that did it shed hoped it would the locals were vain they showed off and took pride in showing off lucio claudio turned red no he snapped nothing but the best the finest for the most illustrious nobleman your price is outrageous but he will pay it yes he would have tried to dicker more if he hadnt known about the fixedprice policy amanda hid a snicker imagining how gaio fulvio would have lost face if hed gone out in public with a cheap watch she said i thank you and i thank the most illustrious nobleman i will write out a contract for the sale you write the classical tongue you read it lucio claudio said oh yes sir amanda answered many merchants do it helps us in our business literacy wasnt all that unusual in agrippan rome in a town like polisso perhaps a quarter of the men had their letters more knew neolatin than the old language though but you are a girla womana female gaio fulvios man sputtered far fewer women could read and write even in neolatin it was a sexist society no doubt about it and neolatin wasnt valid for most business deals which made life harder still amanda enjoyed poking just because the society was so sexist i am a merchant she said proudly the pen like most was a reed with a handcarved nib penknives really were pen knives here amanda neatly printed a standard sales contract she gave it to lucio claudio to sign he read it over looking for anything wrong to his obvious disappointment he found nothing let me have the pen he said and scrawled his name in the space shed left for it i hope the most illustrious nobleman gets good use from his hourreckoner amanda said letting him down easy not too easy though he can have it as soon as he pays of course payment will come to you soon im sure he will be pleased to carry the hourreckoner lucio claudio got out of there in a hurry amanda closed the door behind him then went back to finish her breakfast a skinny stray dog gnawed at something in a pile of garbage near polissos main square it growled as jeremy and his family walked by when they didnt bother it it lowered its head again poor pup amanda said she was right by the standards of anybody from the home timeline everybody here was poor jeremy knew all the things the locals didnt have but they didnt know and so it didnt bother them some of them thought they were rich they tried to keep what they had and to get more the ones who didnt have so much wished for more schemed for more people again in the square and in the roofed colonnades to either side farmers and craftsmen and traders sold everything under the sun here a man hawked cups another man carried a tray of sweet rolls and shouted about how good they were a craftsman displayed wooden buckets on a stand a storyteller told a fable about the emperor agrippa and the beautiful queen of china agrippa had never gone anywhere near china but that didnt stop the storyteller every so often someone would toss a coin into the bowl at his feet a blankfaced peasant woman stood behind a big basket of onions shed carried from her farm come evening shed go home with the ones she hadnt sold on the far side of the square stood the prefects palace and the temple to the spirit of the emperor the clerks and secretaries and nobles who ran polisso worked in the prefects palace soldiers stood guard in front of it nobody was going to give the rulers any trouble just for a moment jeremy remembered the guards in front of the crosstime traffic office in moigrad dad pointed to the temple well make our offering well get our certificate then nobody will worry about us any more that sounds good to me jeremy said they were in public so he couldnt come out with what he really thought he felt like a hypocrite sacrificing to a spirit he didnt believe in dad insisted that hypocrisy greased the wheels between people if you always said just what you thought nobody could stand you hed say and youd hate everybody who did it to you jeremy wasnt convinced a big blond man in a linen shirt with billowing sleeves and baggy breeches tucked into boots held up some furs you want pelts he asked in accented neolatin that accent and his clothes showed he came from lietuva make fine fur jacket marten sable ermine no thank you jeremy tried not to look at the pelts as he walked by he couldnt have been much more revolted if the lietuvan had tried to sell him a slave no one in the home timeline had worn furs for more than fifty years the mere idea turned his stomach true furs were warm and this alternate had no substitutes but jeremy couldnt get over his disgustand he couldnt sell pelts in the home timeline anyway he sneaked glances at his sister and his parents they all had that same tightlipped look they were trying not to show what they thought too then up the stairs of the temple they went the guards nodded to them in the name of the gods greetings one of the soldiers called greetings to you dad replied he didnt have to mention the gods that wasnt the custom for what agrippan rome called imperial christians he went on weve just come to polisso we need to make an offering to the emperors spirit go ahead then and peace go with you the guard said before they entered the temple itself they paused in an anteroom called the narthex several clerks stood there behind lecterns only the very most important people here worked sitting down dad steered the family to a clerk who was talking to a woman and had no one else waiting in line that did him less good than hed thought it would the woman had a complicated problem and took what seemed like forever to get it settled you pick the shortest line you take the longest time mom said its just as true here as it is at home i know dad said gloomily you wish some of the rules would change when you travel but they dont the locals who might overhear him would think he meant traveling from town to town his own family knew better at last the woman flounced off jeremy didnt think shed settled anything she seemed to be giving up the clerk spent the next couple of minutes making notes on her caseor for all jeremy knew doodling only after hed used that time showing how important he was did he look up and ask and how may i be of assistance to youin classical latin most newcomers wouldnt have understood him they would have had to ask him to repeat himself in neolatin he would have done itand looked down his pointy nose at them while he was doing it but dad answered in the classical language having arrived at the famous city of porolissum using the ancient name was especially snootywe should like to make a thanksoffering to the spirit of the emperor oh upstaged the clerk seemed to shrink a few centimeters all right give me your name and the day you came into town that was in neolatin since he couldnt score points with the old language he stopped using it dad also returned to the modern tongue the clerk went off to a wooden box full of papers and parchments and papyri he finally found the one he wanted ioanno called acuto ieremeo called alto melissa and amanda yes you are all here and as described he didnt seem happy about that dad had proved more clever than he would have liked you are imperial christians thats right dad said then you will offer incense not a living sacrifice yes dad said very well that is permitted by the way the clerk sounded he wished it werent but he didnt decide such things he just did what the people set over him told him to do after scribbling several notes on his forms he said you do understand though that you will pay as large a fee for the incense as people who believe in the usual gods pay for a sacrificial animal yes dad said again this time with resignation why wouldnt the government tolerate imperial christians jeremy thought it makes money off them the fee for four pinches of incense then is twelve denari the clerk said dad paid as far as jeremy was concerned the ripoff was enough to incense anyone the clerk wrote some more he handed dad a scrap of parchment here is your receipt keep it in your home in a safe place it is proof that you have offered sacrifice he pulled four tiny earthenware bowls from a cabinet behind him and handed one to each member of the solters family the bowls held literally a pinch of waxy incense apiece you may proceed into the sacred precinct set the bowls on the altar light the incense and offer the customary prayer next that last was aimed at the woman standing behind the crosstime travelers the clerk reminded jeremy of someone who worked for the department of motor vehicles not a man who had anything to do with holiness but then for most people here religion was as much something the government took care of as roads and public baths as he walked into the temple proper he brought the bowl up to his nose so he could sniff the incense smelled faintly very faintlyspicy it was no doubt as cheap and as mixed with other things as it could be and still burn sunbeams slanting in through tall windows lit up the interior of the temple mosaics on the walls and statues in niches showed every god the agrippan romans recognized from aphrodite and ares to zalmoxis and zeus one small statue pictured jesus as a beardless youth carrying a lamb on his back that kind of portrait had gone out of favor in jeremys world but not here here for most people jesus was just one god among many mithras the bullslayer had a more impressive image one of the sunbeams fell on the bust of the roman emperor behind the altar honorio prisco iii was a middleaged man with a big nose jowls and a bored expression as far as jeremy could tell he wasnt a very good emperor he wasnt a very bad emperor either he just sort of sat there the sunbeam also highlighted a line around his neck that looked unnatural the lower neck and top part of the chest on the bust never changed the head and upper neck did whenever a new emperor took the throne a peg and socket held the two parts of the bust together a new emperor take the old rulers portrait off the peg pop on the new there you were easy as pie ready to be loyal several pinches of incense already smoked on the altar off to one side a priest in a white togaonly priests wore togas these dayswrung the neck of a dove for a man who wasnt a christian of any sort dad set his incense bowl on the altar jeremy and amanda and mom followed suit several lamps burned on the altar by each one stood a bowl full of thin dry twigs each member of the family took a twig and lit it at a lamp they used the burning twigs to light their incense then stamped them out underfoot four thin twists of gray smoke curled upward along with his parents and sister jeremy said the prayer required of imperial christians may god keep the emperor safe and healthy may his spirit always be the spirit of truth and justice amen they all bowed to the bust of honorio prisco iii then turned away from the altar that prayer didnt say the emperor was divine it did say that the people who made it cared about him and wished him well it was hardly religious at all not in the sense jeremy would have used the word back home it was more like pledging allegiance to the flag it showed that the people who did it willingly took part in the customs of this country not far from the altar two ordinarylooking men stood talking in low voices they werent being rude they were quietly making sure the prayers were made the way they were supposed to be people who didnt like being watched couldnt have stood living in agrippan rome that was one of the traders biggest problems here the locals werent just curious they were snoopy about everything jeremy glanced over at amanda as the family left the temple that fellow to whom shed sold the blueplate specialthat was how he thought of the big blue pocket watcheshad talked about making them submit one of the empires dreaded official reports about how they could turn out such things when nobody else here knew how dad would have to figure out a way around that out in the market square a herald was shouting hear ye hear ye the great and mighty emperor of the romans honorio prisco iii has declared that the roman empire will keep the peace with the kingdom of lietuva for as long as king kuzmickas chooses to keep it whats that supposed to mean jeremy asked it doesnt sound like it means anything a lot of the proclamations the government put out didnt sound as if they meant anything but dad said it means were liable to have a war lietuva has wanted to take this province away from rome for years and if king kuzmickas does decide to go to war the emperor is saying hell get all the fight he wants border provinces like dacia did sometimes change hands between agrippan rome and lietuva in the middle east mesopotamiairaq in the home timelineand syria went back and forth between the romans and persians every so often but the heartland of each great empire was too far from its neighbors to be conquered the ruling dynasties might change but the empires went on and on oddly gunpowder made that more true not less hearing as much had puzzled jeremy at first but it made sense if you looked at it the right way cannons could knock down the strongest fortress or city wall and cannons here were also very very expensive only central governments pulling in taxes from huge tracts of land could afford to have a lot of them that meant anybody who rebelled against the central government was likely to lose he wouldnt be able to get his hands on enough cannons to fight back well there had been gunpowder empires in jeremys world too the ottoman turks the moguls in india and the manchus in china had all run states like that in his world though europe had had lots of countries not one big overarching empire theyd competed kicking technology and thought ahead and leading to the scientific and industrial revolutions competition here was weaker the dead hand of the past was stronger this is how they did it in the good old days carried enormous weight in agrippan rome and in lietuva and in persia and in the two gunpowder empires that split india between them in this alternate and in china the japanese here were pirates who raided chinas coast the same as the scandinavians did in europe a beggar with a horrible sore on his face held out a skinny hand to jeremy and whined alms gentle sir jeremy gave him a sestertio a little copper coin that was a mistake dad said with a sigh how come jeremy asked look what happened to the poor man for one thing that sore is probably a fake dad said and if its not a fake he probably picks at it and rubs salt in it to keep it looking nasty beggars tricks are as old as time and for another well youll find out and jeremy did in short order hed given one beggar money all the other beggars in the market square hurried toward him he might have been a magnet and they bits of iron they showed off blind eyes missing hands and feet and sores even uglier than the first mans had been none of them had bathed in weeks if not years most of them called for coppers some the bolder ones screeched for silver i cant give them all money jeremy said in dismay which is why you shouldnt have given it to any of them dad said just keep walking theyll get the message little by little the beggars did by ones and twos they drifted back toward their places in the square some of them cursed jeremy as much for getting their hopes up as for not giving them any coins others didnt bother they might as well have been merchants if business in one place didnt suit them theyd look somewhere else did they try to slit your belt pouch dad asked after checking jeremy shook his head no youre lucky i am lucky jeremy said slowly he didnt mean it the way his father did i dont have to live the way they do a day in polisso taught more about human misery than a year in los angeles most of whats wrong with them a doctor back home could fix in a hurry ive always had plenty to eat and a house with a heater that works coming here can make you feel guilty about living the way we do at home amanda said jeremy nodded that was what hed been trying to say his sister had done a better job of putting it into a few words theres nothing wrong with the way we live dad said anybody who says poverty makes you noble has never been poorreally poor the way these people are but you were right we are lucky that we dont have to live like this all the time yeah jeremy said even when they were in polisso they didnt live just like the locals they had links back to the home timeline if something went wrong they could get help or leave they had a swarm of immunizations they couldnt come down with smallpox or measles or typhoid fever or cholera smallpox didnt even exist any more in the home timeline they had antibiotics against tuberculosis and plague the locals didntthey had doctors who believed in the four humors and priests who prayed one was about as much use as the otheras much or as little a drunk lurched out of a tavern he stared around with bleary bloodshot eyes then sat down next to the doorway he wasnt going anywhere not any time soon some things didnt change from one timeline to another jeremys also had its share of drunks and probably always would make way make way in the name of the city prefect make way bawled a man with a loud voice up the street came a gang of slaves carrying firewood to heat the water in the public baths they were skinny sorrylooking men all of them burdened till they could barely stagger along they belonged to polisso not to any one person that made their lives worse not better because they didnt serve anyone in particular no one in particular cared how they were treated the overseer shouted out his warning again neither jeremy nor anybody else in his family said much the rest of the way back to the house that gang of slaves reminded them again all how lucky they really were four the smiths name was mallio sertorio he used his dirty thumbnail to pull one tool after another out of the swiss army knife big blade small blade file corkscrew awl when he found the little scissors an almost comic look of surprise spread over his face how do they do that he muttered more to himself than to amanda i am only a trader she answered i do not have the secrets of the men who made these knives of course you dontyoure only a girl mallio sertorio said that wasnt what amanda had said and didnt endear him to her he extracted a screwdriver blade that puzzled him screws here were made by hand and uncommon but he poked at the blade with his thumb fine workmanship and very fine steel too we sell only the best amanda nodded oh yes oh yes the smith nodded too i want to buy this one and take it apart to see if i can learn the secrets these fellows know he pulled a tweezer out of its slot isnt that clever he crooned ill be glad to sell it to you amanda said what you do with it afterwards is your business she didnt think he would learn much a couple of smiths in polisso had already started selling imitation swiss army knives they were bigger and clumsier and held fewer tools do i have to pay grain mallio sertorio asked grain is a nuisance ill give you silver ill even give you gold you can buy grain yourself or anything else you want grain is what we want amanda answered grain and other food from the alternates helped feed the crowded home timeline oil fed the petrochemical industry the list went on and on i have to have this mallio sertorio said do you understand i have to have it i am not a young man you you have your whole life ahead of you but i am not young he scratched at his mustache like his hair it was grizzled i have spent thirty years learning my trade i am good at it as good as any man in polisso as good as any man in the whole province of dacia im sure you are amanda said softly people in agrippan rome liked to swagger and brag they often made themselves out to be richer or more clever or more skilled than they really were this didnt sound like that mallio sertorio was stating the facts as he saw them thirty years the smith set down the swiss army knife his handshands callused from work and scarred by cuts and burnsbunched into fists thirty years and i see this and i also see i might as well be an apprentice in my first day at a smithy how did they do this work machinery your culture wont invent for quite a while if it ever does amanda thought but she couldnt tell him that instead she had to repeat i dont know she felt embarrassed even a little ashamed how was a man with nothing but hand tools supposed to match this mechanical nearperfection and even if he did somehow do it once how could he keep on doing it again and again mallio sertorio saw that too people in agrippan rome were ignorant yes they werent stupid he said you have dozens of these knives dont you hundreds of them even but each one has to take months maybe a year to make how amanda didnt say anything she didnt see anything she could say it probably wouldnt have mattered mallio sertorio was talking to himselfto himself and to the swiss army knife how he said again whatever the answer is by the gods ill find it he picked up the knife and held it out to amanda i will buy this write me up a fancy contract in oldfashioned latin you want grain ill get you grain i must have this ive got so much to learn the smith had to make his mark on the contract amanda witnessed it you know how many modii of wheat she asked oh yes he answered i know numbers words especially in the old languagewords im not so good with at supper that eveningbread cheese and a stew of rabbit onions garlic and parsnipsamanda mentioned the smiths driving urge to know her mother nodded she said thats one of the things we want here you bet dad said thats why we sell them things that arent impossibly far ahead of what they can make theres a story about an african who saw an early airplane but it didnt mean anything to himit was magic then he saw a team of horses pulling a carriage he laughed and clapped his hands and said why didnt i think of that it was beyond what his people knew how to do then but not too far beyond this culture has been stuck in a rut for a long time along with everything else were doing maybe we can help shake it loose then what happens amanda asked with luck things go forward here her father answered by themselves gunpowder empires dont change very much or very fast a poke here and a poke there though and who knows in a few hundred years this may be a different place he sounded as if he were sure he would come back here to see the changes to amanda a few hundred years didnt begin to seem real she had enough trouble trying to figure out where shed be and what shed do when she got out of high school year after next she wasnt going to worry about whether agrippan rome had its own industrial revolution a long long way down the line one of the reasons jeremys folks brought him and amanda to agrippan rome with them was so theyd look normal everyone here expected grownups to have children who else could take over the family business after they were gone that meant he and his sister had to go out into polisso and do the things kids their age did here they had to be seen doing them too if they werent out there being visible what point to bringing them along the trouble with that was jeremy didnt like most of what the kids his age in polisso did a lot of those kids were already working hard at their trades when they werent working they gambled with dice or knucklebones they played sports different from the ones he knew and they didnt seem to care if they maimed one another or they went to the amphitheater jeremy didnt have the stomach for that here the roman empire had never lost its taste for blood sports people swarmed into the amphitheater to watch bears fight wolves they gave condemned criminals to lions thousands cheered as what they called justice was done and they set men against men gladiators who won their matches were heroes here the way running backs and point guards were at home gladiators who didnt win were often dragged from the arena feet first people here said seeing bloodshed made for better soldiers of course people here also said the sun went around the earth they said some men were slaves by nature they said there were oneeyed men and men with their faces in the middle of their chests off in some distant corner of the world they said the streets in china were paved with gold in china in this alternate they said the streets in the roman empire were paved with jade the chinese were no less ignorant than anybody else that jeremy was a visitor in polisso didnt make things any easier people picked on him because he came from somewhere else it could have been a farm more than ten kilometers from town as easily as los angeles in the home timeline and polisso had its street gangs too things could have been worse by local standards jeremy was very large that made some of the towns less charming inhabitants think twice unfortunately they often hunted in packs as much as he could he stayed out of the alleys and lanes that wound between the main streets anything could happen there the bigger streets on the other hand were pretty well patrolled gangs mostly steered clear of men with muskets armor and short tempers mostly though didnt mean always and the vigili couldnt be everywhere at once three locals came up to jeremy on the street just around the corner from where he was staying they were his age or a little older one of them had the fair beginnings of a beard none of them would ever belong to the polisso chamber of commerce the one with the shaggy chin said youre not from here are you that was a loaded question if he said yes theyd call him a liar and jump on him if he said no theyd call him a strangerand jump on him even if none of them came up much past his chin one against three made bad odds sometimes people didnt come back from summer trading runs he said no but then before they could jump on him but ive got some new jokes from carnuto the town to the west was a reasonable place to say hed come from and the prospect of jokes was enough to make the punks pause they could find people to beat up any old time jokes were something else something special in a world without the web tv radio movies and recorded music entertainment was where you found it all right lets hear em said the gangbanger with the whiskers the other two nodded trying to look tough plainly they followed his lead he leaned forward and stuck out his jaw he was better at being menacing than his pals they better be good they are jeremy hoped he sounded more confident than he felt the jokes came from a real roman joke book called the laughterlover dad had got it so the family could have jokes to tell that came from rome not from los angeles trouble was by los angeles standards they were some of the lamest jokes in the world with luck things were different here without luck go on then whiskers said a halfwit wanted to see what he looked like when he was asleep so he stood in front of the mirror with his eyes closed jeremy waited for the punks to commit literary criticism on his person instead they grinned they didnt laugh out loud but they didnt start kicking him either the skinnier one of the pair behind whiskers got up the nerve to speak for himself tell us another one sure jeremy flogged his memory that slave you sold me died yesterday a man told a halfwit the halfwit said by the gods he never did anything like that when i owned him whiskers did laugh this time which seemed to be the cue for his pals to do the same not bad he said keep going how many can i remember jeremy wondered the ancient roman joke book did seem better suited to polisso than to los angeles he brought out another one an astrologer cast a horoscope for a sick man and said youll live another twenty years the man said come back tomorrow then and ill give you your fee but what happens if you die tonight the astrologer said they needed a couple of seconds to get it when they did though they howled scandalized laughter despite common sense some people in los angeles believed in astrology here people believed in astrology they didnt know all the things about the way the universe worked that people in the home timeline did astrology let them think they knew more than they did not bad whiskers said not bad at all i knew a guy like that he said he knew everything there was to know but he didnt even know his girl was seeing somebody else on the side you got any others sure jeremy told as many jokes as he remembered some got laughs some were groanersbut if you told a lot of jokes some would always be groaners the three punks slapped him on the back whiskers reached out and affectionately messed up his hair after that they paid him the best compliment they couldthey went off and left him alone from then on he knew he wouldnt worry when he haggled with people in polisso how important was haggling over money or grain really hed just won a dicker for his own skin mom dug a big blob of bread dough out of an earthenware bowl she slammed it down on the countertop and started to knead it half a meter away amanda was chopping cabbage there was an odd sort of pleasure in making the familys food from scratch if it was good you deserved all the credit if it wasnt you deserved all the blame amanda didnt like to think about that if i make it it will be good she told herself pleasure or not making food from scratch was much more work than cooking at home no microwaves here no computerized ovens that did everything but blow out the candles on a birthday cake they had a woodburning oven for baking and the fireplace for soups and stews and for roasting that was it mom paused im going to bring in a stool she said im sick and tired of standing up its all right with me amanda hoped she didnt show how startled she was local women always worked standing up in the kitchen always and mom had always been a stickler for doing things the way people here did them to see her changing her ways was a surprise even after she got the stool she didnt seem comfortable she kept shifting her weight leaning now this way now that watching her made amanda nervous finally when she couldnt stand it any more she asked are you all right mom im fine her mother said quickly too quickly her right hand rubbed her stomach and got bits of cabbage on her tunic ive had kind of a stomach ache the last couple of days though probably getting used to what polisso calls food again amanda said i guess so mom said but then she contradicted herself it doesnt feel like that she shrugged then i dont know what else it could be she went back to kneading what would be a loaf if the dough wasnt well kneaded the bread would be dense and chewy antibiotics dont always get everything amanda said you could catch almost anything from food in polisso the only way to be perfectly safe would have been not to eat or drink unfortunately that had drawbacks of its own it doesnt feel like food poisoning her mother said only an ache its not bad justannoying she hardly ever complained when she did amanda worried but there wasnt time for much worrying there wasnt time for anything except chores from dawn till dusk cooking and washing and cleaning and doing business after the bread went into the oven you couldnt walk away and forget about it till it was done no thermostats here amanda had to watch the fire and feed wood into it at the right rate to keep it from getting too high or too low otherwise the loaves would come out scorched or soggy either way they wouldnt be worth eating all the work that went into making them starting with grinding grain into flour would be wasted mom used a flat wooden peel to slide the loaves out of the oven the same tool a cook at a pizza place used in the home timeline after the bread had cooled amanda ate a piece she wished she could have said it was far better than anything she could get at home because shed helped make it herself she wished she could but she couldnt it was gritty the quern that ground the grain was made of stone and tiny bits of it got into the flour the bread was also coarsegrained the quern didnt grind as fine as modern milling machines and in spite of everything it had stayed in the oven a couple of minutes too long it was okay but nothing to get excited about her mother had some too amanda watched to see if she had trouble eating she didnt seem to even if she also looked disappointed at how the bread turned out amanda asked how do you feel im all right mom answered like i said a nuisance thats all have you told dad yes ive told your father hes the one who wouldnt tell me he wouldnt want me to worry mom rolled her eyes i dont want him to worry either but i want him to know whats going on what if it really is something amanda didnt want to say that she didnt even want to think it she knew something about loss two of her grandparents had died but mom and dad were different they were supposed to be there no matter what they were the rocks at the bottom of her world part of amanda knew her parents were people she knew things could happen to people the rest of her recoiled from that like a nervous horse shying from a rattler move the rocks at the bottom of the world and you made an earthquake mom came over and gave her a hug the very worst that can happen is that i go back to the home timeline for a little while and get it fixed whatever it is then i come back here again okay okay amanda hugged her back hard she was very very glad for the transposition chamber down in the subbasement here just in case doctors in agrippan rome not only didnt know anything they didnt even suspect anything the really scary part was they were better than doctors other places in this world roman doctors got fat salaries teaching medicine in lietuva and persia that evening jeremy got into an argument with mom over nothing in particular he would do that every once in a while mostly because he couldnt stand admitting he might be wrong he was right most of the time that made it harder for him to see he was wrong some of the time it also made him a firstclass pain in the neck and tonight it made amanda furious you leave mom alone she yelled at him dont you know anything nothing made jeremy madder than even hinting that he was dumb i know what a miserable pest you are he said he would have gone on from there too but dad held up a hand that will be enough of that he said that will be enough of that out of both of you as a matter of fact there are four of us here and thousands of people in polisso if we cant count on each other we may as well go home it wasnt that he was wrong he was right and amanda knew it and he knew mom wasnt feeling right so hed taken that into account but so did jeremy and he kept steaming he hadnt said all he wanted to and he was itching to let out the rest he pointed at amanda she started it thats the oldest excuse in the worldin any world dad said she got the first word you got the last word and thats plenty if it goes on from there the only thing youll both do is get angrier whats the use answer me please jeremy didnt maybe he wanted to he probably did in fact but arguing with dad was usually like playing chess against the computer at the high level you could try it and it would make good practice and youd even learn something but you wouldnt win mom sat quietly through the whole thing she often did during squabbles dad enjoyed stamping on fires and she didnt but she seemed too quiet tonight or maybe im imagining things amanda thought she knew she sometimes borrowed trouble she couldnt help it any more than jeremy could help being a knowitall but she feared this trouble didnt need borrowing it was really here most of the house the merchants from crosstime traffic used would have seemed ordinary to the people of polisso most but not all that was why they had no servants servants would have seen things that couldnt be explained to anybody from this alternate the basement and subbasement were cases in point part of the basement wouldnt have seemed strange to the locals a lot of houses here had storerooms under them this one did too but its were different jeremy took a lamp with him when he went down the wooden steps into the storeroom that held sacks of grain baskets of onions strings of garlic and big clay jars full of olive oil and wine and the fermented fish sauce that went into every kind of cooking here the way soy sauce and salsa did back home as usual the lamp didnt defeat darkness it did push back the hem of its black cloak jeremy could walk around without banging his head there was a smooth patch on the wall above one particular jar of wine jeremy let his hand rest on it for a moment software scanned his palmprint and fingerprints a wellcamouflaged door silently slid open the camouflage was all the better down here with only lamplight to see by as soon as jeremy walked through the door it closed behind him real lights electric lights came on in the ceiling highcapacity batteries powered themand everything else down here the flickering flame of the lamp was suddenly next to invisible jeremy blew it out he would light it again when he left the basement the wall behind the palm lock was reinforced concrete so was the ceiling the locals might be able to blow them open but they wouldnt have an easy time of it the subbasement where the transposition chamber came and went had another layer of shielding but the most important shield was making sure nobody in polisso suspected the house had a special basement let alone a subbasement on a table sat a powerbook it was sleeping to save power jeremy touched a key to rouse the laptop it was the houses link to the home timeline and all the alternates crosstime traffic visited michael fujikawa he said into the microphone and then an eightdigit number that defined the alternate where his friend was spending the summer go ahead the computer told him you around michael jeremy asked its me jeremy he didnt really expect that michael would be there north china where his parents traded was six hours ahead of romania michael would probably be snoring in the wee small hours hows it with you what you been up to give me a yell when you get a chance bye the powerbook turned jeremys spoken words into written ones text took up a lot less bandwidth to send than voice did jeremy knew he ought to go back up into the world of agrippan rome instead he started a game the computer which was playing the aliens invading earth was knocking the snot out of him when the incomingmessage bell rang quit dont save jeremy said with relief the twisted world war ii vanished from the screen he wouldnt lose tonight anyway a human player would have screamed at him for grabbing the excuse to bail out the powerbook didnt care words formed on the monitor hey jeremy michael said good to hear from you i was wondering when i would weve been getting settled in jeremy said you could have messaged me too you know and what are you doing up so early sunrise ceremony todayyawn michael answered weve been busy same as you it happens hows business pretty good jeremy said the locals are starting to wonder how come we can do things they cant though one of them gave my sister a hard time about it they may start trying to snoop harder that wouldnt be so good not when traders have spent so much time making connections here if you have to pull out you have to pull out plenty of alternates and theyre all easy to get to crosstime will find one thats not too different and youll start over michael could be practical to the point of cynicism i suppose so jeremy knew crosstime traffic had had to abandon some alternates most of those had technology a lot higher than agrippan romes though and that wasnt really what was on his mind anyhow after a pause he said other thing thats been going on here is mom doesnt feel good whats wrong the question came back at once michael had spent so much time at the solters house mom sometimes seemed to be almost as much his mother as jeremys some kind of stomach trouble jeremy said something she ate maybe i hope so that would be the easiest to fix and the least to worry about jeremy answered as he spoke the dictation program on the powerbook put his worries on the monitor where he could see them as well as think them he didnt like that it made them seem more real when he said the antibiotics she took didnt do much the words on the screen took on a frightening importance they also must have seemed important to michael who was reading them not just in another place but in another universe that doesnt sound so good he said do you think shell have to go back to the home line to get it looked at i dont know jeremy said on the monitor that looked very bald and very helpless as long as shes all right nothing else matters sure michael replied listen tell her i hope shes feeling better he wasnt somebody who talked for the sake of being polite what he said he meant he went on i wish i were close enough to do something you let me know whats going on you hear you dont youre in big trouble when i see you this fall i will jeremy said thanks michael wouldnt tell him anything like if you need somebody to talk to im here coming right out with something like that would only embarrass both of them but there were ways to get the message across without saying the words take care of yourself ive got to go the rising sun is calling me like jeremy michael took part in rituals he didnt fully believe in the locals believed in them and that was what counted you watch yourself too jeremy waited for an answer and waited and waited michael really had gone then jeremy softly said something elsesoftly but not quite softly enough the words formed on the powerbooks screen he laughed erase last six he said and they disappeared he wanted to say something that would make the monitor burst into flames but that wouldnt help either even if it might make him feel better for a little while he didnt know what would help he didnt know if anything would help he was seventeen he took care of most things on his own some of them his folks never found out about taking care of your own troubleslearning how to take care of your own troubleswas a big part of what growing up was about but having mom and dad there as backups felt awfully good and when the trouble was that something was wrong with one of them he said some more things he had to tell the computer to erase a water jug on her hip amanda walked down the street to the public fountain a couple of blocks from her house she didnt have to bring water back not when it was piped into the place but she or mom went every few days anyway women didnt just fill up their jars and walk away they stood around and chatted the way men were more likely to do in the market square locals said i heard it by the fountain when they meant i heard it through the grapevine the last couple of times mom had sent amanda to get water and listen to the chatter mom liked to go herself that she stayed home gnawed at amanda mom kept insisting everything was all right now trouble was she didnt act as if everything were all right a girl about amandas own age came out of a house not far from the fountain hello maria amanda said how are you this morning shed got to know the local the last time her family was in polisso im fine thank you mistress amanda maria answered she was short and skinny and dark she had a delicately arched nose and front teeth that stuck out and spoiled her looks in the home timeline braces would have fixed that here she was stuck with it her smile was sweet even so god bless you she told amanda she was a christian and not one of the imperial sort she clung tight to her beliefs not least because she had little else to cling to she was a slave what do you know amanda said uncomfortably she had tried and failed to imagine what it would be like to own somebody or to be owned if the prosperous potter maria belonged to ever ran short of cash he could sell her as if she were a secondhand car and he could visit indignities on her no car ever suffered under local law every bit of that was legal too i know god loves me maria did sound convinced of it maybe believing that helped keep her from fretting about her fate in this world she went on and i know my master is worrying about the godless lietuvans again is he amanda said maria nodded the lietuvans werent really godless but they did have their own gods they didnt much like the traditional roman deities and they really didnt like the christian god in lietuva christians still became martyrs there werent many of them there the handful who did live in the kingdom lived secretly and in fear even in amandas world lithuania had been the last european country to accept christianity maria said he thinks they will go to war with the empire there have been more lietuvan merchants and traders in town than usual he says they are all spies the guard at the gate had talked about lietuvan spies when amanda and her family came into polisso had he known something or had the city prefect or the garrison commander started worrying for no good reason that could make everybody in town jumpy why doesnt your family have any servants amanda maria asked you traders must be rich you could afford them then you wouldnt have to do work like this she didnt say a slaves workit wasnt or wasnt always anyhowbut she meant something like that we like taking care of things for ourselves amanda answered it was an unroman attitude but she couldnt explain the real reasons maria looked puzzled but you dont mind doing this she sounded puzzled too its just something that needs doing amanda said if it were something she had to do every day of her life she probably wouldnt have felt that way about it it wouldnt just have been work it would have been drudgery most of the year she didnt have to worry about it maria did other women at the fountain were talking about the lietuvans too maybe that meant there was something to marias masters alarm maybe it just meant theyd all heard the same rumors either way amanda knew shed have to tell her folks about it they didnt want to get trapped in a war a lot of the chatter at the fountain though could have happened in front of the lockers at canoga park high the women and girls talked about who was seeing whom they talked about who was cheating on whom they traded news on where the prices were good and on who had the best stuff a couple of them asked amanda about the mirrors her family was selling how do they give such good reflections a plump woman asked nobody in town has ever seen anything like them amanda went into her song and dance about buying the mirrors from people who lived a long way away the less she admitted knowing about them the fewer really pointed questions shed get its too bad you wont tell the plump woman said oh leave her alone lavinia another woman said you mean to tell me your kin havent got any trade secrets well of course we do lavinia said but not everybodys so interested in ours that made amanda want to fill up her jar and get back to the house as fast as she could but the women took turns and cutting ahead would get her talked about much moreand much more nastilythan any trade secrets she had to wait and smile and pretend she didnt know what lavinia was talking about while she was waiting though jeremy came up the street calling amanda amanda come home quick ice ran through her whats the matter she said afraid she already knew the answer her brother didnt come right out and say it not in front of all the women he did say mom needs you in a way that could only mean one thing im coming amanda started away without a backwards glance quietly maria called ill pray for you after her amanda had told her mom wasnt feeling well the rest of the women would soon know the same thing once amanda got out of earshot of them she asked what is it how bad is it dad thinks its her appendix jeremy answered all the pain is here now he rested his hand between his right hipbone and his belly button then went on shell have to go back and have it out thats not something to take care of here theyre sending a chamber now down in the subbasement hell go back with her then come here again as soon as shes okay amanda nodded thats fine we can manage by ourselves for a couple of days or whatever it takes i just want to make sure moms all right her mother didnt look all right or anywhere close to it by the dark circles under her eyes the pain wasnt just in one place now it was worse than it had been maybe a lot worse but she tried hard to stay cheerful she kissed amanda and said ill be fine if it is appendicitis they wont have any trouble fixing it once i get back to the home timeline dad and jeremy and amanda all helped her down to the subbasement the chamber appeared in the room fifteen minutes later dad and the operator eased mom inside dad said ill send a message as soon as we know for sure and ill be back as fast as i can okay amanda and jeremy said together the chamber door slid shut a moment later the chamber disappeared amanda looked at jeremy he was looking back at her for a little while they were on their own five jeremy thought people were looking at him he had to go out in polisso and pretend everything was normal mom and dad had been gone for only a few hours jeremy felt as if his shield against the world were gone too responsibilities weighed a million kilos if he made a bad mistake he couldnt pass any part of it on to someone else it was his and he worried about mom appendicitis was something simple enough to fix on the home timeline but all the same even doctors said the only minor surgery was surgery you didnt have to have if something went wrong or if it turned out not to be appendicitis but something worse he wouldnt think about that he told himself so again and again it was like trying not to think of a greenandorange zebra you could tell yourself you wouldnt you could tell yourself all sorts of things the thought kept returning just the same furs i have fine furs a lietuvan trader shouted jeremy kept on walking through the market square he didnt want furs he wanted to tell the lietuvan what he thought of him for selling them he couldnt a real agrippan roman might not have bought fur but he wouldnt have minded anyone selling it and the locals call the lietuvans barbarians jeremy thought theyre more alike than they are different they had reason to be of course rome and lietuva had lived next door to each other for a thousand years theyd fought wars against each other theyd traded ideas had gone across their border along with trade goods neolatin had words for things like amber and wax and slave that were borrowed from lietuvan lietuvan had more words taken from classical latin and neolatin a whole host of technical terms as well as words like wine and wheel and ship another lietuvan in a fur jacket called here you are a young man buy yourself a slave girl shes well trained shell do what you tell her he leered the girl he pointed at was blond and skinny and broadfaced with high cheekbones she couldnt have been more than twelve years old her threadbare tunic was filthy she didnt look well trained she looked scared to death you want her the lietuvan asked ill give you a good price no again jeremy kept on walking behind him the lietuvan said something in his own language whatever it was it wasnt praise jeremy didnt care he discovered hed only thought being offered furs was disgusting now he found the real thing if he gave the trader enough silver the fellow would sell him the girl he couldnt dealing in slaves even to set them free was as illegal as could be for crosstime traders setting her free wouldnt do her much of a favor anyhow what was called freedom here was often only the freedom to starve keeping her was just as much out of the question she would ask questions the traders couldnt answer see things she wasnt supposed to see and learn things the locals shouldnt know whatever happened to her would just have to happen good luck jeremy whispered she would need it he hoped she got an easy master there were some quite a few in fact that wasnt really the problem with slavery the problem with slavery was that there were masters period plums peaches wholl buy my plums and peaches a peasant woman called she wore a bright scarf wrapped around her head years of weathering had left her cheeks almost the same color as the plums in her basket the peaches here were smaller and paler than the ones jeremy knew from the home timeline they didnt taste just the same either they werent quite so sweet but they had a spicy flavor he liked he haggled long enough to look normal then took a small basket full of them back to the house hed brought the basket himself nobody here gave out shopping bags or anything like them amanda opened the door as soon as he knocked smiles wreathed her face youve heard from dad jeremy exclaimed his sister nodded it was her appendix and now its out and shes going to be fine some of the weight fell from jeremys shoulders thats about the best news there is he said did dad say how long hell stay back there a few days amanda answered he cant be quite sure yet cause he has to see how moms doing but he said hed get back here as soon as he could and mom shouldnt be more than a couple of weeksbut shell have to wear a patch of false skin over the scar when she goes to the baths i hadnt thought of that jeremy said but it made sense when he did nobody here had a scar like that agrippan rome knew no anesthetics it had no antibiotics it had never heard of sterile operating techniques a wound in the belly meant sure death from infection it doesnt matter amanda said shes going to be okay that does yeah jeremy nodded yes some of the weight was off things would get back to normal pretty soon now he could concentrate on how much business he and amanda did before dad came back to polisso and he could tell michael fujikawa the good news he stayed up late to try and catch michael getting up when he went to the laptop in the hidden part of the basement he found a message waiting for him hows your mom doing she went back to the home timeline he answered as if his friend were standing there in front of him the computer transcribed his words it was appendicitis dad was right about that they took out her appendix shell be back in a couple of weeks dad says hell be back in a few daysas soon as hes sure shes all right she should be the operation went fine he waited he didnt have to wait long michael must have been sitting at the laptop that connected them across the skein of alternates thats terrific he said im sorry she had to have the operation but now shell be okay so you and amanda are by yourselves how you doing were okay jeremy said we can manage on our own for a little while anyway i want to see how much we can sell before dad gets here again there you go michael told him show him what you can do by the message stopped there jeremy frowned waiting for michael to go on but only the incomplete sentence stared at him after half a minute or so new words formed on the screen transmission interrupted no contact with home timeline whats that supposed to mean jeremy asked the message program was still running so those words went up on the monitor too you there michael that appeared too what didnt appear was an answer from michael fujikawa muttering jeremy ordered the computer to send the message he got the same error report as before transmission interrupted no contact with home timeline but im not even trying to send to the home timeline jeremy protested he really did swear when he saw those words go up on the screen then a chill ran through him he wasnt trying to send to the home timeline but everything went through it he called up the address code for the crosstime traffic office in moigrad that was the home timelines counterpart of this place is everything all right there he asked and told the laptop to send transmission interrupted no contact with home timeline that wasnt good at allnot even slightly something had gone wrong somewhere between here and the world where hed been born he tried michael one more time and got the same error message really scared now he leftfledthe basement the secret door closed behind him amanda was not someone who gave in to panic she was someone who always tried to look on the bright side of things that was one reason her brother sometimes drove her crazy of course jeremy had woken her out of a sound sleep to tell her about the error message she was not at her best yawning in the middle of the night she went down to the basement to try to send messages to the home timeline herself when she found she couldnt either she went back to her bedroom itll be fine in the morning she said how do you know that jeremy demanded because nothings ever as awful when the sun comes out as it is at three in the morning or whatever time it is now amanda answered then she shut the door in his face the computer still wouldnt send messages when she got up in the morning that wasnt good news it was in fact very bad news with the sun shining down brightly on the courtyard though it didnt seem so bad before long amanda was too busy to worry about it anyway she and her mother had had all they could do to keep the house in some kind of order and to keep everybody fed without help from servants or slaves now she had to do it without mom around it was more work than one human being could do she tried to get jeremy to help he didnt want to that made her lose her temper you listen to me jeremy she snapped if you dont do what needs doing ill tell dad when he gets back here then youll catch it and you know what else youll deserve it too he helped he was surly about it he helped less than he would have if hed known what he was doing sometimes just having an extra pair of hands and an extra pair of eyes made a difference though breaking off from the housework to deal with customers every once in a while didnt help either the one good thing about that was that nobody asked them where are your mother and father the locals probably thought they would get better deals from the younger people in the family they were wrong but it kept them from being too curious two days passed three days four five the computer kept giving the same error report whenever amanda and jeremy tried to send a message no message from any of the other alternates or the home timeline came in and dad didnt come back to polisso at first amanda wondered whether that was because something had gone wrong with mom no way to know for sure not when the message system was down as one day followed another though she began to realize that probably wasnt the problem i think somethings wrong with the transposition chamber she said to jeremy at supper the sixth night when she put it that way it didnt sound so bad if shed said im afraid were stuck here forever it would have seemed much worse but it would have meant the same thing her brother was sucking marrow out of a lamb shank amanda thought that took realism too far but jeremy really did like marrow air and marrow going through the center of the bone made a gross noise he smacked his lips you may be right he said scratching his chin he was growing the scraggly beginnings of a beard razors here even the straight razors the traders sold were nothing but long slim knives no neat blades in plastic safety housings you could do yourself some serious damage if you werent careful from what he said the beard itched coming in maybe we ought to go out to the chamber outside of town amanda said we can if you want to jeremy said i dont think itll do much good though why not because if that one were working dad would have come through it by now along with technicians to fix whatevers wrong with this one oh amanda winced that made more sense than she wished it did she tried to stay optimistic we ought to check anyway all right ill go tomorrow jeremy said amanda wished he didnt make sense there too but he did anyone on the road was much less likely to give a large young man trouble than a young woman that was unfortunate which didnt make it any less true she said what could make both transposition chambers stop working at the same time i dont know her brother answered bleakly ive been chewing on that for three or four days now and i havent got any sure answers three or four days that was a day or two longer than amanda had been worrying jeremy hadnt let on how worried he was till now amanda said what are some of the things youve thought of maybe there was an earthquake in the home timeline that could have been true quakes happened randomly across timelines maybe the transposition operators are out on strike that was a joke the chambers could go automatically and probably several more nines after that percent of the time jeremy went on maybe the operators are still filling out agrippan roman forms that was a joke toosort of what are we going to do if a chamber doesnt show up for a while amanda asked the best we can her brother answered what else can we do nothing she said unhappily when people do come back for us well be the richest pair in polisso jeremy said that sounds good amanda said her brother grinned at her she knew he was trying to keep up her spirits along with his own and liked him for it after a second she stuck a finger in the airthe sign shed thought of something from now on wed better take money for everything we sell how come jeremy asked then he looked foolish oh yeah amanda said what would we do with all that grain if we couldnt ship it back to the home timeline itd start coming out of our ears uhhuh jeremy nodded then when things do get straightened out again thatll make things more complicated because the locals will keep wanting to buy for cash but we can worry about that later right now well just do what weve got to do to keep going do what weve got to do to keep going that made a lot of sense to amanda it was simple it was practical and it meant she didnt have to think about nasty possibilities if the transposition chamber couldnt come back for a few weeks that was one thing if it couldnt come back for a few years that was something else again no matter how much energy the batteries stored theyd run dry sooner or later then amanda and jeremy would be on even terms with the locals and theyd stay that way till they got rescued and if for some reason the chamber couldnt come back at all then were stuck here amanda thought the chill that ran through her was colder than winter at the south pole polisso was a nice enough place to visit plenty of alternates were worse but to live here to speak neolatin the rest of her days and forget english to have to forget that women were just as good as men and could do anything men could to say goodbye to doctors and dentists and ice cream and deodorant and malls and copernicus and the spca and everything shed grown up with jeremy said something under his breath she thought it was robinson crusoe she didnt want to ask him for fear she was right why wouldnt he be thinking along with her though they would be even more isolated from their homes than robinson crusoe ever was at least hed stayed in his own world we know moms all right thats the important thing jeremy said sure amanda made herself sound perky if her brother didnt want to think about getting stuck here how could she blame him she didnt want to think about it either a literate soldier poised pen over papyrus reason for leaving the city he asked im just going out for a walk jeremy answered its a nice day and im sick of smelling smoke and garbage in here reason for leaving the city constitutional the guard at the western gate wrote that down then laughed jeremy realized the fellow wasnt much older than he was himself when the local smiled he looked like a kid he said the city stink does get to you doesnt it but when you get out of it for a while its even worse when you come back ive noticed that too jeremy said youll be back by sunset the soldier asked theres another form if you stay out longer by sunset jeremy promised all right the guard said if you come in late now theres a fine for giving false information there would be jeremy said the guard laughed again he thought jeremy was kidding jeremy knew he wasnt life in agrippan rome broke down into a million separate boxes if you stepped outside any of them or if you stepped into one where youd said you wouldnt go you had to pay even the law here worked like that for two thousand years and more lawmakers and lawyers had tried to take life apart and look at each possible deed if you were accused of doing something wrong they would fit it into a pigeonhole stealing sheep worth between twenty and forty denari for instance then they would decide whether youd done it if they decided you had another pigeonhole told them exactly how to punish you to jeremy that kind of precise control felt like a straitjacket the locals took it for granted pass on the gate guard said and jeremy did a hawk wheeled overhead there were rabbits in the fields the hawks werent the only ones to eat them sometimes the locals would hunt them with dogs and nets rabbit stew could be tasty no matter what people in the home timeline said it didnt taste like chicken jeremy realized he hadnt been outside polisso since coming here the town couldnt have been even a kilometer square he traveled several times that distance every day he went to high school when you were on foot all the time though distance stretched dramatically a few tombstones poked up through the tall grass on either side of the road time had blurred the carvings on them the locals didnt bury people inside the walls that wasnt because they thought dead bodies left there might spread disease theyd never heard of germs and had no idea how disease spread the only pollution they worried about was the religious kind as jeremy reached the bend that put polisso out of sight behind him he stopped in the middle of the road except for the faintest ripple of the wind through the grass and a starlings distant metallic call silence was absolute that kind of quiet was something he didnt get to know in los angeles there was always a murmur of traffic noise there of airplanes and helicopters overhead and of the neighbors tvs or radios or computers or stereos there was also the sixtycycle hum of electricity you didnt constantly notice it but it was around whenever you went indoors not here this was just nothing the starling fell silent all jeremy could hear was the blood rushing in his ears he hardly ever realized it was there but it seemed very loud now when he started walking again each thump of his sandal on the paving stones might have come from a giants heavy boots he tried to go on tiptoe to be quieter it didnt seem to do much good he concentrated so hard on being quiet he almost walked past the cave that hid the transposition chamber that would have been great he looked ahead he turned around and looked behind no one coming either way he left the road and went over to the mouth of the cave he had to cast around a bit before he found the hidden trapdoor close by grunting with effort he lifted it and went down the tunnel pathway that led back into the cave almost everything inside the cave seemed the same as it had when his family got here only one thing was missing the transposition chamber he hadnt expected to find that there it would have been nice but he hadnt expected it he turned on the powerbook sitting on a table in a niche farther back in the cave the computer came to life right away he sent a message to the crosstime traffic electronic monitor in the home timeline that checked this machines output he tried to send one anyway transmission interrupted no contact with home timeline jeremy said several choice things in neolatin and in english again he wasnt really surprised but he was disappointed whatever had gone wrong had gone wrong here as well as at the chamber inside polisso hed feared that was true as hed told amanda dador somebodywould have come out of a chamber here and fixed the problem with the one under the house if it werent after running out of curses jeremy said one thing more well i tried now he and amanda knew help wasnt right around the corner theyd already been pretty sure of that finding out they were right was news they needed not news they wanted for the time beinghowever long the time being turned out to bethey were on their own he thought about growing old and dying in polisso then he thought about not growing old but dying in polisso there was a lot more wear and tear here than back in los angeles there were a lot fewer ways to fix anything that went wrong too filled with such gloomy thoughts he went to the monitors to make sure he could safely leave he got a surprise then and not a pleasant one an army was coming up the highway toward polisso it was a roman army the standardbearers carried gilded eagles above the letters spqr those stood for senatus populusque romanus the senate and people of rome in classical latin the senate these days was a powerless rich mens club the people had no voice in politics and hadnt for two thousand years the slogan lived on some cavalrymen were heavily armored lancers others were archers with quivers full of arrows on their backs the big clumsy matchlock pistols they had here werent practical for horsemen behind the cavalry squadrons marched troop after troop of foot soldiers some men carried tall pikes others shouldered matchlock muskets they laughed and joked and sang as they tramped along their being here said they were liable to see action before long the government wouldnt reinforce polisso if it didnt think trouble likely that kind of trouble could come from only one place lietuva jeremy remembered the gate guard whod asked if he and his family were lietuvan spies the soldier had been kidding but hed been kidding on the square were some of the lietuvan traders in town real spies jeremy would have been surprised if someone in polisso werent looking into that right now he wouldnt have wanted to be a lietuvan trader here no one in this world had ever heard of laws against illegal search and seizure the armys baggage train followed the foot soldiers cannon rattled along on wheeled carriages wagons carried food and gunpowder and lead for bullets and stone or iron cannonballs other wagons held surgeons and their supplies clerks to keep track of pay records and such and farriers and blacksmiths and veterinarians to care for the horses those cannon made jeremy especially thoughtful polisso already had a lot of artillery the central government wouldnt move more in unless it really worried about an attack normally jeremy and his family wouldnt have had to fear a war if it got bad they could hop into a transposition chamber and leave it behind but at least for now he and amanda were stuck here that made him take things more seriously than he would have otherwise he was also stuck herein this cavetill the army marched past and went into polisso he couldnt come out while soldiers might spot him they would wonder what hed been doing there spying on them the way things were that would have to occur to them they would ask questions they wouldnt be polite about itor gentle either up till then hed never worried about how long an army took to pass any particular place while he was waiting it seemed like forever in fact it was several hours he kept looking down at his wrist to find out just how long that would have worked better if hed worn a wristwatch in agrippan rome he couldnt even the big mechanical pocket watches crosstime traffic traders sold here were way ahead of the state of the art at last the coast was clear jeremy scooted out of the cave and made it to the road before anybody coming from polisso spotted him he sauntered toward the city as if he had not a care in the world pretending to be carefree took more acting than anything else hed done since coming to this alternate pretending to be carefree also proved the wrong role travelers in polisso hadnt been allowed to leave while the army was going in a grayhaired merchant leading a train of mules was the first man who came up to jeremy the merchant stared at him and said boy dont you know theres a godscursed army just ahead of you jeremy couldnt very well claim he didnt know the horses and oxen of the cavalry and baggage train had left unmistakable hints an army was on the move so he smiled and shrugged and nodded the merchants eyes got bigger yet well then dont you know youre an idiot if hed smiled and shrugged and nodded again the older man would have been sure he was one instead he asked what are you talking about what am i talking about what am i talking about the merchant seemed convinced he was an idiot anyway the gods must watch over fools like you even if you are a big strong fool dont you think those soldiers would have grabbed you and put you in a helmet if theyd spotted you gurk jeremy said the man with the mule train seemed to think that was the first sensible thing to come out of his mouth he got his mules going again and left jeremy standing in the middle of the road after a couple of minutes jeremy walked on to polisso other travelers coming out of the city sent him strange looks they too must have wondered what he was doing ambling along in the armys wake none of them asked him any questions though they just went on about their own business when he got back to polisso the gate guard whod let him out of the city checked him back in he too said youre lucky the soldiers didnt see you after a moment he took off his helmet and scratched his head how come they didnt id gone off the road when they came i was trying to knock over rabbits with rocks jeremy answered he spread his hands no luck i wouldnt think so the gate guard laughed at the idea youd need a cursed lot of it to hit one then he laughed again and when you saw the soldiers ill bet you bloody well made sure they didnt see you wellyes jeremy had been inside the cave of course they hadnt seen him but he could agree without actually lying the guard clapped him on the back and waved him into polisso he didnt have good news for amanda no sign of the transposition chamber and no contact with the home timeline but he was happy just the same the good news was he would be able to tell her the bad news in person he hadnt been pulled into the army what would happen if there really was a war he did his best not to think about that in the declaration of independence thomas jefferson complained that the king of england quartered his soldiers on the american colonists amanda remembered that from the us history class shed taken two years before it hadnt meant anything to her then except one more fact she had to know for a test people in the united states hadnt had soldiers quartered on them for a long long time but she wasnt in the united states any more some of her neighbors had soldiers living in their houses and eating their food she and jeremy were lucky it hadnt happened to them i wonder why they didnt try to give us any soldiers she said at breakfast two days after the army came to polisso they like what we sell and they dont want to make us so angry well go away and wont come back jeremy answered spooning up barley mush thats the only thing i can think of what do we do if they say here take these four amanda asked im going to give the city prefect a couple of thousand denari jeremy said why not silvers not much more than play money for us ill tell him to use it to buy food for the reinforcements well do that instead of letting them in here can you be smooth enough to get away with it amanda asked her older brother shrugged i canbecause i have to dad would probably do a better job of it but hes not here that leaves me im not a potted plant you know amanda said no but youre a girl jeremy answered as far as the locals are concerned you might as well be a potted plant that stung especially because it was true amandas chin went up so what jeremy held up a hand look i know its no big thing everybody youve skinned on a deal here knows its no big thing but if you go try to talk to the city prefect what will he and his flunkies see a girl guys like that are like principals they cant see past the end of their noses the principal at canoga park high was a woman that didnt spoil jeremys point ms williams definitely couldnt see past the end of her nose amanda sighed all right she said no not all right because it isnt but i can see why youve got to be the one who goes macho she spat that out as if it were the dirtiest word ever invented right then she felt it was most alternates that havent had an industrial revolution are like this jeremy said if you dont have machines size and strength count for more than they do with us guys dont have babies either its still not right amanda said did i tell you it was her brother gave her a dontblameme look but even if its noteven though its not its real and that was also true and also stung but the next day jeremy went to see the city prefect amanda went to the public water fountain with a jug on her hip to listen to the talk there thats what people here think women are good for she thought carrying water and gossip and i cant even rock the boat there was gossip tooplenty of it a plump woman with an enormous wart on the end of her nose spoke in important tones i hear the city prefect ordered all the lietuvan traders out of polisso last night no that isnt true the slave girl named maria said a lot of them are leaving but theyre leaving on their own how do you know so much the woman with the wart not a regular at the fountainlooked down her nose past it at the slave maria didnt get angry amanda had never seen her get angry maybe that was because she was a slave and couldnt afford to maybe it was because she was a christianwhat they called a strong christian here not an imperial christian and didnt believe in it or maybe she was just a nice person she said i pray with a girl who serves at the inn where the lietuvans stay thats what she told me well i heard my news from someone who heard it from the city prefects second secretarys cousins hairdresser the plump woman said amanda laughed out loud if that woman thought her account trumped what an eyewitness said but a couple of the other ladies filling water jugs were nodding too they must have believed it did both of them were free and fairly prosperous as far as amanda could see both of them were also fairly dumb too bad theyll let the lietuvans go one of those ladies said we could hold them for hostages in case the barbarians attack what would the lietuvans do to romans they caught then amanda asked she didnt call the woman a jerk no matter what she thought well theyd do that anyway they are barbarians the woman answered all the women gathered around the fountain nodded this time maybe the lietuvans really did do horrible things to any romans they caught maybe the romans just thought they did how was anybody supposed to know for sure go out and let the lietuvans capture you that didnt seem like a good idea to amanda a squad of soldiers marched by nobody in agrippan rome had ever heard of the wolf whistle but the men in the dull red surcoats had no trouble getting the message across guys in los angeles usually werent so crude amanda turned her back on the soldiers that only made them laugh some of the other women just ignored the mens leers and gestures and suggestions a few of them smiled back though that horrified amanda if they encouraged the soldiers those men would go right on acting that way they would think they were right to act that way how could she say that so someone whod spent her whole life in agrippan rome would understand it wasnt easy people here took lots of things for granted that nobody in the home timeline would have put up with for a minute the best amanda could do was if you give them a smile theyll only want more maybe i will too dearie a woman twice her age said everybody except amanda laughed and she didnt push it any more what was the use she wasnt going to change this alternate singlehanded she wished she hadnt had that thought if she really was stuck here how much would this alternate end up changing her six the city prefect was a moonfaced middleaged man named sesto capurnio and nicknamed gemino which meant he was one of a set of twins as far as jeremy knew the other half of the pair didnt live in polisso jeremy didnt know whether that meant he lived in some other town or wasnt alive at all sesto capurnio collected modern art that meant something different here from what it would have in los angeles nobody in agrippan rome would know what to make of abstract painting or sculpture hardly any cultures that hadnt invented the camera produced art that didnt try to represent reality photographs reproduced the real world more exactly than painters and sculptors could hope to do that let them in fact it almost forced them totry other things what the city prefect called modern art were pieces done by artists of agrippan rome from the past couple of hundred years even that made him unusual for most collectors here the older the better if they had an early roman copy of an ancient greek original that was good if they had the greek original itself that was heaven but sesto capurnio was different several busts of recent emperors stared at jeremy from behind the city prefect the effect was eerie not least because they were painted to look as realistic as they could eyes of ivory and colored glass added to the effect jeremy had seen the head of honorio prisco iii in the temple he still had trouble getting used to the style sesto capurnio also had several paintings on his wall some were landscapes others scenes taken from mythology one showed christ and mithras beating back a demon together official roman belief mixed faiths in a blender and he had a pot made in the shape of a dogs head with a rabbit in its mouth you drank from the dogs left ear jeremy was no art critic but he knew what he liked the best thing anyone could have done with that pot was break it into little pieces lots of them the more the better it is good to see you young ieremeo sesto capurnio said jeremy could have done without that young but then sesto capurnio was a pompous fool he spoke neolatin in a way that suggested hed start spouting the classical language any minute he never quite did but still i thank you most illustrious prefect of the great municipality of polisso jeremy laid it on with a trowel too if he sounded as educated as the prefect sesto capurnio couldnt score any style points off him he went on i am glad to see that city garrison has been reinforced the barbarians will surely know better than to trouble us now of course they will capurnio said they were both lying through their teeth they both knew it too nobody wanted to see new soldiers coming into the city if they were here that meant polisso was liable to need them jeremy picked up a heavy leather sack full of silver i know these men will need supplies he said here is my familys small gift to the city for the sake of the soldiers who have just come he set the sack on the table behind which sesto capurnio sat you are generous the city prefect picked up the sack one of his eyebrows jumped in surprise at the weight by the gods you are generous he didnt seem to want to set the money down jeremy wondered how many denari would stick to his fingers some no doubt this was a world that ran on nudges and winks and greased palms come to that most worlds did this one though was more open about it than a lot of them with a small sigh sesto capurnio said i am sure the soldiers will be grateful for your bounty that meant he knew he couldnt get away with lifting the whole sack if jeremy told an officer hed given capurnio money and the soldiers had seen none of it that could make the prefects life difficult it is the least we can do jeremy said by that he meant it is the most we can do dont ask us to do anything else very generous very kind a gift whose like i wish we had from every prosperous citizen of polisso the city prefect said by that he probably meant i will have a gift like this from every man who doesnt want soldiers in his house drinking the best wine and coming on to the slave womenor to his wife and daughters the town needs to be as safe and secure as it can jeremy said and now most illustrious prefect if you will excuse me instead of going through the usual polite goodbyes capurnio said wait one moment ieremeo soltero if you would be as generous with your time as you are with your silver there is something i would like to know from you and i hope you will be kind enough to tell me if i can i will jeremy said i should not speak about the secrets of my trade any more than any other merchant would of course not the city prefect said what i want to know is why are you making this generous gift and not your father oh jeremy said as if hed expected just that question in fact it did not surprise him all that much my father and mother went out of polisso a few days ago that is why i see sesto capurnio shuffled through sheets of papyrus and paper and parchment i have no record of their leaving the city jeremy gulped in agrippan rome not to have a record of something was serious business records proved a person was real they proved that things had really happened by contrast not having records meant something hadnt happened at all that could be a problem if jeremy and amanda were stuck here in polisso with no escape through a transposition chamber it could be a big problem i dont know anything about that jeremy said they had to go back to carnuto and so they did if your guards dont know about it they cant have been keeping up with things very well can they the city prefect had poked him so he poked back accusing the gate guards of not keeping the proper records was like accusing sesto capurnio of sleeping on the job capurnio glared you will give me an affidavit concerning this he asked in a harsh voice an affidavit would give him the record he wanted jeremy nodded sure i will he said he didnt like lying but he liked being cut off from the home timeline even less very well by sesto capurnios scowl it was anything but jeremy wished he hadnt angered the city prefect but if capurnio didnt believe mom and dad had left polisso what was he going to believe that jeremy and amanda had killed their parents the punishment for that was putting each guilty person in a sack with a dog a cock and a snake and throwing all the sacks in the river in some ways agrippan rome had changed very little from ancient days sesto capurnio called in a secretary the man took down jeremys statement using a stylus to write the words on wax that coated one side of a wooden tablet that was what the locals used for a scratch pad when the secretary made a mistake he rubbed it out with the blunt end of the stylus and wrote over it let me have that capurnio said when jeremy was done the secretary gave him the tablet he read the affidavit aloud is this the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth he asked at the end it is jeremy answered some of it was true his mother and father had left polisso and he didnt know when theyd be back if they hadnt gone out by way of the west gate the locals didnt need to know that do you swear by capurnio paused you are an imperial christian is that not so yes illustrious prefect the illustrious prefects face said he had a low opinion of all christians imperial or otherwise his words though were all business do you swear then by your god and by your hopes for the emperors health long life and success that what you have stated is true and complete i do illustrious prefect go on thenand thank you again for your generosity sesto capurnio added grudgingly thank you for your kindness illustrious prefect jeremy said sesto capurnio turned around and looked at his collection of imperial heads the emperors stared back without a blink jeremy left the city prefects house in a hurry he had the feeling capurnio might not have let him go if he stayed much longer amanda sat in the courtyard with a customer they both enjoyed the warm summer sun house sparrows sat on the edge of the red roof tiles and chirped a starling hopped around in the herb garden every now and then it plunged its bananayellow beak into the dirt sometimes it got something good to eat sometimes it had to try again she could have seen house sparrows and starlings in los angeles of course neither was native to north america she didnt know how house sparrows had got there at the end of the nineteenth century a mad englishman who wanted america to have all of shakespeares birds had imported ten dozen starlings to central park in new york city hed brought in nightingales too the nightingales promptly died out there were millions and millions of starlings all over the continent it struck amanda as a bad bargain her customer was a matron named livia plurabella she was a little older than mom and would have been a beauty if smallpox scars hadnt slagged her cheeks she took the scars in stride much more than she would have in amandas world here plenty of womenand men toohad their looks ruined the same way men could hide pockmarks with a beard women had to make do with powder and paint livia plurabella didnt even try she must have known a losing battle when she saw one let me have a look at that one if you please she said pointing to a straight razor with a motherofpearl handle i like the way it gives back the sunlight here you are my lady amanda said the older woman was the wife of the richest banker in town he wasnt a noble in fact he was the son of a freedman banking wasnt a highclass profession in agrippan rome but here as everywhere else money talked and money marco plurabello had his wife opened the razor isnt that something she murmured she seemed to admire the glitter of the sun off the edge even more than the way it brought out the pink and silver of the motherofpearl she shaved a patch of hair on her arm well she said isnt that something the blade was of better steel and sharper than anything local smiths could make if you strop it regularly it will last you a lifetime amanda said that was true even though women in agrippan rome shaved more places than they did in california the notion of shaving with a straight razor made amanda queasy anyway jeremy hadnt wanted to try it either a mistake with that thing wasnt a nick it was a disaster livia plurabella looked at the bare spot on her forearm she felt of it i believe you she said by the way she brought those words out she didnt use them every day she closed the razor it clicked she waited one eyebrow raised a hundred fifty denari amanda answered the unspoken question well the bankers wife said again i thought you would put the price in grain weve changed our policy there amanda said sensible very sensible livia plurabella nodded ill give you eighty for the razor im sorry but no we havent changed our policy there at all amanda said we dont haggle she still wondered how much trouble they would get into for taking money instead of grain if crosstime traffic wanted to yell about that the company was welcome to yell as much as it cared to she and jeremy had nowhere to store grain if they couldnt ship it out of polisso but they were trying to bend as few rules as they could livia plurabella frowned it was the sort of frown that said you cant possibly mean what you just said kid it was meant to intimidate amanda instead it made her mad the matron said i dont know that i want this razor enough to pay one hundred fifty denari for it thats for you to decide my lady amanda said politely weve sold several at that priceor the equivalent in grainand nobodys complained if you want to keep on using something ordinary though go right ahead livia plurabella frowned again this time she looked worried amanda hoped she was imagining other women having something she didnt amanda also hoped she was imagining the other women laughing at her because she didnt have it advertising was one more place where the home timeline had a long lead on agrippan rome amanda had seen a million commercials almost without thinking she knew what buttons to push and livia plurabella didnt know what to do when amanda pushed them i dont think youre being reasonable about the price she complained but her voice lacked conviction amanda pounced oh but i am my lady you admired the motherofpearl it comes all the way from the red sea what little motherofpearl the romans had did come from there she went on and if you can find an edge like that on any other razor any razor you dont sell you mean the other woman broke in yes thats right amanda nodded proudly everything we sell is of the best quality if you can find something to match it anywhere else go ahead and do that she pushed another button there people in polisso couldnt get anything to match what the crosstime traders sold and they knew it livia plurabellas face said just how well she knew it oh all right she sounded angrymore angry at the world than angry at amanda a hundred fifty denari we have a bargain ill write up your contract amanda said and she did she hoped livia plurabella could read otherwise she would have to witness the local womans mark even if she did marco plurabello might still raise a stink and claim shed cheated his wife that wouldnt be true or just but he was a power in polisso he wouldnt need truth or justice on his side to get what he wanted but livia plurabella proved to have her letters as amanda had hoped she would if any woman in polisso was likely to a bankers wife would let me have that pen please the matron said amanda gave it to her she wrote her name on both copies of the contract here thank you very much my lady amanda said ill send a slave with the money the bankers wife said her fatherinlaw had once been a slave that didnt keep her from owning them amanda wondered why not one of the harder things about living in agrippan rome was that there were so many questions she couldnt ask one of these days one of these yearsscholars would look at history and literature and law and custom here and figure out some answers to questions like those but amanda wanted to know now the trouble with finding the alternates and visiting so many of them was that there were always more questions than answers there probably always would be there sure were now too many alternates not enough people exploring them the last time anything this important happened in the home timeline columbus discovered the new world the alternates were far far bigger than north and south america and theyd been known for less than a lifetime no wonder there were still so many things to learn the wonder was that people from the home timeline had found out as much as they had then livia plurabella said ive heard you people dont keep slaves can that be true she wasnt shy about indulging her curiosity yes its true amanda said that was no secret really the local womans eyes their edges outlined with powdered antimony went wide by the gods dear how do you ever get anything done without other people to do it for you we do it ourselves amanda answered she didnt mention that they had gadgets here no locals could see aside from the wrongs of slaveryand its being illegal for people from the home timeline to have anything to do withhaving the gadgets made it impossible for the traders to have slaves too too many questions they would have to answer amanda laughed at herself thered been answers she wanted to get but there were also answers she couldnt give shed certainly puzzled livia plurabella how do you manage that the bankers wife asked when do you sleep when do you bathe we just do what needs doing as best we can amanda thought she could ask one of her questions now how do you own people who are just like you they arent people just like me theyre slaves livia plurabella said completely missing amandas point this had to be the first time anyone had ever questioned slavery in the matrons hearing she hesitated she was polite too in her own way then she asked youre christian arent you dear yes amanda said imperial christian i know christians have some some different ideas yes livia plurabella was working very hard to be polite she went on do christians have some sort of interesting notion that slavery is bad i never heard theyyoudid no theyuh wedont amanda answered that was true for all kinds of christians in agrippan rome it had also been true for christians in the roman empire of amandas world the new testament didnt say one thing about putting an end to slavery people hadnt really started opposing it till the rise of democracy in england and america and france suggested that all men should be equal under the lawand till machines started doing work instead of slaves even then america had needed a war to get rid of slavery but amanda had only perplexed livia plurabella more what have you got against it then she asked we just dont think its right for anyone to be able to buy and sell someone else amanda said and its always worse for womeneverybody knows that if the lietuvans took polisso would you want them selling and buying you such things did happen after cities fell livia plurabella turned pale she leaned towards amanda and set a manicured handa hand probably manicured by a slaveon her forearm is there going to be a war she whispered as if she didnt dare say it out loud is there what have you heard shed missed the point again or most of it but war was no small thing either i havent heard anything new amanda said all i know is everybodys worried about it some of the matrons color came back gods be praised she said in a voice more like her own a sack is the worst thing in the world pray to your own funny god that you never have to find out how bad a sack can be she got to her feet i will send the slave with the money no you dont need to show me out dear i know the way off she went the hem of her long wool tunic sweeping around her ankles amanda wanted to know how she knew about sacks she also wanted to ask her more questions about slavery now that she had the chance but livia plurabella had done all the talking she intended to do she opened the front door then closed it behind her amanda sighed the chance was gone jeremy was tossing a ball back and forth in the street with a boy named fabio lentulo and nicknamed barbatothe guy with the beard fabio was jeremys age more or less he was a skinny little fellow a head shorter than jeremy hed been apprenticed to the silversmith whose shop stood a few doors down from jeremys house jeremy had got to know him the summer before even then fabio had had this thick curly luxuriant beard on cheeks and chin and upper lip jeremy didnt know if his own beard would be that heavy when he was thirtyor ever playing catch in the street here was an adventure they had to do it over and through traffic which paid no attention to them the ball was leather and stuffed with feathers it wasnt especially round it would have made a crummy baseball for throwing back and forth though it was all right jeremy dodged a creaking oxcart he lofted the ball over the sacks of beans or barley piled high in the back of the cart fabio jumped to catch it when he came down he almost got trampled by a horse with big clay jars of wine tied to its back the man leading the horse called him several different kinds of idiot fabio gave back better than he got grinning he sent jeremy running after the ball with a high lob his foot splashed down in a smelly puddle the instant he made the catch the dirty waterhe hoped it was water anywaysplattered him and three or four people around him they all told him just what they thought since he was as disgusted as they were he couldnt even yell back he flung the ball right at fabios nose as hard as he could it wouldnt have hurt much had it hit but it didnt the apprentice snatched it out of the air he grinned his teeth were white but crooked got you he said and threw the ball back this time jeremy caught it without disaster so fabio thought landing him in trouble was fun did he why arent you at work jeremy shouted my boss is down sick so he didnt open up fabio answered why arent you i will be pretty soon if you dont get me killed first jeremy said and fabio lentulos grin got bigger jeremy threw the ball high in the air fabio had to look up to follow its flight that meant he couldnt watch where he was going he caught itand staggered back into one of the four big men carrying a sedan chair jolted out of step the man swore and boxed fabios ear the woman sitting in the sedan chair screeched at the apprentice now jeremy was the one who grinned two can play at that game he called from then on it was who could land whom in a worse pickle how they didnt get killed or badly hurt jeremy never understood that they didnt lose the ball might have been an even bigger marvel and then everything even the ball game came to a stop a herald went through the streets shouting all who are not roman citizens or legal residents have two days to vacate polisso by order of the most illustrious city prefect sesto capurnio and the most noble and valiant garrison commander annio basso all who are not roman citizens or legal residents have two days to vacate polisso after that they may be arrested their property may be seized they may be sold as slaves hear ye hear ye all who are not he started over again as loud as he could that doesnt sound good jeremy said sounds like a war all right fabio lentulo agreed dont want any stinking lietuvans around to open the gates at night or something why would they want to do that jeremy asked the silversmiths apprentice looked at him as if hed just lost his mind because theyre lietuvans fabio said with exaggerated patience theyd rather have their stupid king rule here than the emperor gods bless him theyd rather have everybody bow down to their stupid gods tooperkunas and all the others nobody ever heard of what do you want to bet theyre throwing romans out of their ugly old towns too what jeremy would have bet was that fabio had never been more then ten kilometers outside of polisso in his life he had no way of knowing whether the towns in the kingdom of lietuva were ugly for that matter he had no way of knowing whether king kuzmickas was stupid either but he believed those things because he lived in the roman empire if hed lived in lietuva he would have thought the emperor was stupid and roman towns were ugly and roman gods were stupid nationalism wasnt as strong in this world as it was in the home timeline but it existed fabio lentulo suddenly looked like a ferret that had spotted a mouse i know where some of those lousy lietuvans live he said they wont be able to take all their stuff with themnot if theyve only got two days to pack the plundering ought to be juicy no thanks jeremy said leave me out why not now fabio really couldnt believe what he was hearing who knows what all theyll have to leave behind but jeremy shook his head the apprentice stared you ore weird whats wrong with plundering a bunch of rotten foreigners i dont care that theyre foreigners jeremy answered theyre merchants so am i i wouldnt want anybody plundering me if i had to get out of town is that the golden rule thing christians go on and on about fabio asked wellyes jeremy said surprised the local had heard of it fabio lentulo might have heard of it but he wasnt much impressed with a scornful wave he said bunch of crap if you ask me you do your friends all the good you can and your enemies all the harm you can and thats how you come out on top the ancient greeks and romans had believed the same thing plenty of people in jeremys world still did but they mostly pretended they didnt in agrippan rome christianity hadnt changed morals as much as it had back home people here were more openly for themselves than they were in the home timeline maybe that explains why they dont worry about owning slaves jeremy thought if somebody was a slave didnt he have it coming to him jeremy liked the ideafor about half a minute then he remembered all the men whod owned slaves in the south before the civil war and whod called themselves good christians he sighed things werent so simple as they looked at first he saw things like that more and more often as he got older hed begun to suspect that no small part of growing up was seeing that more and more things werent so simple as they looked at first trouble was he liked being sure watching certainties disappear under the magnifying glass was a jolt every time you could of course pretend things were as simple as youd believed when you were a kid you couldif you didnt mind living a lie or maybe if you just refused to look facts in the face some people did lots of people did in fact jeremy wondered how then he had to make a quick grab to keep the ball from hitting him in the eye fabio lentulo screeched laughter i thought youd gone to sleep there he said if you had i was going to slit your belt pouch jeremy threw the ball back to the crows with you he said an insult the locals often used good to your friends and bad to your enemies you said am i your enemy if you want to steal from me my enemy nah the silversmiths apprentice shook his head but you sure were acting like a dopey friend there he heaved the ball high in the air after a run that involved dodging two women and almost tripping over a dog jeremy caught it at his belt buckle willie mays had invented that kind of catch a century and a half before his time hed seen old video he wasnt so smooth as willie mays but he was plenty smooth enough to impress fabio lentulo let me try that the apprentice called jeremy flung it high fabio staggeredhe almost tripped over that dog tooand tried his own basket catch the ball thudded to the cobbles at his feet jeremy jeered fabio lentulo came back with something just as nasty they both laughed the game went on every day amanda would go into the secret part of the basement hoping to see a message on the powerbooks screen every day she would be disappointed every day she would try to send her own message every day the computer would tell her she couldnt and every day she would go back up to the main level wishing none of this were happening wishes like that were worth their weight in gold amanda knew as much knowing didnt keep her from making them every day no message came every day she and jeremy remained cut off in polisso was an argument no message would ever come an argument theyd stay cut off forever she thought about livia plurabella if she was stuck here would she turn into someone like that in another twentyfive years wondering what you would be like when you grew up was scary enough when you were doing it in your own world when you might be stranded forever in a place where you didnt want to live then again stranded forever might be stretching things the lietuvan traders still left in polisso got out of town the day after the city prefect and the garrison commander finally issued the order expelling them some of their wagons rattled past the house where amanda and jeremy were staying amanda peered out through one of the handful of narrow windows that opened on the street traffic in polisso was as insane as usual that meant the lietuvans couldnt get out of town in a hurry no matter how much they wanted to it also gave the locals the chance to pay them a not so fond farewell get out never come back godscursed blond barbarians those were a few of the nicer goodbyes people yelled the rest amanda had heard some vile things at canoga park high what the people of polisso called the departing lietuvans would have made the toughest kid there turn green they didnt just call them names either they threw things they had nastier things to throw than they would have in los angeles squishy vegetables and balls of manure were bad enough but the stench of rotten eggs seemed ten times worse amanda couldnt get away from it either the windows had no glass closing the shutters didnt do a dollars worth of good the worst of it was the lietuvans had to take the abuse if theyd tried to hit back they wouldnt have got out of polisso alive if theyd tried to hit back the people in the street wouldnt have thrown dung and rotten eggs they would have thrown rocks and jars instead they probably would have mobbed the foreigners too and so stonefaced the lietuvans pushed on toward the gate they tried to keep the flying garbage from spooking their horses and mules and oxen too badly they also tried to duck so they didnt get too filthy some of the lietuvans had been in polisso a long time long enough to have brought their wives down from their own country the fairhaired women tall by the standards of this world left the town with their men the locals spattered them with filth too some of the things they called them made the names they gave the lietuvan men sound friendly by comparison at last after what seemed much too long the hubbub moved closer to the gate amanda retreated to the courtyard but the stink of hydrogen sulfide lingered there too jeremy walked into the courtyard a minute or so later he looked grim he must have been watching the lietuvans leave from another window nice people he said he didnt mean the lietuvans he meant the locals who had harried them on their way amanda nodded really we wouldnt do anything like that jeremy said oh i dont know amanda remembered her us history class again look what happened to the japaneseamericans during the second world war so her brother didnt buy the argument that was a hundred fifty years ago are you saying wed keep slaves because they kept slaves in the south before the civil war well maybe not amanda admitted but the second world war was a lot closer to now than the civil war was people acted more like us a little maybe but not a whole lot jeremy said it was still a long time ago they didnt have any computers they only had one telephone for every seven people in the country you ask me thats backward hed just finished a highschool us history course now that he reminded her of it amanda remembered running into that statistic too but she never would have thought of it on her own she asked how do you come up with that stuff shed asked him questions like that before so he knew what she meant hed never been able to give her a good answer though he couldnt now either he said i dont know i just do which told her nothing whatsoever but then he said how do you know what people are feeling i cant do that or not very well no amanda said in surprisesurprise that vanished when she thought it over and realized jeremy was right he didnt just see how people worked he always had to work it through inside his mind sometimes he didnt come up with the right answers even then maybe that was the other side of the coin to being able to remember how many telephones the united states had during world war ii given a choice amanda knew which one she would rather be able to do but people didnt get choices like that they were what they were and had to make the most of it some remembered better and thought straighter than others some felt more clearly than others a lucky handful maybe could do all those things well whatever you were good at though you needed to make the most of it if you did things wouldnt turn out too bad most of the time amanda wished that hadnt occurred to her just then every once in a while things happened to you where it didnt matter how smart you were or how well you remembered or how clearly you felt getting stuck in agrippan rome sure looked like one of those things amanda didnt see what she or jeremy could have done to stop that he started to say something else but some more noise outside the house made him stop what now amanda exclaimed lietuvans again doesnt quite sound like that jeremy answered and he was right these shouts sounded happy and excited they didnt have the fierce baying undertone that had been there when people jeered the lietuvans out of polisso he said wed better go find out amanda nodded her brother didnt need to think very clearly to have that straight she got to a window just in time to see and hear another herald coming up the street war he shouted lietuvan soldiers have crossed the border we have begun the fight to drive them back because the gods love us we will win war hear ye hear ye war is declared seven jeremy had thought bullets and cannonballs would start flying as soon as war between rome and lietuva was declared that was how things worked in his worldnot that people there bothered declaring war any more they just launched missiles and sent tanks over the border things were more formal here the gunpowder empires clung to rituals and customs that had their roots in the days of ancient greece and even if bullets and cannonballs flew fast here too armies didnt they were tied to the speed at which a man could march and a horsedrawn wagon could roll nobody went anywhere in a hurry not in the world of agrippan rome the people of polisso took advantage of the time they had before the lietuvans arrived more soldiers came into the town these troops tramping up from the south more wagons full of wheat and barley came with them as far as men and supplies went polisso was ready to stand siege whether the walls were ready was another question they were made of thick stone sure enough but even thick stone walls fell down if enough cannonballs hit them in the home timeline people had solved that by building huge earthen ramparts instead of stone walls they werent so impressive but they worked better a cannonball that hit piledup earth didnt go crash it went thud and buried itself without doing much harm nobody here had figured that out yet it had taken two or three hundred years to see in the home timeline and wars there had been a lot more common than they were here there in the centuries right after the invention of guns europe had been crowded with a whole slew of kingdoms and principalities and duchies and independent archbishoprics and free cities and even the occasional republic somebody was always fighting somebody else and either coming up with new tricks on his own or stealing the almostnew tricks somebody else had come up with a few hundred kilometers away it wasnt like that here almost all of europe belonged to either rome or lietuva almost all the near east belonged to either rome or persia the gunpowder empires did fight among themselves but they usually fought once a generation more or less there wasnt the unending strife that had lit a fire under change in the home timeline and now is the time jeremy thought joy and rapture the first lietuvan cavalrymen reached the outskirts of polisso eight days after news of the declaration of war they attacked a wagon train bringing still more grain into the town jeremy heard the details only later in the market square at the time all he noticed were a few distant bangs like fourth of july fireworks at a park a couple of kilometers away the big clumsy matchlock pistols cavalrymen here carried couldnt be reloaded on horseback the lietuvans did most of their damage with bow and sword and lance most of the time they would have set fires all through the fields around polisso not much point to that today though because it had rained the day before the horsemen trampled long swaths through the green growing wheat then rode back the way theyd come several of the wagons rumbled past the house where jeremy and amanda were living some of the animals that pulled them had been hurt some of the men who drove them had been hurt too jeremy gulped at the sight of bandages strained soakedwith blood he gulped even more at the sight of flesh punctured by bullets or split by swords some of the wounds had been roughly stitched up in the field the drivers and guards whod been hurt moaned or wailed or screamed in los angeles in the home timeline jeremy saw gore at the movies or on tv or in video games hed hardly ever run into the real thing himself oh hed gone past a restaurant once not long after a shooting and hed seen a few traffic accidents where people got hurt but hed never seen so many men other men had hurt on purpose before and hed never had the feeling this could happen to me he did now doctors ran toward the wounded drivers and guards they might do a little good they had longhandled probes for digging out bullets they could sew up swordcuts and set broken bones but all they had to fight pain while they worked was opium which wasnt nearly enough and all they had to fight infection was wine injured men screamed louder when the doctors splashed it on their wounds jeremy would have screamed too rubbing alcohol stung like the devil when you put it on a little scrape splashing something full of alcohol on a gaping cut just the idea made him shudder wine wasnt that good a disinfectantbetter than nothing but not great and there was more filth in this world than in the home timelinefar more some of those wounds would fester when they did there was nothing to do but drain them and hope for the best a lot of the time that wouldnt be enough either some men would die of fever no one in this alternate could do a thing about it about half an hour after the wagons came into polisso someone knocked on the front door jeremy opened it waiting in the street was a lean dark man in a tunic of good wool but without too much embroidered ornament after a second or two jeremy recognized him good day sir he said politely youre lucio claudio arent you called fusco yes that is correct lucio claudio nodded he had the air of somebody who liked to dot every i and cross every t i have the honor to act as man of affairs for gaio fulvio called magno yes i know wont you come in jeremy stepped inside we can sit in the courtyard if you like would you care for some wine and honey cakes thank you that would be pleasant by the frown ironed onto lucio claudios face he had trouble finding anything pleasant but he was being polite too jeremy sat him down on a bench in the courtyard he politelyadmired the flowers jeremy went into the kitchen to get wine and cakes for the two of them while he was there amanda came in and hissed whats he want dont know yet jeremy answered he hasnt said his sister looked daggers in the direction of lucio claudio hes a snoop well who here isnt jeremy said hes gaio fulvios man too and gaio fulvio is a big wheel in this town people say hes got sesto capurnio in his back pocket i wouldnt be surprised i cant just ignore his man of affairs dont trust him amanda said fiercely i dont intend to jeremy picked up the tray no matter what you think im not dumb dont be thats all amanda scowled at him he carried the refreshments out to lucio claudio gaio fulvios man of affairs praised the cakesonce more politely he spilled out a small libation for the gods and muttered a prayer before he drank any wine he waited for jeremy to do the same jeremy did but in place of the prayer said only to the spirit of the emperor you are a christian the local asked frowning yes were imperial christians jeremy answered it is permitted lucio claudio admitted his face said it wouldnt be if he had anything to do with the way things worked he took another sip of wine then gave a grudging nod not bad glad you like it jeremy said even if the man of affairs hadnt gone that far i hope your principal is pleased with his hourreckoner he is again lucio claudio sounded as if he was admitting something he would rather not have he is he repeated though he does still wonder how you few merchants are the only ones who sell such marvelous devices hourreckoners are not the only things we sell you know jeremy said proudly we have fine razors too and mirrors of wonderful quality and knives with sharp blades and many attached tools amanda had told him to be careful hed said he would but he hadnt hed started bragging instead and that turned out not to be such a good idea just then he couldnt even blame the wine hed had only a sip lucio claudio smiled it was the sort of smile an evil banker in a bad movie might have given when he foreclosed on a widows mortgage yes i do know about these things he said so does sesto capurnio uhoh jeremy thought too late he did his best to cover up im sure he hasnt got any complaints about quality or value no lucio claudio didnt like admitting that either but the sharksteeth smile didnt slip from his face because of the many ah unusual matters pertaining to your family he now requests and requires an official report on your activities what jeremy thought this time wasnt uhoh it was damn an official report meant imperial bureaucrats were going to take a long close look at the traders from crosstime traffic that was the last thing he wanted well no he shook his head the last thing he wanted was to be cut off from the home timeline he had that now he had this too talk about adding insult to injury maybe he could stall if he couldnt get out of it he said regulations state that an official report must be requested in writing so they do and why am i not surprised that you know those regulations very well lucio claudio had a nasty sarcastic streak he also looked to be enjoying himself from his belt pouch he pulled a rolledup sheet of papyrus sealed with a ribbon and a big blobby red wax seal he aimed it at jeremy as if it were a pistol here thank you jeremy said meaning anything but he broke the seal and unrolled the papyrus it was what the local had said it was in the most complicated classical latin at his command sesto capurnioor more likely his secretary ordered an official report on the deeds and practices of the soltero family jeremy looked at when the report was due as if it were one for school three weeks he sighed it could have been worse they could have wanted it day after tomorrow if they were really suspicious they would have wanted it day after tomorrow of course if they were really suspicious they would have torn the house apart for answers but answers they wanted even if they were willingfor nowto ask instead of tear the more jeremy looked at the written request the less happy he got the bureaucrats of agrippan rome took pride in their attention to detail theyd outdone themselves here they wanted to know how every item crosstime traffic traders sold was made if that information wasnt available they wanted to know where the traders got each one they wanted to know how much the traders paid for each they wanted to find out about profit margins they were curious about why the traders always wanted grain not cash this is a mistake jeremy pointed to that question we take silver ask livia plurabella if you dont believe me let me see lucio claudio examined the paragraph he scratched his chin do you claim the error makes the official request invalid i could jeremy said gaio fulvios man had to know as much too any mistake on an official document invalidated it that could be true even in the home timeline here it was as much an article of faith as the cult of the emperor if you do i will return with a revised request lucio claudio said i do not know when i will return i do know the date on which we want your official report will not change unless it moves up the romans also wanted to know where jeremy and amandas folks had gone hed already explained that to sesto capurnio if they were still asking the city prefect didnt much like what hed heard at least he wasnt sending men to dig up the basement and see if mom and dads bodies were there that was somethinga very small something i wont make the claim jeremy said lucio claudio looked smug jeremy added i am going to remind you theres a war on though if king kuzmickas and the lietuvans lay siege to polisso i dont know if i can get the official report in on time flying cannonballs make it hard to write he didnt want lucio claudio thinking himself the only one who could be sarcastic i suggest you get to work on the report now then lucio claudio sounded just like a teacher when a student complained about too much work the sooner you start the sooner youll finish thanks a lot jeremy thought he almost said that out loud just in time he swallowed it instead he already had enough problems here why make things worse by offending lucio claudio sitting there eating honey cakes and sipping wine with him made the next half hour the most uncomfortable time jeremy had ever spent it wasnt a year before the local finally left it only seemed that way amanda looked up from the official request to her brother she said well i know the best thing we can hope for what the lietuvans blow up polisso he asked no mom and dad get back before we have to give the prefect the report oh jeremy thought about that he nodded but not as if his heart was in it we can hope yeah but i just dont know somethings got really messed up in the home timeline if it hadnt we wouldnt have been stuck here by ourselves so long already it wasnt that he was wrong he was right he was in fact much too right amanda had done her best not to think about why no one had sent them any messages why no transposition chamber had shown up in the subbasementor for that matter in the cave a few kilometers away if the lietuvans besieged polisso that cave wouldnt do the crosstime traffic people much good theyd be on the outside looking in could they get through a whole army maybe but amanda didnt see how she had to look at staying here not just for a summer with her folks but forever forever she couldnt imagine a scarier word only one thing kept her from breaking down and crying in something as close to panic as made no difference she didnt want jeremy laughing at her for going to pieces like a girl it never occurred to her to wonder how close jeremy was to going to pieces himself sooner or later theyre bound to come after us he said was he talking to convince her or to convince himself they cant just leave us here if hed stopped there it would have been a pretty good pep talk but he went on i wish i knew what happened at the other end maybe amanda let her voice trail away maybe what jeremy asked amanda said the worst thing she could think of maybe somebody found crosstime traffic people from the home timeline had only been traveling to the alternates for about fifty years they hadnt discovered all of them the math said they probably couldnt discover all of them they hadnt even scratched the surface of the infinite swarm of alternates that were out there they sure hadnt discovered anyone else who could go from one timeline to another but just because they hadnt discovered anyone like that didnt mean there wasnt anyone in a timeline that had branched off from theirs long long ago other people might have figured out how to go crosstime five hundred years ago or five thousand they might have their own trading zoneor their own crosstime empire and if they did and if they noticed newcomers they might not be friendly they might not be friendly at all that could be very bad news indeed nice cheerful thought all right jeremy said but i dont believe it why now why not before i dont know amanda said but why not now if youve got a good reason id love to hear it she really hoped her brother would come up with something jeremy was smart and he was a year older most of the time that didnt matter every once in a while it did if he knew why crosstime travelers from a faraway alternate couldnt have found the home timeline that would have been wonderful but he just said it doesnt seem likely thats all getting stuck here doesnt seem likely either amanda burst out but we are why something went wrong somewherethats got to be it jeremy said which was true but wasnt reassuring it doesnt mean the home timelines been invaded by one where alexander the great discovered transposition chambers it could mean that you know it could amanda said it could mean all kinds of things bombs earthquakes who knows what jeremy was trying very hard to be reasonable why come up with something thats never happened before and probably isnt happening now because i never got stuck in an alternate before amanda blazed the more reasonable jeremy tried to be the less reasonable she wanted to be he went right on trying it has to be something natural something possible for heavens sake whats so impossible about somebody else discovering crosstime travel amanda asked we did ourselves and we worry about it on some of the timelines that arent far from ours why not somebody else a long time ago well if somebody else did do it theyre liable to come up from the subbasement and wipe us out in the next twenty minutes jeremy said what are we going to do about that amanda hadnt the faintest idea she hadnt thought she could feel any worse than she did already now she discovered she was wrong thanks a lot she told her brother you just gave me something brand new to worry about he shook his head nope no point worrying about that because we cant do anything about it what we can do is worry about this lousy official report and about selling as much as we can and about doing whatever we can to make sure the lietuvans dont take polisso getting captured and sold into slavery can ruin your whole day so can getting killed amanda pointed out that too jeremy said he was so grave so earnest so serious that amanda started to laugh she couldnt help it when jeremy was being reasonable she didnt want to think when he was being serious she wanted to act like a clown what went through her mind was anybody would think hes my big brother or something i dont know what else we can do except wait and hope and keep trying our best as long as were stuck here he said now that was what shed been thinking too she hadnt liked the idea it was the best they could manage no doubt of that it still seemed grim or it had seemed grim till he said it then all of a sudden it was the funniest thing in the world that made no sense at all which didnt stop it from being true she giggled jeremy gave her an odd look youre weird he said you only just noticed amanda laughed harder than ever it was probably no more than reaction to too much stress carried for too long it felt awfully good anyhow solemn as usual jeremy shook his head again no id suspected it for a while now really what gave you the clue sherlock im punchy amanda thought well who could blame me ive earned the right the market square was a busy place these days everybody who lived in polisso was trying to get hold of enough food to last out a siege the soldiers whod come to reinforce the garrison were laying in food too they all reminded jeremy of squirrels gathering nuts for the winter but that was important business for the squirrels and this was important business for the locals if you had grain to sell you could pretty much name your price somebody would pay it jeremy knew how many modii of wheat were stored under the house he didnt want to sell them though even if he could make a lot of silver on the deal the local authorities already wondered about amanda and him they would ask why those sacks of wheat hadnt left the city the way they thought the grain had they would accuse him of profiteering if he sold now a soldier was arguing with a farmer you should take less he said how come the farmer said when am i going to get another chance to make this kind of money but youre cheating me the soldier said by the gods im not the farmer answered he was a big burly man almost as tall as jeremy and half again as wide through the shoulders next to him the soldier was a skinny yappy little terrier the farmer went on if you dont want to pay what i ask you dont have to ill find other customers not if the city prefect or the commandant sets a top price the soldier said they can do that all they have to do is declare danger of siege everybody knows thats real then fixing prices is as legal as buying and selling slaves oh yes its legal but prefects dont try it very often the farmer said and do you know why because when they set a top price they always set it too cursed low then nobody wants to sell any grain it just disappears from the market and people start going hungry you you the soldier looked as if he couldnt find anything bad enough to call the farmer to the crows with you he snarled at last and stalked off disgust showed in every line of his body laughing the farmer turned to jeremy and said id like to see him get a better deal from anybody else jeremy nodded the farmer thought the way a merchant had to think but if your city was in danger didnt you have to ease off on that approach if you didnt wouldnt you end up without a city to do business in who decided when you did that how did whoever it was draw the line those were all good questions jeremy didnt have good answers for any of them he was scratching his head as he went on to the temple dedicated to the emperors spirit when he stopped in the narthex to get a pinch of incense to light on the altar the clerk who took his three denari for it looked puzzled by the records ieremeo soltero you have already made the required offering why are you here to make another offering jeremy said polisso may be in danger after all how publicspirited of you the clerk said jeremy did his best to look modest he felt more like a hypocrite than ever but he wanted officials seeing him acting publicspirited it might help take the heat off amanda and him even if it didnt it couldnt hurt and what were three denari to him nothing but monopoly money the clerk gave him his receipt and the incense it smelled sweeter than the last pinch hed got maybe they saved extracheap stuff for people making required offerings and gave you something better if you were doing it because you really wanted to jeremy didnt know for sure up till now he didnt think any trader had made offerings that werent required he carried the incense into the temple proper there they were all the gods the romans recognized in statue or painting or mosaic form they all seemed to be looking at him he didnt believe in any of them except possibly jesus and the jesus he knew wasnt the same as the one in this world the effect was impressive even so several pinches of incense already smoked on the altar either other people wanted to look publicspirited or they were worried well im worried too jeremy thought but he didnt believe lighting this incense would help make his worries go away he lit it anyhow then stepped on the twig hed used to make it start burning the smoke from the incense definitely smelled better than it had the last time he sacrificed the image of honorio prisco iii stared blindly from behind the altar jeremy recited the prayer an imperial christian gave the emperors spirit it still felt more like pledging allegiance to the flag than praying but neither of the two men who stood near the altar to listen to prayers complained hed done what he needed to do and hed done it right and now he understooda little better anyhowwhat his dad said about the uses of hypocrisy he wondered if hed ever have the chance to tell dad so even though amandas house had running water she liked visiting the fountain people of the female persuasion couldnt go as many places or do as many things in this world as men could at the baths and at the public fountains age and wealth and social class didnt matter so much a woman could say what she pleased and a lot of women did when amanda went to the fountain on a warm sticky summer afternoon she found several women complaining about the soldiers quartered in their houses they eat like dragons said a plump middleaged woman in a saffron tunic and then they grumble about the cooking do they pay a sestertio for what they get do they not likely another woman also plump nodded they lie around snoring till all hours too and they dont bathe often enough or at all she held her nose for good measure she scratched as if she had fleas amanda wondered how much shed had to do with soldiers before her tunic was saffron yellow too which meant she had money saffron dye wasnt cheap here and in this world you had to be rich to have enough food to get overweight a couple of lines of kipling from english lit also ran through amandas head for its tommy this an tommy that an chuck im out the brute but its savior of is country when the guns begin to shoot theyd never heard of kipling in agrippan rome but he understood what made them tick all right the soldiers arent so bad the slave girl named maria said in a low voice we have some in our house too and they dont do anything worse than pat me a little in the home timeline that would have been bad enough it struck maria as a miracle of moderation here different worlds different standards amanda had to work to make herself remember that it wasnt always easy of course next to marias being a slave to begin with how big a deal was it that some soldiers let their hands roam more than they might have probably not very maria asked how is your mother i have not seen her for a while she and father uh left polisso amanda said he took her to a healer in carnuto whos supposed to be one of the best this side of rome or athens i hope he will help her maria said gravely she didnt say anything about dad and mom leaving the two solters children on their own here by local standards they were plenty old enough to take care of themselves i got a letter from my father not long ago amanda said he says mother is doing much better she will do better away from polisso i think thats very likely maria said with a sour smile amanda nodded maria let out a small sad sigh having your letters must be nice you can talk back and forth with carnuto and i cant even make myself heard across the street sometimes i can talk back and forth a lot farther than thator i could if we werent cut off amanda thought out loud she said if you want i could teach you your letters it isnt very hard then youd be able to read and write too at least some and its like anything else the more you do the easier it gets marias jaw dropped could you she whispered i dont think my owner would mind id be worth more to him if i knew something like that andher eyes widenedand id be able to read the bible for myself what could be better than that not all the books in the new testament here were the same as they were in the home timeline the gospel according to john didnt exist in agrippan rome it was supposed to date from the first half of the second century by then history here was different enough from what had happened in amandas world that john either hadnt written or had never been born at all the acts of the apostles had the same name but didnt say all the same things and some of pauls epistles went to churches to which he hadnt written in the home timeline comparative bible scholarship across timelines was a field that was just getting off the ground it was also a field maria had never heard of she never would either as far as she knew hers was the bible amanda said yes i think you should be able to there were two or three translations into classical latin none by st jerome whod never lived here and several more into neolatin some of those were from the classical latin others from the original hebrew and aramaic and greek imperial christians had an official version other kinds of christians had different favorites the bible the word of god in my mouth maria looked as if shed just gone to heaven it would be a miracle no it wouldnt amanda said its just something you learn how to do likelike weaving for instance but everybody learns how to spin and weave maria said you have to or you dont have any clothes reading isnt like that plenty of free womenplenty of rich women evencant read its not hard honest amanda said in the home timeline the only people who could spin or weave were the ones who did it for a hobby and the ones who worked in livinghistory museums almost everybody could read though across the timelines people first learned what they most needed to know back home that was reading here it was weaving livia plurabella came up and said may i speak to you for a moment amanda soltera sure amanda said and turned away from maria the slave dropped her eyes to the cobblestones when free people spoke with each other she had to show she knew her place amanda asked is something wrong with the razor you bought my lady no no no impatiently the bankers wife shook her head i just wanted to put a flea in your ear what do you mean amanda understood the phrase the older woman wanted to warn her about something she didnt know what the bankers wife thought she needed warning about livia plurabella spelled it out its all very well to be polite to a creature like that she pointed toward maria who still made as if she were paying no attention to her social betters its all very well to be polite yes we are by the fountain after all the usual rules do slip if they didnt wed never hear anything juicy would we she smiled but only for a moment there is a difference you know between being polite and being friendly thats a bit much dont you think the most annoying thing was livia plurabella meant well she was trying to save amanda from showing bad manners that meant amanda couldnt get as angry as she wanted to smashing her water jug over the older womans head would get her talked about no matter how tempting it was she said oh its all right i dont think the slave girl minds livia plurabella took a deep breath whether she minds isnt the point dear she said sharply then she gave amanda a suspicious look are you making fun of me young lady i wouldnt do that for the world amanda exclaimed hmm the bankers wife didnt seem any happier on your head be it she said and stalked away on your head be it no matter how amanda usually aped the manners of this world she wasnt really part of it she didnt feel in her belly that being friendly with a slave was wrong the way a free woman here would livia plurabellas warning would have horrified a local merchants daughter it wouldnt have been necessary in the first place because a local merchants daughter would have played by the rules without needing to be warned if amanda felt like breaking the rules every once in a while she would and that was all there was to it she turned back to maria where were we talking about how easy reading is werent we the slave girl said dont get into trouble on my account mistress amanda she sounded worried she looked worried too amanda snorted she cant do anything to me only after the words were out of her mouth did she wonder how true they were a bankers wife was an important person in polisso which people you knew what connections you had mattered more here than in los angeles connections mattered back home but the laws and customs there assumed one person was just as good just as important as another that wasnt true here marias expression showed how untrue it was the slave said shes got clout well if you think we dont amanda let that trail away the merchants from crosstime traffic had money nothing made a better start for connections but money was only a start amanda wasnt from here livia plurabella was local and the authorities in polisso were already curiousto say the leastabout how the crosstime traders operated if you think we dont have clout you may be right she filled her jar at the fountain most of the women swung full jars up onto their heads and carried them home that way a few though carried them on the hip full as well as empty even with a hand up to support the jar on her head she couldnt have been smooth and graceful like the locals she would have looked like a clodhopper a country bumpkinbut country bumpkins carried water jugs on their heads too she had just left the fountain when she heard a noise like distant thunder it came from the north but it wasnt thunder some clouds drifted across the sky but there was no sign of rain for a moment she was puzzled then she knew what it had to begunfire the lietuvan army was on the way eight jeremy didnt know whether climbing up on the city wall was a good idea amanda thought he was nuts maybe he was but he wanted to see what was going on out beyond polisso he wasnt the only one either lots of locals were up there staring out at the advancing lietuvan army soldiers hurried back and forth on the top of the wall if ordinary people got in their way they pushed them aside they didnt waste time being nice not far from jeremy a soldier knocked a man sprawling when the local lurched to his feet blood dripped down his face he didnt say anything if he had the soldiers might have pitched him off the wall and it was a long way down on came the lietuvans their army was bigger than the roman force that had come into polisso it flew banners of gold green and redthe colors of lithuania in the home timeline lietuvan soldiers wore dull blue surcoats and tunics and breeches that made them easy to tell apart from the romans their helmets were simplermore like iron pots plopped on their heads their weapons seemed almost identical though horsemen had pistols or lances or bows and sabers foot soldiers carried pikes or muskets and straight swords they had cannon too you couldnt very well besiege a town without them slowly the guns left the road and began taking up positions around the city cavalrymen went with them to protect them from any roman attack but the romans didnt seem interested in sallying from polisso not right then instead they started shooting from the wall jeremy wished he had earplugs having a cannon go off close by was like getting smacked in the side of the head flames belched from the guns muzzle so did a great cloud of dark gray smoke the cannon and its fourwheeled carriage jerked back from the recoil ropes kept it from jerking back too far at a sergeants shouted orders the gun crew yanked on the ropes and ran it forward again a man with a dripping swab on the end of a long pole stuck it down the barrel to make sure no bits of powder or wadding still smoldered inside the swab steamed when he brought it out again that smoke made jeremy cough it also smelled familiar he wondered why for a couple of seconds hed never stood near a cannon going off before then he knew what the odor reminded him of hed smelled it at parks on the fourth of july when they set off fireworks gunpowder then gunpowder now pretty flowers of flame in the night air then a cannonball flying now jeremy saw the divot it kicked up when it hit it kept rolling after it struck the ground too the lietuvans in its path dodged jeremy had read about a civil war soldier who tried to stop a rolling cannonball with his foot hed ended up having the foot amputated the cannon crew were reloading as fast as they could another man used a tool called a wormlike a short corkscrew on the end of a long poleto drag out any chunks of wadding the swab might have missed as soon as he finished still another man set a bag of powder in the muzzle of the gun a soldier with a rammer shoved it down to the back of the cannon in went the cannonball it got rammed down too so did ragsthe waddingwhich made the cannonball fit tightly inside the barrel at the rear of the cannon a soldier poked a sharp spike into the touchhole he punctured the powder bag so fire could reach the charge inside to make sure it did he sprinkled a little finely ground gunpowder in and around the touchhole ready he yelled to the sergeant all the men on the gun crew jumped to one side so the recoiling gun carriage wouldnt run over them fire the sergeant shouted a soldier with a length of slowly burning fusethey called it match hereon the end of a long stick a linstock brought the smoldering end to the touchhole jeremy heard a brief fizz as the fine priming powder there caught thenboomthe powder in the main charge caught and sent the cannonball hurtling toward the lietuvans the whole cycle started over other cannon on the walls of polisso were shooting too the din was unbelievable and the lietuvans started shooting back not all of their guns could reach the wall every so often though the wall would shudder under jeremys feet when a ball thudded home and lietuvan foot soldiers marched forward so they could shoot their muskets at the romans on the wall they didnt break up and spread out the way modern soldiers in the home timeline would have instead they stayed in neat formation a cannonball plowed through one block of men half a dozen lietuvans went down one after the next dead or maimed the rest closed ranks and kept coming how did you train a man so he wouldnt run away when the fellow next to him got torn to pieces this wasnt videogame blood it was real it would splatter you all hot and wet you could smell it and you had to know it could have been your blood it could be your blood next but the lietuvans advanced anyhow a gate openednot one of the main city gates but a postern gate a little one out thundered some of the heavy cavalry jeremy had followed into the city not long before the lancers roared toward a block of lietuvan infantrymen bang bang bang some of the matchlocks the lietuvans carried went off two or three roman horsemen and horses fell the rest pitched into the lietuvans first with their lances then with swords ha said a man near jeremy we caught em by surprise they didnt post pikemen out in front of their musketeers our lancers wouldve had a harder time then he might have been talking about a football team not blitzing the quarterback on the other side he wasnt a soldier his tunic might have been twin to jeremys but he spoke with a serious fans serious knowledge civilians here knew how the game of war was played wars came along often enough to let the rules be known they didnt change much from one to the next out on the battlefield more lietuvan soldiers came up to help the men under attack the roman horsemen broke off the fight and galloped back toward the city behind them lietuvan muskets banged another couple of romans slid out of the saddle one of them thrashed and writhed on the grass the other lay very still the rest of the cavalry got back into polisso the spectators and some of the soldiers on the walls cheered jeremy found himself yelling and clapping his hands along with everybody else he wondered if he had lost his mind this wasnt a football game people were dying really and truly dying out there how could you cheer were the romans better than the lietuvans was emperor honorio prisco iii a finer fellow than king kuzmickas not so youd notice but the lietuvans were trying to break into polisso and do horrible things to the people inside jeremy was one of those people amanda another the roman horsemen were fighting to keep the lietuvans out wasnt that a reason to cheer for them the locals thought so and jeremy had a hard time believing they were wrong after a pause the lietuvans moved forward again this time they did what the man by jeremy had said they should they put a double line of pikemen in front of the musketeers if horsemen came out again the long pikes would help keep them away cannon kept booming from the wall every so often a cannonball would knock people over like a bowling ball knocking down pins but bowling pins didnt keep moving after they were hit they didnt scream either through the guns thunder jeremy heard the shrieks of wounded men again though the lietuvans who werent wounded kept right on coming when they got close enough the musketeers touched the smoldering ends of their matches to the vents of their guns bang bang bang flame shot from the muzzles of all the muskets a fogbank of smoke swallowed up the lietuvan soldiers bullets cracked past overhead a couple of them didnt crack past but struck home with wet meaty thunks blood poured from a roman artillerymans face it was amazingly red he let out dreadful gobbling cries of pain one of his pals led him off to a surgeon what could the locals do for a shattered jaw though that wound would have been bad in the home timeline and the man standing next to jeremy clutched at himself and fell over one minute he was handicapping the war the next it reached out and grabbed him he looked more astonished than hurt he tried to say something but blood poured from his mouth and nose instead it poured from the wound in his chest too jeremy gulped he hadnt realized how much blood a man held he had to step back in a hurry or it would have soaked his shoes after four or five minutes the man on the flagstones stopped moving he just lay there staring up at nothing with eyes that would never close again more bullets whistled by the civilians on the wall decided that wasnt a good place to stay they went down inside polisso in a disorderly stream jeremy gaped at the corpse that had been a happy living breathing man only minutes before that could have been me he thought if the lietuvans had aimed a little more to the left that could have been me death had never seemed real to him at his age it hardly ever did but the sightand the smell for the mans bowels had let goof that body made him believe in it at least for a little while so did the snap of another bullet right past his ear he didnt have to be here hed come up to see what war looked like hed found out more than he wanted to know roman musketeers were shooting back at the lietuvans as jeremy went down the stone stairs and back into the city he was nearer the end of the stream of civilians than the beginning he took some small pride in that as he walked back toward the house where he and amanda were staying he wondered why from the inside polisso hardly seemed a city under siege not at first amandas daytoday life changed very little the smoke and the smell of gunpowder were always in the air jeremy was right it did smell like the fourth of july every so often a cannonball would crash down inside the city but that hardly seemed important not at first it wasnt as if amanda could see the damage for herself while she stayed at home no news crews put it on tv no reporters interviewed bloodied survivors it might have been happening in another country but it wasnt before too long the bombardment got worse the lietuvans dug trenches and pits so they could move their cannon forward without getting hammered by polissos guns as soon as each cannon came into range it started blasting away at the city amanda thought business would go down the drain during the siege people wouldnt want to leave their homes would they they wouldnt want to spend money on luxury goods either would they after all they might need that money for food later on they came in droves the people who could afford what crosstime traffic sold had enough money that they didnt need to worry about saving it to buy grain as long as there was grain they would be able to afford it livia plurabella came back to the house to buy a watch she and amanda were in the courtyard talking when a cannonball smacked home two or three houses away the bankers wife took it in stride that was close wasnt it she said and went back to talking about which pocket watch she would rather have you were afraid of a sack before my lady amanda said arent you worried about one now livia plurabella blinked i was i remember talking about it with you now that you remind me she said but now now life has to go on doesnt it well do the best we can to hold out the barbarians and if we cantthen that will be the time to be afraid till then no she made good sense fair enough amanda said another cannonball hit something not too far away with a rending crash amanda managed a shaky laugh sometimes not being afraid is pretty hard though well yes livia plurabellas laugh was a long way from carefree too but we have to try the men expect it from us they say they want us all quivering so they can protect us but they go to pieces if we really act like that havent you noticed the same thing amanda didnt know everything there was to know about how things worked in agrippan rome she thought back to the home timeline things werent so openly sexist there but all the same she found herself nodding i think you have a point my lady of course i do the bankers wife took her own lightness for granted now show me these hourreckoners again if youd be so kind sure amanda held them up one after the other these are the three most popular ladies styles one was metalflake green one was eyesearing orange and one was hot pink like the mens pocket watches they all had gilded reliefs on the back amanda had never decided which one was the most tasteless she wouldnt have been caught dead with any of them but livia plurabella sighed theyre all beautiful amanda only smiled and nodded if her drama teacher at canoga park high had seen her face just then he would have known she could act which one costs what the local woman asked this one is two hundred denari amanda pointed to the green monstrosity this one is two hundred ten she pointed to the orange catastrophe and this one is two hundred twentyfive she pointed to the pink abomination as she often did with customers she guessed which one livia plurabella would choose she turned out to be right again too the bankers wife picked up the pocket watch with the hotpink case this is so elegant i just cant say no to it two hundred fifteen did you say dear two twentyfive amanda answered again what she was thinking didnt show on her face livia plurabella wasnt the sort of person to make slips by accident shed wanted to see if amanda would call her on it knowing that amanda enjoyed calling her on it twice as much two twentyfive livia plurabellas voice drooped but she nodded anyhow well all right we can do that draw up the contract the cannon kept booming as amanda wrote out the classical latin she hardly looked up from what she was doing life went on sure enough she couldnt do anything about the lietuvans outside since she couldnt she tried to pretend they werent there here you are she said and handed the contract to livia plurabella the matron read it then signed both copies she gave one back to amanda and kept the other ill send a slave with the payment she said as she had before and if a cannonball doesnt squash him to jelly coming or going ill have a fine new hourreckoner she laughed one thingwith the lietuvans outside the city i dont have to worry that hell run off with the money erno amanda said uncomfortably livia plurabella wagged a finger at her thats right youre the one who doesnt approve of slaves well my dear if you like working like a slave yourself thats your affair but believe you me the better sort of people dont she got to her feet and swept out of the house all by herself she made a parade the better sort of people amanda spat out the words then she spat for real on the dirt in the courtyard herb garden the idea of slavery disgusted her having to put up with it here disgusted her more if she were a slave and her mistress gave her that much money to buy something what would she do id be gone so fast her head would spin she thought but it wasnt that simple agrippan rome had slavecatchers just like the american south before the civil war whenever you went into a town you had to show who you were and what your business was the records would go into a file that made things easier for anyone who came after you you couldnt even run across the border to lietuva not in peacetime the lietuvans gave back runaway slaves from the roman empire that way the romans gave back runaway slaves from lietuva you scratch my back ill scratch yours and the poor slaves who wanted nothing but the chance to live their own lives too bad for them there were bandits in the mountains some of them were runaways but that was no life not really few lasted long at it army patrols did their best to keep banditry down and crucifixion had never gone out of style in agrippan rome amanda shivered it was an ugly way to die another cannonball crashed into polisso somebody shrieked amanda shivered again were there any ways to die that werent ugly she didnt think so bang bang bang before the siege of polisso started jeremy would have said the big iron knocker on the front door made noises like gunshots he knew better now the only thing that sounded like a gunshot was another gunshot he went to the door and opened it the man standing there wasnt someone he knew yes he said may i help you you are ieremeo soltero called alto the stranger was somewhere in his thirties he was lean and dapper and had a sly look that said he knew all sorts of strange things by the way one dark eyebrow kept jumping some of the things he knew were either funny or none of his business yes thats me jeremy answered who are you iulio balbo called pavo he said he didnt look like a peacock but he might be proud as one he went on i have the honor to be one of sesto capurnios secretaries the most illustrious city prefect sent me here to remind you that your official report is due in two days time did he jeremy said tonelessly he certainly did the secretary smirked he enjoyed seeing other people in trouble doesnt the city prefect have more important things to worry about right now jeremy asked will he read the official report while the lietuvans knock down the walls and break into the city will he take it with him when they drag him away to the slave market that wiped the smirk off iulio balbos face if you are trying to be funny ieremeo soltero funny jeremy broke in im not trying to be funny im only trying to find out whether the city prefect cares more about keeping polisso safe or about making sure all the forms get filled out at the right time there was a lot of bureaucratic foolishness in the home timeline hed seen that no one who went to a public school could help seeing it but here in agrippan rome bureaucracy wasnt just foolish it was downright idiotic and the people who ran things didnt seem to notice iulio balbos eyebrows rose no matter how sly he was he was a gear in this ponderous bureaucratic machine he wasnt likely to see any humor in it and he didnt in a voice like winter he said the report is due it is expected it is required if you do not submit it on or before the due date you will suffer the penalties the laws on the subject lay down do you understand this formal notice oh yes i understand it jeremy answered do you understand youre liable to go off to the lietuvan slave market along with the most illustrious city prefect defeatism is a crime iulio balbo said defeatism in time of declared war is a worse crime defeatism while besieged is a still worse crime as usual the locals had precise distinctions between one degree of what they thought crime and another jeremy was too angry to care i am not being defeatist the city prefect is he is paying attention to these things that are not important when he ought to be doing nothing but defending the city if you asked the garrison commandant about it what would he say maybe annio basso and sesto capurnio were working well in harness if they were iulio balbo would just laugh at that crack but he didnt laugh he scowled and turned red do not try to stir up quarrels between the prefect and the commandant he warned that is also an offense what isnt an offense here jeremy wondered im not trying to stir up anything he said i asked a reasonable question and you didnt give me an answer or maybe you did you may be as clever as you please you may quibble with words however you please the official report is still due in two days remember that obey the law iulio balbos bow was a small masterpiece of sarcasm he stalked away like a cat with ruffled fur muttering jeremy closed the door he was the sort who usually put schoolwork off till the last minute without a deadline he couldnt get interested in what he was supposed to do well he had a deadline now this was work of a different kind from what he got in school there he had to show off how much he knew here he would have to disguise most of what he knew he sat down with pen and ink and paper and got to work he set out to make the report as confusing as he could to do that he started by writing it in classical latin not neolatin the old language was made for bending back on itself until someone reading it wasnt quite sure exactly what it said maybe that hadnt been true when classical latin was the roman empires usual spoken language jeremy wouldnt even have bet on that now though one of the things officials here used it for was confusing one another jeremy intended to use it the same way he tried to make his answers to the questions the locals had asked him contradict one another he had to be careful with that if he was too obvious about it he would get himself in trouble but if he made his classical latin fancy enough nothing was obvious as soon as he figured that out the official report stopped being a nuisance it stopped being something he had to do it turned into something that was fun to do when hed finished the first few sections he showed amanda what hed written what do you think he asked she started working her way through it she hadnt got very far before she looked up and crossed her eyes what are you talking about here she said it sounds like it ought to mean something but i dont think it does oh good he said thats what i was trying to do will the city prefect let you get away with it she asked i hope so jeremy answered the first thing hell do is make sure we did turn in an official report by the due date thats how i figure it anyhow when he sees we did he may not even have anybody read it right away hes got other things to worry about after allyeah just a few and if he does have somebody read it and they decide they dont like it what can he do have us write another one right this will buy us time anyhow amanda nodded she didnt seem to want to meet his eyes though that was all right he didnt want to meet hers either they both had to be wondering whether buying time mattered it certainly did if the home timeline could get in touch with them fairly soon but every passing day made that seem less likely if they really were stuck here jeremy shook his head he wouldnt think that he refused to believe it amanda said before you give this report to the locals scan it into the computer that way everyone will know just what youve told them she wouldnt believe they were permanently cut off any more than he would ill do that he promised i just wanted you to see what i was up to i like it his sister said youve got nerve she pointed to him when you turn it in make sure you get a receipt from the clerk who takes it dont give the locals any excuse to say we didnt follow the rules that was also good advice ill take care of it jeremy said now i have to finish writing the silly thing the more of it he wrote the sillier it got too it also occurred to him that telling the exact truth would have been sure to convince officials here that he was out of his mind temptingbut no the secret of crosstime travel had to stay hidden when he carried the official report to the prefects palace he saw a few buildings with holes in them a handful of others had been knocked flat but the siege so far hadnt done all that much damage jeremy knew polisso had been lucky if a fire started on a windy day and began to spread that was one more thing he didnt want to think about he gave the report to one of sesto capurnios secretaries a junior man not iulio balbo the fellow took it and stuck it in a pigeonhole without giving it more than a quick glance he seemed surprised when jeremy asked for a receipt but gave him one without making a fuss as jeremy started back toward his house he thought maybe this is one of those stupid assignments where they dont even look at it once you turn it in somehow though he had trouble believing it there was an ancient stone plaque by the fountain near the traders house in classical latin full of abbreviations it told how a man named quintus ninnius hasta had given the money to set up the fountain that plaque had been standing there for two thousand years more or less amanda wondered if anyone inside polisso knew anything else about quintus ninnius hasta she also wondered if anyone outside of polisso had ever heard of him at all when she carried a water jar to the fountain early one muggy morning she stared in surprise and dismay a cannonball had smashed the marble plaqueand most of the brick wall in which it was set chunks of shattered stone and brick lay in the street women kicked through them on the way to get water well so what one of those women said when amanda exclaimed about the loss plenty of other old stuff in this town sweetie believe me she wasnt wrong a little talk showed that most of the other women had the same point of view amanda didnt and couldnt in the part of los angeles where shed lived all her life nothing dated back earlier than the middle of the twentieth century the first european settlement in california wasnt much more than three hundred years old to her things that had stood for two thousand years were precious antiques they werent routine landmarks or worse old junk if you worry about all the old things a woman said how are you ever going to put up anything new again most of the heads around the fountain bobbed up and down in agreement that wasnt a question with an easy answer either if you lived where other people had been living for a couple of thousand years you didnt get excited about remains of the distant past you took them for granted and if say you needed building stone you were liable to knock down something old and reuse what had gone into it that was often easier and cheaper than hauling in new stone from somewhere else and if that old building had been standing there for a thousand years or fifteen hundredso what try as she would amanda couldnt think so what to her it was worth keeping around just because it was old the local women laughed at her if a place like thats falling down around your ears what good is it one of them asked better to get rid of it another woman agreed but but amanda tried to put her feelings into words after some struggle she did but you could learn so much about the way things were long ago if you studied old things all the women around the fountain laughed at her who cares except for a few old fools with more money than sense said a squat woman with a burn scar on her cheek things werent so different anyway a grayhaired woman added by the standards of the home timeline she wasnt wrong things in agrippan rome had changed much less in the twentyone hundred years since augustus day than they had in the home timeline and people here werent much aware of the changes that had happened when modern painters showed ancient scenes they dressed people in modern clothes they didnt remember that styles had changed they had ancient roman legionaries wearing modern armor too they didusuallyremember soldiers in the old days hadnt known about muskets but that was about as far as it went a cannonball howled through the air overhead and smashed into something made of brick or stone there goes some more old junk the woman with the scar sounded gleeful to her it might have been a joke the grayhaired woman nodded somebodyll need a new house or a new shop she said i hope its somebody rich because they can afford it better amanda asked no by jupiter the grayhaired woman kicked at the cobblestones because poor folks like me always get it in the neck let the rich fools find out what its like to do without several of the other women waiting their turn at the fountain nodded or spoke up in favor of that but then one of them said if the lietuvans pounded the walls the way theyre pounding the city wed have more to worry about maybe they want to scare us into surrendering the grayhaired woman said good luck three women said it at the same time the one with the burn scar added you have to be crazy to surrender to the barbarians crazy or starving another woman put in even if youre starving you have to be crazy the scarred woman said what do the lietuvans say about us amanda asked like her remark about saving old buildings that one got less understanding than she would have wanted the women around the fountain didnt know what the lietuvans said not only that they didnt care king kuzmickas subjects were the enemy and that was that i hope they come down with smallpox one said i hope they come down with the plague another said overtrumping everyone shuddered at that this world had never known a plague outbreak as bad as the black death of the fourteenth century it had seen several smaller ones over the years thoughplenty to make people afraid of the disease amanda and jeremy had antibiotics to protect them if plague ever came to polisso the locals werent so lucky cannon on the wall boomed they were trying to knock out the guns the lietuvans were using it wasnt easy though the trenches the lietuvans dug so they could get their cannon closer and closer to polisso didnt come right toward the city if they had cannonballs shot from the walls could have bounced along them and wrecked guns moving forward instead they approached at an angle that way the guns were harder to hit even if they took longer to get really close at each stop on the way the lietuvans parked them in pits protected by mounds of earth the roman cannon had trouble getting at them and the lietuvans kept on shooting too every few minutes a cannonball would smack down somewhere inside polisso the woman with the scar on her cheek had filled her water jar but she didnt leave the company at the fountain was probably better than back at her house when another crash resounded from not very far away she said gods be praised we havent had any bad fires jeremy had thought of that too here it produced the same sort of shudder as mention of the plague had in a city without fire engines a big blaze was a deadly danger the scarred woman rubbed at her cheek amanda wondered how shed got burned even without a fire blazing out of control polisso had countless open flames lamps candles torches fireplaces cookfires bonfires every now and then to get rid of garbage so many things that could go wrong another cannonball screamed in in the heartbeat before it struck amanda thought it sounds like its coming straight at me and it was it slammed off the cobbles only two or three meters from where she was standing banged against the side of the fountain crashed into two walls and clattered about on the road till it finally stopped those first few crashes kicked up stone fragments of all sizes some as deadly as bullets amanda yelped in sudden surprise and pain a tiny chunk of flying stone had drawn a bloody line across the back of her hand and she was lucky when she looked up from her own little wound she found out just how lucky she was on one of its bounces the iron ball had hit the scarred woman it smashed her skull like a rock dropping on an egg she lay facedown in the street her blood and the water from the jar shed dropped puddled together shed never known what hit her another woman was down clutching at her leg and screaming blood gushed from that wound too which of the two women was luckier amanda couldnt have said other women were also hurt by the cannonball and by the fragments their cries dinned in her ears this was ten times worse than any traffic accident shed ever seen she wanted to throw up she wanted to run away too instead she ran forward she did what she could for the wounded women that wasnt much past putting on bandages making the more badly injured ones lie down and telling them theyd be all right some of the time she knew she was lying she wasnt the only one helping several other women who werent hurt did the same screams brought men running too one of them was a doctor he made bandages he set broken bones and he had opium against the pain that wasnt much but it was better than nothing when amanda had done all she could she went home she didnt realize she was sobbing till she was almost there nine jeremy wouldnt have thought he could sleep with muskets and cannon going off within a hundred meters of the house to say nothing of the ones the lietuvans were shooting at polisso but he didnt have a whole lot of trouble when he was tired enough he did sleep amanda had complained the first few days after the shooting started she hadnt since or not about the noise shed come home splashed with blood and green around the gills when the cannonball smashed down by the fountain jeremy hadnt said a word to her about that hed known the same horror when he came down off the wall in person war was even uglier than books and movies made it out to be and yet the romans and the lietuvans took it in stride so did the people in the other gunpowder empires in this world hed wondered about that even before this round of fighting broke out now lying on his lumpy bed looking at the ceiling it was too dark to see he thought hed found an answer he didnt know if it was the answer but it was an answer in his world almost everybody lived to grow old painkilling drugs that really worked cushioned the end when it came at last before the end most people went through most of their lives without a whole lot of pain few cared to risk their comforts by shooting at their neighbors if your life was likely to be long and pretty comfortable why would you take the chance of throwing it away but that was in the home timeline things were different here theyd been different in his world too before anesthetics and antibiotics and dentists who knew what they were doing here babies and toddlers died all the time from diarrhea and typhoid fever and whooping cough and diphtheria one child in three didnt live to be five years old here toothaches went on and onunless teeth got pulled while the sufferer was awake here infections and boils and blood poisoning and food poisoning happened every day here there were no tetanus shots people died from smallpox and the plague and tuberculosis if they got cancer they died from that toodied slowly and in agony a centimeter at a time in this kind of world war looked different you werent likely to live a long healthy painfree life no matter what you did if you died in battle that was liable to be a faster more merciful death than you would get if you werent a soldier with all those things being so why not take up a sword or a pike or a musket and try to do unto the other fellow before he did unto you jeremy didnt think soldiers paused and reasoned that out they didnt have to in agrippan romeand in lietuva toosongs and poems and statues celebrated generals whod won glory and soldiers whod been heroes if a young man didnt want to stay on the farm what was he likely to do join the army that was the best chance to change his lot he was likely to have the other difference was wars here werent overwhelmingly destructive in the home timeline two dozen countries could blow up the world if they ever thought they had a reason to here most of agrippan rome wouldnt feel this war at all neither would most of lietuva and so people seemed to think why not fight so what if we fought twenty years before and fifty years before and seventy and a hundred ten this time we might win or at least get even all that made some sense when looked at from a distance when seen close up it could have been the mad logic of beings from another planet jeremy still had nightmares about the man with most of his jaw shot away and his gobbling cries of pain he didnt know everything that went into amandas nightmares but he knew she had them shed scared him awake crying out in the night more than once outside of polisso a lietuvan cannon barked a couple of seconds later inside polisso the cannonball crashed home what did it hit whom did it maim jeremy didnt know wherever it came down it was too far away for him to hear the shrieks of the wounded he yawned he shifted his weight again on the lumpy mattress the wooden bed frame creaked he closed his eyes it seemed no darker with them closed than it had with them open he yawned again another cannon fired and another no doubt more of them went off all through the night but he never heard them he woke up with light leaking in through the slats of the shutter sitting up in bed he scratched his chin his beard was on the scraggly side it would probably stay that way for another couple of years he didnt care better a scraggly beard than shaving with a straight razor with nothing but olive oil to use instead of shaving gel yawning some more shaking his head to get the cobwebs out he walked down the hall to the kitchen he was almost there before he consciously noticed the gunfire he shook his head again this time in surprise this was how you got used to being stuck in the middle of a war till a cannonball tore a hole in your house you just went on about your business amanda was already in the kitchen eating bread and honey and drinking watered wine good day she said good day jeremy answered he tore his own piece of bread from the loaf no one here had ever heard of sliced bread that annoyed him it wasnt the biggest thing that did though he said dont you get sick and tired of speaking this language oh yes oh yes his sister nodded but what choice have we got if the locals hear us using english what will they think theyll think its lietuvan thats the only foreign language anyones likely to hear around here and if they think its lietuvan theyll think were spies soneolatin neolatin jeremy agreed dully he bit into the bread it tasted good but it was gritty was this how it would be for the rest of his life a language that wasnt his food that wore down his teeth an empire that had forgotten freedom and never heard of so many other things another cannonball smashed something to smithereens if the gunner had turned his cannon a little to the left in that case jeremy might not have had to worry about the rest of his life amanda didnt want to go back to the water fountain not after what had happened there she didnt think she was more likely to get hurt there that wasnt it she could get hurt anywhere and she knew it but she didnt want to be reminded of where the other women had got hurt the locals hadnt done much to clean things up either broken stone and bricks still lay where they had fallen for that matter the cannonball still lay there too it wasnt all that much bigger than her closed fist strange to think something so small could have done so much harm as no one had cleaned up the rubble so no one had cleaned up the bloodstains they were brownishblack now and dry not wet gleaming scarlet but she still knew what they meant they meant anguish for people who hadnt done anything to deserve any how many husbands were without wives how many children without mothers because of that round lump of iron most of the women at the fountain this morning hadnt been there when the cannonball struck home amanda thought she could tell which ones had they were the ones who flinched whenever another cannonball smacked into polisso amanda flinched too after seeing what shed seen she didnt know how anyone could keep from flinching the slave girl named maria came out of her house with a water jar on her hip good morning mistress amanda she said god bless you god bless you amanda answered automatically but in this place that didnt seem adequate she waved with her free hand do you think god blessed what happened here maria only shrugged i am sorry truly sorry people were hurt but i am less than a mote in the eye of god i cannot know his purposes neither can any other mere mortal you really mean that amanda said in slow wonder you really doubt it maria sounded every bit as amazed they both stared neither understanding the other in the least maria said i thought even an imperial christian would have more faith in the lord amanda said i thought even a strong christian would be able to think for herself a little bit and then at the same time they both said how can you be so blind that might have killed the strange delicate friendship that had grown up between them friendship between slave and free wasnt easy in agrippan rome neither was friendship between a native of agrippan rome and someone from the home timeline pile the one on top of the other and this friendship should have been impossible to begin with but amanda and maria really did like each other marias eyes twinkled amandas eyes sparkled they both started to laugh maria wagged a finger at amanda you are impossible she said well you are pretty difficult yourself amanda retorted they laughed some more you are more than half a heathen maria said by the standards of strong christians in agrippan rome that was true and more than true youre drunk on god amanda said by the standards of ordinary americans in the home timeline that was also true and more than true maria had very little but her god no wonder she clung to him so tightly after a moment amanda added youre nice anyway though so are you maria said they put down the jars and hugged each other another cannonball crashed into a building a rumbling roar followed the first sharp impact a wallor maybe the whole buildinghad fallen down i hope nobody was inside amanda said me too maria said they hugged again clutching each other for whatever reassurance they could find then with a sigh maria picked up her water jar amanda she broke off what is it amanda asked ive prayed so hard marias voice was soft and shaky her thin face pinched with worry ive prayed and prayed and prayed and the lietuvans are still out there theyre still smashing things up theyre still killing people i know its gods willbut i have so much trouble seeing why she sounded on the edge of tears and youre asking me amanda said in dismay that kind of question makes me feel like adas holding up the heavens on my shoulders maria nodded if she was offended she kept it to herself lots of people here used figures of speech from the greek myths even if they didnt believe in them people did the same thing in the home timeline though not so much the slave girl said you think about these things anyhow a lot of people never do maybe i do but i havent got any real answers amanda said either things happen because god makes them happen or they happen because they just happenyou know what i mean oh yes maria said some people call fortune a god i dont believe that she set her chin and looked stubborn well amanda paused if things happen because god make them happen then you need to figure out why bad things happen satan maria said it has to be satan but if gods allpowerful why does he let satan do things like that amanda asked marias face was the picture of hard serious thought after close to half a minute she gave amanda a sad little shrug amanda also shrugged she said i dont know either and if things just happen because they happen what can you do about it nothing i can see you sound like a philosopher maria said wistfully amanda laughed not likely philosophers are supposed to have answers arent they all ive got are questions maybe even questions help maria said all i had before were things to worry about she still had those of course but they didnt seem to worry her quite so much water poured out of the fountain amanda filled her jug maria filled hers she put it on her head when she was through as usual amanda put hers on her hip again maria looked tall erect and graceful carrying her jar the way she did amanda knew she would have looked like a clumsy fool trying to do the same enough women carried full jars the way she did to keep her from standing out that was all she cared about see you soon maria said take care of yourself amanda answered do you have enough to eat yes my owner hasnt changed what he gives me at all maria said my owner there it was ugly as a slap in the face just hearing the words made amanda want to be sick or to lash out and hit something but maria took them in stride if not for granted real worry in her voice she asked what about you amanda are you and your brother all right were fine so far amanda said she and jeremy were a good deal better off than that but she didnt want to sound as if she were bragging she didnt think maria would do anything to betray her trust but you never could tell who might be listening thats good maria said and then wistfully youve got money if youve got money you can always get food as long as theres any food to get again she didnt make anything special out of it it was just the way this world worked it was probably the way any world worked but hunger was a much more common guest here than in los angeles in the home timeline maria went into her owners house amanda turned away and started back toward the house where she and jeremy lived those words againher owner words and the ideas behind them had enormous power but what can i do amanda thought unhappily even if she bought amanda set her free and found her work where she could make a livingnot always easy to do for a freedwomanthen what how many slaves just like her would remain in polisso afterwards up into the thousands surely how many in all of this roman empire in lietuva in persia in the gunpowder empires in india in china millions all told without a doubt and crosstime traffic had only a few outposts in this whole world some problems were just too big to solve with what was available to tackle them amanda hated that which didnt make it any less true jeremy was sitting in the courtyard reading a poem when a cannonball crashed into the kitchen the poem had kept him interested all the way through it was in neolatin about a girl on a trading ship whod been captured by scandinavian pirates but escaped and about her adventures getting back to the empire it wasnt great literature it was more like this worlds closest approach to reality tv but it wasnt dull not even slightly all the same he dropped the scroll and jumped to his feet when half a dozen roof tiles exploded into red dust a magpie that had been sitting on the roof flew away as fast as it could screeching in alarm from her room amanda let out a startled squawk what was that we just got hit jeremy answered im going to see how bad there was a hole in the roof in the kitchen and another one in the far wall but the planks under the roof tiles werent smoldering the cannonball hadnt smashed any weightbearing beams no big cracks ran out from the whole in the wall the stonework still seemed sound amanda came into the kitchen behind jeremy as he had she looked around were lucky she said after a few seconds i was thinking the same thing he said i can put boards over the hole in the roof to keep the rain out till somebody really repairs it and some plaster will take care of the one in the wall i suppose so amanda hesitated do you think well ever get back in a way the question came out of the blue in another way jeremy had trouble thinking about anything else how surprising was it that his sister felt the same way not very he shrugged i have to think so whatevers gone wrong it cant stay messed up forever why not he wondered it shouldnt have got messed up in the first place since it has who knows how long it can stay that way he wondered whether amanda would point that out she didnt not in so many words instead she asked do you think you could stand it if we had to stay here forever i wouldnt like it thats for sure jeremy answered stand it i dont know what other choice would i have it would be horrible amanda said he couldnt very well argue with that they still had enough merchandise from the home timeline to make a lot of money probably enough to keep them wealthy for the rest of their lives but even the richest people in polisso did without so many things anyone from the home timeline took for granted it would seem a bare empty life they might as well be shipwrecked among savages as a matter of fact they were we just have to go on jeremy said i dont know what else to tell you his sister nodded its what i keep telling myself she said sometimes it lets me get through the daymost of the time in fact but when they go and knock a hole in the housetwo holes in the houseeven going on doesnt seem very easy yeah i know jeremy cocked his head to one side there was a new breeze in the kitchen because of those two holes i go down to the basement and i try to send a message back home from the powerbook and it doesnt let me i go down there too amanda said sometimes i dont even try to send a message but the door opens when you touch the palm lock the electric lights come on the furniture looks like it comes from home depot or walmartand it does there is a computer i see all that stuff and i remember we did come from the home timeline its not just something i dreamt or made up inside my head jeremy made himself grin if it is were both nuts the same way he spoke in a low voiceand in english making himself use his own language instead of neolatin took a real effort and hearing english made amanda blink thats right she said in the same tongue will we ever be able to speak our own language to anybody but each other i dont know for safetys sake jeremy fell back into neolatin i just dont know another cannonball screeched by overhead it slammed into a house or shop not too far away jeremy and amanda looked at each other if the lietuvans broke into polisso or starved it into surrender nothing theyd talked about would matter very much they wouldnt have to complain about how empty even the richest persons life here was they wouldnt be rich theyd be slavesor theyd be dead amanda was sewing up a tunic seam when someone rapped on the door she wanted company just then about as much as she wanted another head but jeremy was at the market square and it might be business with a mutter of regret she put down the tunic she walked out of the courtyard and up the entry hall the door was barred she took the bar out of its brackets set it aside and opened the door there stood lucio claudio called fusco good day amanda said meaning anything but what can i do for you i am looking for ieremeo soltero answered gaio fulvios man of affairs hes not here right now amanda said can i help you i doubt it lucio claudio said amanda glanced over at the iron bar shed just put down no you cant hit him over the head with it she told herself people would talk it seemed a great pity the local who didnt know she was contemplating his sudden departure from this world went on it has to do with the official report he submitted oh then i can help you amanda stepped aside and gestured politely wont you come in would you care for some wine it is written in the classical language how could you but lucio claudio caught himself hed already done business with amanda no wait you have already proved that you are familiar with it thats right i have and i am amandas smile was anything but sweet she repeated wont you come in lucio claudios face said mere females had no business knowing classical latin it also said mere merchants had no business knowing the old language and if the merchant happened to be a girl or the girl happened to be a merchant very well he didnt sound any happier about being there than amanda was to have him there when she took him back to the courtyard she pointed to the hole in the kitchen roof jeremy had put boards over it but the roofer hadnt replaced the shattered tiles as she pointed a cannonball thudded home somewhere not far away she said at a time like this dont you have more important things to worry about than official reports we submitted it on time its accurate isnt that enough to satisfy you the locals swarthy skin darkened further probably with annoyance he said what could be more important than keeping complete and thorough records youre joking amanda said then she realized he wasnt in agrippan rome records were at least as important as people another cannonball landed somewhere a little farther away she asked dont you think you ought to be worrying about keeping the lietuvans out of polisso shouldnt everything else wait on that certainly not he answered she might have suggested that he ate with his fingersexcept the locals did eat with their fingers and had a complex set of manners for doing so though besieged we are still roman life must go on as normally as possible that could have sounded brave and noble to amanda it sounded infuriating but she didnt let her anger show she would have to keep on dealing with lucio claudio and with people like him or if she didnt other crosstime traders would if there still are other crosstime traders she thought if they ever come back to agrippan rome she shivered she doubted more and more that they ever would all she said then was let me get you your wine in that case and you can go ahead she poured a cup for herself too if she hadnt lucio claudio might have thought she was trying to poison him he spilled some on the paving stones and murmured a prayer to dionysus amanda spilled some too she prayed for the emperors spirit not to any of the gods an imperial christian could go that far and no further lucio claudios sneer said he didnt think it was far enough but it was legal he didnt complain not out loud instead he took out the official report jeremy had written some of this is not as clear as it ought to be he said amanda knew her brother had written the report so it wouldnt be clear she couldnt very well tell that to lucio claudio though you must be mistaken she said he shook his head no i am not he insisted look here where the report speaks of your sources for these remarkable trade goods you have may i see it please she asked reluctantly lucio claudio handed it to her people were careful with papers here this was the only copy of the official report the only way to get another one would be to have a secretary copy it all out she read the passage he pointed at then said it seems plain enough to me nonsense lucio claudio said it is not nonsense amanda said dont they teach anyone in polisso what an ablative absolute is and how to use it if she could argue about classical latin grammar and how it worked she wouldnt have to argue about what was and wasnt in the official report and shed flicked lucio claudio on his pride he took a big angry gulp of wine we may be near the frontier here but we have good schools he insisted we have excellent schools in fact why three hundred years ago the poet settimo destro called sinistro had his verses quoted from one end of the empire to the other and where did he come from right here in polisso amanda was happier arguing town pride than the official report too three hundred years is a long time she said what have you done since your lefthanded poet lived sinistro meant lefthanded not much if you dont understand what this means suppose you explain it lucio claudio said i dont need to explain it its as plain as the nose on your face let me read it to you so you can see for yourself read it she did in classical latin they having secured the required articles from their suppliers who having taken all precautions to produce them with the maximum practicable degree of quality and artistic excellence conveyed the aforementioned goods to those who would distribute them for retail distribution they delivered these aforesaid articles of commerce to the famous metropolis for final distribution to and among its most excellent citizens there isnt that obvious lucio claudio fumed hed wanted to talk about the official report in neolatin but if amanda stuck to the old language he had to do the same if he didnt he would lose face he would sooner have been blown to bits by a lietuvan cannonball than admit that a merchants daughter knew more about classical latin than he did instead of admitting it he snatched the official report away from her he went through it till he found another passage he didnt like triumph in his voice he said what about this it does not explain why you have these remarkable goods and no one else does that after all was the whole point of requiring an official report from you in the first place so you could steal our trade secrets you mean amanda said that made lucio claudio look as if hed bitten into a lemon everybody was touchy about trade secrets in agrippan rome with no patents or copyrights to protect knowledge people had to be not even the government could poke at them too hard not without risking trouble amanda held out her hand let me see it if you please how can i answer when you keep taking things away from me here lucio claudio said and no quibbles over ablative absolutes this time if you please the sentences are very straightforward even you understand them you mean it was on the tip of amandas tongue but she didnt say it a bureaucrat who was doing his job going through the motions was one thing a bureaucrat with a personal grudge was something else again and something much more dangerous she read jeremys answer and nodded youre right this is very straightforward it says we get our goods from the finest suppliers in the roman empire thats the truth the quality of what we sell proves it but who are these suppliers lucio claudio demanded why cant anyone else find them and deal with them that is our trade secret amanda said if everyone knew where to get these goods where would our living be she smiled would you like some more wine they went round and round for the next hour jeremy had done a good job of writing the report so that it sounded impressive but didnt say anything finally lucio claudio gave up and went away amanda would have liked that better if she hadnt been pretty sure he would come back people in polisso had stopped carrying food out in the open that was an invitation to get knocked over the head and have it stolen after almost four weeks the lietuvan siege was starting to pinch the city when shoppers brought grain or olives home from the market square they put them in leather sacks that could have held anything they tried not to go alone too having friends along made thieves try someone else jeremy bought wheat and barley in the market square every so often he wanted people to see him doing it that way nobody would start wondering if he and amanda were hoarding he too had a plain leather sack for carrying home the grain he headed back to his house by himself but he wasnt worried he was young and big and looked strong no one had bothered him yet he was only a couple of blocks from the house when three punks stepped out of a shadowed doorway oh its you the biggest one saidtheyd met before what have you got before jeremy could answer a cannonball smashed through a door about a hundred meters away one punk flinched then tried to pretend he hadnt jeremy said ive got barley he felt fairly safe admitting it plenty of people were going back and forth if the three toughs tried robbing him theyd get jumped on people here were more likely to do that than they were in los angeles in the home timeline punks often carried knives here but so did ordinary men you didnt run the risk of going up against an assault rifle with your bare hands and the leader of this little gang shook his head no thats not what i meant he said no doubt he sounded much more innocent than he was he could see this wasnt a good spot for a robbery as well as jeremy couldbetter probably he gave jeremy a mocking little halfbow what jokes have you got oh jokes jeremy tried not to show how relieved he was let me think hed looked at the laughterlover a long time ago well there was the cheapskate who named himself as heir in his own will the punks groaned which was about what that one deserved you can do better their leader said youd better do better his tone warned if they started thumping jeremy for telling lousy jokes ordinary people might not stop them might join in as a matter of fact he tried again there was a halfwit who bought a house and went around carrying one stone from it so he could show people what it was like they groaned again they didnt seem quite so disgusted this time though what else have you got the biggest one asked there was another halfwitthis one wanted to cross a river jeremy said when he rode onto the ferryboat and didnt get down from his horse somebody asked him why not he said i cant im in a hurry thats not too bad the leader said after looking at his two buddies to see what they thought but try to have some better ones next time we run into you he swaggered on up the street jeremy stood there staring after him till a badtempered man in a tunic full of fancy embroidery shouted for him to get out of the way that tunic shouted too and what it said was im important dont mess with me or youll be sorry in los angeles that kind of display would have provoked jeremy to ignore the badtempered man people here paid more attention to status with a twinge of regret jeremy moved he got the barley back to the house without any more trouble amanda said we have a new hole in the roof to fix she pointed sure enough another cannonball had hit the kitchen about two meters to the left of the first hole jeremy said something about what the lietuvans did for fun that he couldnt possibly have known for sure then he asked are you all right is the house all right it scared me out of a years growth but it didnt hurt me his sister answered it seemed worse than the last one because it didnt go out through the wall it banged around inside the kitchen till it finally stopped i was here in the courtyard it smashed some jars some grain got spilled but it missed the big amphora full of olive oil thank goodness that would have been a mess jeremy agreed it sure would amanda said but do you know what i wasnt even thinking about the mess i was thinking how bad it would be to lose the whole amphora of oil when were under siege and it would cost an arm and a leg to buy another one she looked at him im starting to think the way the locals do that scares me worse than the cannonball in the kitchen i dont blame you jeremy said if they really were stuck in agrippan rome forever they would have to make that adjustment sooner or later they couldnt live here the way they would have back in the home timeline polisso was a different placesuch a different placefrom los angeles they couldnt look at the world here the same way and hope to survive will i end up buying slaves then jeremy shuddered and shook his head nothing could make him do that better to be dead than to do that even if it was as ordinary for someone rich here as owning a fancy car was back in la i know what youre thinking amanda whispered the horror in her eyes matched the horror jeremy felt we cant no matter what else we do we cant no we wont jeremy said not ever no matter what he did his best to laugh it sounded pretty ghastly this is all dumb anyhow before too long well be back in touch with the home timeline mom and dad will come up from the transposition chamber in the subbasement and everything will be fine sure amanda nodded but she wouldnt look at him a cannonball screeched through the air and thudded home fifty meters away somebody screamed that was all real the home timeline the home timeline seemed like a dream and a fading dream at that ten if i cant go back to the home timeline what do i have to do to make this one as bearable as i can the longer amanda stayed in polisso the more she asked herself that question asking it was easy finding any kind of answer wasnt the only thing she could come up with was get rich stay rich if she had money she wouldnt go hungry the food she did eat would be a little better her clothes would be warmer in the winter and not quite so scratchy her bed would be a little softer she would be able to buy books to help pass the time if she got sick or hurt herself she would be able to buy poppy juiceopiumto ease the pain and that was about all so much of what shed taken for granted would be gone forever if her teeth gave her trouble she could either get them pulled without anesthetic or suffer if she got sick with something that the medicines she and jeremy had wouldnt cure she would either get well or die on her own no doctors worth the name no hospitals she ground wheat into flour in a stone quern the repeated motion made her shoulder ache if she did it for years it would give her arthritis if she didnt do it she wouldnt have any bread to eat the work was boring it would have gone by faster if she could have gabbed with friends or listened to music or watched tv while she did it no phone no cd player no tv no nothing she muttered grind grind grind when she baked at home shed taken flour for granted too machines made it it came out of a sack when you had to make it yourself you didnt take it for granted why couldnt she get more than this pathetic little bit with each turn of the quern grind grind grind jeremy walked into the kitchen hows it going he asked cheerfully why shouldnt he be cheerful he wasnt grinding flour amanda screamed at him he jumped half a meter in the air well excuse me for breathing he said when his feet thumped back onto the ground what did i say that was wrong part of amanda was ashamed at losing her cool nothing really she mumbled but the rest of her was angry and she decided she wouldnt sweep it under the rug after all there werent any rugs here to sweep it under anyhow she shook her head no not nothing i dont see you in the kitchen i dont see you with a sore shoulder i just see you eating bread im making money for us he answered that was true and if they were stuck here for good they would need all the money they could get their hands on amanda had just been thinking about that but even so i could do that just as well as you could she said you could do it pretty well yeah her brother said just as well i dont know some of the locals get weird about dealing with a girl thats cause theyre a bunch of sexist yahoos said amanda whod gone all the way through gullivers travels not long before the parts of the book everybody knew where he went to lilliput and then to brobdingnag were only the icing on the cake the real essence came later sure they are jeremy said but just because an attitude is stupid that doesnt mean its not real again he wasnt wrong that didnt mean amanda liked his being right if i could only get out of this kitchen more id show you what i can do she said he didnt say how are you going to do that if he had she wouldnt just have screamed she would have thrown something at him then again he didnt need to ask the question out loud it hung in the air whether he asked it or not the scary part was how are you going to do that had an answer the answer was buy a slave to do the work for me that was what the localsthe prosperous locals anyhow did they didnt have food processors or kneading machines or automatic dishwashers or vacuum cleaners or washing machines or any of a zillion other gadgets they had people they had them and they used them that let the ones who werent slaves take care of their businessand also think about things like literature and what passed for science here seeing slavery was dreadful enough for somebody from late twentyfirstcentury los angeles beginning to understand how and why it worked was a hundred times worse theyd better find us and get us out of here amanda whispered yeah jeremy said both of them had forgotten the quarrel as amanda had followed his thoughts not long before he hadnt had any trouble knowing what she was thinking it disgusted him as much as it did her yes this was why the locals kept slaves worse this was why from their point of view it made sense amanda shook her head no matter how much sense it made it was still awful theyd better get us out she repeated thats right jeremy said if they dont get us out of here we can sue them wait a minute amanda said her brother looked back at her bland as unsalted butter amanda made a horrible face at him it was so horrible it made himjust barelycrack a smile she aimed her index finger as if it were a gun youre being ridiculous on purpose what about it jeremy retorted its better than being ridiculous by accident dont you think she didnt have a good answer for that as cannon roared and muskets barked as walls fell down with a crash she wondered if there were good answers for anythingnot just in this world but in any i wish we were back in the home timeline she said which wasnt an answer but was the truth so do i her brother said and that and some silver will buy me wine in a tavern if they fix whatevers wrongif they can fix whatevers wrongtheyll bring us home if they dont or if it isnt we figure out how to make the best of things here he strode forward you want me to grind flour for a while sure amanda said jeremy was awkward rotating the central stone in the quern she had to remind him to keep feeding wheat in at the top otherwise he would have happily ground away at nothing he worked steadily for about ten minutes then he started grumbling and rubbing his shoulder after another five minutes he stepped away from the counter with a proud smile on his face there amanda clapped her handsonce twice three times she couldnt have been more sarcastic if shed tried for a week wow congratulations yippee she said thats about enough flour for a muffina small muffin dont stop youre just getting the hang of it he looked as if shed stabbed him in the back i was trying to help he said i know you were she said you were starting to do it tooand then you went and stopped where do you think your bread comes from every day let me give you a hint its not a miracle its me standing there turning that miserable quern till my shoulder really starts hurting and then turning it some more if i dont make flour we dont eat bread its that simpleor it would be except you can make flour too go ahead you were doing fine and what will you do while im taking care of that jeremy asked suspiciously me ill stand here fanning myself with peacock feathers for a while amanda answered then ill peel myself some grapes a whole bowlful i think and then ill drop them into my mouth one at a time ill make sure i do all this stuff while youre watching too so it drives you especially wild he gaped at her she wondered if shed gone too far with that far enough to make him angry but then he started to laugh even better he started to grind more wheat into flour amanda wished she really did have some grapes to peel to help keep him going jeremy already knew most women worked harder than most men in polisso that stint at the quern drove the lesson home so did the way his shoulder ached the next day hed been doing work his body wasnt used to and it told him it wasnt happy amanda spent more time than that at the quern just about every day how did her shoulder feel when she got up every morning how would it feel twenty years from now if she ground grain just about every day between now and then peoples bodies wore out faster in this world than they did in the home timeline the work here was a lot harder and except for wine and opium nothing here could make pain go away no one here had ever heard of aspirins for instance down in the secret part of the basement jeremy tried to send a message to the home timeline as usual no such luck he wondered why he went on bothering every time he failed he felt terrible but if i ever do get through thatll make up for all the times i dont besides if he didnt keep trying what would that be a sign that hed given up hope he might be stuck in agrippan rome resigning himself to getting stuck here was a whole different story the siege went on the lietuvans pounded away at polisso the gunners on the walls shot back at them little by little king kuzmickas cannoneers wrecked the roman guns no doubt they lost some of their own too the question was who could hold out longer the besiegers or the besieged that was one of the questions anyhow another was how long would the romans farther south in the province of dacia need to send an army up to polisso and try to drive the lietuvans back into their own kingdom jeremy had no idea what the answer to that was but it was on his mind it had to be on the mind of everybody trapped inside polisso it had to be on kuzmickas mind too and on the minds of his soldiers they wouldnt want to be stuck between an advancing roman army and the garrison of a town that still defied them if they could take polisso soon it would be in their interest to do so getting their guns closer to the walls and shooting at all hours of the day and night made good sense for them jeremy didnt think trying to storm polisso made good sense for the lietuvans annio basso the commandant of the city would surely have agreed with him so would all of annio bassos colonels and captains when everybody on one side thinks the other side couldnt be dumb enough to try somethingwell what better time to try it no one in polisso looked for an allout assault on the walls jeremy certainly didnt unlike some other men in polisso he didnt claim afterwards that he did either like just about everyone else in town he was asleep when the attack started king kuzmickas men chose the middle of a dark moonless night like anything else that had both advantages and disadvantages the inky blackness of nights without electric lights let them get close to the wall before the romans saw them on the other hand that same inky blackness made them stumble and trip over their own feet and think they were closer to the wall than they really were taking everything into account a little moonlight might have helped the attack when the first horn calls and shouts of alarm rang out from the wall jeremy slept through them hed had trouble falling asleep because the lietuvans were shooting more than usual later he realized they were hiding the racket their advancing soldiers made but that was later at the time all he thought was that there was a devil of a lot of noise along with the gunfire he heard shouts from the direction of the wall at first he couldnt tell through the din what people were shouting that they were yelling anything at all surprised him except for the cannon going off every now and then he hadnt heard much at night hed learned to ignore the cannon how was he supposed to ignore people yelling like madmen then he made out what the soldiers were yelling ladders he knew little about warfare he didnt want to learn anything more but one thing seemed plain enough when some people started shouting ladders it was because other people were trying to climb them the only people who could trying to climb ladders here were king kuzmickas lietuvans for a little while jeremy thought kuzmickas had gone out of his mind assaulting polisso couldnt possibly work could it then he heard more shouts on the wall and not all of them sounded as if they were in neolatin if the lietuvans had got men up on the walls that could mean only one thing trouble big trouble those shouts on the wall raised shouts inside polisso more and more people woke up and discovered their city was under attack by the cries and screams jeremy heard a lot of the locals believed polisso was as good as lost at first he thought they were idiots then he realized they might know more about what was going on than he did he wished that hadnt occurred to him he would have been a lot happier if he hadnt ignorance is bliss ran through his mind jeremy that was amanda out in the hall you awake no im still sound asleep he got out of bed sleeping in the clothes you also wore during the day had one advantage you didnt need to get dressed he opened the door how are you not so good she answered what are we going to do before jeremy could answer a herald up the street shouted citizens of polisso stay in your homes do not give way to fear soldiers will keep the invaders out of the city thats what well do jeremy said well sit tightfor now anyway do you really think the soldiers can drive back the lietuvans amanda asked what do we do if they dont well we cant run because theres nowhere to run to he said we can surrender and be slavesif they dont kill us for the fun of itor we can fight i dont see much else do you the basement she said the subbasement he shook his head they arent set up to live in maybe they ought to be but they arent if we were hiding for a few hours from people who would go away thatd be different but if the lietuvans win theyre here to stay before too long wed have to come out and theyd have us soldiers ran by the house their chainmail clanking they shouted in neolatin they were romans then jeremy didnt know what he would have done if theyd been shouting in lietuvan panicked probably i wish we had dads pistol amanda said wish for the moon while youre at it jeremy said can you imagine trying to explain that to the city prefect amanda only shrugged i dont care id rather be alive and free and explaining with a bunch of lies than killed or sold in a slave market somewhere in lietuva if polisso falls it doesnt matter whether the link with the home timeline comes back afterwards nobody would find us jeremy hadnt thought of that his sister was right he wished she werent he said no guarantee the pistol would save us if polisso falls we couldnt shoot enough lietuvans to make much difference he wasnt sure he could shoot anybody but if the choice was between killing and dying or being enslaved he thought he could pull the triggernot that there was any trigger to pull he turned away hurrying out into the courtyard and then across it where are you going amanda called after him to the storeroom and the kitchen what for he didnt answer he was trying not to break his neck in the darkness when he got into the storeroom he had to feel around to find what he wanted it was pitch black in there and he hadnt brought a lamp even in the dark though he didnt need long and he knew where things were in the kitchen even without any light what on earth amanda said as he went past her and out toward the front door what are you doing with the sword and those knives putting them where we can grab them in a hurry if we have to jeremy said we havent got a pistol the sword is the best we can do and a couple of those carving knives have blades that are almost as long theyre better than nothing he hadnt been sure he could shoot anybody he was even less sure he could stab somebody and using a sword or a knife took more skill and practice than using a firearm he had next to none of those amanda even less in an emergency though you did what you could with what you had and hoped for the best if this didnt count as an emergency hed never seen one amanda didnt argue with him hed been afraid she would instead she went up the hall herself she came back with one of the knives looked at it started to put it down and then hung on instead just in case she said she didnt say in case of what jeremy didnt need her to draw him a picture women and girls had reasons not to want to be taken as slaves that most men didnt need to worry about who could say how much those would matter till the moment came maybe it wouldnt jeremy hoped not outside more men in chainmail ran past like the last lot of soldiers these yelled back and forth in neolatin with luck that meant the romans were getting the upper hand in the fight on the wall with luck we ought to make a thanksoffering at the temple if the lietuvans dont get in jeremy said and amanda nodded somewhere not far away a horn blared out a call both jeremy and amandas heads whipped toward those notes jeremy had heard lots of roman military horn calls this didnt sound like any of them it was wilder and fiercer and if it wasnt a roman horn call it could only be the lietuvans someone down the block crieda sort of a despairing wail the lietuvans are in the city a volley of musket fire that seemed to come from right up the street proved the man was right more shouts rang out from most of the houses close by those were as full of dread as the first and there were fresh shouts shouts of kuzmickas and perkunas and other things jeremy couldnt understand they were all in an oddly musical language one full of rising and falling syllables lietuvan in this world wasnt quite the same as lithuanian in the home timeline but it wasnt very far away amandas lips were squeezed tight together she looked as if she was clamping down hard on a scream jeremy didnt blame her he was clamping down pretty hard himself she whispered what are we going to do sit tight as long as we can jeremy answered if it looks like the citys going to fall if it looks like that maybe our best chance is to try to get away but we dont know how many lietuvans got in or how the fights going everything still may turn out all right she nodded even though her eyes called him a liar another volley of musketry rang out this one even closer to the house men shouted the roman emperors name and some ripe insults in neolatin the roman legionaries hadnt given up this fight then neither had the lietuvans they yelled back more guns banged boots thudded on cobblestones soldiers ran back and forth right in front of the house a wounded man shrieked jeremy couldnt tell if he was a roman or a lietuvan when people were healthy they all sounded different when they were badly hurt they all sounded the same metal clashed on metal matchlock muskets were slow and clumsy to reload any time in the middle of the night the job had to be next to impossible you could reverse them and use them for clubsor you could throw them down and use swords instead it sounded as if the whole battle for polisso were being fought there outside the house that couldnt have been true but it still seemed that way every shot and groan and sword clanging off sword or spearhead came to jeremys ears from what felt no more than five meters away he could only have made sure of that by going out in the street and seeing for himself except for jumping off a cliff he couldnt have found a better way to kill himself he stayed inside come on amanda said whenever the romans rallied or whenever they wavered come onyou can do it she suddenly stopped and looked amazed im rooting for people to kill other people thats so sick tell me about it jeremy answered im doing the same thing people were killing other people out there in the street if more romans killed lietuvans than the other way round polisso would staywhat free polisso hadnt been free before the lietuvans broke in it wouldnt be free if they all packed up and marched away as soon as the sun came up but it would be unsacked jeremy didnt even know if that was a word he didnt care either it was what he wanted more than anything else in the world he heard or thought he heard more shouts in neolatin than in lietuvan the romans sounded excited the lietuvans sounded scared or did they was he hearing it that way because that was what he wanted to hear how could he tell how could he know by waiting to see what happenedno other way someone pounded on the front door jeremy froze amanda gasped someone pounded again not with the knocker but with a heavy fist on the oak timbers whoever was out there shouted something the shout wasnt in neolatin what are we going to do amanda said jeremy started for the door she grabbed his arm dont let them in let them in are you nuts he said im going to pile furniture and stuff behind the door so they have a harder time breaking it down oh she said and then ill help they carried tables and chests of drawers in from the parlor and the bedrooms the lietuvans werent pounding with fists any more theyd found something big and heavy by the way it thudded against the door jeremy would have guessed it was a telephone pole except they didnt have telephone poles here they didnt have many in los angeles any more either but some were still left the door and the iron bar across it seemed to be doing all right but the brackets that held the bar in place were starting to tear out of the door frame why did they have to pick our house amanda groaned because were lucky jeremy answered which jerked a startled laugh out of her he clenched his fingers around the hilt of the sword till his knuckles whitened he didnt know how much good it would do but it wouldnt do any if he didnt have it where are the roman soldiers when we really need them one of the brackets came loose with a tortured crunch of splintering wood the door sagged back as if someone had punched it in the stomach jeremy and amanda pushed against the pile of furniture to try to hold it closed no good more people were pushing from the other side a lietuvans scowling bloodstreaked face appeared in the doorway sword in hand he started scrambling over the obstacles toward jeremy and amanda get back jeremy shouted to his sister she shook her head ill help she had her kitchen knife out and ready too the lietuvan thrust at jeremy who jerked back just in time to keep from getting spitted like a corn dog with a mocking laugh the soldier scrambled forwardtill a little table broke under his weight his laugh turned into a howl of dismay as he went down splat on all fours jeremy jumped forward and stabbed him in the arm the lietuvan screamed the sword grated on bone blood spurted out jeremy could smell it like hot iron the lietuvan jerked away and ran back the way hed come the sword pulled free jeremy brandished the bloodstained blade later he realized what an idiot he was hed been lucky with the one soldier if the lietuvans pals had come after him how could he have held them off but just then a swarm of romans shouting honorio priscos name charged up the street instead of breaking into the househad they intended to use it for a strongpointthe lietuvans fell back jeremy stared at the bloody sword he had blood on his hand too and on his arm and splashed on the front of his tunic he didnt know whether to be proud or be sick amanda said lets prop the door closed maybe we can at least halfway fix that bracket so itll stay shut by itself then we wont be an easy target for every burglar in town burglars jeremy dropped the swordhe almost dropped it on his toes which wouldnt have been so good right now i dont care at all about burglars hed almost said something much juicier than that weve got worse things to worry about than burglars that was also understated and also true i know but amanda cocked her head to one side listening i think this new push really is driving the lietuvans back the noise does sound like its farther from here and closer to the wall than it has been for a while i hope so jeremy said after cocking his head to one side and listening he meant every word of that in wondering tones he went on i dont know whether to hope that lietuvan bleeds to death or gets better his sister shrugged i dont much care one way or the other all i care about is that youre all right she paused and seemed to be listening to herself in almost the same way as shed just listened to the street fighting did i really say that slowly she nodded i really did and you know what else i meant it too good jeremy picked up a leg from the table that had broken under the lietuvan he smacked it into his palm maybe i can use this to hammer the bracket into place if i could go get a couple of tools from home depot fixing it would probably take about ten minutes but if i could do that he let his voice trail away and got to work making what repairs he could going to the water fountain two days later reminded amanda of what a close call polisso had had bloodstains were everywhere shed never seen so much blood here and there where it had pooled between cobblestones flies gathered in buzzing clouds they flew up as she walked past one of them lit on her and crawled along her arm she made a disgusted noise and shook it away no bodies lay in the street theyd already been dragged away romans and lietuvans alike theyd probably been plundered first of weapons of money of armor of food of everything down to their shoes and their drawers she wondered if scavengers in polisso had quietly made sure some of the soldiers were dead she wouldnt have been surprised bullet scars marked the brick and stone ground floors of houses and shops bullet holes peppered the timber upper stories in one way though the damage would have been worse in the home timeline here neither side had been able to shoot out any glass windows as far as amanda knew polisso had none several women were already at the fountain when she got there everything all right with you dearie one of them called im still here im still in one piece amanda answered the towns still here too its not in as many pieces as it might be the local woman laughed aint it the truth she said when those barbarians got inside i didnt know whether to go up on the roof and throw tiles down on their noggins or hide under my bed thats how pyrrhus of epirus got it another woman said roof tiles i mean not hiding under the bed amanda had heard of pyrrhus of epirus he was the king whod given his name to the pyrrhic victory hed fought the romans beaten them thanks to war elephants but almost ruined his army doing it afterwards looking things over hed said one more victory like this and were ruined that was where her knowledge stopped and she would have bet knowing even that much put her ahead of nine out of tenmaybe ninetynine out of a hundredpeople in los angeles in the home timeline but this housewife on the edge of the roman empire knew how hed died even though hed been dead for more than years at first that astonished amanda after a little while though it didnt any more pyrrhus was part of the locals history in a way he wasnt back home these romans nowadays thought of themselves asweredescended from the ones whod battled and finally beaten pyrrhus they knew who he was the same way most americans knew who cornwallis was he was almost a favorite enemy hed been tough hed been clever hed been dangerousand hed lost what more could you ask for in a foe some of the women whod been at the fountain the morning before started going on about what theyd seen they were amazingly calm about mutilated bodies amanda gulped the woman whod mentioned pyrrhus noticed she was green and said sweetie if those lietuvan soandsos had whipped our boys wed look like that now she was right that didnt make amanda like it any more or make it any better and when roman legionaries took a town in lietuva or persia they acted the same way soldiers played by tough rules in this world come to that soldiers played by tough rules in any world the home timeline didnt have much to be proud of the main difference was they tried to cover up the worst of what they did in the home timeline here they were likely to boast about their atrocities they thought such horrors made other people afraid of them a cannonball howled through the air the romans had driven the lietuvans out of polisso but king kuzmickas hadnt given up and gone home he was still out there and so were his soldiers if they couldnt storm the city they still might starve it into surrendering youre full of cheerful thoughts today arent you amanda said to herself and then all at once she did feel better here came maria the slave girl smiled and waved to her good to see youre safe she said same to you amanda answered i was worried maria said you never can tell what will happen when the enemy gets into a city amanda knew more about that now than shed ever wanted to ill say the lietuvans broke into our house ieremeo drove them off with his sword bravely done maria said it was wasnt it amanda knew she sounded surprised bravery wasnt something people thought about much in the home timeline how often did anyone there have the chance to be brave how often did anyone there want the chance to be brave didnt the chance to be brave mean the chance to get killed or at least badly hurt measuring yourself against a chance like that was what made bravery i should say it was maria answered your brother with just a sword against trained soldiers with mailshirts and helmets and everything he couldnt have frightened them off all by himself could he she suddenly looked frightened i mean no disrespect to him of course none at all whats that all about but amanda needed only a couple of seconds to realize what it was about maria had remembered she was a slave she might have offended a freewoman if she did offend she could pay for it painfully its all right amanda said quickly whats that proverb even hercules cant fight two thats it we would have been in a lot of trouble if the legionaries hadnt come up the street just then the lietuvans went off to fight them and they never came back now what was the matter maria was looking at her as if shed picked her nose in public voice stiff with disapproval the slave girl said i wouldnt have thought even an imperial christian would believe in hercules who said i believe in him amanda answered its just a proverb maria wouldnt see it the more amanda tried to explain the more stubborn the slave got as far as she was concerned the word was the thing youve talked of pagan gods twice now in the last couple of weeks she said sadly either one thinks they have power or one tells lies on purpose knowing they are lies and lies come straight from satan you dont understand maria told her i wanted you to know i wasnt mad because you said my brother couldnt fight off a bunch of lietuvans by himself i already knew he couldnt and i was trying to find a fast way to say i knew it thats all i was doing honest it is not honest to treat pagan things as if they are real maria said if you believe they are real how can you believe in the one true god but i dont believe they are i told you that and its the truth amanda said even more sadly maria shook her head i will pray for you she said and turned away she didnt feel like being friendly any more she couldnt have made it any plainer if shed slapped amanda in the face amanda had broken a rule nobody she approved of would break and so she didnt approve of amanda any more no doubt she meant it when she said she would pray in the hereandnow though that did amanda no good at all i dont belong here this isnt my world of course im going to make mistakes in it every once in a while amanda thought miserably if things were the way they were supposed to be that wouldnt have mattered so much she could have got away whenever she needed to but not now whether this was her world or not she couldnt get away from itand shed just lost the only real friend she had eleven jeremy saw more piles of rubble in polisso than he had the last time he went to the market square amanda said if this siege goes on how much of the city will be left beats me he answered were just lucky we havent had a bad fire polisso had nothing better to fight fires than a big wooden tub with a hand pump and a leather hose they called it a siphon any blaze that got well started had no trouble staying ahead of it fire was a nightmare here especially fire with a strong breeze to fan it a gang of municipal slaves with shovels and hods cleared bricks from the street the skinny wearylooking men worked as slowly as they could get away with every once in a while the overseerwho was much better fed than the work gang would growl at them theyd speed up for a little while after that then ease back down to the usual pace again the overseer didnt growl too often he knew when he could push them they knew when they could slack off and by how much if he didnt get that minimum amount of work out of them he would let them hear about it they didnt want that so they gave him what he neededand not a coppers worth more little by little the work got done if it wasnt finished todayand it wouldnt betheyd come back tomorrow what difference did a day make one way or the other that was how the slaves seemed to feel about it and the overseer as well when jeremy and amanda got to the market square he saw that the city prefects palace had had several chunks bitten out of it he had that odd feeling you get when something bad happens to someone you dont like he didnt like sesto capurnio one bit but he hopedhe supposed he hoped none of those cannonballs had mashed the prefect next door to the palace the temple stood undamaged look at that said a man who displayed some wellmade wooden bowls and platters only goes to show the gods look out for their own oh garbage the coppersmith beside him said it could be fool luck just as easy as not plainly theyd been going through all the variations in that argument for a while now in almost the same way as the slaves moved wreckage up the street they werent in any hurry about it the more they stretched it out the longer it could amuse both of them in polisso entertainment was where you found it jeremy and amanda went on to the temple as usual they had to wait in line in the narthex to buy incense for their thanksoffering today though the clerk who sold it to them and took down their names didnt act snooty he said ive already made my offering when the barbarians got in i thought we were all done for ive never been so glad in all my life i know what you mean jeremy answered they broke into our house if the legionaries hadnt driven them back he didnt say anything about stabbing the lietuvan soldier he wasnt proud of that he knew hed had to do itthe man would have killed him without a second thoughtbut he still wished he hadnt he decided he did hope the lietuvan would get betterafter he went home no wonder youre here to make a thanksoffering then the clerk said in memory of the hard time just past he was acting much more like a human being much less like nothing but a gear in the roman imperial machine were here jeremy meant here as in alivenot here as in the temple narthex thats why were making the thanksoffering and the clerkyes amazingly lifelikesmiled and nodded he understood what jeremy had in mind who would have thought it clerks didnt get paid to understand and so they mostly didnt bother here is your incense this one said may your god and the spirit of the emperor look kindly on the offering thank you jeremy said after a disaster people pulled together for a while mom and dad had talked about how things were like that after the last big quake in la and they always mentioned that sure enough almost getting the city sacked counted for a disaster he and amanda each had a little pinch of cheap incense in an even cheaper earthenware bowl they walked into the temples main hall side by side there in the paintings the mosaics the statues in niches were all the gods the locals believed in and jeremy didnt it was almost a walmart of religion dionysus aisle mithras aisle isis shes way over there by the checkout stands he whispered to amanda she smiled but then all at once it didnt seem quite so funny maybe because he too was feeling the aftereffects of disaster he suddenly saw the swarm of gods here as something more than superstition mixed with bureaucracy whether he really believed in them or not the gods meant reassurance to a lot of people and everybody needed reassurance every now and then especially after a brush with catastrophe he went up to the altar in front of the roman emperors bust even the line around the neck that showed where one head could replace another didnt bother him today wasnt it a symbol of how the empire went on no matter what the emperor looked like it was if you looked at it the right way the altartop had been polished to begin with the touch of lots of bowls with pinches of incense in them had worn it smoother still the marble was cool and slick under jeremys fingers as he set down his bowl he reached for a twig lit it at the waiting flame touched it to the stuff in the bowl and then stamped it out smoke curled up from the pinch of incense it smelled more greasy than sweet it had to have next to no myrrh or frankincense in it none could have come into polisso since the siege started here now that hardly seemed to matter the thought counted more than the actual physical stuff that went into it beside him her face serious amanda was lighting her thanksoffering he wondered what she was thinking he couldnt ask not here locals were coming up to make offerings of their own he and his sister stood with their heads bent in front of the altar for a little while then withdrew when they got outside amanda said thats funny i really do feel better i was thinking the same thing jeremy exclaimed it meant something today even if we dont exactly believe we werent just going through the motions his sister nodded thats right i was thankful i could make the offering there you go jeremy said i was looking for that but you found it i wish i could find some other things that matter more amanda said a way home would be nice i know jeremy said and then i dont know i just dont know any more lost hope he shook his head it wasnt that he would never lose hope but hed lost optimism whatever had happened back in the home timeline it wasit had to bea lot worse than hed thought when the connection between there and here first broke a cannonball sailed through the air when you were out in the open you could really watch them fly they didnt move too fast for the eye to follow even if their paths did seem to blur this one smashed into the roof of a leather workers shop red tilesthey really were a lot like the ones on the roofs of spanishstyle houses back in los angelescrumbled into red dust and smoke a womanthe leather workers wife or maybe a daughterlet out a scream he was down below putting the finishing touches on a saddle he threw it down and ran upstairs cursing i know how he feels jeremy said i know how she feels amanda said jeremy thought about that then he said he cant hit back at the lietuvans any more than she can he waited to see what amanda would say it was her turn to do some thinking in the end she didnt say anything but she did nod jeremy felt as if hed passed an odd sort of test rap rap rap pause rap rap rap amanda raised a pot of porridge several chain links higher above the fire so it wouldnt scorch while she went to see who was at the door rap rap rap whoever it was wanted to make sure she and jeremy knew he was there rap rap rap she wondered if the knocker would come off or if the door would fall down theyd had it fixed but she almost ran into her brother in the front hall want me to take care of it jeremy asked she knew what he meant the locals would expect to deal with somebody male she stuck out her chin she didnt much care what the locals expected its all right she said they can talk to me or they can she used a gesture common in polisso but not commonly used by girls a local would have been horrified jeremy laughed he bowed as if she were the city prefect all yours then jeremy behind her she unbarred the door and opened it just in the nick of time too the man standing there was reaching for the knocker again good day amanda said pleasantly no need to do that any more we knew you were here he blinked and then frowned by the way one eyebrow went up even as his mouth turned down he recognized sarcasm when he heard it that was almost as rare in polisso as it was in los angeles he said you are requested to come to the city prefects palace at once neolatin had separate words and separate verb forms for the singular and plural of you hed used the plural including her and jeremy who requests that she asked why the most illustrious city prefect himself of course the man replied he would be one of sesto capurnios chief secretaries or maybe his steward he wore a tunic of very fine wool with very little embroidery on it that meant he had a good deal of money without much status did it mean he was a slave it might well slaves here could have money of their own they could even though rarely own other slaves amanda sometimes wondered how well anyone from the home timeline understood all the complications to society in agrippan rome she knew she didnt she did know the request wasnt really a request it was an order but the fact that the city prefect hadnt phrased it as an order meant she and jeremy had gained status it didnt mean she could say no she said yes the nicest way she knew how my brother and i are honored to accept the most illustrious city prefects kind invitation we certainly are jeremy agreed the secretary or steward or whatever he was looked relieved to hear him speak up you sexist donkey amanda thought but this whole world was full of sexist donkeys she couldnt change it all by herself no matter how much she wished she could the man said come with me then both of you amanda moved the porridge higher above the fire and made it smaller so the food wouldnt burn and then go they did back through the battered streets of polisso the gang of slaves theyd seen on their trip to the temple a few days beforeor maybe a different gangworked at its usual unhurried pace to clear away another ruined wall when they got to the square amanda saw that a cannonball had hit the temple jeremy caught her eye she knew what he was thinking so much for miracles she nodded but she really had felt better coming out of the temple after the thanksoffering that wasnt a miracle she knew it wasnt it still counted for something though sesto capurnios flunky led the two crosstime traders into the city prefects office the prefect himself sat behind his desk the painted busts of several recent emperors stared out at amanda and jeremy from in back of him amanda found that slightly eerie or more than slightly when sesto capurnio spoke she half expected the lips on all the busts to start moving in time with his mouth they didnt of course only he said good day good day most illustrious prefect amanda and jeremy replied in chorus he bowed she curtsied still together they went on how may we serve you sesto capurnio shook his head i did not call you here on official business he said this is a a private conversation yes thats it a private conversation he looked pleased at finding the phrase amanda glanced at jeremy just for a moment his eyes met hers past that their faces showed no expression that was something theyd had to learn but even though jeremys face stayed blank she was sure he was thinking right along with her again when an important person told you something was a private conversation did you believe him not on your life did you let him know you didnt believe him not on your life what can we do for you then your excellency amanda still sounded respectful but she didnt curtsy this time the city prefect said if king kuzmickas receives uh certain presents from the great and glorious metropolis of polisso there is a chance that he will accept those as a symbol of the city and withdraw without troubling us any further would the king of lietuva do something like that or was sesto capurnio having pipe dreams amanda didnt know she didnt think anyone from the home timeline could have answered a question like that people from the home timeline didnt know enough about this one jeremy asked a symbol of the city you say do you mean a symbol of surrender your excellency even if you dont really give up polisso no by the gods no sesto capurnio shook his head his jowls wobbled back and forth watching them made amanda queasy far fewer people were heavy here than in the home timeline the city prefect was one of them though he went on what would my career be worth if i gave the king of lietuva such a token the emperor would think i had acted unwisely and he would be right when the prefect talked like that amanda believed him if he was starved into giving up that was one thing but if he acted too friendly toward kuzmickas while honorio prisco iii could still get his hands on him that would be something else again amanda asked well what do you want from us your excellency you have some of the richest most unusual gifts anyone in polisso could give the king sesto capurnio answered your razors your mirrors your knives with many tools your hourreckoners most of all so you want us to give you some of our goods so you can give them to kuzmickas amanda asked i think we can do that as long as you pay us back for them if the prefect insisted the watches and such were for the good of the city she was ready to hand them over without getting paid but she wanted to get the protest on the record the city will pay you for what you giveand i will accept your official report sesto capurnio not only agreed he sweetened the deal he really had to want them to go out to the fearsome king of lietuva he went on if i make the presents to kuzmickas though i would have to do it as city prefect it would be an official act by the government that is what we cannot have as i explained before if private citizens give kuzmickas presents that is unofficial do you see the difference that is why this is a private conversation too amanda and jeremy looked at each other again amanda gave a small nod her brother gave an even smaller shrug i think we see your excellency amanda said cautiously good sesto capurnio beamed at them then i will send the two of you out to the king as polissos unofficial very unofficialambassadors in an odd way jeremy almost admired sesto capurnio the city prefect had solved a lot of his problems at one fell swoop he was giving king kuzmickas rich presents if the king of lietuva decided to act like a barbarian and break his truce he would have jeremy and amanda but nobody who actually lived in polisso all the time and if kuzmickas did seize them jeremy would have bet sesto capurnio would find or invent some legal excuse to get his hands on the trade goods yes a pretty slick move all the way around except for us jeremy thought a soldier at the postern gate nodded to him and amanda the roman smelled of sweat and garlic ready he asked them wed better be jeremy said amanda nodded good fortune go with you then the soldier opened the gate rusty hinges squeaked postern gates almost always stayed closed they had nothing to do with the ordinary traffic that went into and out of a city they were for letting soldiers out to make a surprise attack against invaders who were assailing one of the main gates and for other small often secret things like that this mission was small but it wasnt secret it couldnt be not with the guns on both sides silent and with soldiers watching from the walls jeremy carried a staff with a spray of dried olive leaves attached to the top in this world the romans and lietuvans and persians all used that as a sign of truce a lietuvan carrying a similar staff came out of king kuzmickas camp polisso had grown out of a roman legionary encampment roman soldiers on campaign still camped with everything just so with each unit in its assigned place with the camp streets at right angles to one another and so on lietuva had imitated the roman empire in a lot of ways making camp wasnt one of them tents of every size style and color fabric sprawled here there and everywhere all higgledypiggledy if there were any real camp streets jeremy couldnt make them out the closer to the encampment he got the more he noticed that here was a place that smelled even worse than polisso he hadnt dreamt that was possible it nearly made him want to congratulate the lietuvans the big blond man with the staff of truce called good day in neolatin in the same language he went on do you speak lietuvan i am sorry your excellency but we do not jeremy answered will we need an interpreter to speak to his majesty the city prefect hadnt said anything about that to his relief the blond man shook his head no the king knows your tongue things would have been easier in ours but he will get along come with me if you please they came the lietuvan led them through the camp toward the biggest fanciest tent in it jeremy supposed that made sense who else but the king would have that kind of tent soldiers stared at them those stares didnt seem mean or fierce just curious guards stood outside the kings tent one of them spoke in lietuvan the guide answered in the same strangely musical language he turned back to jeremy before you see his majesty you will have to be searched we do not want you romans trying to steal a victory by murdering the king jeremy looked at the guards he looked at amanda who rolled her eyes those big lugs arent going to search my sister he said oh to his surprise the guide turned red he spoke to the guard chief in lietuvan they went back and forth at last the guide said the kings women will search your sister surprising jeremy again he added we meant no offense now amanda nodded all right jeremy said you come here a guard told jeremy in slow heavily accented neolatin he patted jeremy down and searched the bag he had with him since the bag had swiss army knives and straight razors in it jeremy wondered if he would get upset about them a security man in the home timeline would have this fellow seemed to understand they were meant as presents not murder weapons he nodded all good you wait for sister now two of king kuzmickas women brought amanda out of a little tent a few minutes later like lietuvan men they wore breeches tucked into high boots which made them scandalous to the romans they glittered with gold belts rings bracelets necklaces big hoops in their ears their fair hair hung straight and free the style was closer to what jeremy would have seen at canoga park high than the fancy curls roman women wore the lietuvans wore more makeup than either romans or highschool girls one of them spoke to the guard chief by the way he nodded shed given amanda a clean bill of health the other lietuvan woman eyed jeremy she might have been sizing up a horse or a dog she said something she and her friend both laughed so did a couple of the guards jeremy stood there stolidly he did his best to pretend the women didnt exist they thought that was funny too i will take you to the king said the lietuvan whod brought jeremy and amanda to the royal pavilion one of the guards held the tent flap so they could duck their way inside king kuzmickas sat in what looked like a folding wooden patio chair covered in gold paint a portable throne jeremy realized guards with drawn swords stood on either side of it the kings redgold beard was streaked with white a gold circlet shone in his greasy hair he would have been very handsome if hed lost twenty kilos the fur robe he wore had to be valuable even if it did make jeremy a little sick hed been doused with rosewater and had bad breath your majesty jeremy bowed low amanda curtsied as she had for sesto capurnio good day both of you kuzmickas said he had a light true tenor voice his neolatin was very good almost perfect with only a vanishing trace of the lietuvan accent that made him sound as if he were singing ordinary speech he looked the two crosstime traders over i did not think you would be so young we are old enough to bring you presents from polisso your majesty jeremy said oh no doubt kuzmickas pointed at him the kings nails were perfectly shaped but dirty you have some of those fancy things that are all the talk of the border the past few years yes your majesty jeremy said good i have seen some of these i would like to see more i would like to have more for myself king kuzmickas was nothing if not direct amanda spoke up polisso would like to have peace oh yes i know kuzmickas sounded amused some of us are likelier to get what we want than others youve already seen our city isnt easy to take jeremy said and so not many things that are worthwhile are easy just because something is hard does not mean it cannot be done the lietuvan king sounded like one of those boring lessons on how to get ahead in life those lessons might be boring that didnt make them any less true which worried jeremy but he wasnt there to argue with kuzmickas he was there to try to make him happy here is one of our gifts for you your majesty he said and gave the king a straight razor in a motherofpearl sheath that doubled as a handle he had to show kuzmickas how to free the blade with his thumbnail kuzmickas tested the edge on the ball of his thumb he raised an eyebrow in surprise yes this is very fine he said a good tool for smoothing a throator for cutting one he did not sound as if he was joking amanda said here is a mirror for you your majesty she gave him one of the biggest ones they had in a frame set with sea shells kuzmickas stared into it he muttered a few words in lietuvan by the smile on his face they meant something like i sure am a handsome fellow i like this he said in neolatin it is better than the mirrors we make i will not try to tell you any different and here your majesty jeremy gave the king a swiss army knife kuzmickas had learned his lesson with the razor he started using his thumbnail to free blade after blade tool after tool each new one made the smile on his face get wider yes he said this is a wonderful toy and useful too i would like to meet the knifesmith who made it to tell him how clever he is there was no smith of course somewhere someone sitting at a computer had designed the knife after that machines had done the rest just for a moment jeremy felt a twinge of regret about that people here really got their hands on what they made in a way they seldom did in the home timeline but machines could do things with so much less labor it made the trade worthwhile and finally your majesty amanda pulled out a blueplate special she showed king kuzmickas what the big shiny pocket watch was for how to wind it and how to read the hands better than a sundial i can take it anywhere and i can tell the hour at night and it is beautiful kuzmickas was good at figuring out the advantages of what was new technology to him his taste might have been a different question he went on but what if i forget to wind it what happens if it stops he was clever sure enough few people here ever wondered about that amanda answered wait till noon your majesty noon on a sundial and set it to six oclock like the romans the lietuvans started the day at sunrise not at midnight and if i dont have a sundial handy i can figure out when noon is on any sunny dayclose enough anyhow kuzmickas said nodding that is fine thank you people here didnt worry about time to the minute time to the half houror at most to the quarter hourwas close enough for them maybe watches would change that it hadnt happened yet we hope your presents please you your majesty jeremy said if you had brought me polissos surrender that would have pleased me more kuzmickas answered but wait fair is fair and never let it be said i take without giving in return i have presents for you as well he called out in lietuvan the man who hurried up and bowed to him was small and dark he looked more like a roman than a lietuvan a slave jeremy wondered he realized he would never know the king pointed to him and amanda in turn and spoke as if giving orders the little dark man bowed again nodding over and over he raced away as fast as he had come when he came back he carried a jacket of some thick brown lustrous fur and a necklace this marten jacket is for you ieremeo soltero king kuzmickas said it will keep you warm no matter what the weather try it you are large i hope it will fit you thank you very much your majesty that was the biggest lie jeremy had ever told putting on the jacket felt like the hardest thing hed ever done in his world in his time only a few perverts wore fur he knew that hadnt been true for his ancestors but theyd had all sorts of other nasty habits that he didnt want to imitate too he could smell the animal hides that made up the jacket it was warm but not all the sweat that sprang out on his forehead rose because it was he managed to hold his voice steady as he said it fits well your majesty thank you again you are welcome kuzmickas waved indulgently you will not offend me by taking it off i know it is too much for todays weather yes jeremy got out of it in a hurry he could still feel the weight of it on his shoulders though he fought not to be sick kuzmickas turned to amanda this necklace is of fine lietuvan amber when you wear it think of me he beckoned her forward and put it on her thank you very much your majesty its beautiful she said jeremy was jealous of her she could sound grateful and mean it the home timeline had nothing against amber and i give you one other gift kuzmickas said you will have paint or whitewash in your home he waited till jeremy and amanda gave him puzzled nods then went on if polisso falls to us paint a white x on your door you will not be harmed or enslaved you will come under my protection this gift is for you alone if we see many white xs when we break in we will ignore them all do you understand yes your majesty jeremy wasnt sure he ought to thank king kuzmickas for that he wasnt sure he and amanda ought to use the gift if polisso fell either it didnt seem fair but he wasnt sure they wouldnt use it either hed heard too many horror stories about things that could happen in the sack of a town instead of saying thank you he bowed that seemed to satisfy the king go back to polisso he said before the summer ends we will see whose gods are stronger yours may be more clever but minemine can fight jeremy had to pick up the martenfur jacket touching it was as bad as wearing it i cant be sick till i get someplace where nobody can see me he told himself again and again as he walked back to polisso and he wasnt quite though afterwards he never knew why not whatever the city prefect thought amanda and jeremys visit to king kuzmickas didnt change anything much amanda hadnt expected that it would the king of lietuva politely went on with the truce till the two crosstime travelers got back inside the walls of polisso then the lietuvans started shooting again they fired one cannon to let the romans know the truce was over the romans shot back with one gun to show they understood after that both sides returned to banging away with everything they had amanda liked her amber necklace she knew what her brother had to be thinking about getting a fur jacket she would have felt the same way herself and jeremy had to keep holding on to it as the roman officials questioned him about the meeting with king kuzmickas it seemed like forever before they finally got back inside their own house as soon as they did jeremy dropped the jacket he disappeared into the bathroom at a dead run amandas own stomach heaved as she listened to the sounds of retching when jeremy came out his face was pale as parchment are you all right amanda asked ill tell you im a lot better he answered and as soon as i drink some wine and get this horrible taste out of my mouth ill be better yet ill get it for you said amanda who wasnt sure he could walk to the kitchen without falling over thanks he said when she handed him the cup he sipped carefully dont want to drink too fast or im liable to throw up again that miserable horrible thing he wouldnt even look toward the jacket i could smell it what are you going to do with it amanda didnt want to look at the fur either she wasnt sure she could smell it but she imagined she could that was just about as bad what can i do with it jeremy answered even if we werent stuck here we couldnt take it back to the home timeline i cant sell it inside polisso as long as the siege is going on word might get back to kuzmickas that wouldnt be good if the lietuvans take the town we just have to hang on to it ill put it in a cabinet amanda said youve had enough to do with it ill shove it along with a broom handle or something so maybe i wont have to touch it would you jeremy looked happier maybe it was the wine maybe it was the thought of not having to deal with the fur any more it was the fur all right for he said thanks sis i dont think anybodys ever done anything nicer for me when i had to pretend i liked it he started turning green again cut that out amanda said sternly i told you id take care of it and i will just remember the acting you did there will make you a better bargainer from now on her brother nodded yeah thats true but you can pay too high a price for some things you know what i mean oh yes amanda nodded ill deal with it you dont have to worry about it any more she went out to the kitchen instead of a broom she found a mop that would do well enough she pushed the fur jacket ahead of her on the floor as if she were herding along an animal that didnt want to cooperate the poor martens whose furs went into the jacket hadnt wanted to cooperate they hadnt had a choice there was a chest that held mostly rags amanda opened it she needed two or three tries to pick up the jacket with the end of the mop handle it was heavier than shed thought she could have just stooped and gathered it in her hands but that never occurred to her she didnt want to touch it any more than jeremy had at last she managed to get it into the chest down came the lidthud for good measure amanda closed the latch she nodded pleased with herself the jacket was gone it might as well never have existed out of sight out of mind she thought she shouldered the mop as if it were a legionarys matchlock musket and marched back to the courtyard there she said her brother let out a long sigh almost an old mans sigh good thanks again i owe you one he laughed i dont know where i can find one that big to pay you back with though dont worry about it amanda answered this is what family is for i knew it was for something jeremy said amanda stuck out her tongue at him almost forgotten by both of them the siege of polisso ground on twelve jeremy and amanda both ate meat jeremy had never wondered why that didnt bother him when wearing fur did if he had wondered he would have said people needed protein but they could keep warm without killing animals and that would have been true but it wouldnt have been the whole truth though he might not have realized it wouldnt the whole truth was that he was as much a part of his culture as the people of agrippan rome were of theirs he noticed their quirks his own were water to a fish since he ate meat he had to buy it in the market square with polisso besieged there wasnt much to buy pork every now and then from people who kept pigs and what the sellers claimed to be rabbit jeremy didnt buy any of that his bet was that it would meow if you sliced it when he brought back pork amanda cooked it till it was gray back in the home timeline people didnt worry about trichinosis any more here the danger was as real as a kick in the teeth all sorts of things you didnt need to worry about in the home timeline could make you sick here even when hed stopped buying very often he kept going back to the market square women gossiped at the fountains the square was for men one drizzly morning he heard a rumor hed been hoping for someone said the roman emperor or at least an imperial army was on its way north to fight the lietuvans how do you know its true he asked the man whod passed the news to himone of the people who were selling what had to be roof rabbit well my brotherinlaw told me and hes pretty sharp the fellow answered that did not strike jeremy as recommendation enough how does he know he asked who told him you think my brotherinlaw would make something up the man with the mystery meat sounded indignant jeremy only shrugged as if to say how should i know the other man thought it over then he shrugged too well maybe he would terrific jeremy said you want to buy some rabbit the man asked him if youve got any prunes or anything like that you can make a nice tasty sauce for it no thanks jeremy answered if i had mice id get some of it from you theyd all run away funny the local said ha ha ha ha there you hear me laughing no jeremy told him i didnt hear me joking either the local sent him a gesture that meant something nasty the one jeremy gave back meant something just as nasty they parted on terms of perfect mutual loathing jeremy headed back to the house without any meat on his way there though he heard two men who looked like blacksmiths talking about the army coming up from the south that left him scratching his head he told amanda about them what do you think he asked were they listening to the other guys brotherinlaw who knows she answered well just have to wait and see thats all maybe everybodys saying yes theres an army coming because were all sick of being cooped up here but maybe there really is an army we wont know till it starts shooting at the lietuvans if it ever does schrodingers army jeremy said thinking of cats amanda made a face at him he made one right back she was his sister after all he couldnt let her get away with something like that but he hadnt been joking with her either if you couldnt tell whether an army was real till it showed up or didnt show uphow much good did it do you the only thing an army that might be real did was to pump up hope that could help for a little while maybe but if more time went by and the army didnt show up wouldnt hope sink lower than it would have if it hadnt been lifted in the first place he wondered if the city prefect or the garrison commander had got worried about morale in polisso even if the rumors about an approaching roman army werent true they might think it was in their interest to start them or people who were in danger of losing hope on their own might have started the rumors to make themselves feel better or jeremy gave up he couldnt tell he just didnt know and he didnt have any real evidence one way or the other sooner or later hed find out till then till then ill worry thats what ill do he thought amanda set her palm on the proper spot in the basement wall the concealed door slid aside and let her into the chamber the locals werent supposed to discover the electric lights in there came on seeing them made tears sting her eyes some small part of the tears came because the lights were bright after the gloom of the basement but most of them sprang from the lights being electric they were things from the home timeline every time she came down here not being able to go back there ate at her more its home she thought as the door silently slid shut behind her how can anybody blame me because i want to go home because i dont want to stay here people from polisso would find los angeles endlessly marvelous endlessly exciting but they might well want to come back to the timeline of agrippan rome once theyd seen what there was to see and los angeles was a richer place where you could do more thingsdo more kinds of thingsthan you could in polisso if it wasnt home even that wouldnt matter when it was the lights werent all that reminded her of home the sheetmetal cabinets the table with the plywood top the blue plastic chair with the slotted backthey were ordinary things but they were things from her world in the home timeline you didnt have to be somebody important to sit in a chair with a back instead of on a stool that wasnt a big difference between the two worlds but it was a difference differences gnawed at her spirit like acid now and the computer the difference there was what the powerbook couldor rather couldntdo now it was supposed to connect her to the home timeline to the world that knew how to move between worlds how to talk between worlds it was supposed to but it didnt it was like a friend whod let her down it was a friend whod let her down amanda had to make herself walk to the blue plastic chair she had to make herself pull it out had to make herself sit down in it and it took everything she had in her to make herself look at the laptops monitor her brother said the same thing she and jeremy had been disappointed so many times is anybody there three little words shed heard that i love you was supposed to hit you like that when the right person said those three little words these three nobody talked about these three but i love you even when she heard it from the right person was going to have to do some pretty fancy work to top them she blinked is anybody there stayed on the screen she wasnt imagining it if king kuzmickas had taken polisso without getting one single soldier scratched he might have let out a whoop with one tenth the joy of the one that burst from amandas lips she sprang out of the chair she jumped up and down she did the wildest whirlingest dance the world had ever seen and then she did something a lot harder than that instead of answering right away she turned her back on the beautiful monitor she left the secret basement the door closed behind her again shutting her out she went upstairs to primitive smelly besieged polisso jeremy was watering the herbs in the herb garden a few spices like pepper and cinnamon were expensive imported luxuries here as for the rest the ordinary ones like basil and thyme you grew your own if you wanted them otherwise you did without theres something i think you ought to see amanda said she tried to sound calm to hold the excitement out of her voice she tried but it didnt work jeremys head came up as if he were a wolf scenting meat is it he stopped as if he didnt want to go on for fear of hearing no but amanda said yes her brother whooped even louder than she had he was out in the open not in a soundproof basement he didnt care at all and neither did amanda somebody next door exclaimed in surprise they didnt care about that either jeremy set down the water jug it was a wonder he hadnt dropped it and smashed it he grabbed amandas hands they did sort of a twoperson version of the crazy dance shed done by herself down below they were both laughing and panting when they finally stopped what does it say jeremy demanded tell me what it says come see for yourself amanda told him but then as they both hurried to the stairs she added its just asking if were here i havent even answered it yet well wed better jeremy said you bet fear filled amanda as she set her palm on the patch of wall where it was supposed to go the door slid aside opening the secret part of the basement she and jeremy hurried in they both ran to the powerbook on the table her fear grew would the message still show on the screen had she imagined she saw it because she wanted to see it so badly is anybody there the words were real seeing them there again seeing jeremy see them made amanda as happy as she had been when she saw them the first time she would have been glad to go back to the temple to make one more thanksoffering those three words made her more grateful than anything else shed ever known wow jeremy said his eyes wide and shining amanda nodded jeremy shook his head as if fighting to believe it amanda understood that all right her brother started to say something then stopped and shook his head again he turned to her and almost bowed you found it you do the talking okay with that she switched from neolatin to english answer that was an oral command the computer recognized she paused to think for a moment then just spoke simply this is amanda jeremy and i are both here were all right but the lietuvans have polisso under siege what went wrong back there that summed up what the home timeline needed to know and what she and jeremy most wanted to find out she had another frightened moment when she sent the message would the laptop tell her it couldnt go through the way the machine had so many times before it didnt from everything she could tell the message went crosstime just the way it was supposed to softly she clapped her hands beside her jeremy said yeah then they had to wait that hadnt occurred to her back in porolissum in the home timeline wouldnt somebody be watching the monitor every single minute shed thought somebody would maybe she was wrong five minutes went by ten fifteen she wanted to kick something she also wanted to scream had the message made it back to the home timeline and then the screen showed new words even before she read them she and jeremy both cheered again why not they werent cut off any more only now as the isolation ended did amanda realize how bad it had been she leaned forward to get a better look at the monitor this is dad the new message began she grinned at jeremy who was grinning back gladder than i can tell you that youre okay were starting to get things sorted out here too what happened amanda asked again this time the answer came back right away terrorists nationalist terrorists dad said they bombed a lot of crosstime sites here in romania all on the same day it was a nice piece of work if you like that kind of thing terrific jeremy said hush amanda told him theres more and there was their father went on that would have been bad enough by itself but they also planted tailored viruses at some of the blast sites guess what both of the ones that connect to polisso in agrippan rome got lucky theyve finally managed to decontaminate enough to set up computers here but im wearing a spacesuit to talk to you guys urk jeremy said this time amanda didnt hush him she felt like going urk herself making real viruses these days was almost as easy as making computer viruses had been at the start of the twentyfirst century and real viruses could do as much damage in the real world as computer viruses had in the virtual world they could if you were ruthless enough to turn them loose nagornokarabakh and a big chunk of azerbaijan next door were still uninhabitable armenians blamed azerbaijanis azerbaijanis blamed armenians no one was ever likely to know whod really used that ebola variant it was so hot it had probably killed off whoever started it that was poetic justice of a sort fighting tailored viruses was dangerous enough in the home timeline if one of them got loose in an alternate like agrippan rome it might take out a third of the population or more natural epidemics had done that in the past unnatural epidemics amanda didnt even want to think about it hows mom jeremy asked shes fine she sends her love dad answered amanda breathed a sudden sigh of relief if moms appendix had waited a little longer to act up she would have got stuck here that could have been very bad amanda couldnt think of anything much worse in fact she asked how long before youre able to come and get us crosstime traffic and the ministry for the environment here both have to decide its safe dad said a week or two probably but you said there was a war going on there thats right amanda said she and jeremy took turns telling what had happened since they got cut off weve had to sell for money instead of wheat and barley she put in at one point we didnt have any place to put the produce and then we didnt want the locals calling us hoarders dont worry about that dad said no one will complain that you went against the grain for a second amanda just accepted that she opened her mouth to start to answer it then she saw the revolted look on her brothers face she read the message again she made a horrible face too well thats dad for sure she said you better believe it jeremy said nobody else in the world makes puns that bad from revolted his expression suddenly went crafty except maybe me he spoke to the powerbook answer wheat like to tell you to clean up that last message we could barley understand it it seemed pretty corny send ow amanda exclaimed wheres something i can hit you with jeremy looked proud of himself which wasnt what shed had in mind there was a pause at the other end amanda hoped dad wasnt running out and throwing up that could be awkward in an antivirus spacesuit at last he answered your sense of humor is as rye as i remember he must have typed that in instead of dictating it if hed spoken into the computer it would have written wry which was right and not rye which was wrong to say nothing of ghastly for good measure he added but i dont want to be on the oats with you thats rice amanda said jeremy groaned not quite in praise it wasnt the best comeback but they were running out of grains dad got back to business just hang on till we finish decontaminating here he said thats all you need to do now like i told you it wont be too long as long as the lietuvans dont get into polisso again well be fine jeremy said amanda thought hed put in one word too many but it was too late to stop him sure as houses dad wrote back again they got some men in at night amanda said not too many though and polisso is crawling with roman soldiers we had to pay the prefect a sort of a bribe to keep from having any quartered on us they drove the lietuvans out again are you all right is the house all right were fine jeremy said quickly and the house is okay a couple of cannonballs hit the roof and smashed some tiles but thats it he didnt say anything about the brokendown front door it was just about as good as new so amanda could understand that and he didnt say anything about the lietuvan soldier whod stumbled when the table broke under him he didnt say anything about stabbing the lietuvan either amanda supposed she could also understand that jeremy didnt want to think about it and it was all over with anyhow and it would only worry dad were fine was an awful lot simplerand it was the truth maybe one of these days ill get the whole story out of you dad wrote even when he couldnt see faces and hear voices he wasnt so easy to fool but he went on for now im just glad you are fine i hope ill see you soon ive got to go get out of this suit and clean up now i love you and so does your mom bye amanda and jeremy said together they didnt get an answer amanda wished they would have but dad had already said he was going they found us again she said she couldnt imagine a more wonderful sentence yeah by the glow in jeremys eyes neither could he but then amanda found one were not going to have to stay here yeah jeremy said again that would have been pretty bad i kept trying not to worry about it but his voice trailed away sometimes you cant help it no you cant amanda had thought about living out the rest of her life here and wondered how long it would be it would certainly have seemed long with hard work filling so much of it she wouldnt have had the whole world and lots of alternates at her fingertips the way she had back home anything outside of polisso would have faded to a whisper almost to a dream she would have had to live with stench and dirt the rest of her life sooner or later the drugs they had here would have run out or got too old to do any good doctors in agrippan rome didnt know anything and mostly didnt know they didnt know anything dentists were even worse if her wisdom teeth gave her trouble when they came in what could she do take poppy juice and hope for the best but none of that was the worst if she and jeremy were stuck in polisso they would have had to become part of the city in a way they werent now they would have had to make real friends good friends here if they didnt they wouldnt have any how were you supposed to live your life without friends when you made friends though you went out with them and you did what they did if they wanted to go to the arena to watch beasts fight or gladiators go at each other how could you say no all the time they thought that was good clean fun if you didnt how could you stay friends it got worse too she and jeremy were both young if they had to stay in polisso they mightthey probably wouldend up getting married marriages here were usually business arrangements not love matches like the ones in the home timeline even so how could you live with somebody when you couldnt tell that person what you really were and here if she and jeremy did marry they would be bound to marry somebody with money in polisso if you had money you had slaves that would have put them nose to nose with something they fought to keep at arms length amanda didnt see any way she could persuade a roman husband slavery was wrong since she couldnt could she be a good mistress maybe if she were would it make her feel any less unclean she doubted that she doubted it very much she also had one worry that jeremy didnt what would having a baby be like in this world without hospitals women did it all the time polisso wouldnt have had any people if they didnt but mothers died here from childbed fever babies died too more than a third of the babies born in agrippan rome didnt live to be five years old how could you love a child if you knew you might lose it the next minute how could you not love it if it was yours she didnt see an answer to either question now she wouldnt have to look for one lets go upstairs she said okay jeremys voice came from far away had he been thinking about all the reasons he was glad not to be trapped here amanda wouldnt have been surprised the door slid shut after she and jeremy left the secret part of the basement there they were back in agrippan rome amanda sighed staying here for another week or two was going to be hard but staying forever would have been a lot harder jeremy was playing catch in the street with fabio lentulo and trying not to get smashed when he heard somebody say theyre going he didnt have much chance to worry about who was going the apprentice had thrown the ball so that he had to catch it without banging into either a mule or the soldier who was leading it watch yourself kid the soldier growled with the sour disapproval so many grownups had for anybody younger than they were sure jeremy said even if the soldiers whiskers were turning gray he could probably whale the stuffing out of somebody who didnt fight for a living besides jeremy had just made a great catch he wasnt going to be fussy with anybody about anything he tossed the ball high in the air so that fabio lentulo would have time to run under itif he ran right into the middle of another bunch of soldiers he didnt one of the soldiers picked up the ball and flipped it to him thanks he said the legionary could have kept it just as easily when he threw it back though he tried to take jeremys head off with it jeremy had won a point in the game and he didnt like it jeremy won another pointor at least kept from losing onewhen he snatched the ball out of the air fabio lentulo sent him a gesture that was anything but complimentary same to you with olive oil on it jeremy said they both laughed buddies could insult each other as much as they pleased but if jeremy had aimed his gibe at fabio lentulos mother instead of the apprentice he would have had a fight on his hands in some ways polisso and los angeles werent so different two men came up the street toward jeremy and fabio lentulo one of them said are you sure theyre pulling out by the gods you can go up on the wall and see for yourself if you dont believe me the other man replied they havent got the nerve to stay and fight it out the first man said his friend shrugged i dont know about that if you ask me theyre going off to fight the relieving army when its still too far from polisso for the garrison here to pitch into em from behind they walked on still arguing in a goodnatured way well fabio lentulo said you going to throw me the ball or not here jeremy tossed it to him soft enough for a sixyearold to catch did you hear what they said sounds like the lietuvans are leaving to the crows with the lietuvans fabio lentulo threw the ball so that jeremy would have to splash through a puddle to go after it but he didnt go after it he just let it fall with a thump it didnt have much bounce to it he said if they let me im going up onto the wall i dont know about you but i want to see king kuzmickas leave why so you can wave byebye fabio lentulo knew jeremy and amanda had gone out to give the king of lietuva presents jeremy sent back the gesture the apprentice had given him no so i can be sure hes gone or didnt you worry about a cannonball coming down on your head or getting sold into slavery me i kept hoping a cannonball would come down on my bosss head he already treats me like a slave fabio lentulo answered he probably wasnt kidding or not very much an employer could order an apprentice around much as a master could order a slave the difference was an apprentice became his own man once he was trained a slave was never his own man he always belonged to somebody else fabio lentulo went on besides none of that stuff happened to him his place didnt get hit even once he spread his hands as if to say what can you do all right i still want to see kuzmickas leave so im going up on the wall jeremy said are you coming oh ill come fabio lentulo said youre not going to be able to go around town telling people im yellow jeremys challenge would have got a lot of young men in los angeles to go with him here in polisso any of them would have risen to it as automatically as a trout rising to strike at a fly people here did behave in a more macho way than they did in the home timeline they thought that was what they were supposed to do and they did it in school jeremy had learned nothing could travel faster than light he didnt think his teachers had heard about the speed with which rumor could spread he and fabio lentulo were part of a line going up the stone stairs to the top of the wall grumbling soldiers herded the civilian gawkers along like so many sheep yes the barbarians are pulling out they said you can take your gander if it makes you happy mind you dont get your stupid heads shot off the lietuvans havent quit fighting and they arent gone yet jeremy discovered how true that was a moment later a lietuvan soldier popped up out of a trench aimed a matchlock in his general direction and pulled the trigger to bring the burning match down on the priming powder the priming powder caught and set off the main charge the musket went off a great cloud of gray smoke made the musketeer vanish the bang of the gun reached jeremy half a second later about the same time as the bullet whined past his head he ducked he couldnt help it when he looked behind him he saw that fabio lentulo had ducked too that made him feel better now his friend couldnt tease him for being a coward either and why did such teasing matter to him maybe he had more macho in himself than he wanted to admit but even though some of the lietuvans were still shooting at polisso the rest did seem to be leaving tents around the city were coming down wagons drawn by horses or mules or oxen were rolling away companies of musketeers like the man whod shot at jeremy were marching off to the south distantly the breeze brought commands in musical lietuvan to jeremys ears they are going he said looks that way fabio lentulo agreed then he yelled something truly vile at king kuzmickas he followed it with a gesture much nastier than the one he and jeremy had aimed at each other he wasnt the only one doing such things either half the men seemed to be swearing at the lietuvans or sending them obscene gestures or doing both at once the big blond soldiers shouted back in their language they sent the romans gestures different but no less foul and some of them kept on shooting at polisso the legionaries on the wall shot back at them about ten meters in front of jeremy a civilian fell down clutching at his leg his howl of pain pierced the jeers like a sword piercing flesh when jeremy and fabio lentulo walked by where hed been wounded the crosstime trader didnt look at the scarlet puddle of blood on the stone he didnt need to look to know it was there he could smell the hotmetal scent as he had when he stabbed the lietuvan soldier by contrast the apprentice stared and stared at the gore got him good he remarked did you hear him yell a deaf man would have heard him yell jeremy answered fabio lentulo thought that was funny and laughed out loud jeremy hadnt meant it for a joke there was a lot more raw agony in this alternate than in the home timeline bad things happened to people more often in polisso than in los angeles people here could do much less about them too joys on the other hand the lietuvan soldiers were going away with luck they wouldnt be able to come back that would do for joy till something better came along jeremy shook his fist at the withdrawing soldiers he never wanted to see them again or king kuzmickas either as soon as the lietuvans were gone the defenders of polisso opened the gates people poured out of the city somethe scavengersmade for the lietuvan camp to bring back and sell whatever the enemy had left behind others just wanted to get away from their houses to get away from their neighbors for a little while amanda was one of those she couldnt go by herself that wasnt done it wasnt safe either but she and jeremy went out together he didnt feel the need to get away as much as she did but he did see she made him seeshe would be impossible unless she got out for a little while out they went as far as guns would reach from the wall the ground was cratered the grass torn to shreds shed seen that when she and her brother went to call on king kuzmickas when the wind swung it brought the stink of the lietuvan encampment to her nose the lietuvans had been even more careless of filth and dirt and sewage than the romans were that they could have still surprised her they probably would have had to leave pretty soon even if there werent a roman army coming up from the south jeremy said in an alternate like this sickness kills more soldiers than bullets ever do amanda knew he was right that didnt mean she felt like listening she didnt answer she just kept walking till the wind swung again and the stench went away then she stepped off the road she lay down on her back in the grass it tickled her ankles and her arms and her cheeks she looked up and saw nothing but blue sky ahhh she said for a wonder jeremy didnt spoil the moment he stayed out of her way and let her do what she wantedwhat she neededto do when she sat up again she brushed grass out of her hair with both hands she looked forward to using real shampoo once more too her brother stood by the side of the road sword on his hip watching for lietuvan stragglers and any other strangers who might be dangerous hed plucked a long grass stem and put it between his teeth except for the sword you look like a hick farmer on an ancient sitcom amanda told him is that a fact he said doing a bad halfsouthern halfmidwestern accent then he went back to neolatin all the backwoods farmers on all those stupid programs were as modern as next week next to the peasants in this alternate well sure amanda said peasants here were cut off from the wider world around them in a way nobody in america had been since the invention of the telegraph they might have been more cut off from the wider world than peasants in europe since the invention of the printing press that went back a long way but only a third of the distance to the breakpoint between the home timeline and agrippan rome a cool breeze blew down from the mountains to the north it didnt say winter was coming not yet but it did say summer wouldnt last forever the harvest was on the wayand it would come even sooner in chilly lietuva than here there was another reason king kuzmickas army would have had trouble besieging polisso much longer jeremy spread his arms the breeze made the wide sleeves of his tunic flap he said everythings so peaceful so quiet id almost forgotten what quiet is all about cannon and muskets going off and cannonballs smashing into things are even noisier than traffic back home amanda agreed they may be more dangerous too heh jeremy said and then it all seems so stupid is owning polisso worth killing so many people i cant see it neither can i amanda said but could you explain the software war so it made sense to the city prefect here you cant explain anything so it makes sense to sesto capurnio i ought to know jeremy said amanda made a face at him he made one right back at her then he went on all right i know what you mean but copy protection is something worth fighting over we think so would the romans would the lietuvans or would they figure it wasnt worth getting excited about the way we do when it comes to owning one of these little cities who knows her brother said ill tell you something else thoughi dont much care just now amanda didnt care very much either she didnt feel like squabbling with jeremy right this minute the fresh breeze teasing her hair the clean smell of the meadow the calm after so much chaos and the knowledge that shed be going back to the home timeline before long all of them joined together to make her as contented as shed ever been when she looked to her right she saw a hawk flying by the locals would have called that a good omen she was willing to do the same thirteen having the lietuvans gone didnt mean polisso came back to normal right away the city usually had farmers bringing in produce and eggs and sometimes livestock to sell in the market here now the farmers didnt have much to sell to the people in the city kuzmickas soldiers had lived off the countryside as much as they could locusts might have stripped it barer then again they might not have as they left the lietuvans had ruined as many grainfields as they could too polisso and the surrounding farms could look forward to a lean harvest jeremy would have worried more about that if hed expected to stay in town through the winter being back in touch with the home timeline changed his whole way of looking at things for better or worsemostly for worsehed started to think of polisso as home now he felt like a visitor a tourist again things that happened here happened to other people they werent likely to affect him much he was in touch with michael fujikawa again too his friend was back from his summer in alternate north china and back to school at canoga park high youre lucky michael wrote you dont have to worry about history homework and boolean operators lucky my left one jeremy answered for one thing i was scared amanda and i would be stuck here for goodexcept it wouldnt be very good and besides think of all the work ill have to make up when i do get back poor baby heres the worlds smallest violin playing hearts and flowers for you michael sent jeremy laughed his grandfather had said that and run his forefinger over the top of his thumb when he did to show the violin the joke had to be ancient jeremy had never heard it from anybody but grandpa he wondered where on earth michael had picked it up his friend went on i am glad you two are okay though i knew something was wrong when we got cut off terrorists i heard thats no fun lucky they didnt have nukes gurk jeremy said when that showed up on the powerbooks monitor ordinary explosives and tailored viruses were bad enough nukes terrorists didnt have an easy time getting them but bad things happened when they did and how would anybody have rebuilt the transposition chambers if even vestpocket nukes had gone off in them one thing happened after the lietuvans went away jeremy and amanda started selling pocket watches and mirrors and razors and swiss army knives hand over fist that wasnt just because theyd given them to king kuzmickas either their goods had always had snob appeal but now polissos rich seemed to realize they wouldnt need to spend their last denari on grain and so they started spending their money on luxuries instead after amanda sold a blueplate special jeremy said shame we cant start taking payment in grain again not in silver but theyd still come down on us for hoarding if we tried anybody who comes here from now on will have a hard time insisting on grain amanda said i wish that hadnt happened she found more things to worry about than jeremy did shrugging he said i dont know what else we could have done we didnt have any place to put more grain once the transposition chambers stopped coming even if we did people would have stopped giving it to us after the siege started they didnt worry so much about money i suppose amanda said in a tone of voice that meant she was still worrying about it jeremy didnt have the patience to straighten his sister out he also never wondered about how much patience she needed to get along with him he left the house and went over to the market square to see what sort of gossip he could pick up he thought of it as news when he got there he saw workmen busily repairing the city prefects palace sesto capurnio wouldnt have to worry about drafts or a leaky roof for very long ordinary people what was the point of being rich and powerful if you couldnt get your roof fixed ahead of ordinary people masons patched holes with cement carpenters hammers banged good thing the temple next door didnt get hurt too bad said a man in the market square the gods would have to wait their turn too the gods can take care of themselves another man answered thats probably why nothing much happened to the temple but what about the poor soandsos who got their shacks knocked flat what are they going to do same as always the first man said theyll get it in the neck by the way he spoke and dressed he wasnt a rich man himself when he talked about what happened to the poor it was from bitter experience i dont suppose the city prefect would have got hungry if the siege had gone on either the second man said the first man laughed not likely city prefects dont go hungry that isnt in the rules if you dont believe me just ask sesto capurnio ill tell you what i believe his pal said i believe youre going to get in trouble if you dont stick a sandal in your big flapping mouth for a wonder the first man did shut up jeremy bought a handful of pickled green olives from a vender with a crock of them that he wore tied around his neck with a leather strap so that it bounced against his belly jeremy savored what salt and vinegar could do for olives he spat the pits onto the cobbles of the market square he wouldnt have done that back in the home timeline but things were different here what would i have been like if id got stuck here for twenty years and then gone home he wondered would i have done things like that without thinking about them because everybody did them here i bet i would somebody came into the square at a run people looked up that was out of the ordinary which meant it might be important and sure enough the man yelled news at the gate our army beat the lousy lietuvans theyre on their way home fast as they can go people in the square didnt all jump up and start cheering they nodded to one another as if to say theyd expected as much had they maybe some of them had but others wouldnt want to show that theyd thought anything else was possible and one man said why didnt our army come six weeks ago then we wouldnt have had to go through so much trouble another merchant said were lucky they didnt wait till next spring or till five years from now he laughed to show he meant it for a joke the men who heard him laughed too to show they knew it was one jeremy wasnt so sure they might all have been kidding on the square agrippan rome was so bound up in rules and regulations all its wheels turned slowly the army had to be less sluggish than most parts of the government and it had done its job here even if it hadnt done it very fast would the romans know what to do with freedom if they got it theyd done without it for a long long time jeremy shrugged it wasnt his worry not any more sure enough he was and felt like a visitor here once more not somebody who might have to put down deep roots and that suited him just fine not living in polisso for the rest of his life even if that meant going back to high school and catching up on everything hed missed seemed pretty good everything is clean now in both transposition chamber areas mom wrote theyre running a last few checks and then well be able to come through amanda raised an eyebrow when she read that if everything were clean now her folks should have been able to come straight through now the technicians wouldnt be running more checks she sighed she could understand why they didnt want to risk letting a tailored virus loose in agrippan rome doctors here couldnt do anything about natural germs let alone genetically engineered ones she said answer well see you when we see you thats all we miss you its already been too long send the wordsminus the opening and ending commands appeared on the powerbooks screen they would also appear on the monitor mom was looking at back home when mom and dad came into polisso again word would be bound to get back to the city prefect amanda knew that sesto capurnio still half suspected she and jeremy had knocked their parents over the head and buried them somewhere out of the way well i dont have to worry about what sesto capurnio suspects not now amanda thought she was just a tourist again and she wouldnt even be that for very long burgers fries milkshakes sushi lamb vindaloo spit flooded into her mouth she was tired of barley porridge and gritty brown bread its been much too long mom agreed you dont know how much weve missed you and worried about you well it wont be much longer ive got to go see you soon see you amanda said shed done plenty of worrying about herself too nice to know somebody else was also doing it for her that was a big part of what parents were for she didnt want to leave the cellar going back into the world of agrippan rome the world of stinks the world with slavery and without electricity reminded her of everything shed left behind shed get it back again though and she and jeremy would get mom and dad back too it was like living in a fairy tale when you got three wishes but the three wishes hadnt happened yet she just had the promise that they would what to do in the meantime the only thing she could see was to get on with her life she felt like cinderella back with her stepmother and nasty stepsisters before the prince came along with the glass slipper the next morning she put a water jar on her hip and went to the fountain she would never be able to go there without thinking of the lietuvan cannonball ricocheting through the crowd of women that one dreadful morning she noticed local women also looking at the scars it had left behind on the stonework the real damage it had done though had nothing to do with stonework maria was at the fountain she and a couple of free women were talking about the victory the romans had won against king kuzmickas people in polisso hoped it meant the lietuvans wouldnt invade again any time soon past that they didnt much seem to care one of the free women waved to amanda what do you think the local asked you went out there and gave the king presents will he try again soon how can i know that amanda said reasonably i just met him for a little while i dont know how badly the legions beat him either if they really smashed up his army maybe hell stay in his own country for a while if they didnt though he might think hed have better luck next time and try again sounds sensible the local woman seemed surprised maybe she wasnt used to logically thinking things through even back in the home timeline a lot of people werent that never failed to startle amanda when she bumped into it which probably wasnt sensible on her part maria smiled at her amanda cautiously smiled back the slave girl seemed willing to be friendly at least to a certain degree no matter what she believed maybe that meant maria wasnt quite so strict herself as amanda had thought more likely it just meant the slave couldnt help being a friendly person even if her beliefs were strict maria said you seem happy amanda nodded i am happy i just got a message from my mother and father she didnt have to say the message had crossed timelines to get here they ought to be back in polisso in a few days oh that is good news maria set down her water jar and gave amanda a hug yes she was a friendly person all right i know you and your brother have been worried about them a little amanda didnt want to say how much she couldnt say all the reasons why she and jeremy had been worried either they will have worried about you even more what with the two of you under siege here im sure they will reward the messenger when he tells them you are all right maria said i prayed that everything would turn out well for you and for them im glad my prayers were answered amanda didnt quite know how to take that thank you seemed the right thing to say stammering a little she added dont you uh pray for yourself too for your freedom oh yes maria answered calmly but god hasnt chosen to hear that prayer yet in his own good time he will or if it pleases him he will leave me as i am his will be done she means it amanda realized understanding that believing it was a bigger jolt than seeing how some people wouldnt think logically maria believed no matter how friendly she was believing helped her accept her place accepting a low place wasnt something americans were used to instead they went out and tried to make it better people in agrippan rome usually didnt they couldnt how do you stand it amanda blurted what can i do about it maria still sounded calm and reasonable nothing not by myself after echoing amandas thoughts she went on since i cant do anything whats the point of getting upset it would only make life harder and life is hard enough as is im more ready to be free than i used to be i think now that you showed me how the alphabet works i can read more and more though its still not easy for me i go on from day to day and i pray and i hope would you like enough silver to buy yourself free amanda asked impulsively i have it you know maria smiled again and shook her head i would rather be your friend than your debtor it would take me years to pay back that kind of money if i ever could i didnt mean as a loan amanda said if you want to be free id gladly pay your owner what youre worth she couldnt change the whole roman empire here but she could help a friend if she got in trouble for that with crosstime traffic too bad she and jeremy had piled up an awful lot of silver freeing maria counted for more with her than buying grain shed had second thoughts about it before now that she was leaving yes things seemed different somehow the slave girls eyes went big and round when she realized amanda meant it you would do that for me she said amanda nodded maria hugged her again but then worry in her voice she asked what would i do if i were free you could go on working for your master but as a freedwoman amanda answered you know his business wouldnt he be glad to have you youd be your own person though you wouldnt be his even that wasnt a hundred percent true freedmen and freedwomen had obligations to the people whod once owned them but they couldnt be sold or mistreated the way slaves could and their children would be wholly free i hardly believe my own ears maria said well youd better amanda told her i meant it take the water back and ill do the same then ill meet you at pulio carvilios shop marias owner a cobbler was a short stocky man with a broad face hairy ears and scarred hands whats this i hear he said in a gruff raspy voice when amanda came in he pushed the sandal he was repairing off to one side and set the awl he held down on the table you want to buy maria from me amanda shook her head no i want to buy her freedom pulio carvilio stuck out his chin which made his jowls wobble shes a good worker itll cost you shes worth five pounds of silver if shes worth a copper five pounds amanda exclaimed thats robbery the haggle that followed was the strangest one shed ever known she was dickering over the price of another human being when she let herself think about that it made her sick i dont want her for myself she thought i want her to be able to have herself she got pulio carvilio down to four pounds of silver but no further he had the advantage in the bargain the only reason she haggled at all was that he would have been shocked if she hadnt if he wanted to think hed skinned her in the deal she didnt mind a bit once theyd agreed she and the cobbler and maria had to go to the city prefects palace to make everything official it turned out to be more complicated than amanda had expected almost everything in agrippan rome turned out to be more complicated than people from the home timeline expected there were endless forms to fill out most of them in triplicate pulio carvilio couldnt read or write that meant the clerk at the palace had to read everything to him which made the whole business take twice as long as it should have maria could hardly read either but the clerk didnt care about that till all the paperwork got filled out she was just a piece of property with legs the clerk and amanda both had to witness pulio carvilios mark again and again and again and the clerk kept sniffing this is irregular he said several times that a female should make such a purchase most irregular is it illegal asked amanda who knew it wasnt he was honest or honest enough he shook his head no but it is irregular never mind that amanda told him just think of the tax the empires getting she had to pay him ten percent of what she was paying marias master the government said that kept people from freeing slaves on a whim maybe it did but amanda thought the main purpose of the law was to make the government money finally all three copies of all the forms were filled out the clerk nodded to maria and said congratulations maria carvilia you are free as a freedwoman she took the family name of her former owner that was another sign freedwomen and freedmen werent so very free after all amanda swallowed a sigh shed hoped for something better and then she got it the clerk slid off his stool he opened a drawer in a cabinet behind him amanda expected him to pull out one more document instead he held what looked to her like nothing more than a funny hat but maria knew what it was she clapped her hands together a phrygian cap a phrygian cap the clerk agreed gravely the sign of your freedom he set it on her head except that it was red not white and only bulged out in front it reminded amanda of a chefs hat not counting her buck teeth maria was a nicelooking girl even she couldnt make the phrygian cap seem anything but ridiculous to amanda but what amanda thought didnt matter here marias eyes glowed the cap might have been oddlooking but it meant everything in the world to her amanda wondered how long freed slaves had been putting on phrygian caps in agrippan rome a thousand years two thousand longer still most of the time she thought old customs held this world back here she dimly understood what this one meant to maria pulio carvilio kissed maria on one cheek the clerk kissed her on the other would they have done that if she were a middleaged man amanda doubted it but maria kept on smiling so she didnt say anything then the brandnew freedwoman kissed her and whispered thank you thank you oh thank you in her ear its all right im glad to do it amanda answered for about half a minute she felt really proud of herself then she thought of all the slaves in polisso in the vast empire of agrippan rome she couldnt free and that didnt count the slaves in lietuva and persia and the gunpowder empires farther east rome wasnt built in a day slavery wouldnt fall apart in a day either too bad she thought three raps on the door it could have been anybody it could have been a neighbor asking to borrow a cup of olive oil sugar here was uncommon and expensivemore a medicine than anything else it could have been but jeremy didnt think it was he ran for the door as if shot from a gun he got there half a step ahead of his sister they grinned at each other jeremy took the bar off the door amanda unlatched it there in front of the house stood mom and dad the next couple of minutes were confused everybody was hugging and kissing everybody else passersby stopped and watched and called out comments instead of ignoring them the way they would have in the home timeline its so good to see you everyone kept saying over and over why dont you come on in jeremy suggested at last good idea mom said jeremy and amanda both kept looking at her if they hadnt heard they wouldnt have known shed had her appendix out shed had plenty of time to get better this town took a beating didnt it dad said as jeremy closed the door behind them its in worse shape than i thought it would be like i told you the lietuvans broke in once jeremy answered the garrison managed to drive them out again he still didnt say anything about stabbing the lietuvan soldier he knew he wouldnt forget it but wished he could mom and dad walked out into the courtyard dad clicked his tongue between his teeth when he saw the places where the kitchen roof had been repaired the new tiles were a brighter red than those that had stood out in the sun for a while you were lucky he said jeremy nodded amanda went into the kitchen she came out carrying a tray i knew you were coming so i baked a cake she said it was of course a honey cakehoney did duty for sugar here most of the time along with it the tray held a jar of wine and four cups everyone poured out a small libation the cake was sweet the wine was sweeter having the family together again was sweetest of all how long till we can go home jeremy asked like amanda and his parents he was still speaking neolatin voices carried no point in rousing suspicion our replacements left carnuto a couple of days after us mom answered which told him what he needed to know and didnt tell the neighbors anything they didnt need to know the accounts are in good shape jeremy said we had to collect in silver not grain for a while you know about that dad and mom both nodded dad said you did what you had to do no one will hold that against you sooner or later well turn the silver back into grain amanda stirred i used some of the silver to buy marias freedom i liked her before but we got to be really good friends during the siege the people we all work for will probably bill us on account of it jeremy thought the same thing he hadnt said anything to amanda about it because he understood why shed done what shed done even so he doubted crosstime traffics accounting computers would but dad just shrugged mom smiled neither one seemed the least bit upset dad said dont worry about it sweetheart youre not the first person to do something like that and you wont be the last really amanda sounded amazed when we train to go out into the alternates they tell us and tell us not to have anything to do with freeing slaves they say were not supposed to mess with slavery at all they tell you that to keep you from getting into trouble dad answered but you didnt get into trouble here you did everything by the book mom added besides a lot of the people who teach those training courses have never been out in the alternates themselves saying never do this is a lot easier when youve never had to worry about doing it yourself once youve gone out and seen some of the things people do in the alternates a lot of the time you do want to change it you cant help yourself its ugly dad said what exactly are you saying jeremy asked are you saying we shouldnt pay any attention to what they tell us in the training sessions why do we have them in that case he liked authority no better than anyone else his age if the stuff they fed him was pointless he didnt want to have to go through it no im not saying that you do have to pay attention dad answered but what you run into in the real worldin the real alternatesisnt just the same as what they tell you about in training when you get out on your own you have to use your own judgment amanda did that were not mad at her were proud of her amanda looked so smug jeremy wanted to hit her he didnt like her getting praised when he didnt she probably didnt like him getting praised when she didnt that wasnt his worry though that was hers then mom said were proud of both of you as a matter of fact it sounds like you did a great job here youre not supposed to be on your own yet youre especially not supposed to be on your own in the middle of a war dads chuckle had kind of a nasty edge the locals probably figured you bashed out our brains and buried us in the cellar thats not funny amanda stopped acting smug her voice went shrill they did they sure did jeremy agreed if theyd been any more suspicious they would have tried digging down there that wouldnt have been so good they would have found all the grain we were storing and they might have found the concrete over the subbasement he spoke quietly so only the people in the courtyard could hear they couldnt get through it amanda said no but they sure would have wondered why it was there jeremy said locals arent supposed to wonder about us at all hed learned that in a training session too hed never thought to doubt it either it seemed too obvious to need doubting by then dads grin had fallen from his face he poured himself another cup of wine i thought i was joking he said nope jeremy shook his head they do wonder about us we sell things nobody else has we sell for grain not silver they think thats weird too i dont know what we can do about it move out of polisso maybe and start up again somewhere a long ways off that would buy some time less than you think dad said news doesnt move fast here but they keep records they keep records like you wouldnt believe in fact theres bound to be a file on us back in rome nobodys ever come out here to ask question so they cant think were real important but if we showed up in spain or britain instead of polisso news of that would get back to rome too and a clerk whod seen the one file would also see the other one hed wonder why we disappeared here and set up shop there and somebody would start asking questions then or am i wrong jeremy thought it over he didnt have to think very long hed already had his own runins with the bureaucracy of agrippan rome no youre right i hope we dont have to pull out of here and start over on some other alternate that looks a lot like this one that would be a nuisance dad agreed i wouldnt want to have to say weve lost our grip on agrippan rome jeremy and amanda both made horrible faces dad grinned at them he had no shamehe was proud when he did something like that still grinning he went on were not the ones who make choices like that anyway one good thing amanda said even if the locals here found out were from crosstime they couldnt do anything about it as long as we could jump into a transposition chamber wed be safe true enough here mom said but there are alternates where they have the technology to go crosstime themselves if they ever get the idea some of those arent nice worlds at all crosstime traffic has to be real careful in places like that it might be better if we didnt go to those places ourselves jeremy said then we couldnt give ourselves away it might but it might not too dad said if they found out how to build transposition chambers on their own and we didnt know till we bumped into them on some alternate where we were both working well that wouldnt be so good either so we stay and we watch and we try to be careful and we worry sometimesa lot of the timethere are no clear answers only hard choices jeremy thought about that too it reminded him reminded him uncomfortablyof his own worries after he and amanda got stuck here he said things dont seem as blackandwhite to you as they do to me do they dad and mom looked at each other they both started laughing at the same time jeremy started to get mad dad saw that too he held up a hand no offense he said honest none it makes us feel good that youre growing up it really does its just that you dont know how right you are mom broke in you sure dont dad said thats what youll do between now and when youre as old as we are one of the things youll do anyway youll find out how right you are the older you get the more complicated things look mom said thats not because youll get smarter youll just get more experience you wont get more ram dad added but youll have a lot more programs and a lot more files on your hard disk that you can use and read not all of dads comparisons made sense to jeremy that one did he said what do we do if somebody from a nasty alternate figures out how to go crosstime mom and dad looked at each other again they didnt laugh this time slowly dad said i dont know i dont think anybody else knows either what do you think we ought to do a lot depends on when we find out theyre doing it amanda said while jeremy was still chewing on it we can do things if we catch them quick that we cant if they have a chance to spread out she was right jeremy could see as much he said i just hope it doesnt happen thats all well so do i dad said but it probably will its almost bound to sooner or later he raised his winecup in a toast heres hoping its later they all drank to that two days later the robinson family came into polisso as jeremy and his kin had before them they walked in through the western gate as far as anyone here was concerned they came from carnuto they were all small and dark for looks and size they fit in better than the solters family did they too had a boy and a girl the boy michael was thirteen or fourteen the girls name was stephanie she was jeremys age and pretty enough almost to make him sorry he was leaving that was all the more true because she seemed very impressed about what he and amanda had gone through during the siege amanda noticed jeremy noticing stephanie she got him aside and asked well are you going to tell her all about what a hero you were no he shook his head violently that hadnt even crossed his mind he said i never even want to think about that again let alone brag about it his sister eyed him after a few seconds she nodded he felt oddly relieved he might have just passed a test and an important one amanda said all right she started to turn away then seemed to decide that wasnt enough better than all right in fact i wouldnt like it if you got all bloodthirsty on me you dont need to worry about that jeremy promised i saw that guy get shot when i was up on the wall at the start of the siege it wasnt movie blood or videogame blood it was real i could smell it he shuddered and it could have been me as easy as him nothing but dumb luck one way or the other anybody who goes on about how glorious war is should have been there you know what i mean oh yes amanda nodded again i know just what you mean i was there when that cannonball came down by the fountain that could have been me too and you could see the blood in the cracks between the cobblestones for days afterwards maybe you still can if you get down on your hands and knees and look close mr and mrs robinson were hashing things out with mom and dad they were talking about business and about exactly how big a snoop the city prefect was it all mattered if you were going to do business in polisso somehow though to jeremy it seemed to be missing the real point and what is the real point if youre so smart he asked himself after a little while he came up with an answer i suppose the real point is that life is cheap here and youll get in trouble if you forget it he wondered if he should have gone to the beast shows and the gladiator games at the amphitheater they would have made him sick but they would have taught him the lesson he needed to know he also wondered if he ought to tell michael and stephanie robinson to go he shook his head they wouldnt go on his sayso the locals blood sports would gross them out just as they did with him one way or another the robinsons would have to find out for themselves and seeing what polisso was like they probably would in neolatin stephanie was saying it smells so bad now that were in a town again she was careful about protecting the secret michael made gagging noises to show how he thought polisso smelled jeremy hardly noticed the stink any more but he noticed the fresher air when he and his sister and his parents left polisso the next morning the breeze was out of the west so it blew away the city stench as soon as he and his family got outside the wall he looked back in amazement somebody might have sent the air through a washer and dryer he noticed amanda and mom and dad smiling too they walked out toward the transposition chamber in the cave outside of town a long line of cranes flew past overhead bound for a warmer friendlier country jeremy waved to the big longlegged birds he felt the same way no one in sight in either direction the road west from polisso wasnt a busy one the solters family didnt have to wait before they went up the hillside to the trap door even inside the cave jeremy had trouble making himself believe the chamber would really show up but then it appeared on time to the second the door opened in you go the operator said to him it was all routine it wasnt routine to jeremy it never would be again so what though this time everything would work fine and it did
