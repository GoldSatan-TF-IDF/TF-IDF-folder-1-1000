how i spent my summer vacation and every other free minute for five straight years after any number of requests to put all our short stories together in one place the idea began to take on some merit when larry and i looked into the idea we discovered that we had a lot of other short fiction about ten years worth ten years unbelievable as it seemed at the time i found the very first story i ever had published i had sold one story before that but it wasnt published until the following month fantasy book magazine september the story was turnabout which was a tarma and kethry story which is going into another collection for the record the first story i ever sold was for marion zimmer bradleys free amazons of darkover friends of darkover anthology which was published in december of that year the story was a different kind of courage some of these stories are a little grey around the edges but i include them as a kind of object lesson in writing some of the things in them i winced at when i read againi had no idea of how to write a wellviewpointed story for instance and someone should have locked my thesaurus away and not given it back to me for a while and insofar as the march of technology goesthe earliest were written on my very first computer which had no harddrive a whopping four kilobytesthats kilobytes not megabytesof ram and had two single sided single density disk drives i wrote five whole books and many short stories on that machine which did not have a spellcheck function either on the other hand if ewe sea watt effect modern spellcheckers halve on righting perhaps it that was knot a bad thing its just as well if it had it would have taken half a day to spellcheck twenty pages so for those of you who are wailing that you cant possibly try to write because you only have an ancient with a meg harddrive forgive me if i raise a sardonic eyebrow feh i say feh i held down a job as a computer programmer for american airlines during seven of those ten years and every minute that i wasnt working i was writing i gave up hobbies i stopped going to movies i didnt watch television i wrote not less than five hours every day all day on saturday and sunday i wanted to be able to write for a living and the only way to get better at writing is to do it i managed to slow down a bit after being able to quit that job but i still generally write every day not less than ten pages a day and that is the answer to the oftenasked question how do you become a writer you write you write a great deal you give up everything else so that you can concentrate on writing there are many fine books out there the title usually begins with how to write to teach you the mechanics of writing ray bradbury has also written an excellent book on the subject you only learn the soul of writing with practice practice will make you betteror it will convince you that maybe what you really want to do is go into furniture restoration and get your own television show on the learning channel here are the answers to a few more frequently asked questions how do you develop an idea mostly what we do is to look at what we have done in the past and try to do something different as for finding ideas i can only say that finding them is easy they come all the time deciding which ones are worth developing is the difficult part to find an idea you simply never accept that there are absolute answers for anything and as theodore sturgeon said you ask the next question continuously for example one story evolved from seeing a piece of paper blowing across the highway in an uncannily lifelike manner and asking myself what if that was a real living creature disguised as a piece of paper the next questions were why would it be in disguise and what would it be and what would happen if someone found out what it really was do you ever get writers block and what do you do about it when i get stalled on something i do one of two things i either work on another project i always have one book in the outline stage and two in the writing stage and i will also work on short stories at the same time or i discuss the situation with larry working with another personsometimes even simply verbalizing a snagalways gets the book unstuck there is a perfectly good reason for this when you speak about something you actually move it from one side of the brain to the other and often that alone shakes creativity loose how do you do revisions i may revise the ending of the book between outlining and actual writing but that is only because a more logical and satisfying conclusion presents itself i am really not thinking of anything other than that the only other revisions are at the request of the publisher and may vary from none to clarifying minor points or further elaborating a minor point in the case of clarification this amounts to less than words in a book of or more in the case of elaboration this usually amounts to the addition of words to words generally less would you call your books character driven i think that is quite correct my books are characterdriven to me how people react to a given situation is what makes a story interesting history is nothing more than a series of peoples reactions after all and many alternate history stories have been written about what would have happened if the ideathe situationis only half the story what the characters do about it is the other do you base your characters on people you know with very rare exceptions i dont base my characters on anyone i knowthose exceptions are minor ones where ill ask permission to write a friend into a walkon role they do come out of my observation of people in general when did you know you wanted to write i knew i wanted to tell stories from a very early agein fact i told them to the kids i babysat for then wrote them in letters to friends and penpals it was only when i graduated from amateur fiction to being paid for what i wrote that i realized i did have a talent for writingand i had the will to pursue it that was some thirty years later where do you start plotting is usually done with larry and one of the first things we do is determine what the characters will be like then what the major conflict of the book will be then we figure out the minor conflicts the ways that those characters will deal with those conflicts and ways we can make their lives even more complicated the resolution generally comes at that point but not always sometimes it doesnt come to us until we are actually writing the book and we change the way it ended in the outline when did you start reading science fiction i started reading sff when i was about eight or nine as i recall it was the space cat books followed by something called the city under the back steps a kind of antversion of honey i shrunk the kids followed immediately by a leap into andre norton heinlein and my fathers adult sf daybreak ad by norton was one of the first things i read james schmidts agent of vega was another mostly i read norton all the norton i could get my hands on saving my allowance to order them directly from ace little did i guess i would one day be working for andres editor donald a wollheim who were your influences in order of influence andre norton jrr tolkien robert heinlein theodore sturgeon thomas burnett swann anne mccaffrey cj cherryh marion zimmer bradley as for editors i learn something from every editor i have my three main editors elizabeth wollheim melissa singer and jim baen have been incredibly helpful what do you choose to write i write what i would like to read with a caveatafter thirteen years in the marketplace i am beginning to get a feeling for things that will sell so obviously i do tailor what i would like to write to the marketplace i never wrote intentionally for any particular audience but i seem to have hit on a number of things that are archetypal in nature which may account for the appeal the other possibility is that i tend to write about people who are misunderstood outsiders people who read tend to think of themselves that way particularly sff readers so they can identify with the characters do you answer fanmail when possible we do we always read it when mail comes without a selfaddressed stamped envelope for a reply we assume the writer doesnt want a reply it is only courteous not to waste the time of someone you supposedly like by including a selfaddressed stamped envelope if you want an answer we dont answer abusive mail but it does get filed in a special file for future reference we return manuscripts unread after some trouble marion zimmer bradley had with a fanwriter our agent has advised both of us that we cant read unsolicited manuscripts anymore this is an awful pity but life is complicated enough without going out and finding ways to add trouble how do you work with a collaborator working with collaborators depends on the collaborator if possible we work on the outline together until were both happy with it then one of us starts passes it off to the other when she gets stuck and gets it passed back under the same circumstances it goes incredibly fast that way and it is the way larry and i always work even though he is not always on the cover as a cowriter have you ever encountered any censorship i havent encountered any censorship at the publishereditor level on any of my books i have heard rumors of fundamentalist groups causing problems with the herald mage series because of the gay characters but i have never had any of those rumors substantiated there are always going to be people who have trouble with characters who dont fit their narrow ideas of what is appropriate i have perfectly good advice for them dont read the books nobody is forcing you to march into the bookstore and buy it actually i have been considering borrowing the disclaimer from the game stalking the night fantastic by richard tucholkaif anything in this book offends you please feel free to buy and burn as many copies as you like volume discounts are available whats larry like ill let him answer for himself misty and i met on a television interview just before a convention in mississippi we were both guests of honor there by the end of that weekend we had plotted our first book together ties never binding which later became winds of fate and have been together ever since i am an alumnus of the north carolina school of the arts and while there i made some fairly respectable inroads into the world of fine arts however my basic trouble with galleries was that regardless of the content of my work it would only reach that segment of the population that went to galleries i was preaching to the converted couple that distressing truth with an irrepressible irreverence and my days of wearing black and being morose for my art were limited i needed giggles i needed money and i needed to accomplish something i had been an sf and fantasy fan for years when i saw the other people who were also fans i knew that here was a place to be welcomed serve an audience and make a difference through entertainment ever since it has been a matter of matching the message to the medium some lend themselves well to text others to paintings others to satire or dialogues i have been introduced to folks as the other half of mercedes lackey and theres a bit to that ive been working with misty on prose since and including magics price which i coplotted and alphaedited incidentally it was accepted by daw exactly as it is printed there were no revisions or mispe misspel uhm words spelled wrong since then ive worked on them all with heavier cowriting on the subsequent trilogies im not about to steal any of mistys thunder thoughshe is a mighty fine writer without me our styles skills and areas of knowledge happen to complement each others i also get a kick out of hearing oldfogy writers grousing about female fantasy writers when ive been one for years now the black gryphon was about my fourth or fifth cowritten book silently with misty but was one of the first with a cover credit go figure my future is inextricably linked to misty and i would want it no other way high flight arts and letters is flying strongly and the best is yet to come you may have noticed that there is not a lot of really personal information in all of this and thats on purpose larry and i tend to be very private and frankly we find all the selfaggrandizing highly personal i love this and i hate that in some authors notes kind of distasteful weve included some historical notes on the various stories and while i will be the last person to claim im not opinionated see the note to last rights for instance just because i think something that doesnt mean you should go out read and experience everything you can and form your own opinions dont get life secondhand from a curmudgeon like me aliens ate my pickup i thought it might be fun to start this off on a lighter note this is an entirely new story never before seen and was supposed to be in esther friesners anthology alien pregnant by elvis hey dont blame me this is the same lady who brought you the title of chicks in chainmail by another company for some reason it never got printed and none of us understand why must have dropped into the same black hole that eats alternate socks and the pair of scissors youre looking for at the time the anthology was put together anyway here it is now any resemblance to the writer is purely coincidental yesm im serious aliens ate my pickup only it werent really aliens jest one even though it was my chevy fourton and he was a little bitty feller not like some japanese giant thing an he didnt really eat it he just kinda chewed it up a little look you can see the teethmarks on the bumper here an oh start at the beginin well all right i guess my name its jed jed pryor i was born an raised on this farm outsida claremore been here

deals with the devil edited by mike resnick larry and i live near tulsa oklahoma home of oral roberts university and widely termed the buckle of the bible belt we have more televangelists per square mile here in this part of the country than i really care to think about maybe somebody out there will figure out how to spray for them lester parker checked the lock on the door of his cheap motel room for the fifth time once again it held he checked the drapes where he had clothespinned them together there were no cracks or gaps he couldnt afford to be careless couldnt possibly be too careful if anyone from any of the local churches saw him hed picked this motel because he knew it frequented it when he had personal business and knew that for an extra ten bucks left on the bed the room would be cleaned completely with no awkward questions asked like was that blood on the carpet or why was there black candlewax on the bureau although he hadnt checked in under his own name he couldnt afford awkward questions the next time he returned they knew his face even if they didnt know his name unless of course this actually worked then it wouldnt matter such little irregularities would be taken care of his hands trembled with excitement as he opened his briefcase on the bed and removed the two sets of papers from it one set was handwritten in fading pen on yellowed paper torn from an old spiralbound notebook these pages were encased in plastic pageprotectors to preserve them the other was a brandnew contract carefully typed and carefully checked he had obtainedbeen giventhe first set of papers less than a week ago here in this very motel hed just completed a little soulsearching with honey butter one of the strippers down at lady gs and a girl hed counseled plenty of times before hed been making sure that he had left nothing incriminating behindit had become habitwhen there was a knock on the door reflexively hed opened it only realizing when he had it partly open just where he was and that it could have been the cops but it hadnt been it was one of honeys coworkers with whom he also had an arrangement she knew who and what he really was and she could be counted on to keep her mouth shut little star delite looked at him from under her fringe of thick coarse peroxideblonde hair a look of absolute panic on her face her heavily madeup eyes blank with fear without a word she had seized his hand and dragged him into the room next door on the bed gasping in pain and clutching his chest was a man he recognized anyone who watched religious broadcasting would have recognized that usedcarsalesman profile brother lee willford a fellow preacher but a man who was to lester what a whale is to a sardine brother lee was a televangelist with his own studio his own tv shows and a take of easily a quarter million a month lester had known that brother lee had come to town for a televised revival of course that was why he himself had taken the night off no one would be coming to his little storefront church as long as brother lee was in town filling the football stadium with his followers he had not expected to see the preacher herealthough he wasnt particularly surprised to see him with star she had a weakness for men of the cloth and practically begged to be ministered to besides rumor said that brother lee had a weakness for blonds lester had taken in the situation in a glance and acted accordingly he knew enough to recognize a heart attack when he saw one and he had also known what would happen if brother lee was taken to a hospital from this particular motel people would put two and two togetherand come up with an answer that would leave brother lee in the same shape as jim bakker ruined and disgraced and certainly not fluid enough to pay blackmail first things first brother lees wallet had been lying on the stand beside the bed lester grabbed it pulled some bills out of it and shoved them at star the little blond grabbed them and fled without a word now one complication had been dealt with star wouldnt say anything to anyone a hooker whose clients died didnt get much business then he had helped brother lee back into his pants shoved the wallet into his coatpocket a small part of his mind writhing with envy to see that the suit was armani and the fabric was silk and draped the coat over brother lees shoulders he could not be found here he had to be found somewhere neutral and safe there were car keys on the nightstand too lester had assumed they were for the vehicle outside he had hoped there was a carphone in it but even if there hadnt been he could still have worked something out but there had been a phone a portable lester dialed the emergency number returned to the motel room got brother lee into the car and got the car down into the street moments before the ambulance arrived there was after all no harm in being rescued from the streetonly in being taken from a motel room in a state of undress he had followed the ambulance in brother lees car and claiming to be a relative set himself up in the waiting room the reporters came before the doctors did he had told them a carefully constructed but simple story that he had met brother lee just that day that the great man had offered his advice and help out of the kindness of his heart and that they had been driving to lesters little storefront church when brother lee began complaining of chest pains and then had collapsed smiling modestly lester credited the lord with helping him get the car safely to the side of the road hed also spewed buckets of buzzwords about god calling the man home and how abundant life was to believers the reporters accepted the story without a qualm he had made certain that brother lee found out exactly what he had told the reporters he bided his time checking with the hospital twice a day until lee was receiving visitors finally brother lee asked to see him he had gone up to the private room to be greeted effusively and thanked for his quick thinking lester had expected more than thanks however he was already framing his discreet demand when brother lee startled him by offering to give him his hearts desire im going to give you the secret of my success the preacher had said in a confidential whisper i used to be a man of god now i just run a nice scam you just watch that spot there lester had been skeptical expecting some kind of stunt but when the quiet darkly handsome man in the blue business suit appeared in a ring of fire at the foot of brother lees hospital bed he had nearly had a heartattack himself it wasnt until brother lee introduced thebeingas my colleague mister lightman that lester began to understand what was going on brother lee had made a compact with the devil the number one saver of souls on the airwaves was dealing with the unholy adversary and yetit made sense how else could brother lees career have skyrocketed the way it had without some kind of supernatural help lester had assumed it was because of mafia connections or even help fromhimbut it had never occurred to him that brother lee had gone over to the other side for aid and brother lee and his colleague had made it very clear to lester that such aid was available to him as well still there was such a thing as hightech trickery but mr lightman was ready for that suspicion i will give you three requests the creature said they must be smallbut they should be things that would have no chance of occurring otherwise he had smiled and when lester had a glimpse of those strange savagely pointed teeth he had not thought trickery he had shuddered when all three of those requests have been fulfilled you may call upon me for a more complete contract if you are convinced lester had nodded and had made his requests first that the transmission of his car which he had already had inspected and knew was about to go be healed lightman had agreed to that one readily enough second that his rather tiresome wife should be removed permanently from his life lightman had frowned no deaths he had said that is not within the scope of a small request lester had shrugged just get her out you can make me look stupid he said just make me sympathetic lightman agreed and third that the sum of ten thousand two hundred and fifty three dollars end up in lesters bank account why that sum lester had no idea it was picked arbitrarily and lightman agreed to that as well he had vanished the same way he had arrived in a ring of fire that left no marks on the hospital linoleum that was when brother lee had given him the battered pages encased in plastic sleeves this is yours now brother lee had said when you want lightman to bring you a contract you follow these directions he grimaced a little i know theyre kind of unpleasant but lightman says they prove that you are sincere lester had snorted at the idea of the devil relying on sincerity but he had taken the sheets anyway and had returned to his car to wait out the fulfillment of the requests the very first thing that he noticed was that the transmission which had been grinding and becoming harder to shift was now as smooth as if it was brand new now it might have been possible for lightman to know that lesters tranny was about to gocertainly it was no secret down at the garagebut for him to have gotten a mechanic and a new transmission into the parking lot at the hospital performed the switch and gotten out before lester came down from the hospitalwell that was practically impossible but there were other explanations the men at the garage might have been lying they might have doctored his transmission the last time he was in to make him think it needed work that it didnt something could have been fixed with he didnt know a turn of a screw then two days later he came home to find a processserver waiting for him the papers were faxed from his wife who was filing for divorce in mexico he found out from a neighbor that she had left that morning with no explanations he found out from a sniggering friend that she had run off with a male stripper as he had himself specified she was gone he had been made to look stupid but among his followers he also was garnering sympathy for having been chained to that kind of woman for so long she had cleaned out the savings account but had left the checking account alone but that left him in some very dire straits there were bills to pay and her secretarial job had been the steady income in the household with that gonewell he was going to need that ten grand if it came through late that wednesday night as he was driving back from the storefront church and contemplating a collection of less than twenty dollars the back of an armored car in front of him had popped open and a bag had fallen out the armored car rolled on the door swinging shut again under its own momentum as the car turned a corner there was no one else on the street no witnesses either walking or driving by he stopped and picked up the bag it was full of money old worn bills of varying denominations exactly the kind of bills people put into the collection plate at a church there were several thousand bills in the bag they totaled exactly ten thousand two hundred and fifty three dollars not a copper penny more he drove straight to the bank and deposited it all in his savings account then he drove straight home took out the papers brother lee had given him and began to read before he was finished his mind was made up the ritual called for some nasty thingsnot impossible to obtain or perform but unpleasant for a squeamish man to handle and do dancing around in the nude was embarrassing even if there was no one there to see him and although he was certain that this motel room had seen worse perversions than the ones he was performing he felt indescribably filthy when he was through still if this really worked it would be worth it all if now how could you possibly doubt me asked a genteel voice from behind him lester jumped a foot and whirled mr lightman sat comfortably at his ease in the uncomfortable green plastic chair beneath the swaglamp at the window lester thought absently that only a demonic fiend could have been comfortable in that torturedevice disguised as a chair he was flushing red with acute shame and terribly aware of his own physical inadequacies mr lightman cocked his head to one side and frowned shame he said i think not well have none of that here he gesturednot with his index finger but with the second suddenly lesters shame vanished as if the emotion had been surgically removed and as he looked down bemusedly at himself he realized that his physical endowments had grown to remarkable adequacy a taste of things to come lightman said easily you must be a perfect specimen you know people trust those who are handsome those who are sexy think how many criminals are convicted who are plain or even uglyand how few who are handsome people want to believe in the beautiful they want to believe in the powerful above all they want to believe lester nodded and lowered himself down onto the scratchy bedspread as you can see im ready to deal he told the fiend calmly so i do see lightman snapped his fingers and the neatlytyped pages of lesters contract appeared in his hand he leafed through them his mouth pursed yes he murmured and interesting then he looked up you seem to have thought this through very carefully brother lee was not quite sothorough the late brother lee lester nodded then took in the rest of the sentence thelate lightman nodded his contract ran out the fiend said simply perhaps he had been planning to gain some extra years by bringing you into the flock but he had not written any such provision into his contractand a bargain is a bargain after all the usual limit for a contract is seven years i rarely make exceptions to that rule lester thought back frantically and could recall no such provision in his own contract but then he calmed himself with the remembrance of his loophole the very worst that would happen would be that he would live a fabulous life and then die that prospect no longer held such terror for him with the hard evidence of an afterlife before him with the devil so real god was just as real right that beautiful loophole so long as he repented merciful god would forgive his sins the adversary would not have him and he would repent most truly and sincerely every sin he committed as soon as he committed them it was all there in the bible in unambiguous terms if you repented you were forgiven that was the mistake everyone else who made these bargains seemed to make they waited until the last minute and before they could repent wham he wouldnt be so stupid but mr lightman seemed blithely unconcerned by any of this id like to make a slight change in this contract if i might he said instead since brother lees empire is going begging i would like to install you in his place conservation of effort dont you know and it will make his flock so much more comfortable lester nodded cautiously the fiend waved his hand and the change appeared in fiery letters that glowed for a moment and now for my articles lightman handed the contract back and there was an additional page among the rest he scanned them carefully including all the fine print he had expected trouble there but to his surprise it seemed to be mostly verses from the bible itself including the lords prayer with commentaries it looked in fact like a page from a biblestudies course he looked up from his perusal to see lightman gazing at him sardonically what have you never heard that the devil can quote scripture the fiend chuckled its simply the usual stuff so that you know that i know all the things people usually count on for loopholes that gave him pause for a moment but he dismissed his doubts im ready to sign he said firmly lightman nodded and handed him a pen filled with thick red fluid he doubted it was ink he was the most popular televangelist ever to grace the home screen surpassing brother lees popularity and eclipsing it his message was a simple one although he never phrased it bluntly buy your way into heaven and into heaven on earth send lester parker money and lester will not only see that god puts a reserved placard on your seat in the heavenly choir hell see to it that god makes your life on earth a comfortable and happy one he told people what they wanted to hear no uncomfortable truths and there were always plenty of letters he could show which told stories of how the loyal sheep of his flock had found jesus peace of mind and material prosperity as soon as they sent lester their check of course some of those same people would have been happy to ascribe a miraculous reversal of fortune to their personal psychic if theyd called the psychic hotline number instead of lesters above all else people wanted to believewasnt that what both sides said he had a computerized answering service for all his mail no dumping letters into the trash at the bank for him no sir he had a fanatically loyal bunch of parttime housewives read the things enter the letters key words into the computer and have an answer full of homey sensible advice and religious homilies tailored to the individual run up by the machine in about the time it took to enter the address every letter came out a little different every letter sounded like one of his sermons every letter looked like a personal answer from lester the computer was a wonderful thing they could have gotten the same advice from dear abbyin fact a good part of the advice tendered was gleaned from the back issues of dear abbys compiled columns but abby didnt claim to speak for god and lester did he also preached another sort of comfortthat hatred was no sin it was no accident that his viewers were nearly one hundred percent white white people had money and black yellow and red ones didnt or if they did they generally werent going to part with it thats what his daddy had taught him he sprinkled his sermons with bible quotations proving that it was no sin to hate unbelieversor to act on that hatred after all those people had placed themselves beyond the pale of gods forgiveness they had not and would not repent they should be purged from the body of mankind if thine eye offends thee pluck it out he stormed and his legions of followers went out looking for offending eyes their own blind to mirrors most of his prosperity he owed to his own cleverness but there were times when he needed that little helping handjust as he had thought he might like the time when his network of informers let him know that newsweek had found his exwife and she was going to spill some embarrassing things about him or that one of his many exmistresses was going to write a tellall biography or that the irs was planning an audit all he had to do was whisper lightmans name and his request and by midnight it was taken care of by twelveohone he was truly sincerely repenting that he had ordered his wifes murderor whatever other little thing he had requested truly sincerely and deeply confessing himself to god and showing that repentance in concrete sacrifices of tears and cash from the beginning he had told himself that he was acting on gods behalf spitting in the face of satan by tricking the great trickster he told himself every time he prayed that he was working for god it was a foolproof scheme and the seven years flew by during the last year he was cautious but resigned he knew that lightman would arrange for his death so there was no point in trying to avoid it and indeed on the very instant of the seventhyear anniversary of the contract he had a heart attack as he prayed before his videocongregation just like brother lee lester stood beside the body in the expensive hospital bed and stared down at it the monitors were mostly flatlined the only ones showing any activity were those reporting functions that had been taken over by machines strange he thought the man in the bed looked so healthy ah lester youre right on time lightman said genially stepping around from behind a curtain lester shrugged is there any reason why i shouldnt be he asked just as genially he could afford to be genial after all he wasnt going to be leaving with lightman what no screaming no crying no begging lightman seemed genuinely surprised normally your kind are the worst lester only chuckled why should i be worried he replied you only think you have me but i repented of every single one of those crimes i asked you to commit every death every blackmail scheme every disgracei even repented the small things repented every time i accepted someones social security checkevery time i arranged a specialeffects miracle or convinced someone to leave me everything in their will but he stopped as lightman began laughing oh yes you did lightman told him merrily and my opponent has forgiven you for those sins but you didnt read the fine print he handed lester the copy of his contract and pointed to the last page read the commentary dear boy carefully this time the words leapt off the page at him sins repented will be forgiven by the opposition but forgiveness does not imply repayment all sins committed by the party of the first part must be repaid to the party of the second part regardless of whether or not forgiveness has been obtained these are the sins youll be repaying my boy lightman said pleasantly waving his hand a stack of computer forms as tall as lester appeared beside him but that is not why i am truly pleased to have you among us another stack of computer forms appeared impossibly high reaching up as far as lester could see millions of them this stack lightman placed his hand on the first pile represents all the sins you committed directly but this pile represents all those you encouraged others to commit with your doctrine of salvation through donation and hatethyneighbor and those dear boy you did not repent of you are a credit to our side and we will be so happy to have you with us the floor opened up and lightman stood in midair learn to enjoy it dear lester he chuckled as the demons drew the false prophet down among them youll reach your depth soon enough lightman smiled as the mountain of sin forms buried lester parker so i believe last rights mercedes lackey and larry dixon larry and i are members of the north american falconry association and federally licensed raptor bird of prey rehabilitators we have to be pragmatic and scientificwhen you take care of predatory birds they eat meat and when you teach them to hunt so that they can be released they have to learn how to make kills on their own there is no shortcut for that process and no way to fake making a kill needless to say we do not do politically correct although we have not yet suffered harassment at the hands of people with way too much spare time on their hands that some other rehabbers and fellow falconers have nevertheless weve gotten very tired of seeing people who have never lived next to a field of cattle claim that cows are gentle harmless and intelligentor try to raise their dogs on a vegetarian diet so when mike resnick asked us for a story for dinosaur fantastic we knew immediately what we were going to write for him two men and a woman huddled in the wet bushes surrounding the gentech engineering facility in los lobos california across the darkened expanse of expensive gentech grasite lay their goal the gentech large animal development project it was grasite not grass this first product of gentechs researches was a plant that was droughtresistant seldom needed mowing and remained green even when dry perfect for southern california sadly it also attracted grasshoppers who seemed to be fooled by its verdant appearance they would remain on a grasite lawn hordes of them trying valiantly to extract nourishment from something the texture and consistency of astroturf all during the worst droughts anyone holding a garden party in hollywood had better plan on scheduling crittervac to come in and sweep the premises clean or his guests would find every step they took crunching into a dozen insects lending the soiree all the elegance of the wrath of moses but grasite was not the target tonight these three had no argument with genetailored plantlife in fact they strongly supported many of gentechs productsrealskin which reacted to allergens and irritants exactly the way human skin did or steakntaters a tuber with the consistency and taste of a cross between beef and baked potato but all three of them were outraged by this assault upon helpless animals that gentech was perpetrating in their new development lab mary lang howard emory and ken jacobs were selfstyled guerrillas in defense of helpless beasties everywhere charter members of persons in defense of animobeings pida for short there was nothing they would not do to secure the rights of exploited and abused animals this year alone they personally had already chalked up the release of several hundred prisonerrats from a lab in lisle illinois it was too bad about the mutated bubonic plague spreading through chicago afterwards but as ken said people had choices the rats didnt tonight they were after bigger game dinosaurians patent pending real living breathing dinosaursslated to become pozs prisoners of zoos the world over and all because some corporate mba on the board of the san diego zoo had seen the attendance numbers soar when the dunn traveling animated dinosaur exhibit had been booked there for a month he had put that together with the discovery that common chickens and other creatures could be regressed to their saurian ancestorsthe pioneering work had already been done on the eohippus and aurochsand had seen a goldmine waiting for both the zoos and gentech how could they do this to me mary whined they had such a promising record i was going to ask them for a corporate donation and nowthis money ken hissed theyre all moneygrubbing bastards who dont care if they sell poor animals into a life of penal servitude just wait next thing youll be seeing is dinoburgers howard winced and pulled the collar of his unbleached cotton jacket higher so what have we got he asked whats the plan ken consulted the layout of the facility and the outdoor pens it had been ridiculously easy to get them for all the furor over the dinosaurians there was remarkably little security on this facility only signs hundreds of them warning of dangerous animals ridiculous as if members of pida would be taken in by such blatant nonsense there was no such thing as a dangerous animal only an animal forced to act outside of its peaceful nature there are only three dinoanimopersons at the moment and if we can release all three of them it will represent such a huge loss to gentech that i doubt theyll ever want to create more theres a brontosaurian here he pointed at a tiny pen on the far northern corner of the map its inside a special pen with heavyduty electric fences and alarms around it so that will be your target howard youre the alarms expert howard looked over kens shoulder and winced again that pen isnt even big enough for a horse to move around in he exclaimed this is inhuman its veal calves all over again ken tilted the map towards mary theres something here called a dinonychus thats supposed to be going to the san diego zoo it looks like theyve put it in some kind of a bare corral you worked with turning loose the rodeo horses and bulls last year so you take this one mary mary lang nodded and tried not to show her relief the corral didnt look too difficult to get into and from the plans all shed have to do would be to open the corral gate and the animal would run for freedom very active was the note photocopied along with the map that was fine the rodeo horses hadnt wanted to leave their pens and it had taken forever to get them to move and shed gotten horsecrap all over her expensive synthetic suede pants that leaves the tricerotops in the big pasture to me ken folded the map once they had all memorized the way in meet you here in an hour those poor exploited victims of corporate humanocentrism are already halfway to freedom well show the corporate fat cats that they cant live off the misery of tortured helpless animals howard had never seen so many alarms and electric shock devices in his life he thought at first that they were meant to keep people outbut all the detectors pointed inward not outward so they had all been intended to keep this pathetic brontosaurian trapped inside his little box howards blood pressure rose by at least ten points when he saw the victim they were keeping it inside a bare concrete pen with no educational toys nothing to look at no variation in its environment at all it looked like the way they used to pen killer elephants in the bad old days the only difference was that this brontosaurian wasnt chained by one ankle there was barely enough room for the creature to turn around no room at all for it to lie down there was nothing else in the pen but a huge pile of green vegetation at one end and an equally large pile of droppings at the other good god he thought appalled dont they even clean the cage as he watched the brontosaurian dropped its tiny head curved its long flexible neck and helped itself to a mouthful of greenery as the head rose jaws chewing placidly another barrel of droppings added itself to the pile from the other end of the beast the brontosaurian seemed to be perfect for making fertilizer if nothing else well soon he would be fertilizing the acreage of the los lobos national park free and happy and the memory of this dank cramped prison would be a thing of the past howard disabled the last of the alarms and shock fences pulled open the gates and stepped aside proudly waiting for the magnificent creature to take its first steps into freedom the magnificent creature dropped its head curved its neck and helped itself to another mouthful of greenery as the head rose jaws chewing placidly it took no note of the open gates just past its nose come on big boy howard shouted waving at it it ignored him he dared to venture into the pen it continued to ignore him periodically it would take another mouthful and drop a pile but except for that it could just as well have been one of the mechanical dinosaurs it was supposed to replace howard spent the next half hour trying with diminishing patience to get the brontosaurian to leave it didnt even look at him or the open door or anything at all except the pile of juicy banana leaves and green hay in front of it finally howard couldnt take it any longer his bloodpressure rising he seized the electric cattle prod on the back wall and let the stupid beast have a good one right in the backside as soon as he jolted the poor thing his conscience struck him a blow that was nearly as hard he dropped the prod as if it had shocked him and wrapped his arms around the beasts huge leg babbling apologies approximately one minute later while howard was still crying into the leathery skin of the brontos leg it noticed that it had been stung irritating but irritation was easy to avoid it shifted its weight as it had been taught and stepped a single pace sideways its left hind foot met a little resistance and something made a shrieking soundbut there had been something shrieking for some time and it ignored the sound as it had all the rest after all the food was still here presently it finished the pile of food before it and waited patiently there was a buzzing noise and a hole opened in the wall a little to its right that was the signal to shift around which it did a new load of fresh vegetation dropped down with a rattle and a dull thud as the automatic cleaning system flushed the pile of droppings and the rather flat mortal remains of her savior howard down into the sewage system mary approached the corral carefully on the alert for guards and prepared to act like a stupid lost bimbo if she were sighted but there were no guards only a high metal fence of welded slats centered with a similar gate there was something stirring restlessly inside the corral she couldnt see what it was for the slats were set too closely together but as she neared the gate she heard it pacing back and forth in a way that made her heart ache poor thingit needed to run loose how could these monsters keep a wild noble creature like this penned up in such an unnaturally barren environment there were alarms on the gate and on the fence she didnt have howards expertise in dealing with such things but these were easy even a child could have taken them offline as she worked she talked to the poor beast trapped on the other side of the gate and it paused in its pacing at the sound of her voice hang in there baby she crooned to it theres a whole big national park on the other side of the lab fenceas soon as we get you loose well take that big brontosaurian through it and that will leave a hole big enough for a hundred animopersons to run through then youll be free youll be able to play in the sunshine and roll in the grasseat all the flowers you wantwell make sure they never catch you dont you worry the beast drew nearer until she felt the warmth of its breath on her coat sleeve as she worked it snuffled a little and she wrinkled her nose at the smell poor thing what were they feeding it anyway didnt they ever give it a chance to bathe her resentment grew as it sniffed at the gap between the metal slats why it was lonely the poor thing was as lonely as some of those rodeo horses had been didnt anyone ever come to pet and play with it finally she disabled the last of the alarms the creature inside the corral seemed to sense her excitement and anticipation as she worked at the lock on the gate she heard it shifting its weight from foot to foot in a kind of dance that reminded her of her pet parakeet when he wanted out of his cage before shed grown wiser and freed it into the abundant outdoors dont worry little fellow she crooned at it ill have you out of here in no time with a feeling of complete triumph she popped the lock flipped open the hasp on the gate and swung it wide eager for the first sight of her newly freed friend the first thing she saw was a hugeheaded lizard about six feet tall that stood on two legs balancing itself with its tail it was poised to leap through the gate the last thing she saw was a grinning mouth like a beartrap full of sharp carnivorous teeth closing over her head hank threw his rope over a chair in the employee lounge and sank into the one next to it feeling sweat cool all over his body he pulled his hat down over his eyes this had not been the most disastrous morning of his life but it was right up there somehow the dino had gotten into gerties penand whoever had left the gate open last night was going to catch hell the little carnivore couldnt hurt the bronto but he had already eaten all the dobermans that were supposed to be guarding the complex and he was perfectly ready to add a lab tech or lab hand to the menu you couldnt trank the saurians their metabolism was too weird you couldnt drive a dino there wasnt anything he was afraid of the only safe way to handle the little bastard was to get two ropes on him and haul him along a technique hank had learned roping rhinos in africa it had taken him and buford half the morning to get the dino roped and hauled back to his corral theyd had to work on foot since none of the horses would come anywhere near the dino all he needed was one more thing hank someone yelled from the door what dammit hank sayer snapped im tired unless youve got the chowderhead that left dino and gerties pens open they werent left open they were opened last night said the tech his voice betraying both anger and excitement some animalrights yoyos got in last night the security guys found them on one of the tapes and the cleanup crews found what was left of two of them in the pit under gerties pen and just inside dinos doghouse that was more than enough to make hank sit up and push his hat back what the hellhow come the tech sighed these bozos think every animal is just like the bunnywunnies they had as kids i dont think one of them has been closer to a real bull than videotape they sure as hell didnt research the saurians else theyd have known the dinos a landshark and it takes gertie a full minute to process any sensation and act on it we found what was left of the cattleprod in the pit hank pushed his hat back on his head and scratched his chin holy shit so the bozos just got in the way of gertie after they shocked her and opened dinos pen to let him out after disabling the alarms and popping the locks the tech agreed shoot dino must have had fifteen or twenty minutes to get a good whiff and recognize fresh meat he mustve thought the pizza truck had arrived suddenly another thought occurred to him man weve got three saurians in heredid anybody think to check trickys pen alarm filled the techs face i dont think so well come on then hank yelled grabbing his lariat and shooting for the door like dino leaping for a side of beef call it in and meet me there trickys pen was the largest more of an enclosure than a pen it had been the home of their herd of aurochs before the st louis zoo had taken delivery tricky was perfectly placid so long as you stayed on your side of the fence triceratops it seemed had a very strong territorial instinct or at least the gentech reproductions did it was completely safe to come within three feet of the fence just dont come any closer hank saw with a glance that the alarms and cameras had been disabled here too and the gate stood closedbut it was not locked anymore tricky was nowhere in sight he wouldnt go outside the fence hank muttered to himself scanning the pasture with his brow furrowed with worry not unless someone dragged him listen the tech panted hank held his breath and strained his ears help came a thin faint voice from beyond the start of the trees shading the back half of trickys enclosure help oh boy hank grinned and peered in the direction of the shouts this time we got one sure enough just through the trees he could make out the huge brown bulk of the tricerotops standing in what hank recognized as a belligerent aggressionpose the limbs of the tree moved a little shaking beneath the weight of whoever tricky had treed help came the faint pathetic cry reckon he didnt read the sign said buford ambling up with both their horses and indicating the sign posted on the fence that read if you cross this field do it in seconds tricky the triceratops does it in reckon not hank agreed taking the reins of smoky from his old pal and swinging into the saddle he looked over at the tech who hastened to hold open the gate for both of them youd better go get security the cops the medics and the lawyers in that order he said and the tech nodded hank looked back into the enclosure tricky hadnt moved reckon thatuns the luckyun buford said sending pete through the gate at a sedate walk oh i dunno hank replied as smoky followed just as eager for a good roping and riding session as hank wasnt smoky was an overachiever best horse hank had ever partnered but a definite workaholic why you say that buford asked hank shook his head simple enough gettin treed by trickys gonna be the best part of his day by the time the lawyers get done with imwell i reckon hes likely to wish gertied stepped on him too they aint gonna leave him anything but shredded underwear if he thought tricky was bad uhhuh buford agreed his weathered face splitting with a malicious grin both of them had been top rodeo riders before the animalrights activists succeeded in truncating the rodeocircuit theyd been lucky to get this job you know i reckon we had oughta take our time about this exercised do tricky some good hank laughed and held smoky to a walk buford old pal i reckon youre readin my mind you dont suppose the damn fools hurt tricky do ya faint and far came a snort hank could just barely make out tricky as he backed up a little and charged the tree a thud carried across the enclosure and the tree shook naw i think trickys healthy as always help came the wail from the leaves hank pulled smoky up just a little more and grinned fit to split his face this wasnt the best day of his life but damn if it wasnt right up there dumb feast mike resnick is one of my favorite anthology editors and he got us to do a number of stories at the same time when he first said the book this story was slated for was to be called christmas ghosts the concept was so weird i knew i had to contribute warning this is not a nice story but then im not always a nice person aaron brubaker considered himself a rational man a logical man a modern man of the enlightened nineteenth century he was a prosperous lawyer in the city he had a new house in the suburbs and he cultivated other men like himself including a few friends in parliament he believed in the modern he had gas laid on in his house had indoor bathrooms with the best flushing toilets not that a polite man would discuss such things in polite company and had a library filled with the writings of the best minds of his time superstition and old wives tales had no place in his cosmos so what he was about to do was all the more extraordinary if his friends could see him he would have died of shame and yetand yet he would have gone right on with his plans nevertheless he had made certain that there was no chance he might be seen the servants had been dismissed after dinner and would not return until tomorrow after church services they were grateful for the halfday off to spend christmas eve and morning with their own families and as a consequence had not questioned their employers generosity aarons daughter rebecca was at a properly chaperoned party for young people which would end in midnight services at the presbyterian church and she would not return home until well after one in the morning and by then aarons work would be done whether it bore fruit or not the oakpaneled dining room with its ornately carved table and chairs was strangely silent without the sounds of servants or conversation and he had not lit the gaslights of which he was so proud there must only be two candles tonight to light the proceedings one for him one for elizabeth carefully he laid out the plates the silver arranged elizabeths favorite winter flowers in the centerpiece one setting for himself one for his wife his dear and very dead wife his marriage had not precisely been an arranged affair but it had been made in accordance with aarons nature he had met elizabeth in church had approved of what he saw he had courted her in proper fashion gained consent of her parents and married her he had seen to it that she made the proper friends for his position had joined the appropriate societies supported the correct charities she had cared for his home entertained his friends in the expected manner and produced his child in that she had been something of a disappointment since it should have been children including at least one son there was only rebecca a daughter rather than a son but he had forgiven her for her inability to do better romance did not precisely enter into the equation he had expected to feel a certain amount of modest grief when elizabeth died but not the depth of loss he had uncovered he had mourned unceasingly confounding himself as well as his friends there simply was no way of replacing her the little things she did there had been an artistry about the house that was gone now a life that was no longer there his house was a home no longer and his life a barren empty thing in the months since her death the need to see her again became an obsession visits to the cemetery were not satisfactory and his desultory attempt to interest himself in the young widows of the parish came to nothing and that was when the old tales from his childhood and the stories his grandmother told came back toliterallyhaunt him he surveyed the table everything was precisely in place just as it had been when he and elizabeth dined alone together the two candles flickered in a draft they were in no way as satisfactory as the gaslights but his grandmother and the old lady he had consulted from the spiritualist society had been adamant about thatthere must be two candles and only two no gaslights no candelabra from a chafing dish on the sideboard he took the first course elizabeths favorite soup tomato a pedestrian dish almost lowerclass and not the clear consummes or lobster bisques that one would serve to impressbut he was not impressing anyone tonight these must be elizabeths favorites and not his own choices a row of chafing dishes held his choices ready tomato soup spinach salad green peas mashed potatoes fried chicken apple cobbler no wine only coffee all depressingly middleclass that was not the point the point was that they were the bait that would bring elizabeth back to him for an hour at least he tossed the packet of herbs and whatnot on the fire a packet that the old woman from the spiritualists had given him for just that purpose he was not certain what was in it only that she had asked for some of elizabeths hair hed had to abstract it from the lock rebecca kept along with the picture of her mother in a little shrinelike arrangement on her dresser when rebecca had first created it he had been tempted to order her to put it all away for the display seemed very pagan now however he thought he understood her motivations this little drama he was creating was something that his grandmotherwho had been born in devonshirecalled a dumb feast by creating a setting in which all of the deceaseds favorite foods and drink were presented and a place laid for herby the burning of certain substancesand by doing all this at a certain time of the yearthe spirit of the loved one could be lured back for an hour or two the times this might be accomplished were four may eve midsummer halloween and christmas eve by the time his need for elizabeth had become an obsession the spring equinox and midsummer had already passed halloween seemed far too pagan for aarons tasteand besides he had not yet screwed his courage up to the point where he was willing to deal with his own embarrassment that he was resorting to such humbug what did all four of these nights have in common according to the spiritualist woman it was that they were nights when the vibrations of the earthplane were in harmony with the higher planes according to his grandmother those were the nights when the boundary between the spirit world and this world thinned and many kinds of creatures both good and evil could manifest according to her that was why jesus had been born on that night well that was superstitious drivel but the spiritualist had an explanation that made sense at the time something about vibrations and currents magnetic attractions setting up the meal with himself and all of elizabeths favorite things was supposed to set up a magnetic attraction between him and her the packet she had given him to burn was supposed to increase that magnetic attraction and set up an electrical current that would strengthen the spirit then because of the alignment of the planets on this evening the two planes came into close contact or conjunction orsomething it didnt matter all that mattered was that he see elizabeth again it had become a hunger that nothing else could satisfy no one he knew could ever understand such a hunger such an overpowering desire the hunger carried him through the otherwise unpalatable meal a meal he had timed carefully to end at the stroke of midnight a meal that must be carried out in absolute silence there must be no conversation no clinking of silverware then at midnight it must end there again both the spiritualist and his grandmother had agreed the dumb feast should end at midnight and then the spirit would appear he spooned up the last bite of toosweet sticky cobbler just as the bells from every church in town rang out calling the faithful to christmas services perhaps he would have taken time to feel gratitude for the nicklesons party and the fact that rebecca was well out of the way except that as the last bell ceased to peal she appeared there was no fanfare no clamoring chorus of ectoplasmic trumpetsone moment there was no one in the room except himself and the next elizabeth sat across from him in her accustomed chair she looked exactly as she had when they had laid her to rest every auburn hair in place in a neat and modest french braid her body swathed from chin to toe in an exquisite lace gown a wild exultation filled his heart he leapt to his feet words of welcome on his lips tried to rather but he found himself bound to his chair his voice his lips paralyzed unable to move or to speak the same paralysis did not hold elizabeth however she smiled but not the smile he loved the polite welcoming smileno it was another smile altogether one he did not recognize and did not understand so aaron she said her voice no more than a whisper at last our positions are reversed you silent and submissive and myself the master of the table he almost did not understand the words so bizarre were they was this elizabeth his dear wife had he somehow conjured a vindictive demon in her place she seemed to read his thoughts and laughed wildly he thought she reached behind her neck and let down her hair brushed her hand over her gown and it turned to some kind of medievalist costume such as the artists wore the ones calling themselves preraphelites or some such idiocy he gaped to see her attired so or would have if he had been in control of his body i am no demon aaron she replied narrowing her green eyes i am still elizabeth but i am no longer your elizabeth you see death freed me from you from the narrow constraints you placed on me if i had known this was what would happen i would have died years ago he stared his mind reeled what did she mean how could she say those things easily aaron elizabeth replied reclining a little in the chair one elbow on the armrest hand supporting her chin i can say them very very easily or dont you remember all those broken promises broken broken promises aaron she continued her tone even but filled with bitterness they began when you courted me you promised me that you did not want me to changeyet the moment the ring was on my finger you broke that promise and began forcing me into the mold you chose you promised me that i could continue my artbut you gave me no place to work no money for materials and no time to paint or draw but that was simply a childish fancy it was my life aaron she cried passionately it was my life and you took it from me and i believed all those promises that in a year you would give me time and spaceafter the child was bornafter she began school i believed it right up until the moment when the promise was after she finishes school then i knew that it would become after she is married and then there would be some other distant time again she laughed a wild peal of laughter than held no humor at all cakes yesterday cakes tomorrow but never cakes today did you think i would never see through that but why did she have to paint why could she not have turned her artistic sensibilities to proper ladys what embroidery knitting lacemaking i was a painter aaron and i was a good one burnejones himself said so do you know how rare that is that someone would tell a girl that she must paint must be an artist she tossed her head and her wild mane of red hairnow as bright as it had been when he had first met herflew over her shoulder in a tumbled tangle and now he remembered where he had seen that dress before she had been wearing it as she painted for she had been painting a selfportrait of myself as the lady of shallot she said with an expression that he could not read both you and my father conspired together to break me of my nasty artistic habits take me out of my dreamworld i believe he said oh i can hear you both her voice took on a pompous tone and it took him a moment to realize that she was imitating him dont worry sir once she has a child shell have no time for that nonsense and you saw to it that i had no time for it didnt you scheduling ladies teas and endless dinner parties with women who bored me to death and men who wouldnt know a rembrandt from an el greco enrolling me without my knowledge or consent in group after group of other useless women doing utterly useless things and when i wanted to do somethinganythingthat might serve a useful purpose you forbade it forbade me to work with the salvation army forbade be to help with the wayward girlsoh no your wife couldnt do that it wasnt suitable do you know how much i came to hate that word suitable almost as much as the words my good wife but i gave you everything you gave me nothing she cried rising now to her feet you gave me jewelry gowns ordered by you to your specifications furniture useless trinkets you gave me nothing that mattered no freedom no authority no responsibility authority he flushed with guilt when he recalled how he had forbidden the servants to obey her orders without first asking himhow he had ordered her maid to report any outoftheordinary thing she might do how he had given the cook the monthly budget money so that she could not buy a cheaper cut of roast and use the savings to buy paint and brushes did you think i didnt know she snarled her eyes ablaze with anger as she leaned over the table did you think i wasnt aware that i was a prisoner in my own home and the law supported you aaron i was well aware of that thanks to the little amount of work i did before you forbade it on the grounds of suitability one woman told me i should be grateful that you didnt beat me for the law permits that as well he was only doing it for her own good you were only doing it to be the master aaron she spat what i wanted did not matter you proved that by your lovemaking such as it was now he flushed so fiercely that he felt as if he had just stuck his head in a fire how could she be so indelicate oh i was more than indelicate aaron i was passionate and you killed that passion just as you broke my spirit with your cruelty your indifference to me what should have been joyful was shameful and you made it that way you hurt me constantly and never once apologized sometimes i wondered if you made me wear those damned gowns just to hide the bruises from the world all at once her fury ran out and she sagged back down into her chair she pulled the hair back from her temples with both hands and gathered it in a thick bunch behind her head for a moment aaron was still flushing from the last onslaught he hadnt known you didnt care she said bluntly you knew you knew it every time you saw my face fall when you broke another promise every time you forbade me to dispose my leisure time where it would do some good you knew but all of that i could have forgiven if you had simply let rebecca alone this time indignation overcame every other feeling how could she say something like that when he had given the child everything a girl could want because you gave her nothing that she wanted aaron you never forgave her for not being a boy every time she brought something to youa good grade a school prize a picture she had doneyou belittled her instead of giving her the praise her soul thirsted for elizabeths eyes darkened and the expression on her face was positively demonic nothing she did was good enoughor was as good as a boy would have done but children needed correction children need direction but that wasnt all oh no you played the same trick on her that you did on me she wanted a pony and riding lessons but that wasnt suitable she got a piano and piano lessons then when her teacher told you she had real talent and could become a concert artist you took both away and substituted french lessons again she stood up her magnificent hair flowing free looking like some kind of ancient celtic goddess from one of her old paintings paintings that had been filled with such pagan images that he had been proud to have weaned her away from art and back to the path of a true christian woman she stood over him with the firelight gleaming on her face and her lips twisted with disgust you still dont see do you or rather you are so sure so certain that you could know better than any foolish woman what is best for her that you still think you were right in crushing my soul and trying to do the same to my daughter he expected her to launch into another diatribe but instead she smiled and for some reason that smile sent cold chills down his back you didnt even guess that all this was my idea did you she asked silkily you had no idea that i had been touching your mind prodding you toward this moment you forgot what your grandmother told you because i made you forgetthat the dumb feast puts the living in the power of the dead she moved around the end of the table and stood beside him he would have shrunk away from her if he could havebut he still could not move a single muscle there is a gas leak in this room aaron she said in the sweet conversational tone he remembered so well you never could smell it because you have no sense of smell what those awful cigars of yours didnt ruin the port you drank after dinner killed i must have told you about the leak a hundred times but you never listened i was only a woman how could i know about such things but why hadnt someone else noticed it it was right at the lamp so it never mattered as long as you kept the gaslights lit since you wouldnt believe me and i didnt want the house to explode i kept them lit day and night all winter long remember i told you i was afraid of the dark and you laughed and permitted me my little indulgence and of course in the summer the windows were open but you turned the lights off for this dumb feast didnt you aaron you sealed the room just as the old woman told you and the room has been filling with gas slowly all night was she joking no one look into her eyes convinced him that she was not frantic now he tried to break the hold she had over his body and found that he still could not move in a few minutes there will be enough gas in this room for the candles to set it offor perhaps the chafing dishor even the fire there will be a terrible explosion and rebecca will be freefree to follow her dream and become a concert pianist oh aaron i managed to thwart you in that much the french teacher and the piano teacher are very dear friends the lessons continued even though you tried to stop them and you never guessed she looked up as if at an unseen signal and smiled and now he smelled the gas it will be a terrible tragedybut i expect rebecca will get over her grief in a remarkably short time the young are so resilient the smell of gas was stronger now she wiggled her fingers at him like a child goodbye aaron she said cheerfully merry christmas see you soon dance track mercedes lackey and larry dixon this story was for one of mike resnicks alternate anthologies alternate celebrities i believe the wonderful thing about the alternatehistory books is that you can take someone in history that you really like but who may not have made some of the wisest choices in the world and make him or her into something a little better since larry and i decided to do this one together we combined our two passionshis for cars and mine for dance although i am coming to share that passion for cars and even took a highperformance racing school at stevens racing at hallet raceway enjoying it very much thank you that by the way is the same track mark shepherd and i set wheels of fire at were currently thinking about getting a catterham seven which is a new old lotus seven and doing vintage racing and autocrossbut i digress in this case we took the mother of modern dance isadora duncan and gave her a little more common sense we also had her born about years later than she actually was so that she participated in world war two rather than world war one but yes in wwi she did drive an ambulance for the allies as for her protege jimmy well we made his fate a lot kinder too dora blew her hair out of her eyes with an impatient snort and wiped sweat off her forehead and simultaneously adjusted the timing on the engine yelled a correction on tire selection to her tire man and took a quick look out of the corner of her eye for her driver he wasnt lateyet he liked to give her these little heart attacks by showing up literally at the last possible moment she would of course give him hell trying to sound like the crew chief that she was and not like his mother which she was old enough to be and most certainly not like an aging lover which half the bugatti team and every other team assumed she was the fact that they werent had no bearing on the situation dora had been well aware from the moment she joined bugatti at the end of the war that her position in this part of mans world would always be difficult that was all right when had she ever had an easy life all right she pulled clear of the engine compartment hands up and in plain sight as she had taught all her mechanics to do too many men in grand prix racing had missing fingers from being caught in the wrong place when an engine startedbut not on her team the powerful bugatti engine roared to life she nodded to the mechanic in jimmys seat and he floored the pedal she cocked her head to one side frowning a little then grinned and gave the mech a thumbsup he killed the engine answering her grin and popped out of the cockpitjust as jimmy himself came swaggering up through the chaotic tangle of men and machines in the pits she knew he was there by the way the mens eyes suddenly moved to a point just behind and to one side of her they never learnedor else they never guessed how they gave themselves away probably the latter they were mostly italian steeped in generations of presumed male superiority and they would never even think that a woman could be more observant than they no matter how often she proved it to them she pivoted before jimmy could slap her butt and gave him the look she didnt even have to say anything it was all there in the look he stopped standing hipshot as if he were posing for one of his famous publicity shots his borncharmer grin countering her look the blue eyes that made millions of teenage girls suffer heartpalpitations peered cheerfully at dora through his unruly blond hair hed grown a thatch over his eyes for his last movie and hadnt cut it yet he probably wouldnt dora reflected his image as a rebel wasnt just an image it was the real jimmy she pulled her eyes away from his and the look turned to a real frown as she took in the dark anklelength trenchcoat and the flamboyant long silk scarf he wore out she ordered and watched his grin fade in surprise you heard me she said when he hesitated you know the pitrules nothing that can get caught in machinery god help us that scarf could get your neck broken i told you once and i meant it i dont care how many movies youve made in here youre the bugatti rookiedriver youre here on probation even if you are the best damn driver ive ever seen and you toe the line and act like a professional and if you think youre going to make me break my promise not to compete again by getting yourself strangled you can think again now get out of here and come back when youre dressed like a driver and not some hollywood gigolo she turned her back on him and went back to the crew changing the tires but she did not miss his surprisedand suddenly respectfulyes maam she also didnt miss the surprised and respectful looks on the faces of her mechanics and pitcrew so they didnt expect me to chew him out in public she couldnt help but see the little nods and the satisfaction on the mens faces and she hid a grin of her own as she realized what that meant the last rumors of her protege being her lover had just gone up in smoke no lovelorn aging female would lay into her young lover that way in public and no young stud would put up with that kind of treatment from a woman young or old unless the only position she held in his life was as respected mentor she raised her chin aggressively and raked her crew with her stern gaze come on come on pick it up she said echoing every other crew chief here in the pits were running a race here not an ice cream social move it ready miz duncan said a sober voice at her shoulder she turned to see jimmy was back already having ditched the coat and scarf for the racing suit of her own design his helmet tucked under one arm he waited while she looked him over critically nothing binding she asked inspecting every visible seam and wrinkle it was as fireproof as modern technology could make it asbestos fabric over cotton covering the driver from neck to ankle thick asbestos boots covered his feet which would be under the engine compartment it would be hotter than all the fires of hell in there but jimmy would be cooler than most of the other drivers who shunned her innovations in favor of jerseys and heavy canvas pants and he would be safer than she had been whod won the french grand prix in in a leotard and tights and if she could have put an airconditioner in there she would have temperatures in the cockpit ran over fahrenheit while the car was movingworse when it idled in the summer and at those temperatures strange things started to happen to a drivers brain heat exhaustion and the dangerous state leading up to it had probably caused more crashes than anyone wanted to admit she finished her inspection and gave him the nod he clapped his helmet ona full head helmet not just an elaborate leather cap but one with a faceplateand strolled over to his car beginning his own inspection just as she had taught him while the mechanics briefed him on the bugattis latest quirksand grand prix racers always developed new quirks at least a dozen for each race not counting intended modificationsshe took a moment to survey the nearest crews to her right ferrari and lola to her left porsche and mercedes nothing to show that this was wisconsin and not italy or monte carlo nothing here at the track that is she had to admit that it was a relief being back in the us not even the passing of a decade had erased all the scars the war had put on the face of europe and there were those who thought that reviving the grand prix circuit in had been both frivolous and illconsidered in light of all that europe had suffered well those people didnt have to invest their money their time or their expertise in racing the announcement that the indianapolis would be held in had given those behind the project the incentive they needed to get the plans off the drawing board and into action the prince in monaco had helped immeasurably by offering to host the first race monte carlo had not suffered as much damage as some of the other capitals and it was a neutral enough spot to lure even the germans there she shook herself mentally woolgathering again it was a good thing she was out of the cockpit and on the sidelines if she was going to let her thoughts drift like that jimmy nodded understanding as the steeringspecialist made little wiggling motions with his hand dora cast another glance up and down pit row then looked down at the hands of her watch time she signaled to the crew who began to push the car into its appointed slot in line this would be a true le mans start drivers sprinting to their cars on foot and bullying through the pack jockeying for position right from the beginning in a way she would miss it if they went to an indytype start with so little momentum crashes at the beginning of the race were seldom seriousbut when they were they were devastating and there were plenty of promising contenders taken out right there in the first four or five hundred yards she trotted alongside jimmy as they made their way to the starting line all right now listen to me save the engine save the tires you have a long race ahead of you weve got a double whammy on us she warned remember a lot of drivers have it in for bugatti because of meand the europeans arent really thrilled with the bugatti preference for yankee drivers the other thing this is ford country ford is fielding six cars in the factory team alone none of the other chiefs ive talked to know any of the drivers personally which tells me theyre in fords back pocket which means they might drive as a team instead of solo jimmy hazarded shrewdly huh that could be trouble three cars could run a rolling roadblock weve worked on the engine since the trials and theres another twenty horse there she added its just the way you like it light fast and all the power you need if i were you id use that moxie early get yourself placed up in the pack then lay off and see what the rest do she slowed as they neared driveronly territory he waved acknowledgment that he had heard her and trotted on alone she went back to the pits the beginning of the race really mattered only in that he made it through the crush at the beginning and got in a little ahead of the pack that was one reason why she had given over the cockpit to a younger driver she was getting too old for those sprints and leaps places where shed hurt herself as a dancer were starting to remind her that she was fortyfive years old now let jimmy race to the car and fling himself into it he was only twentyfive the view from her end of pitrow wasnt very good but she could see the start if she stood on the concrete firewall one of the men steadied her tonio who had been with her since she was the driver she handed her clipboard down to him then noticed a stranger in their pit wearing the appropriate pass around his neck she was going to say something but just then the drivers on the line crouched in preparation for the starting gun and her attention went back to them the gun went off jimmy leapt for his car like an olympic racer vaulting into it in a way that made her simultaneously sigh with envy and wince the bugatti kicked over like a champ jimmy used every horse under that hood to bully his way through the exhaustchoked air to the front of the pack taking an outside position just like shed taught him the cars pulled out of sight and she jumped down off the wall the stranger was still thereand the pits were for the first time today quiet they would not be that way for long as damaged or empty cars staggered into the hands of their keepers but they were for the moment and the silence impacted the ears as the silence between incoming artillery barrages had she headed for the strangerbut he was heading for her miss duncan he said quickly jim got me this pit passhe came over to see us do death of a salesman last night and when he came backstage and found out i race too he got me the pass and told me to check in with you what kind of racing she asked cautiously it would be just like jimmy to pal around with some kid just because he was an upandcoming actor and saddle her with someone who didnt know when to get the hell out of the way dirttrack mostly he said modestly then quoted her credentials that made her raise her eyebrow ill stay out of the way the kid had an open handsome face and another set of killer blue eyesand the hand that shook hers was firm and confident she decided in his favor do that she told him unless theres a firetell you what you think you can put up with hauling one of those around for the rest of the race she pointed at the rack of heavy firebottles behind the firewall and he nodded all right get yourself one of those and watch our pit porsche and ferrari thats the cost of you being in here if theres a fire in any of em deal with it since the crews had other things on their mindsand couldnt afford to hang extinguishers around their necksthis kid might be the first one on the spot think you can handle thatwhat is your name anyway paul he said diffidently yeah i can handle that thanks miss duncan dora she replied automatically as she caught the whine of approaching engines she lost all interest in the kid for a moment as she strained to see who was in front it was lola but the car was already in trouble she heard a telltale rattle deep in and winced as the leaders roared by jimmy was in the first ten that was all that mattered that and his firstlap time she glanced at fillipe who had the stopwatch he gave her a thumbsup and bent to his clipboard to make notes as he would for almost every lap she let out her breath in a sigh miss duncan how did you get into racing she had forgotten the kid but he was still thereas he had promised out of the way but still within talking distance she shook her head a rueful smile on her lips glory how fleeting fame retire and no ones ever heard of you oh i know all about the grand prix wins the kid said hastily i just wanted to know why you stopped dancing jimmy told me you were kind of abig thing in europe it doesnt seem like a natural approach to racing i mean josephine baker didnt go into racing she chuckled at being compared to the infamous cabaret dancer but no one had ever asked her the question in quite that way a couple of reasons she replied thoughtfully the biggest one is that my dingbat brother was a better dancer than i ever was i figured that the world only needed one crazy dancing duncan preaching greek revival and naturalism and really ruth st denis and agnes de mille were doing what i would have been doing agnes was doing more she was putting decent dancing into motion pictures where millions of little children would see it when i think about it i dont think isadora duncan would have made any earthshaking contributions to dancing then she gave him her famous impish smile the one that peeled twenty years off of her on the other hand every grand prix driver out there does the duncan dive to hit the cockpit and they are starting to wear the driving suits ive been working on so ive done that much for racing the kid nodded he started to ask something else but the scream of approaching engines made him shake his head before she held up her hand jimmy was still there still within striking distance of the leaders but there was trouble developingbecause the ford drivers were doing just what dora had feared they would do they were driving as a teamin two formations of three cars each quite enough to block illegal as hell but only if the race officials caught on and they could get someone on the ford team to spill the beans obvious as it might be the worst the drivers would get would be fines unless someone fessed up that it was premeditatedthen the whole team could be disqualified illegal as hell and more than illegaldangerous dora bit her lip wondering if they really knew just how dangerous halfway through the race and already the kid had more than earned his pitpass porsche was out bullied into the wall by the ford flyingwedge in a crash that sent the driver to the hospital ferrari was out too victim of the same crash both their lmcs had taken shrapnel that had nicked fuellines thank god pauld been close to the pits when the leaking fuel caught fire the ferrari had come in trailing a tail of fire and smoke and the kid was right in there the first one on the scene with his firebottle foaming the driver down first then going under the car with the nozzle hed probably prevented a worse fireand now the alliances in the pits had undergone an abrupt shift it was now the europeans and the independents against the ford monolith porsche and ferrari had just come to herher who porsche had never been willing to give the time of dayoffering whatever they had left somehow the race officials were being incredibly blind to the illegal moves ford was pulling then again how close was detroit to wisconsin it had happened before and would happen again for as long as businessmen made money on sport all the postrace sanctions in the world werent going to help that driver in the hospital and no fines would change the outcome of the inevitable crashes the sad charred hulk of the ferrari had been towed its onceproud red paint blistered and cracked the pit crew was dejectedly cleaning up the oil and foam on the track jimmy still held his position despite two attempts by one of the ford wedges to shove him out of the way that was the advantage of a vehicle like the bugatti as she and the engineers had designed it for him the handling left something to be desired at least so far as she was concerned but it was jimmys kind of car like the porsche he drove for pleasure now that he used to drive in races shed built it for speed point and squirt was how she often put it dryly point it in the direction you wanted to go and let the horses do the work the same thing seemed to be passing through pauls mind as he watched jimmy scream by accelerating out of another attempt by ford to pin him behind their wedge he shook his head and dora elbowed him you dont approve she asked its not that he said as if carefully choosing his words its just not my kind of driving i like handling i like to slip through the pack likelike i was a fish and they were the water or i was dancing on the track she had to smile are you quoting that or did you not know that was how they described my french and monte carlo grand prix wins his eyes widened i didnt know he stammered blushing honest i she patted his shoulder maternally thats fine paul its a natural analogy although i bet you dont know where i got my training he grinned bet i do dodging bombs i read you were an ambulance driver in italy during the war is that when you met ettore bugatti she nodded absently her attention on the cars roaring by was there a faint sound of strain in her engine for a moment her nerves chilled but no it was just another acceleration a little one just enough to blow jimmy around the curve ahead of the mercedes her immediate reaction was annoyance he shouldnt have had to power his way out of that he should have been able to drive his way out he was putting more stress on the engine than she was happy with then she mentally slapped her own hand she wasnt the driver he was but now she knew how ettore bugatti felt when she took the wheel in that first monte carlo grand prix you know bugatti was one of my passengers she said thinking aloud without looking to see if paul was listening he was with the resistance in the italian alps you had to be as much a mechanic as a driver those ambulances were falling apart half the time and he saw me doing both before i got him to the field hospital sometimes she woke up in the middle of the night hearing the bombs falling the screams of the attackfighters strafing the road seeing the road disintegrate in a flash of fire and smoke behind her in front of her hearing the moans of the wounded in her battered converted breadtruck all too well she remembered those frantic moments when getting the ambulance moving meant getting herself and her wounded passengers out of there before the fighterplanes came back and for a moment she heard those planes no it was the cars returning she shook her head to free it of unwanted memories she had never lost a passenger or a truck although it had been a near thing more times than she cared to count whenever the memories came between her and a quiet sleep she told herself thatand reminded herself why she had volunteered in the first place because her brother the darling of the metaphysical set was hiding from the draft at home by remaining in england among the bluehaired old ladies and balletomanes who he charmed because since they would not accept her as a combatant she enlisted as a noncombatant some noncombatant she had seen more fire than most who were on the front lines bugatti had been sufficiently impressed by her pluck and skill to make her an offer when this is over if you want a job come to me perhaps he had meant a secretarial job she had shown up at the decimated bugatti works with its eb sign in front cracked down the middle and offered herself as a mechanic and bugatti faced with a dearth of men who were ablebodied never mind experienced had taken her on out of desperation it was kind of a fluke getting to be bugattis driver she continued noting absently that paul was listening intently the driver for that first grand prix had broken an ankle right at startinglineup and i was the only one on the team that could make the sprint for the car paul chuckled and it had been funny everyone else was either too old or had warinjuries that would slow them down so she had grabbed the racinghelmet before anyone could think to object and had taken the mans place in her anonymous coverall it was entirely possible none of the officials had even noticed her sex she had made the first of her famous duncan dives into the cockpit a modified grand jete that landed her on the seat with a twist and bounce down into the cockpit itself i can still hear that fellow on the bullhornthere was no announcers booth no loudspeaker system she chuckled again and coming in thirdisadora duncan the next race there had been no doubt at all of her sex she had nearly died of heatstroke behind that powerful engine and she had been shocked at what that had done to her judgment and reflexes so this time she had worn one of her old dancing costumes a thick cotton leotard and tightsworn insideout so that the seams would not rub or abrade her the other drivers had been so astounded that she had gotten nearly a twosecond lead on the rest of them in the sprintand two seconds in a race meant a quarter mile for her third race she had been forbidden to wear the leotard but by then she had come up with an alternative almost as formfitting and enough to cause a stir and that had been in france of course and the french had been amused by her audacity la belle isadora had her own impromptu fanclub who showed up at the race with noisemakers and banners perhaps that had been the incentive she needed for that had been her first win she had routinely placed in the first three and had taken home to bugatti a fair share of firstplace trophies the other drivers might have been displeased but they could not argue with success bugatti had been overjoyed and he had continuously modified his racing vehicles to isadoras specifications lighter a little smaller than the norm with superb handling and as a result of isadoras win the bugatti reputation had made for many many sales of sportscars in the speedhungry currencyrich american market and it did not hurt that his prize driver was an attractive american lady but in she had known that she would have to retire and soon she was slowing downand more importantly so were her reflexes that was when she had begun searching for a protege someone she could groom to take her place when she took over the retiring crewchiefs position she had found it in an unlikely place hollywood and in an unlikely person a teenage heartthrob a young hardliving actor but she had not seen him first on the silver screen she had seen him racing behind the wheel of his treasured silver porsche he had been torn by indecision although he made time for her coaching and logged a fair amount of time in bugatti racing machines she and the retiring crew chief worked on design changes to suit his style of driving to help lure him but it was hollywood itself that forced his choice when a nearfatality on a lonely california highway left his porsche a wreck his studio issued an ultimatum quit driving or tear up your contract we dont cast corpses he tore up his contract took the execs pipe from his mouth stuffed the scraps in the pipe slammed it down on the desk and said smoke it he bought a ticket for italy the same day miss duncan paul broke into her thoughts we have company she turned to see the crewchiefs of ferrari mercedes lola and a dozen more approaching her first thought waswhat have we done now but it was not what she had done nor her crew nor even jimmy it was what ford had done isadora said paul lemond the ferrari crewchief who had evidently been appointed spokesman we need your help ten years of fighting her way through this mans world with no support from anyone except bugatti and a few of her crew had left her unprepared for such a statement she simply stared at them while they laid out their idea this would be the last pitstop before the finish and dora was frankly not certain how jimmy was going to take this but she leaned down into the cockpit where she would not be overheard and shouted the unthinkable into his ear over the roar of his engine how the crews of every other team still on the track were fed up with the performance of the ford driversand well they should be with ten multicar wrecks leaving behind ruined vehicles and drivers in hospital the fact that one of those wrecks had included one of the ford threecar flying wedges had not been good enough so if ford is going to play footsie with the rules so are we she shouted they think youre the best driver on the track jimmy the only one good enough to beat cheaters so every other driver on the tracks been given orders to block for you or let you pass she couldnt see jimmys expression behind the faceplate but she did see the muscles in his jaw tense so theyre going to just give me the win he shouted back that was not how jimmy wanted his first grand prix to endand she didnt blame him jimmythey decided youre the best out there not only your peers but mine are you going to throw that kind of vote away it was the only way she would win this argument she sensed it and she sensed as his mood turned to grudging agreement all right he said finally but you tell them this she rapped him on the top of the helmet no you listen they said to tell you that if you get by ford early enough theyre going to do the same for giorgio with the old ferrari and peter for citroen and as many more as they can squeeze by she sensed his mood lighten again although he didnt answer but by then the crew was done and she stood back as he roared back out onto the track when he took the track there were ten laps to gobut five went by without anyone being able to force a break for jimmy not even when the ford wedge lapped slower cars she had to admit that she had seldom seen smoother driving but it was making her blood boil to watch jimmy coming up behind them and being forced to hold his place three laps to go and there were two more cars wrecked one of them from citroen two laps one flag lap suddenly on the back stretch an opening as one of the ford drivers tired and backed off a little and jimmy went straight for it dora was on the top of the firewall without realizing she had jumped up there screaming at the top of her lungs with half the crew beside her ford tried to close up the wedge but it was too late now it was just jimmy and the lead ford neck and neckdown the backstretch through the chicane then on the home run for the finish line dora heard his engine howling heard strain that hadnt been there before surely if she heard it so would he he should have saved the engine early onif he pushed it hed blow the engine he had to know that he pushed it she heard him drop a gear heard the engine scream in protest and watched the narrowbodied lithe steel bugatti surge across the finishline a bare nose ahead of the ford engine afire and trailing a stream of flame and smoke that looked for all the world like a victory banner dora was the first to reach him before hed even gotten out of the car while firefighters doused the vehicle with impartial generosity she reached down and yanked off his helmet she seized both his ears and gave him the kind of kiss only the notorious isadora duncan toast of two continents could have delivereda kiss with every year of her considerable amatory experience behind it thats for the win she said as he sat there breathless mouth agape and for once completely without any kind of response then she grasped his shoulders and shook him until his teeth rattled and thats for blowing up my engine you idiot she screamed into his face by then the crowd was on him hauling him bodily out of the car and hoisting him up on their shoulders to ride to the winners circle dora saw to it that young paul was part of that privileged party as a reward for his firefighting and his listening and when the trophy had been presented and the pictures were all taken she made sure he got up to the front jimmy recognized him as jimmy would being the kind of man he was hey he said as the race queen hung on his arm and people thrust champagne bottles at him you made it paul grinned shyly dora felt pleased for him as he shoved the pass and a pen at jimmy listen i know its awful being asked awful hell no jimmy grabbed the pen and pass have you made up your mind about what you want to do yet acting or whatever paul shook his head and dora noticed then what she should have noticed earlierthat his bright blue eyes and jimmys were very similar and if he isnt a heartbreaker yet she thought wryly he will be i still dont know he said tell you what jimmy said pausing a moment to kiss another beauty queen for the camera you make a pile of money in the movies then go into racing get a good mentor like dora and then he finished the autograph with a flourishand handed it back to the young man to paul newman who can be my driver when i take over the chief mechanic slot from dora best of luck and the familiar autograph james dean note just as a postscriptyes paul newman was doing dinnertheater and summerstock in the midwest in the s he did drive dirttrack as well as going into professional auto racing and james dean was considered by his peers to be an excellent racedriver with great potential in the sport and in case you dont happen to be a dancebuff isadora duncan was killed when the long trailing scarf she wore about twelve feet worth of silk was caught in the wheelspokes of a bugatti sportscar in which she was riding breaking her neck jihad this story was for mike resnicks alternate heroes while t e lawrence aka lawrence of arabia another historical favorite of mine was really a hero i wondered what would have happened if a certain lifeshattering experience he had at deraa had come out a bit differently due to the actual historical details this story is rather a stiff one at the beginning and definitely nc pain was a curtain between lawrence and the world pain was his world there was nothing else that mattered take him out of here you fools youve spoiled him lawrence heard bey nahis exclamation of disgust dimly and it took his painshattered mind a moment to translate it from turkish to english spoiled him as if he was a piece of meat well now he was something less than that he could not reply he could only retch and sob for mercy there was no part of him that was not in excruciating pain pain all his life since he had been a boy pain had been his secret terror and obsession now he was drugged with it a toogreat force against which he could not retain even a shred of dignity as he groveled and wept conversation continued on above his head there were remonstrations on the part of the soldiers but the bey was adamantand angry most of the words were lost in the pain but he caught the sense of a few take him out and leave him for the jackals so the bey was not to keep him until he healed odd after nahis pawing and fondling and swearing of desire lawrence would have thought you stay that petulantly to the corporal the youngest and bestlooking of the lot coincidentally he was the one who had been the chiefest and most inventive of the torturers he had certainly been the one that had enjoyed his role the most take that out the bey told the others lawrence assumed that nahi meant him if he had been capable of appreciating anything he would have appreciated thatthe man who had wrought the worst on his flesh should take his place in the beys bed the remaining two soldiers seized him by the arms waves of pain rolled up his spine and into his brain where they crashed together obliterating thought he couldnt stand up he couldnt even get his feet under him his own limbs no longer obeyed him they dragged him outside the cold air on his burning flesh made him cry out again but this time no one laughed or struck him once outside his captors were a little gentler with him they draped his arms over their shoulders and halfcarried him letting him rest most of his weight on them the nightmarish journey seemed to last a lifetime yet it was only to the edge of the town deraa the edge of deraa the edge of the universe he noted foggily that he did not recognize the street or the buildings as they passed they must have brought him to the opposite side of the town there was that much more distance now between himself and his friends and allies distance controlled and watched by the enemy assuming he wanted to reach them assuming he wanted them to find him see himsee what had been done to him guess at the lacerations that were not visible no his captors let him down onto the muddy ground at the side of the road gently which was surprising one of them leaned over and muttered somethinglawrence lost the sense of it in the pain he closed his eyes and snuggled down into the mud panting for breath every breath was an agony as something probably a broken bone made each movement of his ribs stab him sharply he heard footsteps retreating quickly as if his erstwhile captors could not leave his presence quickly enough tears of despair shameful shamed tears trickled down his cheeks the unmoved stars burned down on him and the taste of blood and bile was bitter in his mouth slowly as the pain ebbed to something he could think through he itemized and cataloged his injuries to regain control of his mind as he had tried to count the blows of the whip on his back the bones in his foot fractured during the chaos of the last sabotageraid had been shattered again the broken rib made breathing a new torture somewhere in the background of everything the dull pain of his head spoke of a concussion which had probably happened when they kicked him to the head of the stairs the lashes that had bit into his groin had left their own burning tracks behind his back was one shapeless weight of pain he had thought to feel every separate bleeding welt but he could only feel the accumulated agony of all of them in a mass but as he lay in the mud the cold of the night numbed him leaving only that final injury still as sharp and unbearable as ever the one that was not visible the laceration of his soul now he knew how women felt to be the helpless plaything of others stronger or more powerful to be forced to give of their bodies whether or not they willed or wanted it to be handled and used like a piece of meat and worst of all at one level the certainty that he had somehow deserved it all that he had earned his punishment that he had asked for his own violation after all wasnt that what they said of women too it was this final blow that had cracked the shell of his will and brought down the walls of the citadel of his integrity how could he face them his followers now they would watch him stare at him and murmur to one anotherno matter how silent he kept they would know surely they would know and knowing how could they trust him they would not of course he no longer trusted himself his nerve was broken his will his soul broken across that guardroom bench there was nothing left but despair he literally had nothing left to live for the revolt had become his life and without it he had no will to live the best thing he could do for the revolt would be to die perhaps feisal would take it upon himself to avenge his strange english friend aurens certainly auda that robber would use aurens death as an excuse to further raid the turks and ali ali ibn el hussein he would surely exact revenge but could they hold the revolt together inshallah as god wills it here in his extremity he had at last come to the fatalism of the moslem it was no longer his concern life was no longer his concern only death and the best way to meet it without further torment to drown his shame in its dark waters where no one would guess what those waters hid this would not be the place to die not here where his beaten and brutalized body would draw attentionwhere his anxious followers might even come upon it and guess the foulness into which he had fallen let him crawl away somewhere let him disappear into the waste and die where he would not be found and let his death become a mystery to be wondered at then he would be a martyr if the revolt could have such a thing it might even be thought that he vanished like one of the old prophets into the desert to return at some vague future date his death would become a clean and shining thing they would remember him as the confident leader not the battered bloody rag of humanity he was now he lay in a sick stupor his head and body aching and growing slowly numb with cold finally a raging thirst brought him to lifeand spurred him to rise he struggled to his feet and rocked in place moaning his shaking hands gathering his torn clothing about him he might have thought that this was a nightmare save for the newlywakened pain somewhere he heard someone laughing and the sound shocked him like cold water deraa felt inhuman with vice and cruelty he could not die here the desert the desert was clean the desert would purge him as it had so many times before he stopped at a trough by the wells scooped a little water into his hands and rubbed it over his face then drank he looked up at the stars which would not notice if there was one halfarab englishman less on the earth and set off one stumbling step at a time for the clean waste beyond this vile pit of humanity he walked for a long time he thought the sounds of humanity faded replaced by the howling of dogs or jackals off in the middle distance tears of pain blurred his sight he hoped he could find some hole to hide himself away before dawn a grave that he might fall into and falling fall out of life he stumbled jarring every injury into renewed agony and a white light of pain blinded him he thought he would die then dropping in his tracks then he thought that the blackness of unconsciousness would claim him but the light did not fade it grew brighter it burned away the pain burned away thought burned away everything but a vague sense of self it engulfed him conquered him enveloped him he floated in a sea of light dazzled sure that he had dropped dead on the road but if that were true where was he and what was this even as he wondered that he became aware of a presence within the light even as he recognized it it spoke i am i on the bank of the palestine railway above the huddle of deraa they waited sherif ali ibn el hussein together with the two men that aurens had designated as his bodyguards halim and faris and the sheik of tafas talal el hareidhin tell me again ali said fiercely tell me what it was you did faris old and of peasant stock did not hesitate although this was the fifth time in as many hours that ali had asked the question talal hissed through his teeth but did not interrupt we came into deraa by the road openly faris recounted as patient as the sand there was wire and trenches some flying machines in the sheds some men about but they took no note of us we walked on into deraa a syrian asked after our villages and whether the turks were there i think he meant to desert we left him and walked on again someone called after us in turkish which we feigned not to understand then another man in a better uniform ran after us he took aurens by the arm saying the bey wants you he took aurens away through the tall fence into their compound this was when i saw him no more i hung about but there was no sign of him although i watched until well after nightfall the turks became restless and looked evilly at me so i left before they could take me too talal shook his head this is pointless he said aurens is either dead or a prisoner and in neither case can we help him if the former it is the will of allah if the latter we must think of how long he will deceive them and where we must go when he does into the desert whence we came ali said glumly the revolt is finished there is no man of us who can do as he has done for there is no man of us who has not a feud with another tribe there is not a one of us who has no tribe to answer to there is no one we may trust to whom the english will listen much less give gold and guns to we are finished talal widened his eyes at that but did not speak ali took a last look at deraa and the death of their hopes and turned resolutely away where do we go lord asked faris humbly the peasant still to azrak ali replied we must collect ourselves and then scatter ourselves if aurens has been taken and betrayed us we must think to take ourselves where the turks cannot find us the others nodded at this gloomy wisdom as the rains began again falling down impartially upon turks and bedouin alike the ride to the old fortress of azrak which aurens and his followers had taken for the winter was made longer by their gloom there was not one among them who doubted the truth of alis words and ali thought perhaps that there was not one among them who was not trying to concoct some heroic scheme either to rescue aurens or to avenge him but a thousand unconnected raids of vengeance would not have a quarter of the power of the planned and coordinated raids aurens had led them in and there was still the matter of gold and gunsgold to buy the loyalty of the wilder tribes to make suni fight beside shia halfpagan desert tribesman beside devout meccan guns because there were never enough guns never enough ammunition and because there were those who would fight for the promise of guns who would not be moved for anything else swords would not prevail against the turkish guns no matter how earnest the wielder they must gather their people each his own and scatter ali would take it upon himself to bear the evil news to feisal who would doubtless take it to his father and the english more ill thoughts how long would king hussein ever jealous of his sons popularity and inclined to mistrust him permit feisal even so much as a bodyguard without aurens to speak to the english and the english to temper the father the son could not rally the revolt either it was truly the death of their hopes the fortress loomed in the distance dark and dismal in the rain ali did not think he could bear to listen to the spectral wailings of the ghostdogs of beni hillal about the walls tonight he would gather his people and return to his tribe what was that noise he raised his eyes from contemplating the neck of his camel just as a shaft of golden light as bright as the words of the koran broke through the clouds where it struck the ground on the road between them and the fortress there was a stark white figure that seemed to take in the golden light and transmute it to his own brightness ali squinted against the light who was this was it mounted yes as it drew nearer strangely bringing the beam of sunlight with it he saw that it was mounted not upon a camel but upon a horse of a whiteness surpassing anything ali had ever seen not even the stud reft away from the turks was of so noble a color now he saw what the noise was behind the rider came every man of the fortress cheering and firing into the air ali goaded his mount into a loping canter his heart in his throat it could not be could it from the canter he urged the camel into a gallop the size was right the shapebut whence the robes the headcloth even the headropes of such dazzling whiteness they had been mired in mud for months he had not thought ever to see white robes until spring it was his heart leapt with joy it was the figure was near enough to see features now and it was not to be mistaken for any other aurens he reined his camel in beside the white stallion and the beast did not even shy it simply halted though aurens made no move to stop it he raised his hand and the mob at his back fell respectfully silent ali looked down at his friend aurens looked up and there was a strange fire in those blue eyes a burning that made ali rein his camel back a pace there was something there that ali had never seen before something that raised the hair on the back of his neck and left him trembling between the wish to flee and the wish to fall from his camels back and grovel at the englishmans feet lawrence ali said using the english name rather than the one they all called him as if by using that name he could drive that strangeness from aurens eyes lawrence how did you escape from the turks the blue eyes burned brighter and the robes he wore seemed to glow lawrence is dead he said the turks slew him there is only aurens aurens and the will of allah alis blood ran hot and cold by turns as he stared down into those strange unhuman blue eyes and what he whispered as he would whisper in a mosque is the will of allah at last the eyes released him leaving him shivering with reaction and with the feeling that he had gazed into something he could not and would never understand the will of allah said aurens gazing toward deraa toward damascus and beyond is this silence in which not even the camels stirred there will be jihad general allenby swore losing the last of his composure hes where the commander of the british forces in the middle east shouted as his aides winced and the messenger kept his upper lip appropriately stiff in the face of the generals anger outside of damascus sir he repeated i caught up with him there he paused for a moment for if this much of the message had the general in a rage the rest of it would send him through the roof he was sweatingly grateful that it was no longer the custom to slay the bearer of bad news he sent me to tell you sir that if you wish to witness the taking of damascus you had best find yourself an aeroplane the general did indeed go through the roof fortunately early on in the tirade allenby said something that the messenger could take as a dismissal and he took himself out there was a mob lying in wait for him in the officers mess what did he say what did he do is it true hes gone native is it the messenger held up his hands chaps one at a time or else let me tell it once from the beginning the hubbub cooled then and he was allowed to take a seat a throne rather while the rest of them gathered around him as attentive as students upon a greek philosopher or as aurens men upon his word the similarity did not escape him what he wondered now was how he had escaped that powerful personality or had he been permitted to escape because it suited aurens will to have him take those words back to jerusalem first must come how he had found aurenshe could no more think of the man as t e lawrence than he could think of the pope as binky there was nothing of britain in the man he had spoken to save only the perfect english and the clipped precise accent not even the blue eyesthey had held something more alien than all the mysteries of the east i was told he had last been seen at deraa so that was where i went to look for him he wasnt there but his garrison was his garrison these wogs couldnt garrison a stable there was an avalanche of comments about that particular term most disparaging kirkbride waited until the comments had subsided i tell you it was a garrison he shook his head i cant explain it as wild as you like tribesmen riding like devils in their games outside the turkish headquarters wrecked and lootedbut everything outside that untouched the turks prisoners housed and fed and cleanthe guards on the town as disciplined as he lacked words the contrast had been so great he could hardly believe it but more than that the town had been held by men from a dozen different tribes or moreand yet there was no serious quarreling no feuding when he ventured to ask questions it had been aurens said and aurens commanded as though aurens spoke for allah aurens it appeared was on the road to damascus sweeping all before him they gave me a guide and sent me off camelback and what was the oddest i would have sworn that they knew i was coming and were only waiting for me that had been totally uncanny the moment he had appeared he had been escorted to the head of the garrison some sheik or other then sent immediately out to the waiting guide and saddled camel and the only answer to his question of where are you taking me was aurens commands deraa had been amazing the situation outside damascus was beyond imagination as he described it for his listeners he could not fault them for their expressions of disbelief he would not have believed it if he had not seen it massed before damascus was the greatest arab army the world had ever seen kirkbride had been an oxford scholar in history and he could not imagine that such a gathering had ever occurred even at the height of the crusades tribe after feuding tribe was gathered there together in the full strength of fighters boys as young as their early teens and scarred old greybeards there was order there was discipline not the discipline of the british regulars of drill and salute of uniforms and ranksa discipline of a peculiarly eastern kind in which individual and tribal differences were forgotten submerged in favor of a goal that engaged every mind gathered here in a kind of whitehot fervor kirkbride had recognized bedouins that were known to be halfpagan alongside druses alongside king husseins own devout guard from mecca that had brought him up short and in answer to his stammered question his guide had only smiled whitely you shall see he said only when we reach aurens reach aurens they did and he was brought into the tent as though into the presence he was announced and the figure in the spotlessly white robes turned his eyes on the messenger his listeners stilled as some of his own awe communicated itself to them he had no doubt at that moment that aurens was a presence the blue eyes were unhuman something burned in them that kirkbride had never seen in all of his life the face was as still as marble but stronger than tempered steel there was no weakness in this man anywhere aurens would have terrified him at that moment except that he remembered the garrison holding deraa the turks there were cared for honorably their wounded were getting better treatment than their own commanders gave them somewhere behind the burning eyes there was mercy as well it took him a moment to realize that the men clustered about aurens as disciples about a master included king hussein sidebyside and apparently reconciled with his son feisal king hussein pried out of mecca at last clearly taking a subservient role to aurens a foreigner a christian kirkbride had meant to stammer out his errand thenexcept that at that moment there came the call to prayer wild and wailing it rang out across the camp someone had translated it for kirkbride once imperfectly or so he said god alone is great i testify that there are no gods but god and mohammed is his prophet come to prayer come to security god alone is great there is no god but god and aurens the englishman the christian unrolled his carpet faced mecca with the rest and fell upon his face that kept kirkbride openmouthed and speechless until the moment of prayer was over and all rose again taking their former places he did what the officers were as dumbfounded as he had been once again kirkbride was back in that tent under the burning blue gaze of those eyes he said to tell allenby that if he wanted to see the taking of damascus he should find an aeroplane else it would happen before he got there kirkbride swallowed as the mess erupted in a dozen shouted conversations at once some of those involved other encounters with aurens over the past few weeks how he had been in a dozen places at once always riding a white arabian stallion or a pure white racing camel of incredible endurance how he had rallied the men of every tribe how he had emptied mecca of its fighting men how he had appeared impeccably uniformed with apparently genuine requisition orders for guns ammunition explosives supplies how he had vanished into the desert with laden camelsand only later were the orders proved forgeries so perfect that even allenby could not be completely sure he had not signed them how incredibly all those incidents had taken place in the same day at supply depots spread miles apart it was possiblebarely such a feat could have been performed by a man with access to a highpowered motorcar no one could prove aurens had such accessbut hussein did he owned several and hussein was now with aurens it would still have taken incredible nerve and endurance kirkbride did not think he had the stamina to carry it off no one was paying any attention to him he slipped out of the officers mess with his own head spinning there was only one thing of which he was certain now he wanted to be in at the kill but to do that he had to get himself attached to allenbys staff within the next hour impossible perhaps but then again had aurens not said as he took his leave we will meet again in damascus kirkbride sat attentively at the generals side they had not come by aeroplane after all but by staff car and so they had missed the battle all six hours of it six hours he could scarcely credit it even the germans had fled in terror at the news of the army camped outside their strongholds they had not even waited to destroy their own supplies the general would not have believed it had not french observers confirmed it allenby had mustered all of the general staff of the allied forces and a convoy of staff cars had pushed engines to the breakingpoint to convey them all to the city but kirkbride had the feeling that this was the mountain come to mohammed and not the other way around he had been listening to the natives and the word in their mouths spoken cautiously but fervently was that aurens was mohammed or something very like him the victories that allah had granted were due entirely to his holiness and not to his strategy strangest of all this was agreed upon by suni and shiite by kurd and afghani by purest circassian and darkest egyptian by bedouin wanderer and lebanese shopkeeper there had been no such accord upon a prophet since the very days of mohammed himself allenby had convinced himself somehow that aurens was going to simply meekly hand over his conquests to his rightful leader kirkbride had the feeling that allenby was not going to get what he expected damascus was another deraa writ large only the turkish holdings had been looted the rest remained unmolested there were no fires no riots highspirited young warriors gamed and sported outside the city walls inside a stern and austere martial order prevailed even the hospital holding the wounded and sick turkish prisoners was in as good order as might be expected for a place that had been foul when the city was in turkish hands there was government there was order it was not an english order organization was along tribal lines rather than rank to each tribe a duty and if they failed it another was appointed to take it to their eternal shame but it was an order and at the heart of it was the new arab government allenby had laughed to hear that at the gates of the city as they were ushered into that governments heart he was no longer laughing there were fire brigades a police force the destitute were being fed by the holy men from out of the looted german stores and the sick tended by the turkish doctors out of those same stores there were scavengergangs to clear away the dead with rights to loot the bodies to make up for the noisome work british gold became the new currency there was a market already with barter encouraged everywhere kirkbride looked there was strange yet logical order and allenbys face grew more and more grave aurens permitted him and the envoys of the other foreign powers into his office commandeered from the former governor the aides remained behind my people will see to us and to them aurens said with quiet authority a look about the room at the men in a rainbow of robes with hands on knifehilts dissuaded arguments the door closed kirkbride did not join with the others drinking coffee and making sly comments about their guardians he had the feeling garnered from glances shared between dark faces and the occasional tightening of a hand on a hilt that all of these barbarians knew english quite well instead he kept to himself and simply watched and waited the hour of prayer came and the call went up all the men but one guarding them fell to praying kirkbride drew nearer to that one a circassian as blond as aurens himself you do not pray he asked expecting that the man would understand and so he did he shrugged i am christian for now he cast his glance towards the closed door and his eyes grew bright and thoughtful butperhaps i shall convert kirkbride blinked in surprise not the least of the surprises of this day what was it that the caller added to the end of the chant he asked for he had noted an extra sentence called in a tone deeper than the rest the mans gaze returned to kirkbrides face he said god alone is good god alone is great and he is very good to us this day oh people of damascus at that moment the door opened and a much subdued delegation filed out of the door allenby turned as aurens followed a little into the antechamber and stopped his white robes seemed to glow in the growing dusk and kirkbride was astonished to see a hint of a smile on the thin ascetic lips you cant keep this going you know allenby said more weary than angry this isnt natural its going to fall apart not while i live i think aurens said in his crisp precise english well when you die then allenby retorted savagely and the moment youre dead well be waitingjust like the vultures you called us in there if anything the smile only grew a trifle perhaps perhaps not there is wealth here and wealth can purchase educations in a few years there will be men of the tribes who can play the politicians game with the best of them years more and there will be men of the tribes who look farther than the next spring into the next century we need not change you knowwe need only adopt the tools and weapons and turn them to our own use i would not look to cut up the east too soon if i were you now he chuckled something that surprised kirkbride so much that his jaw dropped and in any event aurens concluded carelessly i intend to live a very long time allenby swore under his breath and turned on his heel the rest all but kirkbride followed he could not for aurens had turned that luminous blue gaze upon him again oxford i think the rich voice said he nodded unable to speak the gaze released him and turned to look out one of the windows after a moment kirkbride recognized the direction east baghdad i shall have need of oxford men to train my people in the english way of deception the voice said carelessly and the french way of doubledealing and the german way of ruthlessness to train them so that they understand but do not become these things kirkbride found his voice you arent trying to claim that your people arent doubledealing deceitful and ruthless i hope he said letting sarcasm color his words i think that would be a little much even from you the eyes turned back to recapture his and somewhere behind the blue fire there was a hint of humor oh no aurens said with gentle warmth but those are arab deceptions doubledealings and ruthlessness clever but predictable to another arab these things are understood all around they have not yet learned the ways of men who call themselves civilized i should like to see them wellarmored before allah calls me again kirkbride raised an eyebrow at that you havent done anything any clever man couldnt replicate he replied half in accusation without the help of allah have i ever said differently aurens traded him look for ironic look i heard what happened before the battle aurens they said had ridden his snowwhite stallion before them all in whose name do you ride he had called like a trumpet kirkbrides informant had told him as awed as if he had spoken of the archangel gabriel and the answer every man joined in one roar of response in the name of allah and of aurens aurens only looked amused ride with me to baghdad this had less the sound of a request than a command ride with me to yemen help me shape the world again the touch of humor softening it all or at least so much of it as we can inshallah i have stirling i have some others i should like you kirkbride weighed the possibilities the gains the losses then weighed them against the intangible the fire in the eyes the look of eagles then once again he looked aurens full in the eyes was caught in the blue fire of them and felt that fire catch hold in his soul outweighing any other thoughts or considerations slowly knowing that he wagered all on a single cast of the dice he drew himself up to attention then he saluted slowly gravely to the approval of every one of the robed men in that room to baghdad and yemen aurens he said inshallah balance this story first appeared in fantasy book magazine it was later combined with the following story dragons teeth and stories by marion zimmer bradley and jennifer roberson for a volume originally called bardic voices later published by daw as spell singers martis is very close to being a soulsister to tarma and kethry youre my bodyguard the swordsman standing in the door to martis cluttered quarters blinked in startled surprise hed been warned that the sorceress was not easy to work with but he hadnt expected her to be quite so rude he tried not to stare at the tall disheveled mage who stood hands on hips amid the wreckage shed made of her own quarters the womans square features made harsher by nervous tension reflected her impatience as the mercenary groped for the proper response to make martis was a little embarrassed by her own illmanners but really thischildmust surely be aware that his appearance was hardly likely to invoke any confidence in his fighting ability for one thing he was slim and undersized he didnt even boast the inches martis had for another the way he dressed was absurd almost is if he were a dancer got up as a swordsman for some theatrical production he was too clean too fastidious that costume wasnt even the least wornlookingand silk for kevreths sake bluegreen silk at that he carried two swords and whoever had heard of anyone able to use two swords at once outside of a legend his light brown hair was worn longer than any other fighter martis had ever seentoo long martis thought with disapproval and likely to get in the way despite the headband he wore to keep it out of his eyes he even moved more like a dancer than a fighter this was supposed to guard her back it looked more like shed be guarding him it was difficult to imagine anything that looked less like a warrior the guardserjant did send this one for that purpose magelady but since this one does not please he shall return that another may be assigned before martis could say anything to stop him he had whirled about and vanished from the doorway without a sound martis sighed in exasperation and turned back to her packing at this moment in time she was not about to start worrying about the tender feelings of a hiresword she hadnt gotten much farther along when she was interrupted againthis time by a bestial roar from the bottom of the stair martis the walls shook with each step as trebenth guardserjant to the mages guild climbed the staircase to martis rooms most floors and stairs in the guildhold shook when trebenth was about he was anything but fatbut compared to the lean mages he worked for he was just somassive outside of the guards quarters most of the guildhold wasnt designed to cope with his bulk martis could hear him rumbling under his breath as he ascended the faroff mutterings of a volcano soon to erupt she flinched and steeled herself for the inevitable outburst he practically filled the doorframe as he glared at martis she half expected steam to shoot from his nostrils it didnt help that he looked like a volcano dressed in magehireling red from his tunic to his boots it matched the red of his hair and beard and the angry flush suffusing his features martis what in the name of the seven is your problem my problem as you call it is the fact that i need a bodyguard not a temple dancer martis matched him glare for glare her flat gray eyes mirroring his impatience what are you trying to push on me ben zailas toenails if it werent for the fact that guild law prevents a mage from carrying weapons id take sword myself rather than trust my safety to that toy dammit martis youve complained about every guard ive ever assigned to you this one was too sullen that one was too talkative tother one snored at night he snorted contemptuously mother of the gods martis snored you ought to know by now that a mage needs undisturbed sleep more than foodbesides anyone stalking us would have been able to locate our campsite by ear alone she replied pushing a lock of blond hairjust beginning to show signs of grayout of her eyes the gesture showed both her annoyance and her impatience and pulling her robe a bit straighter could not conceal the fact that her hands trembled a little he lost a portion of his exasperation after all he and martis were old friends and she did have a point look when have i ever sent you a guard that couldnt do the job i think this time ive really found the perfect match for youhes quiet half the time you dont even know hes there in factand mart the lads good him ben have you lost what little mind you ever had who told you he was good nobody he replied affronted i dont take anyones word on the guards i hire i tested him myself the boy moves so fast he doesnt need armor and as for those two toy swords of his wellhes good he came within a hair of taking me down martis raised an eyebrow in surprise to her certain knowledge it had been years since anyone could boast of taking trebenth downor even coming close whys he dress himself up like a friggin faggot then i dont know mart ask him yourself i dont care if my guards wear battleplate or paint themselves green so long as they can do the job mart whats bothering you youre not usually so damn picky you generally save your complaining till the jobs over martis collapsed tiredly into a chair shoving aside a box of tagged herbs and a pile of wrinkled clothing trebenth saw with sudden concern the lines of worry crossing her forehead and her puffy bruisedlooking eyelids its the job guild businessinternal problems somebody need disciplining worse gone renegadeand hes raising power with bloodmagic he was very good before he started this ive no doubt hes gotten better if we cant do something about him now well have another sable mageking on our hands trebenth whistled through his teeth a black adept in the making eh no wonder theyre sending you martis sighed just when id begun to think the guild would never set me to anything but teaching again but thats not whats troubling me old friend i knew hima long and close association he was one of my best students trebenth winced to set martis out after one of her old students was a cruel thing to do the powers manipulated by mages gifted them with much that lesser folk could envybut those powers took as well as gave use of magic for any length of time rendered the user sterile in many ways martis students took the place of the children shed never have they often took the place of friends too shed served the guild since shed attained masterclass and her barely past what for the untalented would have been marriageable age there were few sorcerers among her contemporaries male or female that didnt secretly fear and envy the masterclass mages there were no mages of her own rank interested in taking a lover whose powers equaled their own they preferred their women pliant pretty and not too bright martiss relations with her own kind were cordial but barren trebenth himself had been one of the few lovers shed hadand she hadnt taken another since hed toppled like a felled tree for his little margwynwy and shed severed that side of their relationship herself it was times like this one with her loneliness standing bare in her eyes that he pitied her with all his heart martis caught his glance and smiled thinly the council did their level best to spare me this ill give them that much the fact is we dont know for certain how deeply hes gotten himself in yet we know hes been sacrificing animals but so far rumors of human deaths are just thatrumors they want to give him every chance to get himself out of the hole hes digging for himself frankly hes got too much talent to waste one of the factors in deciding to send me is that they hope hell give me a chance to reason with him if reason doesnt work well im one of the few sorcerers around with a chance of defeating him after all i taught him i know all his strengths and weaknesses knew trebenth reminded her can i assign lyran to your service now that ive vouched for his ability or are you still wanting someone else who ohthe boy all right ben you know what youre doing youve been hiring guards as long as ive been training mages tell him to get the horses ready i want to make a start before noon when martis had finished ransacking her room for what she wanted she slung her packed saddlebags over her shoulder and slammed the door on the entire mess by the time she returnedif she returnedthe guild servants would have put everything back in order again that was one of the few benefits of being a masterclass sorceress the guild provided comfortable safe quarters and reliable servants who never complainedat least not to her those benefits were paid for though a masterclass mage lived and died in service to the guild no one with that rating was ever permitted to take service independently martis had a liking for heights and a peculiar phobia about having people living above her so her room was at the top of the staircase that linked all four floors of the masters quarters as she descended the stairs she found that a certain reluctant curiosity was beginning to emerge concerning this unlikely swordsman lyran the order shed given trebenth to have the lad ready the horses was in itself a test martis personal saddlebeast was an irascible bay gelding of indeterminant age and vile temper the possessor of a number of bad habits hed been the cause of several grooms ending in the healers hands before this martis kept him for two reasonsthe first was that his gait was as sweet as his temper was foul the second that he could be trusted to carry a babe safely through hell once it was securely in the saddle to martis as to any other mage these traits far outweighed any other considerations if this lyran could handle old tosspot there was definitely hope for him it was martis turn to blink in surprise when she emerged into the dusty sunlit courtyard waiting for her was the swordsman the reins of his own beast in one hand and those of tosspot in the other tosspot was not trying to bite kick or otherwise mutilate either the young man or his horse his saddle was in place and martis could tell by his disgruntled expression that he hadnt managed to get away with his usual trick of blowing so that his saddle girth would be loose more amazing still the swordsman didnt appear to be damaged in any way didnt even seem out of breath did he give you any trouble she asked fastening her saddlebags to tosspots harness and adroitly avoiding his attempt to step on her foot he is troublesome yes magelady but this one has dealt with a troublesome beast before lyran replied seriously at just that moment the swordsmans dustbrown mare lashed out with a wicked hoof which the young man dodged with reflexive agility he reached up and seized one of the mares ears and twisted it once hard the mare immediately resumed her good behavior sometimes it would seem that the best animals are also the vilest of temper he continued as though he hadnt been interrupted it then is of regrettable necessity to prove that though they are stronger this one has more knowledge martis mounted tosspot and nodded with satisfaction when his girth proved to be as tight as it looked i dont think this old boy will be giving you any more trouble from the sour look hes wearing id say he learned his lesson quite thoroughly the swordsman seemed to glide into his saddle and gracefully inclined his head in thanks for the compliment truly he must have more intelligence than jesalis he replied reining in his mare so that the sorceress could take the lead for this one must prove the truth of the lesson to her at least once a day jesalis martis asked incredulously for the jesalis was a fragile blossom of rare perfume and nothing about the ugly little mare could remind anyone of a flower balance magelady lyran replied so earnestly that martis had to hide a smile so foul a temper has she that it is necessary to give her a sweet name to leaven her nature they rode out of the guild hold in single file with martis riding in the lead since protocol demanded that the hireling ride behind the mistress while they were inside the town wall once theyd passed the gates they reversed position lyran would lead the way as well as providing a guard for all of martis attention must be taken up by her preparations to meet with her wayward former student tosspot would obey his training and follow wherever the rider of jesalis led this was the reason that tosspots gait and reliability were worth more than gold pieces most of martis time in the saddle would be spent in a trancelike state as she gradually gathered power to her it was this ability to garner and store power that made her a masterclass sorceressfor after all the most elaborate spell is useless without the power to set it in motion there were many ways to accumulate power martis was to gather the little aimless threads of it given off by living creatures in their daily lives normally this went unused gradually dissipating like dye poured into a river martis could take these little tagends of energy spin them out and weave them into a fabric that was totally unlike what they had been before this required total concentration and there was no room in her calculations for mistake martis was grateful that lyran was neither sullen nor inclined to chatter she was able to sink into her magic gatheringtrance undistracted by babble and undisturbed by a muddy surly aura riding in front of her perhaps ben had been right after all the boy was so unobtrusive that she might have been riding alone she spared one scant moment to regret faintly that she would not be able to enjoy the beauties of the summer woods and meadows they were to ride through it was so seldom that she came this way the atmosphere was so peaceful that it wasnt until she sensedmore than feltthe touch of the bodyguards hand on her leg that she roused up again the sun was westering and before her was a small clearing with lyrans horse contentedly grazing and a small neat camp already set up martis tent was to the west of the clearing a cluster of boulders behind it and the tentflap open to the cheerful fire lyrans bedroll lay on the opposite side jesalis was unsaddled and her tack laid beside the bedroll from what martis could see all of her own belongings had been placed unopened just inside the tent and all had been accomplished without martis being even remotely aware of it your pardon magelady lyran said apologetically but your horse must be unsaddled and you cant do that with me still sitting on him martis finished for him highly amused why didnt you wake me earlier im perfectly capable of helping make camp the guardserjant made it plain to this one that you must be allowed to work your magics without distraction will you come down just one moment there was something subtly wrong but martis couldnt pinpoint what it was before she could say anything however lyran suddenly seized her wrist and pulled her down from her saddle just as an arrow arced through the air where she had been lyran gave a shrill whistle and jesalis threw up her head sniffed the breeze and charged into the trees to their left martis quickly sought cover in some nearby bushes as lyran hit the ground and rolled up into a wary crouch a scream from where the mare had vanished told that the horse had removed the obstacle of the archer but he had not been alone from under the cover of the trees stepped not one but three swordsmen lyran regained his feet in one swift motion drew the swords he wore slung across his back and faced them in a stance that was not of any fighting style martis recognized he placed himself so that they would have to pass him to reach her the first of the assassinsmartis was reasonably sure that this was what they werelaughed and swatted at lyran with the flat of his blade in a careless backhanded stroke aiming negligently for his head this little butterfly is minewe will see if he likes to play the woman he apes he began lyran moved lithe as a ferret the speaker stared stupidly at the sword blade impaling his chest lyran had ducked and come up inside his guard taking him out before hed even begun to realize what the bodyguard was about lyran pulled his blade free of the newmade corpse while the assassin still stood he whirled to face the other two before the first fell to the ground they moved in on him with far more caution than their companion had circling him warily to attack him from opposite sides he fended off their assault easily his two swords blurring they moved so fast his movement dancelike but despite his skill he could seem to find no opening to make a counterattack for the moment all three were deadlocked martis chafed angrily at her feeling of helplessnessthe combative magics shed prepared were all meant to be used against another mage to use any of the spells she knew that would work against a fighter shed have to reach her supplies in her saddlebagsnow rather hopelessly out of reach she found that she was sharply aware of the incongruous scent of the crushed blossoms that lay beneath the dead mans body the deadlock was broken before martis could do more than curse at her own helplessness within the space of a breath lyran feinted at the third of the assassins drawing the second to attack he caught his opponents blade in a bind and disarmed him with practiced ease then the third lunged at him and he moved aside just enough for his blade to skim past his chest lyrans lefthand blade licked out and cut his throat with the recovery of the stroke that had disarmed the second before martis could blink he continued the flow of movement before the third could fall to cut the second nearly in half with the sword in his right and behind him the first dead man rose sword in hand and hacked savagely at the unsuspecting lyrans blind side lyran got one blade up in time to deflect the blow but the power behind it forced him to one knee the undead hammered at the bodyguard showing sorcerous strength that far exceeded his abilities in life lyran was forced down and back until the undead managed to penetrate his defenses with an underandover strike at his left arm the slice cut lyrans arm and shoulder nearly to the bone the sword dropped from his fingers and he tried to fend off the liche with the right alone the undead continued to press the attack its blows coming even faster than before lyran was sent sprawling helplessly when it caught him across the temple with the flat of its blade martis could seealmost as if time had slowedthat he would be unable to deflect the liches next strike she lyran and the undead all made their moves simultaneously martis destroyed the magic that animated the corpse but not before it had made a twohanded stab at the bodyguard but lyran had managed another of those ferretquick squirms as the liche struck he threw himself sidewaysa move martis would have thought impossible and wound up avoiding impalement by inches the undead collapsed then as the magic supporting it dissolved freed from having to defend himself lyran dropped his second blade groped for the wound and sagged to his knees in pain martis sprinted from out of hiding reaching the swordsmans side in five long strides given the amount of damage done his arm it was lyrans good fortune that his charge was masterclass in her mind she was gathering up the strands of power shed accumulated during the day and reweaving them into a spell of healing a spell she knew so well she needed nothing but her memory to create even in that short period of time lyran had had the presence of mind to tear off the headband that had kept his long hair out of his eyes and tie it tightly about his upper arm slowing the bleeding as martis reached for the wounded arm lyran tried feebly to push her away there isno needmagelady he gasped his eyes pouring tears of pain martis muttered an obscenity and cast the spell no guard in my service stays wounded she growled i dont care what or who youve served before i take care of my own having said her say and worked her magics she went to look at the bodies while the spell did its work what she found was very interesting indeed so interesting that at first she didnt notice that lyran had come to stand beside her where she knelt when she did notice it was with some surprise that she saw the slightly greenish cast to the guards face and realized that lyran was striving valiantly not to be sick lyran must have seen her surprise written clear in her expression for he said almost defensively this one makes his living by the sword magelady but it does not follow that he enjoys viewing the consequences of his labor martis made a noncommittal sound and rose well you neednt think your scoutcrafts at fault young man these menthe archer too id judgewere brought here by magic just a few moments before they attacked us i wish you could have taken one alive he could have told us a lot it is this ones humble opinion that one need not look far for the author of the attack lyran said looking askance at martis oh no doubt its kelvens work all right he knows what my aura looks like well enough to track me from a distance and pinpoint my location with very little trouble and im sure he knows that its me the guild would send after him and he knows the nearest gatepoint and that id be heading there no what i wish i knew were the orders he gave this bunch were they to killor to disable and capture she dusted her hands aware that the sun was almost gone and the air was cooling well im no necromancer so the knowledge is gone beyond my retrieval shall this one remove them lyran still looked a little sick no the healingspell i set on you isnt done yet and i dont want you tearing that wound open again go take care of tosspot and find your mare wherever shes gotten herself to ill get rid of them martis piled the bodies together and burned them to ash with magefire it was a bit of a waste of power but the energy liberated by the deaths of the assassins would more than make up for the lossthough martis felt just a little guilty at using that power violent death always released a great deal of energyit was a shortcut to gaining vast quantities of itwhich was why bloodmagic was proscribed by the guild making use of what was released when you had to kill in selfdefense was one thingcoldblooded killing to gain power was something else when martis returned to the campsite she discovered that not only had lyran located his mare and unharnessed and tethered tosspot but that hed made dinner as well browning over the pocketsized fire was a brace of rabbits two she asked quizzically i cant eat more than half of one and where did you get them this one has modest skill with a sling and there were many opportunities as we rode lyran replied and the second one is for breakfast in the morning lyran had placed tosspots saddle on the opposite side of the fire from his own just in front of the open tent martis settled herself on her saddle to enjoy her dinner the night air was pleasantly cool night creatures made sounds around them that were reassuring because it meant that no one was disturbing them the insects of the daylight hours were gone those of the night had not yet appeared and the contradictions in her guards appearance and behavior made a pleasant puzzle to mull over i give up she said at last breaking the silence between them silence that had been punctuated by the crackle of the fire you are the strangest guard i have ever had lyran looked up and the fire revealed his enigmatic expression he had eaten his half of the rabbit but had done so as if it were a duty rather than a pleasure he still looked a bit sickly why does this one seem strange to you magelady you dress like a dancer playing at being a warrior you fight like a friggin guardtroop all by yourselfthen you get sick afterwards because you killed someone you wear silks that would do a harlot proud but you ride a mare thats a damn trained killer what are you boy what land spawned something like you this one comes from fara great distance to the west and south it is not likely that you have ever heard of the people magelady the guardserjant had not as for why this one is the way he isthis one follows a way the way no magelady a way the people believe that there are many such ways and ours is of no more merit than any other our way is the way of balance you said something about balance before now martis curiosity was truly aroused just what does this way entail it is simplicity one must strive to achieve balance in all things in ones life this oneis on a kind of pilgrimage to find such balance to find a place where this one may fit within the pattern of all because this ones nature is such that he does well to live by the sword he must strive to counter this by using that sword in the service of peaceand to cultivate peace in other aspects of his life and in part it must be admitted that this one fosters a helpless outer aspect lyran smiled wryly the magelady will agree that appearing ineffectual does much to throw the opponent off his guard sothat is the what of this one as to the whythe people believe that the better one achieves balance the better one will be reborn i certainly hope you dont include good and evil in your balanceeither that or ill do the cooking from now on lyran laughed no magelady for how could one weigh good and evil assuredly it was good that this one slew your foes but was it not evil to them sometimes things are plainly one or the other but too often it depends upon where one stands ones own self a primary tenet of our way is to do no harm when at all possibleto wound rather than kill subdue rather than wound reason rather than subdue and recall when reasoning that the other may have the right of it simple to state but ai difficult to live by it would seem that most things worth having are wrapped in difficulty have you not spent your life in magecraft and yet still learn and does this not set you farther apart from otherssacrificing knowledge for the common ties of life martis scrutinized her companion across the flames not so young after all not nearly so young as she had thoughtnor so simple it was only the slight build the guileless eyes the innocence of the heartshaped face that made you think child and attractive too damned attractive dont be a fool she scolded herself you havent the time or energy to wastebesides hes young enough to be your son well maybe not your son but too damned young for the likes of you hellfires you have more to think about than a sweetfaced hireling get your mind back to business before we sleep im intending to gather power as i was doing on the road she stretched a little i want you to rouse me when the moon rises mageladywould quiet chanting disturb you lyran asked anxiously this one would offer words for those slain whatever for they wouldnt have mourned you once again lyran had surprised her that is their way not this ones if one does not mourn that one has slain the heart soon dies under other circumstances might they not have been comrades i suppose youre right martis replied thoughtfully no chanting isnt going to disturb me any just make sure you also keep a good watch out for any more surprises of a certainty magelady lyran didnt even seem annoyed at the needless admonition a fact that made martis even more thoughtful professional mercenaries shed known in the past tended to get a bit touchy about mages giving them orders like shed just given him nothing much seemed to ruffle that serene exterior how long she wondered had it taken him to achieve that kind of mindset and what kind of discipline had produced it a puzzle truly a puzzle the next day brought them to a ring of standing stonesthe gatesite the inherent magic residing in this place made it possible to use it as a kind of bridge to almost any other place on the earths surface martis had been to kelvens tower once and with magehabit had memorized the lay of the land surrounding it they would be able to ride straight from here to there once the proper spell was set into motion this would have another benefit besides saving them a long and tiring journey kelven would lose them if he had been tracking them and without knowing exactly where to look for them would not know how many of them had survived his attack they rested undisturbed that evening with martis quickly regaining from the place the energy she spent in shielding their presence there the gate spell took the better part of the next morning to set up martis had no intentions of bringing them in very near for she had other notions as to how she wanted this confrontation to be played out after a light noon meal she activated the gate the standing stones began to glow not from within but as if an unquenchable fire burned along their surfaces the fire from each reached out to join with the fires of the stones on either side before an hour had passed the ring was a nearsolid thing of pulsating orange light martis waited until the powerflux built to an internal drawing that was wellnigh unendurablethen led them at a gallop between two of the stones they rode in through one sidebut not out the other they emerged in the vicinity of kelvens towerand the confrontation martis had been dreading was at hand she wasnt sure whether the fact that there had been no attempt to block them at the gate was good or bad it could be that kelven was having second thoughts about the situation and would be ready to be persuaded to amend his ways it also could be that he was taking no further chances on the skills of underlings or working at a distance and was planning to eliminate her himself in a sorcerers duel they rode through country that was fairly wild and heavily wooded but kelvens tower lay beyond where the woods ended at the edge of a grassplain martis described the situation to lyran who listened attentively then fell silent martis was not inclined to break that silence lost in her own contemplations magelady lyran broke into martis thoughts not long before they were to reach kelvens stronghold is it possible that the magelord may not know about the continued survival of this one its more than possible its likely martis told him ive been shielding our movements ever since the attack but would you have gone on if this one had fallen would it not have been more likely that you would return to the guild hall to seek other guards they had stopped on the crest of a ridge below them lay grasslands and scrub forest that stretched for furlongs in all directions but the one they had come kelvens tower was easily seen from here and about an hours distance away the sun beat down on their heads and insects droned lazily the scene seemed ridiculously incongruous as a site of imminent conflict martis laugheda sound that held no trace of humor anybody else but me would do just that but im stubborn and ive got a rotten temper kelven knows that he watched me drag myself and two pupilshe was one of themthrough a stinking buginfested bog once with no guides and no bodyguards the guides had been killed and the guards were in no shape to follow us ysee wed been attacked by a nightmare i was byzaila not going to let it get away back to its lair by the time we found it i was so mad that i fried the entire herd at the lair by myself if youd been killed back there id be out for bloodor at least a damn convincing show of repentance and i wouldnt let a little thing like having no other guard stand in my way then let this one propose a plan magelady the land below is much like this ones homeland it would be possible to slip away from you and make ones way hidden in the tall grassand this one has another weapon than a sling from his saddlebag lyran took a small but obviously strong bow unstrung and a quiverful of short arrows the weapon is too powerful to use for hunting magelady unless one were hunting larger creatures than rabbits and birds this one could remain within bowshot but unknown to the magelord if you wished im glad you thought of that and i think its more than a good idea martis said gazing at the tower several new thoughts had occurred to her none of them pleasant it was entirely possible that kelven wanted her here had allowed them to walk into a trap if nothing elsethis is an order if kelven takes me captiveshoot me shoot to kill get him too if you can but make sure you kill me theres too many ways he could use me and anyone can be broken if the mage has time enough i can bind my own deathenergy before he can use iti think lyran nodded and slipped off his mare he rearranged saddlepad and pack to make it appear that martis was using the illtempered beast as a pack animal in the time it took for martis to gather up the mares reins he had vanished into the grassland without a trace martis rode towards the tower as slowly as she could giving lyran plenty of time to keep up with the horses and still remain hidden she could see as she came closer to the tower that there was at least one uncertainty that was out of the way shed not have to call challenge to bring kelven out of his towerhe was already waiting for her perhaps she thought with a brightening of hope this meant he was willing to cooperate when lyran saw after taking cover in a stand of scrub that the mage kelven had come out of his tower to wait for martis he lost no time in getting himself positioned within bowshot he actually beat the sorceresss arrival by several moments the spot hed chosen beneath a bush just at the edge of the mowed area that surrounded the tower was ideal in all respects but onesince it was upwind of where the mage stood he would be unable to hear them speak he only hoped hed be able to read the mages intentions from his actions there were small things to alert a watcher to the intent of a mage to attackprovided the onlooker knew exactly what to look for before leaving trebenth had briefed him carefully on the signs to watch for warning of an attack by magic without proper challenge being issued lyran only hoped that his own eyes and instincts would be quick enough greetings martis kelven said evenly his voice giving no clue as to his mindset martis was a little uneasy to see that hed taken to dressing in stark unrelieved black the kelven she remembered had taken an innocent pleasure in dressing like a peacock for the rest he didnt look much different from when hed been her studenthed grown a beard and moustache whose black hue did not quite match his dark brown hair his narrow face still reminded her of a hawks with sharp eyes that missed nothing she looked closer at him and was alarmed to see that his pupils were dilated such that there was very little to be seen of the brown irises drugs sometimes produced that effectparticularly the drugs associated with bloodmagic greetings kelven the tales we hear of you are not good these days she said carefully dismounting and approaching him trying to look stern and angry tales yes those old women on the council are fond of tales i gather theyve sent you to bring the erring sheep back into the fold he said she couldnt tell if he was sneering kelven the course youre set on can do no one any good she faltered a little a recollection of kelven seated contentedly at her feet suddenly springing to mind hed been so like a sonthis new kelven must be some kind of aberration pleaseyou were a good student one of my best there must be a lot of good in you still and you have the potential to reach masterclass if you put your mind to it she was uncomfortably aware that she was pleading and an odd corner of her mind noted the buzzing drone of the insects in the grass behind her i was very fond of you you know i wasill speak for you if you want you can come back to the fold as you put it with no one to hold the past against you but you must also know that no matter how far you go theres only one end for a practitioner of bloodmagic and you must know that if i cant persuade you i have to stop you there was a coldness about him that made her recoil a little from himthe ice of one who had divorced himself from humankind she found herself longing to see just a hint of the old kelven one tiny glimpse to prove he wasnt as far gone as she feared he must be but it seemed no such remnant existed really he smiled i never would have guessed any weapon of magic she would have been prepared for the last thing she ever would have expected was the dagger in his hand she stared at the flash of light off the steel as he lifted it too dumbfounded to do more than raise her hands against it in an ineffectual attempt at defense his attack was completed before shed done more than register the fact that he was making it first you have to beat me teacher he said viciously as he took the single step between them and plunged it into her breast she staggered back from the shock and pain all breath and thought driven from her im no match for you in a sorcerers duel he said a cruel smile curving his lips as his hands moved in the spell to steal her dying power from her not yetbut ill be the match of any of you with all i shall gain from your death incredibly he had moved like a striking snake his every movement preplannedall this had taken place in the space of a few eyeblinks she crumpled to the ground with a gasp of agony both hands clutching ineffectually at the hilt the pain and shock ripped away her ability to think even to set into motion the spell shed set to lock her dying energy away from his use blood trickled hotly between her fingers as her throat closed against the words she had meant to speak to set a deathbinding against him she could only endure the hot agony and the knowledge that she had failedand then looked up in time to see three arrows strike him almost simultaneously two in the chest the third in the throat her hands clenched on the dagger hilt as he collapsed on top of her with a strangling gurgle agony drove her down into darkness her last conscious thought was of gratitude to lyran there were frogs and insects singing which seemed odd to martis no one mentioned frogs or insects in any version of the afterlife that shed ever heard as her hearing improved she could hear nightbirds in the distance and close at hand the sound of a fire and the stirring of nearby horses that definitely did not fit in with the afterlifeunless one counted hellfires and this certainly didnt sound big enough to be one of those her eyes opened slowly gritty and sore and not focusing well lyran sat by her side anxiety lining his brow and exhaustion graying his face either im alive martis coughed or youre deadand i dont remember you being dead you live mageladybut it was a very near thing almost i did not reach you in time you are fortunate that sorcerers are not weaponstrainedno swordsman would have missed your heart as he did martis my name is martisyouve earned the right to use it martis coughed again amazed that there was so little painthat the worst she felt was a vague ache in her lungs a dreamy lassitude and profound weakness why am i still alive even if he missed the heart that blow was enough to kill youre no healer she paused all that lyran had told her about his way running through her mind are you as my hands deal death so they must also preserve life lyran replied yes among my people all who live by weapons are also trained as healers even as healers must learn to use weapons if only to defend themselves and the wounded upon the field of battle he rubbed eyes that looked as red and sore as her own felt since i am not healerborn it was hard very hard i am nearly as weak as you as a consequence it will be many days before i regain my former competence my energy or my strength it is well you have no more enemies that i must face for i would do so i fear on my hands and knees martis frowned you arent talking the way you used to lyran chuckled it is said that even when at the point of death the mage will observe and recordand question yes i use familiar speech with you my magelady the healing for one not born to the gift is not like yoursi sent my soul into your body to heal it for a time we were one that is why i am so wearied you are part of myself as a consequenceand i now speak to you as one of my people thank the gods i was getting very tired of your everlasting this ones they laughed weakly together before martis broke off with another fit of coughing what happens to you when we get back to the guildhold martis asked presently my continued employment by the guild was dependent on your satisfaction with my performance lyran replied since i assume that you are satisfied im alive arent i the mission succeeded im a good bit more than merely satisfied with the outcome then i believe i am to become part of the regular staff to be assigned to whatever mage happens to need a guard andi think here i have found what i sought the place where my sword may serve peace the place the way has designed for me despite his contented words his eyes looked wistful martis was feeling unwontedly sensitive to the nuances in his expression there was something behind those words she had not expectedhopelonging anddirected at her andunder the weariness was there actually desire would that i could continue in your service magemartis i think perhaps we deal well together hmm martis began tentatively not sure she was reading him correctly not daring to believe what she thought she saw im entitled to a permanent hireling as a master i just never exercised the privilege would you be interested as a hirelingalone or could i hope you would have more of me than boughtservice dear gods was he asking what she thought he was asking lyran you surely cant be seriously propositioning me we have been one he sighed touching her cheek lightly as you have felt a tie to me so have i felt drawn to you there is that in each of us that satisfies a need in the other i think icare for you i would gladly be a friend more than friend if you choose but im old enough to be your mother ah lady he smiled his eyes old in his young face what are years illusion do each of us not know the folly of illusion and he cupped one hand gently beneath her cheek to touch his lips to hers as her mouth opened beneath his she was amazed at the stirring of passionit was impossible but it was plainly there despite years wounds and weariness maybemaybe there was something to this after all i she began then chuckled so he cocked his head to one side and waited for enlightenment wellmy friends will think im insane but this certainly fits your way of balancemy grey hairs against your youth so the smile warmed his eyes in a way martis found fascinating and totally delightful then we shall confound your friends who lack your clear sight we shall seek balance together yes she stretched out her hand a little to touch his already feeling some of her years dissolving before that smile oh yes dragons teeth trebenth broad of shoulder and red of hair and beard was guardserjant to the mage guild not to put too fine a point on it he was guardserjant at high ridings the chief citadel of the mage guild and site of the academe arcanum the institution of highest magicks as such he was the warrior responsible for the safety and wellbeing of the mages he served this was hardly the soft post that the uninformed thought it to be mages had many enemiesand were terribly vulnerable to physical attack it only took one knife in the dark to kill a magetrebenths concern was to circumvent that vulnerability by overseeing their collective safety in high ridings or their individual safety by means of the bodyguards he picked and trained to stand watchdog over them and there were times when his concern for their wellbeing slid over into areas that had nothing to do with arms and assassinations this was lookingto his worried eyes at leastlike one of those times he was standing on the cold granite of the landing at the top of a set of spiraling tower stairs outside a particular tower apartment in the guildmembers hall the highest apartment in a tower reserved for the masterclass mages sunlight poured through a skylight above him reflecting off the pale wooden paneling of the wall he faced there was no door at the head of this helical staircase there had been one but the occupant of the apartment had spelled it away presumably so that her privacy could not be violated but although trebenth could not enter he could hear something of what was going on beyond that featureless paneled wall masterclass sorceress martis orleva kiriste of high ridings a chief instructress of the academe and a woman of an age at least equal to trebenths middle years wasgiggling giggling like a giddy adolescent mart hasnt been the same since she faced down kelven ben gloomed shifting his weight restlessly from his left foot to his right i thought at first it was just because she hadnt recovered yet from that stabwound losing that much bloodgods it would be enough to fuddle anyones mind for a while then i thought it was emotional backlash from having been forced to kill somebody that was almost a substitute child for her but thenshe started acting odder instead of saner first she requisitioned that outlander as her own and then installed him in her quartersand is making no secret that shes installed him in her bed as well its like shes lost whatever sense of proportion she had behind the honeycolored paneling trebenth heard another muffled giggle and his spirits slipped another notch i thought id finally found her the perfect bodyguard with that outlander lyran one that wouldnt get in her way he was so quiet soso humble was it all a trick to worm his way into some womans confidence what the hell did i really bring in what did i let latch onto her soul he shifted his weight again sweating with indecision finally he couldnt bear it any longer and tapped with one knuckle uncharacteristically hesitant in the area where the door had been go away martis called the acid tone of her low voice clearly evident even through the muffling of the wood i am not on call go pester uthedre mart ben replied unhappily its ben it isnt there was a shimmer of golden light and the door popped into existence under his knuckles in the fleeting instant between one tap and the next then it swung open so unexpectedly that he was left stupidly tapping empty air beyond the door was martis sitting room a tiny room mostly taken up by a huge brown couch with overstuffed cushions two people were curled close together there halfdisappearing into the soft pillows one was a middleaged squarefaced woman greying blond hair twined into long braids that kept coming undone beside her was a slender young man his shoulderlength hair nearly the color of dark amber his obliquely slanted eyes black and unfathomable he lookedto trebenths mindfully young enough to be martis son in point of fact he was her hireling bodyguardand her lover ben you old goat martis exclaimed from her seat on the couch why didnt you say it was you in the first place id never lock you out no matter what but you know im no damn good at aurareading to trebenths relief martis was fully and decently clothed as was the young outland fighter lyran seated beside her she lowered the hand shed used to gesture the door back into reality and turned the final flourish into a beckoning crook of her finger with no little reluctance trebenth sidled into the sunflooded outermost room of her suite she cocked her head to one side her grey eyes looking suspiciously mischievous and bright her generous mouth quirked in an expectant halfsmile well she asked im waiting to hear what you came all the way up my tower to ask trebenth flushed itsabout oh my you sound embarrassed bet i can guess myself and my fartooyoung lover hmm mart ben exclaimed blushing even harder ididnt dont bother ben she replied lounging back against the cushions as lyran watched his superior with a disconcertingly serene and thoughtful expression on his lean face i figured it was all over high ridings by now zailas toenails why is it that when some old goat of a man takes a young wench to his bed everyone chuckles and considers it a credit to his virility but when an old woman you are not old lyran interrupted her softly in an almost musical tenor flatterer she said shaking her head at him i know better so why is it when an older woman does the same everyone figures her mind is going trebenth was rather at a loss to answer that fartoodirect question never mind let it go i suspect though that youre worried about what ive let leech onto me let me ask you a countering question is lyran causing trouble acting up flaunting statusspending my gold like water boasting about his connections orhis conquest well ben admitted slowly no he acts just like he did before so quiet you hardly know hes there except except what some of the others have been goin for him at practice mostly and beside her lyran shifted and laid his right hand unobtrusivelybut protectivelyover the one of hers resting on the brown couch cushion between them everything stayed under control until this morning harverth turned the dirty side of his tongue on you stead of lyran seeing as he wasnt gettin anywhere baiting the boy harverth was armed lyran wasnt martis raised one eyebrow so what happened i was gonna mix in but they finished it before i could get involved it didnt take long harverths with the healers they tell me he might walk without limping in a year or so but they wont promise hard to heal shattered kneecaps martis turned a reproachful gaze on the young longhaired man beside her lyran flushed pardon he murmured this one was angered for your sake more than this one knew this one lost both balance and temper you lost moren that boy ben growled you lost me a trained blowhard martis interrupted him you forget that you assigned that dunderhead to me oncehes damned near useless and hes a pain in the aura to a mage like me you know damned well youve been on the verge of kicking that idiot out on his rear a half dozen timesyouve told me so yourself well now youve got an excuse to pension him offit was my hireling and my socalled honor involved deduct the bloodprice from my account and throw the bastard out of high ridings there are you satisfied ben wasnt mart he said pleadingly its not just that what is it the puppies in your kennel still likely to go for lyran no not after this morning what is it then afraid im going to become a laughingstock got news for you ben i already am and i dont give a damn or are you afraid for me afraid that im making a fool of myself since that was exactly what trebenth had been thinking he flushed again and averted his eyes from the pair on the sofa ben martis said softly when have you ever seen us acting as anything other than mage and hireling outside of my quarters havent we at least kept the appearance of respectability i guess he mumbled hot with embarrassment people would be talking even if there was nothing between us theyve talked about me ever since i got my mastery there were years at the beginning when everybody was certain id earned it in bed not in the circles and when you and ithey talked about that too didnt they the only difference now is that im about half again older than lyran people just dont seem to like that much but my position is in no danger when the push comes its my power the guild cares about not what damage i do to an already dubious reputation and i dont care im happy maybe for the first time in years maybe in my life he looked up sharply are you really are you sure im sure she replied with absolute candor as lyran raised his chin slightly and his eyes silently dared his superior to challenge the statement trebenth sighed and felt a tiny irrational twinge of jealousy after all he had margwynwybut hed never been able to bring that particular shine to martis eyesnot even at the height of their love affair all right then he said resigned as long as you dont care about the gossip not in the slightest i guess i was out of line no ben martis replied fondly youre a friend friends worry about friends im glad you care enough to worry my wits havent gone south honestly theni guess ill go see about paying a certain slacker off and pitching him out martis gestured the door closed behind the towering guardserjant then removed the door with another gesture and turned back to her seatmate with frustration in her eyes why didnt you tell me that you were being harassed lyran shook his head his light brown hair shimmered in the warm sun pouring through the skylight above his head it didnt matter words are only as worthy as the speaker it got beyond words i am better than anyone except the guildserjant it wasnt a boast martis knew but a plain statement of fact what did i have to fear from harassment it was only it was lyrans turn to flush although he continued to hold her gaze with his own eyes i could not bear to hear you insulted something rather atavistic deep down inside glowed with pleasure at his words so you leapt to my defense hmm how could i not martisladylove his eyes warmed to her unspoken approval she laughed and leaned into the soft cushion behind her i suppose im expected to reward my defender now hmm now that youve fought for my honor he chuckled and shook his head silly and primitive of us doubtless but it does rouse up certain instinctive responses no she slid a little closer on the couch and reached up to lace the fingers of both hands behind his neck under his long hair not even the silk of his tunic was as soft as that wonderful hair you know good and well how i feel the healingmagic of his people that he had used to save her life had bound their souls together that was the reason why lyran did not refer to himself in the third person when they were alone together and it was why each tended to know now a little of what the other felt it would have been rather futile to deny her feelings even if shed wanted to which she didnt are you happy my magelady she felt an unmistakable twinge of anxiety from him do the words of fools hurt you if they do they dont she reassured him coming nearer to him so that she could hold him closer and bury her face in that wonderful magical hair she wondered now how she could ever have thought it too long and untidy or why she had thought him effeminate she breathed in the special scent of him a hint of sunlight and spicy grasses and she felt the tension of anxiety inside him turn to tension of another kind his hands strong yet gentle slid around her waist and drew her closer still but a few hours later there came a summons she could not ignore a magemessage from the council and the moment the two of them passed her threshold it would have been impossible for anyone to have told that they were lovers from their demeanor martis was no mean actressshe was diplomat and teacher as well as sorceress and both those professions often required the ability to play a part and lyran with his incredible mental discipline and a degree of training in control that matched and was in fact incorporated in his physical training could have passed for an icesculpture only martis could know for certain that his chill went no deeper than the surface he was her bodyguard he was almost literally her possession until and unless he chose not to serve her and as such he went with her everywhereeven into the hallows of the council chamber just as the bodyguards of the five councilors did the carved double doors of a wood so ancient as to have turned black swung open without a hand touching them and she and lyran entered the windowless council chamber it was lit entirely by magelights as ancient as the doors all still burning with bright yellow incandescence high up on the walls of white marble the room was perfectly circular and rimmed with a circle of malachite in the center was a second circle inlaid in porphyry in the white marble of the floor behind that circle was the halfcircle of the council table of blacklacquered wood and the five matching thronelike chairs behind it all five of those chairs were occupied by mages in the purple robes of the mageguild council only one of the councilors the cadaverous masterclass mage ronethar gethry gave lyran so much as a glance and from the way ronethars eyes flickered from lyran to martis and back the sorceress rather guessed that it was because of the gossip that he noticed her guard at all the rest ignored the swordsman as they ignored their own hirelings each standing impassively behind his masters chair garbed from head to toe as was lyran in mageguild hireling red red leathers red lineneven one like lyran in red silk the councilors were worried even martis could read that much behind their impassive masks they wasted no time on petty nonsense about her private life what brought them all to the council chamber was serious business not accusations about whom she was dallying with not that theyd dare take her to task over it she was the equal of any of the mages in those five seats she could sit there behind the council table any time she chose she simply had never chosen to do so they knew it and she knew it and they knew she knew she was not accountable to them or anything but her conscience for her behavior only for her actions as the representative of the guild the fact was that she didnt want a council seat as a masterclass mage she had little enough freedom as it was sitting on the council would restrict it still further the masterclass mage served only the guild the powers of the masterclass being deemed too dangerous to be put at hire martis rotund old dabrel was serving as chief this month he was something less of an old stick than the others councilor she responded how may i serve my guild by solving a mystery he replied the people of lyosten have been acting in a most peculiar and disturbing fashion he means theyve been finding excuses to put off a guild inspection sourfaced and acidvoiced liavel interrupted first there was a feverso they saythen a drought then the road was blocked by a flood it doesnt ring true nobody else around lyosten is having any similar troubles we believe theyre hiding something lyosten is a free city isnt it martis askedwhos in charge the citymastera man called bolger freedman not a guildsman a pity that means we cant put pressure on him through his own guild martis mused youre right obviously they must be covering up something so whats the guess we think dabrel said leaning over the table and steepling his fingertips together that their local mage has gone renegade in collusion with the townsfolk that hes considering violating the compacts against using magecraft in offensive manner against nonmages theyve been feuding off and on with portravus for decades we think they may be deciding to end the feud and portravus has no mage said mousy herjes looking as much frightened as worried just a couple of hedgewizards and some assorted low magick practitioners and not a lot of money to spare to hire one martis snorted just what i wanted to hear why me youre known replied dabrel they dont dare cause you any overt magical harm youre one of the best at offensive and defensive magics furthermore you can activate the gates to get in fairly close to the town before they can think up another excuse well inform them that youre coming about a day before youre due to arrive and theres another factor creaked ancient cetallas your hireling the boy is good damned good best ive seen incant remember when no free city scum is going to get past him to take you out hes a healer of sorts so ben tells us thats no bad thing to have about a healer you can trust just in case some physical accident happens and you must admit hes got a pretty powerful incentive to keep you alive the old man wheezed a little and quirked an amused eyebrow at the two of them martis couldnt help but notice the twinkle of laughter in his eyes she bit her lip to keep from smiling so the old bird still had some juice in himand wasnt going to grudge her her own pleasures you have a point she admitted and yes lyran does have something more at stake with me than just his contract she was rather surprised to see the rest of the councilors nod soberly well well well they may not like itthey may think im some kind of fool or worsebut theyve got to admit that what lyran and i have can be pretty useful to the guild how soon do you want us to leave are you completely recovered from dealing with kelven physically yes mentally emotionallyto be honest only time will tell betrayal gods thats not an easy thing to deal with admittedand were setting you up to deal with another traitor dabrel had the grace to look guilty at least this one isnt one of my former favorite pupils she replied grimacing crookedly i dont even think i know him you dont herjes said i trained him he also is not anywhere near kelvens potential and he isnt dabbling in bloodmagic speaking of whichhave you recovered arcanely as well as physically im at full power i can go any time in the morning then in the morning she inclined her head slightly felt the faintest whisper of magic brush her by showoffs she thought as she heard the doors behind her open two can play that game we will be on our way at dawn councilors she said carefully setting up the rolibera spell in her mind and wrapping it carefully about both herself and lyran there werent too many mages even at masterclass level that could translate two people at once she braced herself formed the energy into a tightly coiled spring with her mind then spoke one word as she inclined her head again there was a flash of light behind her eyes and a fluttery feeling in her stomach as if she had suddenly dropped the height of a man and she and lyran stood sidebyside within the circle carved into the floor of her private workroom she turned to see the mask of indifference drop from him and his thin narrow face come alive with mingled humor and chiding must you always be challenging them beloved she set her mouth stubbornly he shook his head alas he chuckled i fear if you stopped i would no longer know you challenge and avoidance he held out his arms and she flowed into them truly beloved he murmured into her ear as she pressed her cheek into the silk of his tunic shoulder we balance each other they would not be riding jesalis and tosspot those beasts of foul temper and fiercely protective instincts this was a mission which would depend as much on the impression they would give as their capabilities and tosspot and jesalis would be unlikely to impress anyone instead when they descended the tower stairs in the pale pearly light of dawn martis found the grooms in the stonepaved courtyard holding the reins of two showy palfreys a grey and a bay tethered behind the bay on a lead rope was a glossy mule loaded with packs the harness of the grey was dyed a rich purple and that of the bay was scarlet lyran approached the horses with care for the eyes of the bay rolled with alarm at the sight of the stranger he ran his hands over their legs once he could get near them and walked slowly back to martis side with his arms folded shaking his head a little hmm she asked worthless he replied i hope we will not be needing to entrust our lives to them no strength no staminaand worst of all no sense theyre just for show martis frowned feeling a little dubious herself we arent supposed to have to do any hard riding or long except for the gallop to take us through the gates a days ride to the first gate half a day to the second in and out of both gates then a ride of less than half a day to the city if all goes well and what if all does not go well i martis fell silent well thats why youre along lyran looked back over his shoulder at the horses and grimaced this one will do the best one can magelady he said formally will the magelady mount martis had been doing more with lyrans aid than her colleagues suspected a few moons ago she would not have been able to mount unaidednow she swung into her saddle with at least some of the grace of her lover the exercises he had been insisting she practice had improved her strength her wind her flexibilityshe was nearly as physically fit as shed been twentyodd years ago when shed first come to the academe lyran mounted at nearly the same moment and his bay tried to shy sideways it jerked the reins out of the grooms hands and danced backwards then reared lyrans mouth compressed but that was the only sign that he was disturbed that martis could see the scarlet silk of his breeches rippled as he clamped his legs around the bay geldings barrel and the reins seemed to tighten of themselves as he forced the gelding back down to the ground and fought him to a standstill as the horse stood sweating sides heaving lyran looked up at her this one will do what this one can magelady he repeated soberly the grey palfrey martis rode was of a more placid disposition for which she was profoundly grateful she signed to the groom to release his hold and turned its head to face the open wooden gate set into the stone walls of the court at lyrans nod she nudged it with her heels and sent it ambling out beneath the portcullis they rode in single file through the city lyran trailing the mule at a respectful distance from his employer four times the bay started and shied at inconsequential commonplaces each time lyran had to fight the beast back onto all four hooves and into sweating good behavior the last time seemed to convince it that there was no unseating its rider for it did not make another attempt once outside the city walls they reversed their positions with lyran and the mule going first ordinarily martis would now be spending her time in halftrance gathering power from the living things around her but her mount was not her faithful tosspot who could be relied upon to keep a fallingdown drunk in the saddleand lyrans beast was all too likely to shy or dance again and perhaps send her gelding off as well so instead of gathering alwaysuseful energy she fumed and fretted and was too annoyed even to watch the passing landscape they reached the gate at sunset the ring of standing stones in the center of the meadow stood out black against the flaming glow of the declining sun the wide weedgrown fields around them were otherwise empty not even sheep cared to graze this near a gate the evening wind carried a foretaste of autumnal chill as it sighed through the grasses around them martis squinted against the bloody light and considered their options lyran had finally decided to exhaust his misbehaving mount by trotting it in circles around her as they traveled down the road until it was too tired to fuss now it was docile but plainly only because it was weary it still rolled its eyes whenever a leaf stirred the sorceress urged her gelding up beside his can you get one last run out of him martis asked anxiously probably lyran replied why id like to take this gate now if we can while that misbegotten horse of yours is too tired to bolt he looked at her in that silent blankfaced way he had when he was thinking what if he did bolt the gods only know where youd end up she told him frankly if he got out of my influencei cant predict what point beyond the gate youd come out at or even what direction it would be in and if i cant get him to a gallop almost the sameif you didnt keep within my aura youd come out somewhere between here and where id land he reached out and touched her face with the tips of his fingers you seem tired beloved i am tired she admitted confessing to him what she would admit to no other living person but im not too tired to gatespell and i think its safer to do it now than it will be later then i will force this bundle of contrariness disguised as a horse into keeping up with you hold butterbrains here would you she passed him the reins of her mount not trusting it to stand firm on its own she drew entirely into herself centering all her concentration on the hoarded power within herself drawing it gradually to the surface with unspoken words and careful mental probes her eyes were closed but she could feel the energy stirring flowing coming up fromelsewhereand beginning to trickle along the nerves of her spine at first it was barely a tingle but the power built up quickly until she was vibrating to its silent song at that point she opened the channels to her hands raising her arms out in front of her and holding her hands out with the open palms facing the ring of standing stones the power surged along her arms and leapt for the ring of the gate with an eagerness that was almost an emotion she sang the words of the gatespell now sang it in a barely audible whisper her eyes were half open but she really wasnt paying a great deal of attention to anything but the flow of power from her to the gate the ring of stones began to glow glowing as if they were stealing the last of the suns fire and allowing it to run upon their surfaces the color of the fire began to lighten turning from deep red to scarlet to a fiery orange then the auras surrounding each gatestone extended reaching for then touching the auras beside it until the circle became one pulsating ring of goldenorange light martis felt the proper moment approaching and signed to lyran to hand her back her reins she waited weighing judgingthen suddenly spurred her mount into one of the gaps between the stones with lyrans gelding practically on top of her horses tail they emerged into a forest clearing beneath a moon already high exactly five leagues from the next gate gods i wish i had tosspot under me martis muttered facing the second gate under a bright noontide sun this one stood in the heart of the forest and the stones were dwarfed by the stand of enormous pine trees that towered all about them the sorceress was feeling depleted and she had not been able to recuperate the energy shed spent on the last spell we could wait lyran suggested we could rest here and continue on in the morning martis shook her head with regret i only wish we could but it isnt healthy to camp near a gatelook at the way the magics twisted those bushes over there the ones growing up against the stones and besides we need to come as close to surprising our hosts as we can she coughed there was a tickle in the back of her throat that threatened to turn into a cold lyran noted that cough too and tightened his mouth in unvoiced disapproval but made no further objections martis handed him her reins and began the second spell but they emerged not into a sunlit clearing as shed expected but into the teeth of the worst storm shed ever seen rain cold as the rains of winter lashed at them soaking them to the skin in moments it would have been too dark to see except that lightning struck so often that the road was clearly lit most of the time lyran spurred his horse up beside the sorceress as she gasped for breath beneath the onslaught of the icy water hed pulled his cloak loose from the lashings that held it to his saddle and was throwing it over her shoulders before she even had recovered the wit to think about the fact that she needed it the cloak was sodden in seconds but it was woolwarm enough even though wet she stopped shivering a little but the shock of chill coming on top of the strain of the spells had unbalanced her a little she fumbled after her reins but her mind wouldnt quite work she couldnt seem to think where they should be going lyran put his hand under her chin and turned her face toward his she blinked at him at his searching expression as revealed by the flickers of lightning some rational little bit of her that hadnt been stunned hoped idly that he remembered what shed told him once about how mages sometimes went into spellshock when they were low on energy and hit with unexpected physical conditions this happened most frequently when they were ungrounded and uncenteredand the gatespell demanded that she be both when taking them in transit evidently he did for he took the reins out of her unresisting fingers and nudged his gelding into a nervy shuddering walk leaving her to cling to the saddle as best she could while he led her mount it was impossible to hear or be heard over the nearly continuous roar of the thunder so she didnt even try to speak to him she just closed her eyes and concentrated on getting herself centered and grounded again so it was that she never noticed when the road approached the brink of a riveronce peaceful now swollen and angry with flood water she knew that there was such a road and such a rivershe knew that they were to cross it before reaching lyosten she knew that there was a narrow aged bridge that was still nonetheless sound but she was too deeply sunk within herself to see it as lyran urged the horses onto its span but she felt the lightningstrike so close it scorched the wood of the bridge not ten paces in front of them and as her eyes snapped open she saw lyrans horse rearing above her in complete panica darkly writhing shape that reared and thrashedand toppled over onto hers she had no time to react she felt herself go numb and openmouthed in fear and then pain as all of them horses humans and mule crashed through the railing of the bridge to plunge into the churning water below she flailed wildly with unfocused energy trying to form up something to catch themand lost spell and all in the shock of hitting the raging water martis pulled herself up onto the muddy bank scraping herself across the rocks and treeroots protruding from it and dragging lyran with her by the shoulderfabric of his tunic she collapsed halfin halfout of the water too spent to go any farther the swordsman pulled himself coughing up onto the bank beside her a child of open plains he couldnt swim fortunately for both of them martis could and equally fortunately hed had the wit to go limp when he felt her grabbing his tunic the stormnow that the damage was donewas slackening are you all right she panted turning her head and raising herself on her arms enough to be able to see him while her teeth chattered like temple rattles lyran had dragged himself up into a sitting position and was clutching a sapling as if it were a lover his eyes were bruised and swollen one of them almost shut and there was a nasty welt along the side of his face he coughed swallowed nodded i thinkyes good she fell back onto the bank cheek pressed into the mud trying to keep from coughing herself if she didit felt as if she might well cough her aching lungs out she fought the cough with closed eyes the rain plastering hair and clothing flat to her skin this is witched weather the power is everywhere wild undisciplined how could that lyosten mage have let himself get so out of control but that was just a passing thought unimportant the important thing was the cold the aching weariness she was so cold now that she had gone beyond feeling it martis she was drifting drifting away being carried off to somewhere where there was sun and warmth in fact she was actually beginning to feel warm not cold she felt lyran shake her shoulder and didnt care all she wanted to do was sleep shed never realized how soft mud could be martis it was the sharpedged fear in his voice as much as the stinging slap he gave her that woke her she got her eyes open with difficulty what she asked stupidly unable to think beloved thena you are afire with fever he said pulling her into his arms and chafing her limbs to get the blood flowing i cannot heal disease only wounds fight thisyou must fight this or you will surely die ah she groaned and tried to pummel the fog that clouded her mind away but it was a battle doomed to be lost she felt the fog take her and drifted away again lyran halfcarried halfdragged the mage up the last few feet of the road to the gates of lyosten the horses were gone and the mule and with them everything except what they had carried on their persons that had not been ripped away by the floodwaters his two swords were gone he had only his knife his clothing and the money belt beneath his tunic martis had only her robes no implements of magic or healing no cloak to keep her warm at least she had not succumbed to shock or the colddeath she was intermittently conscious if not coherent but she was illvery ill and like to become worse the last few furlongs of road had been a waking nightmare the rain stopped as if it had been shut off but the breeze that had sprung up had chilled them even as it had dried their clothing once past the thin screen of trees lining the river there had been nothing to buffer it it hadnt helped that lyran could see the bulk of lyosten looming in the distance dark grey against a lighter grey sky hed forced himself and martis into motion but more often than not he was supporting her sheer exhaustion made them stagger along the muddy road like a pair of drunks getting mired to the knees in the process it was nearly sunset when they reached the gates of the city he left martis leaning against the wood of the wall and went to pound on the closed gates themselves while she slid slowly down to crouch in a miserable huddle fruitlessly seeking shelter from the wind a mansized door opened in the greater gate and a surly bearded fighter blocked it whats the ruckus he growled lyran drew himself up and tried not to shiver this one is guard to martis master sorceress and envoy of the mages guild he replied his voice hoarse his throat rasping there has been an accident sure tell me another one the guard jeered looking from lyran to the bedraggled huddle that was martis and back again he started to close the portal you think ive never heard that one before go around to th beggars gate wait lyran blocked the door with his foot but before he could get another word out the guard unexpectedly lashed out with the butt of his pike catching him with a painful blow to the stomach it knocked the wind out of him and caused him to land on his rump in the mud of the road the door in the gate slammed shut lyran lowered martis down onto the pallet and knelt beside her he covered her with every scrap of ragged blanket or quilt that he could find she was half out of her mind with fever now and coughing almost constantly the cheap lamp of rockoil gave off almost as much smoke as light which probably didnt help the coughing any martis he whispered hoping against hope for a sane response this time he finally got one her eyes opened and there was sense in them lyr she went into a coughing fit he helped her to sit up and held a mug of water to her mouth she drank her hand pressed against his and the hand was so hot it frightened him thena he said urgently you are ill very ill i cannot heal sickness only hurts tell me what i must do take meto the citymaster he shook his head i tried they will not let me near i cannot prove that i am what i say gods and i cantmagic to prove it you havent even been answering me he put the cup on the floor and wedged himself in behind her supporting her she closed her eyes as if even the dim light of the lamp hurt them her skin was hot and dry and tightfeeling as he stroked her forehead the stormwitched you said as much in raving so i guessed it better to avoid looking for the city wizard tell me what i must do is theremoney a little a very little gettrevaineroot make tea he started and poison you gods and demons not poison she coughed againitll put mewhere i can trance heal myself only way but only way i know she repeated and closed her eyes within moments the slackness of her muscles told him shed drifted off into delirium again he lowered her back down to the pallet and levered himself to his feet the bed and the lamp were all the furnishings this hole of a room had martis had bigger closets back at high ridings and hed been lucky to find the room in the first place the old woman who rented it to him had been the first person hed accosted that had felt honest he blew out the lamp and made his way down to the street getting directions from his hostess he headed for the marketplace the ragged and threadbare folk who jostled him roused his anxiety to a feverpitch he sensed that many of them would willingly knife him from behind for little or no reason he withdrew into himself shivering mentally and put on an icy shell of outward calm the streets were crowded lyran moved carefully within the flow of traffic being cautious to draw no attention to himself he was wearing a threadbare tunic and breeches nearly identical to a dozen others around him his own magehireling silk was currently adorning martis limbs beneath her magerobes the silk was one more layer of covering against the chilland he didnt like the notion of appearing in even stained magehireling red in public not around here he closed his mind to the babble and his nose to the stench of unwashed bodies uncleaned privies and garbage that thickened the air about him but these people worried him he had only his knife for defense what if some of this streetscum should learn about martis and decide she was worth killing and robbing if he had his swords or even just a single sword of the right reach and weight he could hold off an armybut he didnt nor could he afford one the only blades hed seen yet within his scanty resources were not much better than cheap metal clubs finally he reached the marketplace trevaineroot was easy enough to find being a common ratpoison he chose a stall whose owner felt reasonably honest and whose wares looked properly preserved and began haggling a few moments later he slid his hand inside his tunic to extract the single coin he required from the heartbreakingly light moneybelt separating it from the others by feel the herbalist handed over the scrap of root bound up in a bit of old paper without a second glance lyran hadnt bought enough to seem suspicious but then it didnt take much to make a single cup of strong tea lyran turned and narrowly avoided colliding with a scarred man a man who walked with the air of a tiger and whose eyes were more than a little mad lyran ducked his head and willed himself invisible with all his strength if only he had a sword the need was beginning to be more than an itchit was becoming an ache lyran was heading out of the market and back to the boardinghouse when he felt an unmistakable mental pull not unlike the calling he had felt when he first was moved to take up the way of the sword the pull he had felt when he had chosen his teacher it did not feel wrong or unbalanced rather it was as if something was sensing the need in him for a means to protect martis and was answering that need hardly thinking he followed that pull trusting to it as he had trusted to the pull that led him to the doorstep of the woman destined to be his teacher and as he had followed the pull that had led him ultimately to the mage guild at high ridings and to martis this time it led him down the twisting crooked path of a strangely silent street a street hemmed by tall buildings so that it scarcely saw the sun a narrow street that was wide enough only for two people to pass abreast and at the end of itfor it proved to be a deadend street which accounted in part for the silencewas an odd little junk shop there were the expected bins of rags cracked pottery pieces the scavenged flotsam of a thousand lives nothing ever went to waste in this quarter rags could be patched together into clothing or quilts like those now covering martis bits of crockery were destined to be fitted and cemented into a crazypaving that would pass as a tiled floor old papers went to wrap parcels or to eke out a thinning shoesole no nothing was ever thrown away here but there was more to this shop than junk lyran could sense it people could find what they needed here you require something lad said a soft voice at his elbow lyran jumpedhe hadnt sensed any presence at his sideyet there was a strange little man scarcely half lyrans height a dwarf with short legs and blunt clever hands and bright birdlike eyes and a kindness like that of the widow who had rented them her extra room then brought every bit of covering she had to spare to keep martis warm a sword lyran said hesitantly this one needs a sword i should think you do replied the little man after a long moment of sizing lyran up a swordsman generally does need a sword and it cant be an illbalanced bludgeon eitherthat would be worse than nothing eh lad lyran nodded slowly but this onehas but little the man barked rather than laughed but his good humor sounded far more genuine than anything coming from the main street and marketplace lad if you had money you wouldnt be here now would you let me see what i can do for you he waddled into the shop door past the bins of rags and whatnot lyrans eyes followed him into the darkness of the doorway but couldnt penetrate the gloom in a moment the shopkeeper was back a long slim shape wrapped in oily rags in both his hands he handed the burden to lyran with a kind of courtly flourish here you be lad he said i think that may have been what was calling you the rags fell away and the little man caught them before they hit the paving stones at first lyran was conscious only of disappointment the hilt of this weapon had once been ornamented wrapped in gold wire perhapsbut there were empty sockets where the gems had been and all traces of gold had been stripped away left in pawn to me but the owner never came back poor man the shopkeeper said shaking his head a good man fallen on hard timesunsheath it lad the blade was awkward in his hand for a moment the hilt hard to hold with the rough metal bare in his palmbut as he pulled it from its sheath it seemed to come almost alive he suddenly found the balancing of it and as the point cleared the sheath it had turned from a piece of dead metal to an extension of his arm he had feared that it was another of the useless dressswords the ones he had seen too many times worthless mild steel done up in longgone jewels and plating this swordthis blade had belonged to a fighter had been made for a swordsman the balance the temper were almost too good to be true it more than equaled his lost twin blades it surpassed them with this one blade in hand he could easily have bested a twinlyran armed with his old swordpair that was the extent of the edge this blade could give him howhow much he asked mouth dry first you must answer me true the little man said softly you be the lad with the sick lady no the one that claimed the lady to be from the mage guild lyran whirled stance proclaiming that he was on his guard the dwarf simply held out empty hands no harm to you lad no harm meant tell me true and the blades yours for three copper bits tell me not or tell me liei wont sell it flat what if this one is not that person lyran hedged so long as the answer be true the bargain be true lyran swallowed hard and followed the promptings of his inner guides this oneis he admitted with reluctance this one and the lady are what this one claimsbut none will heed the dwarf held out his hand three copper bits he said mildly and some advice for free lyran fumbled out the coins hardly able to believe his luck the worst pieces of potmetal pounded into the shape of a sword were selling for a silveryet this strange little man had sold him a blade worth a hundred times that for the price of a round of cheese this one never rejects advice but you may or may not heed it eh the man smiled showing a fine set of startlingly white teeth right enough you get your lady to tell you the story of the dragons teeth then tell her that bolger freedman has sown them but cant harvest them lyran nodded though without understanding theres some of us that never agreed with him theres some of us would pay dearly to get shut of what weve managed to get into tell your lady thatand watch your backs im not the only one whos guessed lyran learned the truth of the little mans words long before he reached the widows boardinghouse the gang of streettoughs lying in ambush for him were probably considered canny crafty and subtle by the standards of the area but lyran knew that they were there as he entered the sidestreet and he knew where they were moments before they attacked him the new sword was in his hands and moving as the first of them struck him from behind it sliced across the thugs midsection as easily as if lyran had been cutting bread not flesh and with just about as much resistance while the bully was still falling lyran took out the one dropping on him from the wall beside him with a graceful continuation of that cut and kicked a third rushing him from out of an alley delivering a blow to his knee that shattered the kneecap and then forced the knee to bend in the direction opposite to that which nature had intended for a human he couldnt get the blade around in time to deal with the fourth so he ducked under the blow and brought the pommel up into the mans nose shattering the bone and driving the splinters into the brain and while the fifth man stared in openmouthed stupefication lyran separated his body from his head before anyone could poke a curious nose into the street to see what all the noise was about lyran vaulted to the top of the wall to his left and from there to the roof of the building it surrounded he scampered quickly over the roof and down again on the other side taking the time to clean and sheath the sword and put it away before dropping down into the next street after all he hadnt spent his childhood as a thief without learning something about finding unconventional escape routes about the time he had taken a half a dozen paces alarm was raised in the next street rather than running away lyran joined the crowd that gathered about the five bodies craning his neck like any of the people around him wandering off when he couldnt get a look a childhood of thieving had taught him the truth of what his people often said if you would be taken for a crow join the flock and caw lyran took the cracked mug of hot water from his hostess then shooed her gently out he didnt want her to seeand perhaps recognizewhat he was going to drop into it she probably wouldnt understand for that matter he didnt understand he just trusted martis his lover tossed her head on the bundle of rags that passed for a pillow and muttered her face sweatstreaked her hair lank and sodden he soothed her as best he could feeling oddly helpless when the water was lukewarm and nearly black he went into a half trance and soulcalled her until she woke againto his reliefwhen he finally brought her to consciousness there was foggy sense in her gray eyes i have the tea thena he said helping her into a sitting position she nodded stifling a coughing fit and made a weak motion with her hand interpreting it correctly he held the mug to her lips she clutched at it with both hands but her hands shook so that he did not release the mug only let her guide it he lowered her again to the pallet when she had finished the foul stuff sitting beside her and holding her hands in his afterwards how long will this take she shook her head a bit of time before the drug takes after that i dont know she coughed doubling over he supported her have you ever known any story about dragons teeth my lady he asked reluctantly iwas advised to tell you that bolger has sown the dragons teeth but cannot harvest them she shook her head slightly a puzzled frown creasing her foreheadthen her eyes widened harvest gods i the drug chose that moment to take her between one word and the next her eyes glazed then closed lyran swore in three languages fluently and creatively it was some time before he ran out of invective i know bout dragons teeth said a high young voice from the halfopen door behind him lyran jumped in startlement for the second time that day truly anxiety for martis was dulling his edge he turned slowly to see the widows youngest son peeking around the doorframe and would you tell this one of dragons teeth he asked the dirtyfaced urchin as politely as he could manage encouraged the youngster pushed the door open a little more you aint never seen a dragon he asked lyran shook his head and crooked his finger the boy sidled into the room clasping his hands behind his back to the widows credit only the childs face was dirtythe cutdown tunic he wore was threadbare but reasonably clean there are no dragons in this ones homeland be there mages the boy asked and at lyrans negative headshake the child nodded that be why dragons aint natural beasts they be magemade dont breed neither you want nother dragon you take tooth from a live dragon an plant it only thing is baby dragons come up hungry an mean takes a tamed dragon to harvest em else they go out killin an feedin an get the taste fer fear then their brains go bad an they gotta be killed thesselves this one thanks you lyran replied formally the child grinned and vanished well now he knew about dragons teeth the only problem was that the information made no senseat least not to him it had evidently meant something to martis though she must have some bit of information that he didnt have he stroked the mages damp forehead and sighed at least the stuff hadnt killed her outrighthed been half afraid that it would and she did seem to be going into a proper trance her breathing had become more regular her pulse had slowed suddenly it was far too quiet in the street outside lyran was on his feet with his new sword in his hands at nearly the same moment that he noted the absence of sound he slipped out the door closing it carefully behind him once he knew that the musty hallway was safe the stairs that led downwards were at the end of that hallbut he had no intention of taking them instead he glided soundlessly to the window at the other end of the hall the one that overlooked the scrap of back yard the shutters were open and a careful glance around showed that the yard itself was empty he sheathed the sword and adjusted the makeshift baldric so that it hung at his back then climbed out onto the ledge balancing there while he assessed his best path there was a cornice with a crossbeam just within reach he got a good grip on it and pulled himself up chinning himself on the wood of the beamhis arms screamed at him but he dared not make a sound bracing himself he let go with his right hand and swung himself up until he caught the edge of the roof holding onto it with a deathgrip he let go of the cornice entirely got his other hand on the roofedge and halfpulled halfscrambled up onto the roof itself he lay there for one long moment biting his lip to keep from moaning and willing his arms back into their sockets when he thought he could move again he slid over the roof across the splintery sunwarmed shingles to the streetside and peered over the edge below him as he had suspected were a halfdozen armed men all facing the door except for them the street below was deserted there was one waiting at the blind side of the door lyran pulled his knife from the sheath in his boot and dropped on him the crack as the mans skull hit the pavementhe hadnt been wearing a helmtold lyran that he wouldnt have to worry about slitting the fighters throat lyran tumbled and rolled as he landed throwing the knife as he came up at the man he judged to be the leader his aim was offinstead of hitting the throat it glanced off the fighters chestarmor but the move distracted all of them enough to give lyran the chance to get his sword out and into his hands there was something wrong with these men he knew that as soon as he faced them they moved oddly their eyes were not quite focused and even in the heat of the day when they must have been standing out in the sun for a good long time setting up their ambush with one exception they werent sweating then lyran noticed that except for the man hed thrown the dagger atthe man who was sweatingthey werent casting any shadows which meant that they were illusions they could only harm him if he believed in them so he ignored them and concentrated his attention on the leader he went into a purely defensive stance and waited for the man to act the fighter a rugged stocky man with a wary look to his eyes sized him up carefullyand looked as if he wasnt happy with what he saw neither of them moved for a long silent moment finally lyran cleared his throat and spoke this one has no quarrel with any here nor does this ones lady you have done your best this one has sprung the trap there is no dishonor in retreat hireling to hireling there is no contract violation the man straightened looked relieved you no the voice was high cracking a little and came from lyrans left a little distance up the street it was a young voice a breath later the owner emerged from the shadow of a doorway and the speaker matched the voice it was a whiteblond boy barely adolescent dressed in gaudy silks from behind him stepped two more children then another pair all of them were under the age of fifteen all were dressed in rainbow huesand all of them had wild wide eyes that looked more than a little mad the man facing lyran swallowed hard now he was sweating even harder lyran looked at him curiously it almost seemed as if he were afraid of these children lyran decided to act he stepped out into the street and placed himself between the man and the group of youngsters there has been no contract violation he said levelly meeting their crazed eyes blue and green and brown with his own the man has fulfilled what was asked behind him he heard the fighter take to his heels once the attention of the children had switched from himself to lyran lyran sighed with relief that was one death at least that he would not have to balance this one has no quarrel with you he continued why seek you this one the children stared at him a kind of insane affrontery in their faces as if they could not believe that he would defy them lyran stood easily blade held loosely in both hands waiting for their response the blond nearest and tallest raised his hands a dagger of light darted from his outstretched palms and headed straight for lyrans throat but this was something a mage guild fighter was trained to defend against fire daggers could not survive the touch of cold steel lyrans blade licked out and intercepted the dagger before it reached its target it vanished when the steel touched it the child snarled his mouth twisted into a grimace of rage illsuited to the young face another dagger flew from his hands and another his companions sent darts of light of their own within moments lyran was moving as hed never moved in his life dancing along the street his swordblade blurring as he deflected dagger after dagger and still the firedaggers kept coming faster and fasteryet the air was growing chill the sunlight thinning and the faces of the children losing what little color they had possessed lyran realized then that they were draining themselves and everything about them for the energy to create the daggers even as the realization occurred to him one of them made a choking sound and collapsed to the pavement to lie there white and still if he could just hold out long enough he might be able to outlast them but the eldest of the group snarled when his confederate collapsed and redoubled his efforts lyran found himself being pressed back the lightdaggers coming closer and closer before he was able to intercept them his arms becoming leaden and weary he knew then that he would fail before they did and he saw as he deflected a blade heading for his heart another heading for his throatand he knew he would not be able to intercept this one he had an instant to wonder if it would hurt very much then there was a blinding flash of light he wasnt deadonly halfblind for a long and heartstopping moment and when his eyes cleared martis stood in the doorway of the house that had sheltered them bracing herself against the frame her left palm facing him her right the children both he and the youngsters were surrounded by a haze of light his was silver theirs was golden martis gestured and the haze around him vanished he dropped to the pavement so weak with weariness that his legs could no longer hold him she staggered over to his side weaving a little are you going to be all right she asked he nodded panting her hair was out of its braids and stringy with sweat her robes limp with it she knelt beside him for a moment placed both her hands on his shoulders and looked long and deeply into his eyes gods lovethat was close too close did they hurt you he shook his head and she stared at him as hed sometimes seen her examine something for magic taint evidently satisfied by what she saw she kissed him briefly and levered herself back up onto her feet his eyes blurred for a moment when they refocused he saw that the haze around the remaining four children had vanished and that they had collapsed in a heap crying eyes no longer crazed martis stood shoulders sagging just a little a few paces away from them she cleared her throat the eldest looked up face full of fear but she held out her arms to them it wasnt your fault she said in a voice so soft only the children and lyran could have heard the words and so full of compassion lyran scarcely recognized it i know it wasnt your faultand ill help you if you let me the children frozethen stumbled to their feet and surrounded her clinging to her sweatsodden robes and crying as if their hearts had been broken then miraculously remended so bolger decided that he had had enough of the mage guild dictating what mages could and could not do he waited until the lyosten wizard had tagged the years crop of magetalented younglings then had the old man poisoned the speaker was the dwarfwho lyran now knew was one of the local earthwitches a cheerful man called kasten ythres they were enjoying the hospitality of his home while the mage guild dealt with the former citymaster and the clutch of halftrained children hed suborned martis was lying back against lyrans chest wearily at ease within the protective circle of his arms they were both sitting on the floor in one corner by the fireplace in the earthwitchs common room there were no furnishings here just piles of flat pillows martis had found it odd but it had reminded lyran strongly of home it was an oddly charming house like its owner brown and warm and sunny utterly unpretentious kasten had insisted that they relax and put off their magehireling act its my damned house hed said and youre my guests to the nether hells with socalled propriety how on earth did he think he was going to get them trained martis asked kasten snorted he thought he could do it out of booksand if that didnt work hed get one of us halfmages to do it for him fool he sowed the dragons teeth martis replied acidly he shouldnt have been surprised to get dragons ladydragons teeth lyran said plaintively still at a loss to understand martis chuckled and settled a little more comfortably against lyrans shoulder i was puzzled for a moment too until i remembered that the storm that met us had been witchedand that the power that created it was out of control magic power has some odd effects on the mind loveif you arent being watched over and guided properly it can possess you thats why the tales about demonic possession you get a talented youngling or one who blooms late who comes to power with no trainingthey go mad worst of all they know theyre going mad its badand you only hope you can save them before any real damage is done aye kasten agreed i suspect thats where the dragons teeth tale comes from toowhich is why i told your man there to remind you of it the analogy being that the younglings are the teeth the trained mage is the dragon what id like to know is whats to do about this you cant take the younglings to the academeand i surely couldnt handle them no theyre too powerful martis agreed they need someone around to train them and keep them drained until theyve gotten control over their powers instead of having the powers control them we have a possible solution though the guild has given me a proposition but i havent had a chance to discuss it with lyran yet she craned her head around to look at him how would you like to be a father for the next halfyear or so me he replied too startled to refer to himself in third person she nodded the council wants them to have training but feels that they would be best handled in a stable homelike setting but their bloodparents are frightened witless of them but youyou stood up to them you arent afraid of themand youre kind love you have a wonderful warm heart and you know how i feel about youngsters the council feels that we would be the best parental surrogates theyre ever likely to find if youre willing that is lyran could only nod speechlessly and they said martis continued with great satisfaction in her voice that if youd agree theyd give you anything you wanted anything they didnt put any kind of limitation on it theyre worried these are very talented children all five of the councilors are convinced you and i are their only possible salvation lyran tightened his arms around her would theywould they give this one rank to equal a masterclass mage undoubtedly you certainly qualify for swordmasteronly ben could better you and hes a full weaponsmaster if you werent an outlander youd have that rank already would they then allow this one to wed as he pleased he felt martis tense and knew without asking why she had done so she feared losing him so muchand feared that this was just exactly what was about to happen but they were interrupted before he could say anything that and more said a voice from the door it was the chief councilor dabrel purple robes straining over his stomach swordmaster lyran do you wish to be the young fool that i think you do if by that the mastermage asks if this one would wed the master sorceress martis then the mastermage is undoubtedly correct lyran replied demurely a smile straining at the corners of his mouth as he heard martis gasp take her with our blessings swordmaster the portly mage chuckled maybe youll be able to mellow that tongue of hers with your sweet temper dont i get any say in this martis spluttered assuredly lyran let her go and putting both hands on her shoulders turned so that she could face him martis thena lady of my heart and balance of my soul would you deign to share your life with me she looked deeply and soberly into his eyes do you mean that she whispered do you really mean that he nodded slowly then she swallowed and her eyes misted briefly then the sparkle of mischief that he loved came back to them and she grinned will you bloody well stop calling yourself this one if i say yes he sighed and nodded again then that is an offer i will definitely not refuse the cup and the caldron this story was written for the grail anthology that was to be presented at the world fantasy convention in atlanta richard gilliam approached me and asked me if i would contribute we discussed this idea which i had almost immediately and he loved it so i wrote it the book was later broken into two volumes and published as grails of light and grails of darkness rain leaked through the thatch of the henhouse the same dank cold rain that had been falling for weeks ever since the snow melted it dripped on the back of her neck and down her back under her smock though it was nearly dusk elfrida checked the nests one more time hoping that one of the scrawny illtempered hens might have been persuaded by a miracle or sheer perversity to drop an egg but as she had expected the nests were empty and the hens resisted her attempts at investigation with nasty jabs of their beaks theyd gotten quite adept at fighting competing with and chasing away the crows who came to steal their scant feed over the winter she came away from the henhouse with an empty apron and scratched and bleeding hands nor was there remedy waiting for her in the cottage even for that the little salve they had must be hoarded against greater need than hers old mag the village healer and elfridas teacher looked up from the tiny fire burning in the pit in the center of the dirtfloored cottages single room at least the thatch here was sound though rain dripped in through the smokehole and the fire didnt seem to be warming the place any elfrida coughed on the smoke which persisted in staying inside rather than rising through the smokehole as it should mags eyes had gotten worse over the winter and the cottage was very dark with the shutters closed no eggs she asked peering across the room as elfrida let the cowhide down across the cottage door none elfrida replied sighing this springif its this bad now what will summer be like she squatted down beside mag and took the share of barleybread the old woman offered with a crude wooden cup of bittertasting herb tea dipped out of the kettle beside the fire i dont know mag replied rubbing her eyesmag who had been tall and straight with health last summer who was now bent and aching with swollen joints and rheumy eyes neither willowbark nor eyebright helped her much lady bless darling i dont know first that killing frost then nothing but rainseems like what seedlings the frost didnt get mustve rotted in the fields by now hens arent laying lambs are born dead pigs lay on their own young what were going to do for food come winter ive no notion when mag said we she meant the whole village she was not only their healer but their priestess of the old way garth might be hetman but she was the villages heart and soulas elfrida expected to be one day this was something she had chosen knowing the work and selfsacrifice involved knowing that the enmity of the priests of the white christ might fall upon her but not for a long timelady grant that was what she had always thought but now the heart and soul of the village was sickening as the village around her sickened but why we made the proper sacrifices elfrida said finally didnt we whatve we done or not done that the land turns against us mag didnt answer but there was a quality in her silence that made elfrida think that the old woman knew somethingsomething important something that she hadnt yet told her pupil finally as darkness fell and the fire burned down to coals mag spoke we made the sacrifices she said but there was onewho didnt who elfrida asked surprised the entire village followed the old waynever mind the high king and his religion of the white christ that was for knights and nobles and suchlike her people stuck by what they knew best the turning of the seasons the dance of the maiden mother and crone the rule of the horned lord and if anyone in the village had neglected their sacrifices surely she or mag would have known it isnt just our village thats sickening mag said her voice a hoarse harsh whisper out of the dark nor the county alone ive talked to the other wise ones to the peddlersi talked to the crows and the owls and ravens its the whole land thats sickening failingand theres only one sacrifice can save the land elfrida felt her mouth go dry and took a sip of her cold bitter tea to wet it the blood of the high king she whispered which he will not shed come as he is to the feet of the white christ mag shook her head my dear my darling girl id hoped the lady wouldnt lay this on us id prayed she wouldnt punish us for his neglect but tisnt punishment not really and i shouldve known better than to hope it wouldnt come whether he believes it or not the high king is tied to the land and arthur is old and failing as he fails the land fails butsurely theres something we can do elfrida said timidly into the darkness mag stirred if there is i havent been granted the answer she said after another long pause but perhapsyouve had ladydreams before twas what led you to me you want me to try for a vision elfridas mouth dried again but this time no amount of tea would soothe it for it was dry from fear for all that she had true visions when she sought them the experience frightened her and no amount of soothing on mags part or encouragement that thethingsshe saw in the dark waiting for her souls protection to waver could not touch her could ever ease that fear but weighed against her fear was the very real possibility that the village might not survive the next winter if she was worthy to be mags successor she must dare her fear and dare the dreams and see if the lady had an answer for them since high king arthur did not the land and the people needed her and she must answer that need ill try she whispered and mag touched her lightly on the arm thats my good and brave girl she said i knew you wouldnt fail us something on mags side of the fire rustled and she handed elfrida a folded leaf full of dried herbs they werent what the ignorant thought herbs to bring visions the visions came when elfrida asked for themthese were to strengthen and guard her while her spirit rode the night winds in search of answers foxglove to strengthen her heart moly to shield her soul a dozen others a scant pinch of each obediently she placed them under her tongue and while mag chanted the names of the goddess elfrida closed her eyes and released her alltoofragile hold on her body the convent garden was sodden the ground turning to mush and unless someone did something about it there would be nothing to eat this summer but what the tithes brought and the kings grace granted them outside the convent walls the fields were just as sodden so as the mother superior said a tithe of nothing is still nothing and we must prepare to feed ourselves leonie sighed and leaned a little harder on the spade being careful where she put each spadeful of earth behind the spade the drainage trench she was digging between each row of drooping peaseedlings filled with water hopefully this would be enough to keep them from rotting hopefully there would be enough to share already the eyes of the children stared at her from faces pinched and hungry when they came to the convent for mass and she hid the bread that was half her meal to give to them her gown was as sodden as the ground cold and heavy with water and only the fact that it was made of good wool kept it from chilling her her bare feet ankledeep in mud felt like blocks of stone they were so cold she had kirtled her gown high to keep the hem from getting muddied but that only let the wind get at her legs her hair was so soaked that she had not even bothered with the linen veil of a novice it would only have flapped around without protecting her head and neck any her hands hurt she wasnt used to this the other novices gently born and not were desperately doing the same in other parts of the garden those that could rather some of the gentlyborn were too ill to come out into the soaking cold rain the sisters as many as were able were outside the walls helping a few of the local peasants dig a larger ditch down to the swollen stream the trenches in the convent garden would lead to itand so would the trenches being dug in the peasants gardens on the other side of the high stone wall we must work together mother superior had said firmly and so here they were knights daughter and villiens son robes and tunics kirtled up above the knee wielding shovels with a will leonie had never thought to see it but the threat of hunger made strange bedfellows already the convent had turned out to help the villagers trench their kitchen gardens leonie wondered what the village folk would do about the fields too large to trench or fields of hay it would be a cold summer and a lean winter what had gone wrong with the land it was said that the weather had been unseasonableand miserableall over the kingdom nor was the weather all that had gone wrong it was said there was quarreling at high king arthurs court that the knights were moved to fighting for its own sake and had brought their leman openly to many court gatherings to the shame of the ladies it was said that the queen herself but leonie did not want to hear such things or even think of them it was all of a piece anyway knights fighting among themselves killing frosts and rain that wouldnt end the threat of war at the borders raiders and bandits within and starvation and plague hovering over all something was deeply terribly wrong she considered that as she dug her little trenches as she returned to the convent to wash her dirty hands and feet and change into a drier gown as she nibbled her meager supper trying to make it last and as she went in to vespers with the rest something was terribly deeply wrong when mother superior approached her after vespers she somehow knew that her feeling of wrongness and what the head of the convent was about to ask were linked leonie mother superior said once the other novices had filed away back to their beds when your family sent you here they told me it was because you had visions leonie ducked her head and stared at her sandals yes mother magdalene and i asked you not to talk about those visions in any way the nun persisted not to any of the other novices not to any of the sister not to father peregrine yes mother magdalenei mean no mother magdalene leonie looked up flushing with anger i mean i havent she knew why the nun had ordered her to keep silence on the subject shed heard the lecture to her parents through the door the mother superior didnt believe in leonies visionsor rather she was not convinced that they were really visions this could simply be a young womans hysteria shed said sternly or an attempt to get attention if the former the peace of the convent and the meditation and prayer will cure her quickly enoughif the latter well shell lose such notions of selfimportance when she has no one to prate to i know you havent child mother magdalene said wearily and leonie saw how the nuns hands were blistered from the spade she herself had wielded today how her knuckles were swollen and her cheekbones cast into a prominence that had nothing to do with the dim lighting in the chapel i wanted to know if you still have them sometimes leonie said hesitantly that was howi mean that was why i woke last winter when sister maria was elfshot sister maria was not elfshot mother magdalene said automatically elves could do no harm to one who trusts in god it was simply something that happens to the very old now and again it is a kind of sudden brainfever but that isnt the point youre still having the visionsbut can you still see things that you want to see sometimes leonie said cautiously if god and the blessed virgin permit well if god is ever going to permit it i suspect hed do so during holy week mother magdalene sighed leonie i am going to ask you a favor id like you to make a vigil tonight and ask for a vision leonie said raising her head in sudden interest precisely the nun shook her head and picked up her beads telling them through her fingers as she often did when nervous there is something wrong with us with the land with the kingdomi want you to see if god will grant you a vision of what as leonie felt a sudden upsurge of pride mother magdalene added hastily you arent the only one being asked to do thisevery order from one end of the kingdom to the other has been asked for visions from their members i thought long and hard about asking this but you are the only one in my convent who has everhad a tendency to visions the mother superior had been about to say something else leonie was sure for the practical and pragmatic mother magdalene had made her feelings on the subject of mysticism quite clear over the years but that didnt matterwhat did matter was that she was finally going to be able to release that pentup power again to soar on the angels wings never mind that there were as many devils out there as angels her angels would protect her for they always had and always would without another word she knelt on the cold stone before the altar fixed her eyes on the bright little gilded cross above it and released her souls hold on her body what did you see mag asked as elfrida came back shivering and spent to consciousness her body was lying on the ground beside the fire and it felt too tight like a garment that didnt fit anymorebut she was glad enough to be in it again for there had been thousands of those evil creatures waiting for her trying to prevent her from reaching the cauldron she murmured sitting up slowly one hand on her aching head there was a cauldron of course mag breathed the cauldron of the goddess but it was too dark for elfrida to see mag other than as a shadow in the darkness but she somehow felt mags searching eyes what about the cauldron when is it coming back whos to have it not the high king surely imsupposed to go look for it elfrida said vaguely thats what they saidim supposed to go look for it mags sharp intake of breath told her of mags shock butno i know you when you come out of this she muttered almost as if to herself you cant lie if you say they said for you to go then go you must elfrida wanted to say something else to ask what it all meant but she couldnt the vision had taken too much out of her and she was whirled away a second time but this time it was not on the winds of vision but into the arms of exhausted sleep what did you see mother superior asked urgently leonie found herself lying on the cold stone before the altar wrapped in someones cloak with something pillowed under her head she felt very peaceful as she always did when the visions released her and very very tired there had been many demons out there but as always her angels had protected her still she was glad to be back there had never been quite so many of the evil things there before and they had frightened her she had to blink a few times as she gathered her memories and tried to make sense of them a cup she said hesitantlythen her eyes fell upon the communion chalice on the altar and they widened as she realized just what she truly had seen nonot a cup the cup were to seek the grail thats what they told me the grail mother magdalenes eyes widened a little herself and she crossed herself hastily just before youyou dropped over you reached out i thought i sawi thought i saw something faint like a ghost of a glowing cup in your hands leonie nodded her cheek against the rough homespun of the habit bundled under her head they said that to save the kingdom we have to seek the grail we mother magdalene said doubtfully surely you dont mean the high kings knights and squires some of the clergyandme leonies voice trailed off as she realized what she was saying they said the knights will know already and that when you hear about it from camelot youll know i was speaking the truth but i dont want to go she wailed i dont i im convinced of the truth now the nun said just by the fact that you dont want to go if this had been a sham to get attention youd have demanded special treatment to be cosseted and made much of not to be sent off on your own but leonie protested frantically trying to hold off unconsciousness long enough to save herself from this exile never mind the mother superior said firmly well wait for word from camelot when we hear it then youll go leonie would have protested further but mother magdalene laid a cool hand across her hot eyes and sleep came up and took her elfrida had never been this far from her home village before the great forest through which she had been walking for most of the day did not look in the least familiar in fact it did not look like anything anyone from the village had ever described and why hadnt mag brought her here to gather healing herbs and mushrooms the answer seemed clear enough she was no longer in lands mag or any of the villagers had ever seen she had not known which way to go so she had followed the raven she saw flying away from the village the raven had led her to the edge of the woods which at the time had seemed quite ordinary but the oaks and beeches had turned to a thick growth of fir the deeper she went the older the trees became until at last she was walking on a tiny path between huge trunks that rose far over her head before properly branching out beneath those spreading branches thin twiggy growth reached out skeletal fingers like blackened bones while the upper branches cut off most of the light leaving the trail beneath shrouded in a twilight gloom though it was midday though she was on a quest of sorts that did not mean she had left her good sense behind while she was within the beech and oak forest she had gleaned what she could on either side of the track her pack now held two doublehandfuls each of acorns and beechnuts still sound and a few mushrooms two here three or four there they added up it was just as well for the meager supply of journeybread she had with her had been all given away by the end of the first day of her quest a piece at a time to a child here a nursing mother there but she had the freedom of the road and the forest the people she encountered were tied to their land and could not leave it not while there was any chance they might coax a crop from it they feared the forest though they could not tell elfrida why they would only enter the fringes of it to feed their pigs on acorns to pick up deadfall further than that they would not go elfrida had known for a long time that she was not as magical as mag she had her visions but that was all she could not see the power rising in the circles although she knew it was there and could sometimes feel it she could not see the halos of light around people that told mag if they were sick or well she had no knowledge of the future outside of her visions and could not talk to the birds and animals as mag could so she was not in the least surprised to find that she could sense nothing about the forest that indicated either good or ill if there was something here she could not sense it of course the gloom of the firforest was more than enough to frighten anyone with any imagination and while nobles often claimed that peasants had no more imagination than a block of woodwell elfrida often thought that nobles had no more sense than one of their highbred highstrung horses that would break legs shying at shadows witless uselessand irresponsible how many of them were on their lands helping their liegemen and peasants to save their crops few enough most were idling their time away at the high kings court gambling drinking wenching playing at tourneys and other useless pastimes and she would wager that the high kings table was not empty that the nobles children were not going pinchfaced and hungry to bed the religion of the white christ had divorced master from man noble from villager making the former into a master in truth and the latter into an incomeproducing slave the villager was told by his priest to trust in god and receive his reward in heaven the lord need feel no responsibility for any evils he did or caused for once they had been confessed and paid forusually by a generous gift to the priesthis god counted them as erased the balance of duty and responsibility between the vassal and his lord was gone she shook off her bitter thoughts as nightfall approached without mags extra abilities elfrida knew she would have to be twice as careful about spending the night in this place if there were supernatural terrors about she would never know until they were on her so when she made her little camp she cast circles around her with salt and iron betony and rue writing the runes as clear as she could before she lit her fire to roast her nuts but in the end when terror came upon her it was of a perfectly natural sort leonie cowered and tried to hide in the folds of her robe her bruised face ached and her bound wrists were cut and swollen around the thin twine the man who had caught her had used to bind her she had not gotten more than two days away from the conventdistributing most of her food to children and the sick as she walkedwhen she had reached the edge of the forest and her vague visions had directed her to follow the path through it she had seen no signs of people nor had she sensed anything about the place that would have caused folk to avoid it that had puzzled her so she had dropped into a walking trance to try and sort out what kind of a place the forest was that was when someone had come up behind her and hit her on the head now she knew why ordinary folk avoided the forest it was the home of bandits and she knew what her fate was going to be only the strength of the hold the chieftain had over his men had kept her from that fate until now he had decreed that they would wait until all the men were back from their errandsand then they would draw lots for their turns at her leonie was so terrified that she was beyond thought she huddled like a witless rabbit inside her robe and prayed for death whats this the bandit chief said loudly startling her so that she raised her head out of the folds of her sleeves she saw nothing at first only the dark bulking shapes of men against the fire in their midst he laughed long and hard as another of his men entered their little clearing shoving someone in front of himby satans arse the woods are sprouting wenches elfrida caught her breath at the curse so these men were not just banditsthey were the worst kind of bandit nobles gone beyond the law only one who was once a follower of the white christ would have used his adversarys name as an exclamation no follower of the old way either moon or bloodpath would have done so the brigand who had captured her shoved her over to land beside another girland once again she caught her breath as her talismanbag swung loose on its cord and the other girl shrunk away revealing the wooden beads and cross at the rope that served her as a belt worse and worsethe girl wore the robes of one who had vowed herself to the white christ there would be no help there if she were not witless before she had been caught she was probably frightened witless now even if she would accept help from the hands of a pagan leonie tried not to show her hope another girl perhaps between the two of them they could manage to win free but as the girl was shoved forward to drop to the needles beside leonie something swung free of her robe to dangle over her chest it was a little bag on a rawhide thong and the bandit chief roared again this time with disapproval seizing the bag and breaking the thong with a single cruelly hard tug of his hand he tossed it out into the darkness and backhanded the outlaw who had brought the girl in you witless bastard he roared you brought in a witch a witch leonie shrunk away from her fellow captive a witch blessed jesuthis young woman would be just as pleased to see leonie raped to death she would probably call up one of her demons to help as the brigand who had been struck shouted and went for his chiefs throat and the others gathered around yelling encouragement and placing bets she closed her eyes bowed her head and prayed blessed mother of god hear me angels of grace defend us make them forget us for just a moment as the brainless child started in fear then pulled away bowed her head and began praying elfrida kept a heavy hand on her temper bad enough that she was going to dieand in a particularly horrible waybut to have to do it in such company butsuddenly the outlaws were fighting one of them appeared to be the chief the other the one who had caught her and they were ignoring the two girls as if they had somehow forgotten their existence blessed mother hear me make it so the man had only tied her with a bit of leather no stronger than the thong that had held her herbbag if she wriggled just right bracing her tied hands against her feet she could probably snap it she prayed and pulled and was rewarded with the welcome release of pressure as the thong snapped she brought her hands in front of her hiding them in her tunic and looked up quickly the fight had involved a couple more of the bandits she and the other girl were in the shadows now for the fire had been obscured by the men standing or scuffling around it if she crept away quickly and quietly no sooner thought than done she started to crawl away got as far as the edge of the firelight then looked back the other girl was still huddled where she had been left eyes closed too stupid or too frightened to take advantage of the opportunity to escape if elfrida left her there they probably wouldnt try to recapture her theyd have one girl still and wouldnt go hunting in the dark for the one that had gotten away elfrida muttered an oath and crawled back leonie huddled with the witchgirl under the shelter of a fallen tree and they listened for the sounds of pursuit she had been praying as hard as she could eyes closed when a painful tug on the twine binding her wrists had made her open her eyes well come on the girl had said tugging again leonie had not bothered to think about what the girl might be pulling her into she had simply followed crawling as best she could with her hands tied then getting up and running when the girl did they had splashed through a stream running along a moonlit path until leonies sides ached finally the girl had pulled her off the path and shoved her under the bulk of a fallen tree into a little dugout den she would never have guessed was there from the musky smell it had probably been made by a fox or badger leonie huddled in the dark trying not to sob concentrating on the pain in her side and not on the various fates the witchgirl could have planned for her before too long they heard shouts in the distance but they never came very close leonie strained her ears holding her breath to try and judge how close their pursuers were and jumped when the witchgirl put a hand on her dont the girl whispered sharply you wont be going far with your hands tied like that hold still im not going to hurt you leonie stuttered something about demons without thinking the girl laughed if i had a demon to come when i called do you think i would have let a bastard like that lay hands on me since there was no logical answer to that question leonie wisely kept quiet the girl touched her hands and then seized them leonie kept herself from pulling away and a moment later felt the girl sawing at her bonds with a bit of sharp rock every so often the rock cut into leonie instead of the twine but she bit her lip and kept quiet gratitude increasing as each strand parted what were you doing out here anyway the girl askedi thought they kept your kind mewed up like prize lambs i had a vision leonie began wondering if by her words and the retelling of her holy revelation the witchgirl might actually be converted to christianity it happened that way all the time in the tales of the saints after all so while the girl sawed patiently at the bonds with the sharp end of the rock leonie told her everything from the time she realized that something was wrong to the moment the bandit took her captive the girl stayed silent through all of it and leonie began to hope that she might bring the witchgirl to the light and life of christ the girl waited until she had obviously come to the end then laughed unpleasantly suppose just suppose she said i were to tell you that the exact same vision was given to me only it isnt some mystical cup that this land needs its the cauldron of cerridwen the everrenewing for the high king refuses to sacrifice himself to save his kingdom as the holy bargain demands and only the cauldron can give the land the blessing of the goddess the last of the twine snapped as she finished and leonie pulled her hands away then i would say that your vision is wrong evil she retorted there is no goddess only the blessed virgin who is one face of the goddess who is maiden mother and wise one the girl interrupted her words dripping acid only a fool would fail to see that and your white christ is no more than the sacrificed one in one of his many guisesit is the cauldron the land needs not your apocryphal cup your cauldron is some demonthing leonie replied angrily only the grail whatever else she was going to say was lost as the treetrunk above them was riven into splinters by a bolt of lightning that blinded and deafened them both for a moment when they looked up tears streaming from their eyes it was to see something they both recognized as the enemy standing over them was a shape outlined in a glow of its own it was three times the height of a man black and hairy like a bear with the tips of its outstretched claws etched in fire but it was not a bear for it wore a leather corselet and its head had the horns of a bull the snout and tusks of a boar dripping foam and saliva and its eyes glowing an evil red were slitted like a goats leonie screamed and froze the witchgirl seized her bloody wrist hauled her to her feet and ran with her stumbling along behind the beast roared and followed after they had not gotten more than forty paces down the road when the witchgirl fell to the ground with a cry of pain her hand slipping from leonies wrist her ankle leonie thought but no more for the beast was shambling towards them she grabbed the girls arm and hauled her to her feet draped her arm over her own shoulders and dragged her erect up ahead there was moonlight shining down on somethingperhaps a clearing and perhaps the beast might fear the light she halfdragged halfguided the witchgirl towards that promise of light with the beast bellowing behind them the thought crossed her mind that if she dropped the girl and left her the beast would probably be content with the witch and would not chase after leonie no she told herself and stumbled onward they broke into the light and leonie looked up and sank to her knees in wonder elfrida fell beside the other girl half blinded by tears of pain and tried to get to her feet the beastshe had to help leonie up they had to run then she looked up and fell again to her knees this time stricken not with pain but with awe and though she had never felt power before she felt it now humming through her blood and bone saw it in the vibration of the air in the purity of the light streaming from the cup the cup held in the hand of a man whose gentle sad eyes told of the pain not only of his own but of the worlds that for the sake of the world he carried on his own shoulders leonie wept tears of mingled joy and fearjoy to be in the presence of one who was all of light and love and fear that this one was she and not heand the thing that she held spilling over the light of love and healing was cauldron and not cup i was wrong she thought helplessly wrong said a loving laughing voice or simplylimited in vision and in that moment the cauldron became a cup and the lady became the lord jesuthen changed again to a man of strange draped robes and slanted eyes who held neither cup nor cauldron but a cupshaped flower with a jeweled hearta hawkheaded creature with a glowing stone in his handa blackskinned woman with a bright bird and then to another shape and another until her eyes were dazzled and her spirit dizzied and she looked away into the eyes of elfrida the witchgirlwise girl whispered the voice in her mind and questcompanionlooked similarly dazzled but the joy in her face must surely mirror leonies the girl offered her hand and leonie took it and they turned again to face a being of light neither male nor female and a dazzling cup as large as a cauldron the veil covering it barely dimming its brilliance come the being said you have proved yourselves worthy hand in hand the two newest grail maidens rose and followed the shining beacon into the light once and future it was inevitable that the holy grail anthology would spawn an excalibur anthology i kept promising to write the story and things got in the way like other deadlines but bless their hearts they held a place for me and here is the story itself its not at all like the grail story in fact its not a very heroic story which may surprise some people michael omurphy woke with the mother of all hangovers splitting his head in half churning up his stomach like a winter storm off the orkneys and a companion in his bed what in jaysus did i do last night the pain in his head began just above his eyes wrapped around the sides and met in the back his stomach did not bear thinking about his companion was long cold and unmoving but very heavy i took a board to bed was i that hard up for a sheila michael youre slipping he was lying on his side as always the unknown object was at his back at the moment it was no more identifiable than a hard presence along his spine uncomfortable and unyielding he wasnt entirely certain he wanted to find out exactly what it was until he mentally retraced his steps of the previous evening granted this was irrational but a man with the mother of all hangovers is not a rational being the reason for his monumental drunk was clear enough in his mind the pink slip from his job at the docks presented to him by the foreman at the end of the day that would be yesterday friday if i havent slept the weekend through he wasnt the only bloke cashiered yesterday theyd laid off half the men at the shipyard so its back on the dole and thank god almighty i didnt get serious with that little bird i met on holiday last thing i need is a woman nagging at me for losing me job and it wasnt even me own fault depression piled atop the splitting head and the foul stomach michael omurphy was not the sort of man who accepted the dole with any kind of grace other than ill he cracked his right eye open winced at the stab of light that penetrated into his cranium and squinted at the floor beside his bed yes there was the pink slip crumpled into a wad beside his bootsand two bottles of jamesons one empty the other half full and frugally corked holy mary mother of god i dont remember sharing out that often so i mustve drunk most of it myself no wonder i feel like a walk through purgatory he closed his eye again and allowed the whiskey bottle to jog a few more memories loose so hed been sacked and half the boys with him and theyd all decided to drown their sorrows together but not at a pub and not at pub prices you cant get royally roaring drunk at a pub unless youve got a royal allowance to match so we all bought our bottles and met at tommys place thered been a halfformed notion to get shellacked there but tommy had a car and tommy had an idea hed seen some nonsense on the telly about iron johns or some such idiocy over in america said we was all downtrodden and needed to get in touch with our inner selves swore that we had to get empowered to get back on our feet and wanted to head out into the country thered been some talk about male bonding ceremonies pounding drums carrying on like a lot of red indiansand drinking of course tommy went on like it was some kind of communion the rest of them had already started on their bottles before they got to tommys and at that point a lot of pounding and dancing halfnaked and drinking sounded like a fine idea so off they went crammed into tommys aging morris minor with just enough room to get their bottles to their lips at some point they stopped and all piled out michael vaguely recalled a forest which might well have been national trust lands and it was a mercy they hadnt been caught and hauled off to gaol tommy had gotten hold of a drum somewhere it was in the boot with the rest of the booze they all grabbed bottles and tommy got the drum and off they went into the trees like a daft may day parade howling and carrying on like bleeding loonies how tommy made the fireand why it hadnt been seen more to the pointmichael had not a clue he remembered a great deal of pounding on the drum more howling shouting and swearing at the bosses of the world a lot of drinking and some of the lads stripping off their shirts and capering about like so many monkeys about then was when i got an itch for some quiet he and his bottles had stumbled off into the trees following an elusive moonbeam or so he thought he remembered the singing and pounding had faded behind him and in his memory the trees loomed the way they had when he was a nipper and everything seemed huge they were like trees out of the old tales as big as the one they call robin hoods oak in sherwood there was only one way to go since he didnt even consider turning back and that was to follow the path between them and the fey bit of moonlight that lured him on was there a mist i think there was wait that was when the real path appeared there had been mist a curious blue mist it had muffled everything from the sounds of his own footsteps to the sounds of his mates back by the fire before too very long he might have been the only human being alive in a forest as old as time and full of portentous silence he remembered that the trees thinned out at just about the point where he was going to give up his ramble and turn back he had found himself on the shores of a lake it was probably an ordinary enough pond by daylight but last night with the mist drifting over it and obscuring the farther shore the utter and complete silence of the place and the moonlight pouring down over everything and touching everything with silver it had seemed uncanny a bit frightening and not entirely in the real world at all he had stood there with a bottle in each hand a monument to inebriation held there more by inertia than anything else he suspected he could still see the place as he squeezed his eyes shut as vividly as if he stood there at that moment the water was like a sheet of plate glass over a dark and unimaginable void the full moon hung just above the dark mass of the trees behind him a great round chinese lantern of a moon and bluewhite mist floated everywhere in wisps and thin scarves and great opaque billows a curious boat rested by the bank not a meter from him a roughhewn thing apparently made from a whole treetrunk and shaped with an axe not even the reeds around the boat at his feet moved in the breathless quiet then breaking the quiet a sound a single splash in the middle of the lake startled he had seen an arm rise up out of the water beckoning he thought of course that someone had fallen in or been swimming and took a cramp one of his mates even whod come round to the other side and taken a fancy for a dip it never occurred to him to go back to the others for help just as it never occurred to him not to rush out there to save whoever it was he dropped his bottles into the boat at his feet and followed them in he looked about for the tether to cast off but there wasnt onelooked for the oars to row out to the swimmer but there werent any of those either nevertheless the boat was moving and heading straight for that beckoning arm as if he was willing it there and it didnt seem at all strange to him that it was doing so at least not at the time he remembered that hed been thinking that whoever this was shed fallen in fully clothed for the arm had a long sleeve of some heavy white stuff and it had to be a shethe arm was too white and soft to be a mans it wasnt until he got up close though that he realized there was nothing showing but the arm that the woman had been under an awfully long timeand that the arm sticking up out of the water was holding something still daft as it was it wasnt important hed ignored everything but the arm ignored things that didnt make any sense as the boat got within range of the woman hed leaned over the bow so far that he almost fell in and made a grab for that upraised arm but the hand and wrist slid through his grasp somehow although he was sure hed taken a good firm hold on them and he fell back into the boat knocking himself silly against the hard wooden bottom his hands clasped tight around whatever it was shed been holding he saw stars and more than stars and when he came to again the boat was back against the bank and there was no sign of the woman but he had her sword her sword i had her sword now he reached behind him to feel the long hard length of it at his back by godit is a sword he had no real recollection of what happened after that he must have gotten back to the lads and they all must have gotten back to town in tommys car because here he was in bed with a sword ive heard of being in bed with a battleaxe but never a sword slowly carefully he sat up slowly carefully he reached into the tumble of blankets and extracted the drowning womans sword it was real it looked old and it was damned heavy he hefted it in both hands and grunted with surprise if this was the kind of weapon those old bastards used to hack at one another with in the longago days that they made films of there must have been as much harm done by breaking bones as by whacking bits off it wasnt anything fancy though not like you saw in the flicks or the comics a plain black leatherwrapped hilt with what looked like brass bits as the crosspiece and a plain black leatherbound sheath probably weighed about as much as four prybars of the same length put together he put his hand to the hilt experimentally and pulled a little taking it out of the sheath with the vague notion of having a look at the blade itself pendragon the voice shouted in his head an orchestra of nothing but trumpets and all of them played at top volume he dropped the sword which landed on his toes he shouted with pain and jerked his feet up reflexively and the sword dropped to the floor half out of its sheath what the hell was that he howled grabbing his abused toes in both hands and rocking back and forth a little he was hardly expecting an answer but he got one anyway it was i pendragon he felt his eyes bugging out and he cast his gaze frantically around the room looking for the joker whod snuck inside while he was sleeping but there wasnt anyone and there was nowhere to hide the rented room contained four pieces of furniturehis ironframed bed a cheap deal bureau and nightstand and a chair he bent over and took a peek under the bed feeling like a frightened old aunty but there was nothing there either youre looking in the wrong place i left the radio on he muttered thats it its some daft drama gawd i hate those bbc buggers he reached over to the radio on the nightstand and felt for the knob but the radio was already off and cold which meant it hadnt been on with the knob broken pendragon i am on the floor where you dropped me he looked down at the floor the only things besides his boots were the whiskey bottles and the sword i never heard of no jameson bottles talking in a blokes head before he muttered to himself as he massaged his toes and me boots never struck up no conversations before dont be absurd said the voice tartly you know what i am as you know what you are the sword it had to be the sword and just what am i then he asked it wondering when the boys from the home were going to come romping through the door to take him off for a spot of rest this is daft i must have gone loopy im talking to a piece of metal and its talking back to me you are the pendragon the sword said patiently and waited when he failed to respond except with an uncomprehending shrug it went onbut with far less patience you are the once and future king the warrior against the darkness it waited and he still had no notion what it was talking about you are arthur it shouted making him wince you are king arthur warleader and hero now its you thats loopy he told it sternly i dont bloody well think king arthur indeed the only recollection of king arthur he had were things out of his childhoodstories in the schoolbooks a disney flick christmas pantomimes vague images of crowns and redfelt robes of tin swords and papiermache armor flitted through his mindand talking owls and daft magicians king arthur not likely you are the sword said sounding desperate now you are the pendragon you have been reborn into this world to be its hero dont you remember he only snorted im michael omurphy i work at the docks ill be on the dole on monday and i dont bloody think anybody needs any bloody more kings these days theyve got enough troubles with the ones theyvegawd he fell back into the bed as the sword bombarded his mind with a barrage of images more vivid than the flicks for he was in them battles and feasts triumph and tragedy success and failurea grim stand against the powers of darkness that held for the short space of one mans lifetime it all poured into his brain in the time it took for him to breathe twice and when he sat up again he remembered all of it he blinked and rubbed his mistreated head gawd he complained you might warn a lad first now do you believe the sword sounded smug just like the nuns at his school when theyd gotten done whapping him for his own good i believe youre damn good at shoving a lot of rubbish into a mans head and making him think its his he said stubbornly staring down at the shining expanse of blade about ten centimeters worth that protruded out of the sheath i still dont see where all this makes any difference even if i do believe it if the sword could have spluttered it probably would have you dontyoure arthur im excalibur youre supposed to take me up and use me for what he asked snickering at the mental image of prying open tins of beans with the thing you dont make a good prybar i cant cut wood with you even if i had a wood stove which i dont nobodys going to believe youre a fancy sawblade and theres laws about walking around with something like you strapped to me hip what do i do fasten a sign to you and go on a protest march youyou bereft of words the sword resorted to another flood of images forewarned by the last one michael stood his ground but this time the images were harder to ignore he saw himself taking the sword and gathering his fighters to his sideall of his friends from the docks the ones whod bitched along with him about what a mess the world was in he watched himself making an army out of them and sending them out into the streets to clean up the filth there he saw himself as the leader of a new corps of vigilantes who tracked down the pushers the perverts the thugs and the punks and gave them all a taste of what they had coming to them he saw his army making the city safe for people to live in saw them taking back the night from the powers of evil he saw more people flocking to his banner and his cause saw him carrying his crusade from city to city until a joyous public threw the house of hanover out of buckingham palace and installed him on the throne and a tenyearold child could carry a gold bar across the length of the island and never fear a robber or a molester or try this one if that doesnt suit you this time he saw himself crossing to ireland confronting the leadership of every feuding party there and defeating them one by one in challengecombat he saw himself bringing peace to a land that had been torn by strife for so long that there wasnt an irish child alive that didnt know what a kneecapper was he saw the last british tommy leaving the island with a smile on his face and a shamrock in his lapel withdrawing in good order since order itself had been restored he saw plenty coming back to the land prosperity saw ireland taking a major role in the nations of the world and irish honor becoming a byword for trust oh this was cruel throwing a vision like that in his face he wasnt for british rule but the ira was as bad as the plo by his lightsand there wasnt anything he could do about either until now or herewiden your horizons lift your eyes beyond your own sordid universe this time he started as before carried the sword to ireland and restored peace there and went onon to the continent to eastern europe taking command of the un forces there and forcing a real and lasting peace by the strength of his arm oh there was slaughter but it wasnt a slaughter of the innocents but of the bastards that drove the fights and in the end that same tenyearold child could start in galway and end in sarejevo and no one would so much as dirty the lace on her collar or offer her an unkind word the sword released him then and he sat blinking on his shabby secondhand bed in his dingy rented room still holding his aching toes in both hands it all seemed so tawdry this little world of his and all he had to do to earn a greater and brighter one was to reach out his hand he looked down at the sword at the side of his bed and the metal winked smugly up at him you really think you have me now dont you he said bitterly to it it said nothing it didnt have to answer but he had answers enough for all the temptations in his own mind because now he remembered arthurand guinevere and lancelot and agravaine and morgaine and mordred oh yes he had no doubt that there would be a mordred out there somewhere waiting for him the moment he took up the sword he hadnt been any too careful aids notwithstanding and there could be any number of bastards scattered from his seed hell there would be a mordred even if it wasnt his son for every warrior of the light there was a warrior of the dark hed seen that quite quite clearly for every great friend there was always the great betrayerhadnt peter betrayed christ by denying him for every great love there was the great loss it would not be the easy parade of victories the sword showed him he was older and far far wiser than the boyarthur whod taken excalibur the last time he was not to be dazzled by dreams the most likely of the scenarios to succeed was the firstsome bloke in new york had done something like that called his lads the guardian angelsand even he hadnt succeeded in cleaning up more than a drop or two of the filth in one city let alone hundreds that scenario would only last as long as it took some punks parents to sue him what good would a sword be in court eh what would he do slice the judges head off and this was the age of the tabloids of smutpapers theyd love him for a while then theyd decide to bring him down if theyd had a time with charles and di what would they do with himand guinevere and lancelotand mordred for mordred and morgaine were surely here and they might even have got a head start on him they could be waiting for him to appear waiting with hired thugs to take him out for that matter mordred might be a lawyer ready for him at this very moment with briefs and briefcase and hed wind up committed to the loony asylum before he got two steps or he might be a smut reporter good at digging up dirt his own real past wouldnt make a pretty sight on paper oh no oh no i dont think so my lad he said and before the sword could pull any clever tricks he reached down and slammed it home in the sheath three hours and six aspirins later he walked into the nearest pawn shop with a long bundle wrapped in old newspapers under his arm he handed it across the counter to the wizened old east indian who kept the place the old boy unwrapped the papers and peered at the sword without a hint of surprise god alone knew hed probably seen stranger things pass across his counter he slid it out of its sheath and examined the steel before slamming it back home only then did he squint through the grill at michael its mild steel maybe antique maybe not no way of telling five quid he said take it or leave it ill take it said the pendragon fiddler fair this is one of those fun ones i submitted this to andre norton for her magic in ithkar braided anthology for another company this was during that time when braided anthologies otherwise known as shared worlds were hot stuff i didnt know if i had a hope of getting in but i triedand she accepted it later since magic in ithkar only made it to volume two and i really liked the concept of the free bards this became the basis for the bardic voices series i do for baen this is a case where i was able to file the serial numbers off and do a rewrite to fit the story into an entirely original world you cant always do that but sometimes it works all the world comes to ithkar fair thats what they said anywayand it certainly seemed that way to rune as she traveled the trade road down from her home near the galzar pass she wasnt walking on the dusty hardpacked road itself shed likely have been trampled by the press of beasts then run over by the carts into the bargain instead she walked with the rest of the foottravelers on the roads verge it was no less dusty what grass there had been had long since been trampled into powder by all the feet of the pilgrims and fairgoers but at least a traveler was able to move along without risk of acquiring hoofprints on his anatomy rune was close enough now to see the gates of the fair itself and the fairward beside them this seemed like a good moment to separate herself from the rest of the throng rest her tired feet and plan her next moves before entering the grounds of the fair she elbowed her way out of the line of people some of whom complained and elbowed back and moved away from the road to a place where she had a good view of the fair and a rock to sit on the sun beat down with enough heat to be felt through her soft leather hat as she plopped herself down on the rock and began massaging her tired feet while she looked the fair over it was a bit overwhelming certainly it was much bigger than shed imagined it would be it was equally certain that there would be nothing dispensed for free behind those log palings and the few coppers rune had left would have to serve to feed her through the three days of trials for admission to the bardic guild after that well after that she should be an apprentice and food and shelter would be for her master to worry about if not she refused to admit the possibility of failing the trials she couldntthe three surely wouldnt let her fail not after getting this far but for now she needed somewhere to get herself cleaned of the roaddust and a place to sleep both with no price tags attached right now she was the same graybrown from head to toe the darker brown of her hair completely camouflaged by the dust or at least it felt that way even her eyes felt dusty she strolled down to the river her lute thumping her shoulder softly on one side her pack doing the same on the other close to the docks the water was muddy and roiled there was too much traffic on the river to make an undisturbed bath a viable possibility and too many wharfrats about to make leaving ones belongings a wise move she backtracked upstream a bit while the noise of the fair faded behind her crossed over the canal and went hunting the rapids that the canal bypassed the bank of the river was wilder here and overgrown not like the carefully tended area of the canalside finally she found a place where the river had cut a tiny cove into the bank it was secluded trees overhung the water their branches making a good thick screen that touched the water the ground beneath them bare of growth and hollows between some of the roots just big enough to cradle her sleeping roll camp bath and water all together and within climbing distance on one of the trees was a hollow big enough to hide her bedroll and those belongings she didnt want to carry into the fair she waited until dusk fell before venturing into the river and kept her eyes and ears open while she scrubbed herself down once clean she debated whether or not to change into the special clothing shed brought tonight it might be better to save itthen the thought of donning the sweatsoaked dusty traveling gear became too distasteful and she rejected it out of hand she felt strange and altogether different once shed put the new costume on part of that was due to the materialsexcept for when shed tried the clothing on for fit this was the first time shed ever worn silk and velvet granted the materials were all old bought from a secondhand vendor and cut down from much larger garments the velvet of the breeches wasnt too rubbed the ribbons on the sleeves of the shirt and the embroidery should cover the faded places and the vest should cover the stain on the back panel completely her hat once the dust was beaten out of it and the plumes shed snatched from the tails of several disgruntled roosters were tucked into the band looked brave enough her boots at least were new and when the dust was brushed from them looked quite well she tucked her remaining changes of clothing and her bedroll into her pack hid the lot in the treehollow and felt ready to face the fair the fairward at the gate eyed her carefully minstrel he asked suspiciously looking at the lute and fiddle she carried in their cases slung from her shoulders she shook her head here for the trials mlord ah he appeared satisfied you come in good time boy the trials begin tomorrow the guild has its tent pitched hard by the main gate of the temple you should have no trouble finding it the wizard of the gate looked bored ignoring her rune did not correct the fairwards assumption that she was a boy it was her intent to pass as male until shed safely passed the trials shed never heard of the bardic guild admitting a girl but so far as shed been able to determine there was nothing in the rules and charter of the guild preventing it so once shed been accepted once the trials were safely passed shed reveal her sex but until then shed play the safe course she thanked him but he had already turned his attention to the next in line she passed inside the log walls and entered the fair itself the first impressions she had were of noise and light torches burned all along the aisle she traversed the booths to either side were lit by lanterns candles or other more arcane methods the crowd was noisy so were the merchants even by torchlight it was plain that these were the booths featuring shoddier goods secondhand finery brass jewelry flash and tinsel the entertainers here weresurprising she averted her eyes from a set of dancers it wasnt so much that they wore little but imagination but the way they were dancing embarrassed even her and a tavernbred child has seen a great deal in its life she kept a tight grip on her pouch and instruments tried to ignore the crush and let the flow of fairgoers carry her along eventually the crowd thinned out a bit though not before shed felt a ghostly hand or two try for her pouch and give it up as a bad cause she followed her nose then looking for the row that held the cookshop tents and the alesellers she hadnt eaten since this morning and her stomach was lying in uncomfortably close proximity to her spine she learned that the merchants of tavernrow were shrewd judges of clothing hers wasnt fine enough to be offered a free taste but wasnt poor enough to be shooed away sternly admonishing her stomach to be less impatient she strolled the length of the row twice carefully comparing prices and quantities before settling on a humble tent that offered meat pasties best not ask what beast the meat came from not at these prices and fruit juice or milk as well as ale and wine best of all it offered seating at rough trestletables as well rune took her flaky pastry and her mug of juice no wine or ale for her not even had she the coppers to spare for it she dared not be the least muddleheaded not with a secret to keep and a competition on the morn and found herself a spot at an empty table where she could eat and watch the crowd passing by the pie was more crust than meat but it was filling and wellmade and fresh that counted for a great deal she noted with amusement that there were two sorts of the clumsy crude clay mugs one sort the kind they served the milk and juice in was ugly and shapeless too ugly to be worth stealing but was just as capacious as the exterior promised the other for wine and ale was just the same ugly shape and size on the outside though a different shade of toadback green but had a far thicker bottom effectively reducing the interior capacity by at least a third come for the trials lad asked a quiet voice in her ear rune jumped nearly knocking her mug over and snatching at it just in time to save the contents from drenching her shopworn finery and however would she have gotten it clean again in time for the morrows competition there hadnt been a sound or a hint of movement or even the shifting of the bench to warn her but now there was a man sitting beside her he was of middle years red hair going to gray smilewrinkles around his mouth and greygreen eyes with a candid triangular face well that said nothing rune had known highwaymen with equally friendly and open faces his dress was similar to her own leather breeches instead of velvet good linen instead of worn silk a vest and a leather hat that could have been twin to hers knots of ribbon on the sleeves of his shirtand the neck of a lute peeking over his shoulder a minstrel of the guild rune rechecked the ribbons on his sleeves and was disappointed blue and scarlet and green not the purple and silver of a guild minstrel nor the purple and gold of a guild bard this was only a common songster a mere streetplayer still hed bespoken her kindly enough and the three knew not everyone with the musicpassion had the skill or the talent to pass the trials aye sir she replied politely ive hopes to pass i think ive the talent and others have said as much his eyes measured her keenly and she had the disquieting feeling that her boyruse was fooling him not at all ah well he replied theres amany before you have thought the same and failed that may be she answered the challenge in his eyes but id bet fair coin that none of them fiddled for a murdering ghost and not only came out by the grace of their skill but were rewarded by that same spirit for amusing him oh so a lifted eyebrow was all the indication he gave of being impressed but somehow that lifted brow conveyed volumes youve made a song of it surely have i not its to be my entry for the third day of testing well then he said no more than that but his wordless attitude of waiting compelled rune to unsling her fiddlecase extract her instrument and tune it without further prompting its the fiddle thats my first instrument she said apologetically and since twas the fiddle that made the tale never apologize for a song child he admonished interrupting her let it speak out for itself now lets hear this ghosttale it wasnt easy to sing while fiddling but rune had managed the trick of it some time ago she closed her eyes a halfmoment fixing in her mind the necessary changes shed made to the lyricsfor unchanged the song would have given her sex awayand began i sit here on a rock and curse my stupid bragging tongue and curse the pride that would not let me back down from a boast and wonder where my wits went when i took that challenge up and swore that i would go and fiddle for the skull hill ghost oh aye that had been a damn fool moveto let those idiots who patronized the tavern where her mother worked goad her into boasting that there wasnt anyone living or dead that she couldnt cozen with her fiddling too much ale rune and too little sense and too tender a pride as well to let them rub salt in the wound of being the tavern wenchs bastard its midnight and theres not a sound up here upon skull hill then comes a wind that chills my blood and makes the leaves blow wild not a good word choice but a change that had to be madethat was one of the giveaway verses and rising up in front of me a thing like shrouded death a voice says give me reason why i shouldnt kill you child holy three that thing had been ghastly cold and old and totally heartless it had smelled of death and the grave and had shaken her right down to her toenails she made the fiddle sing about what words alone could never convey and saw her audience of one actually shiver the next verse described runes answer to the spirit and the fiddle wailed of fear and determination and things that didnt rightly belong on earth then came the description of that nightlong lightless ordeal shed passed through and the fiddle shook with the weariness shed felt playing the whole night long and the tune rose with dawning triumph when the thing not only didnt kill her outright but began to warm to the music shed made now she had an audience of more than one though she was only half aware of the fact at last the dawnlight strikes my eyes i stop and see the sun the light begins to chase away the dark and midnight cold and then the light strikes something more i stare in dumb surprise for where the ghost had stood there is a heap of shining gold the fiddle laughed at death cheated thumbed its nose at spirits and chortled over the revelation that even the dead could be impressed and forced to reward courage and talent rune stopped and shook back brown locks dark with sweat and looked about her in astonishment at the applauding patrons of the cooktent she was even more astonished when they began to toss coppers in her open fiddlecase and the cooktents owner brought her over a full pitcher of juice and a second pie ida brought ye wine laddie but master talaysen there says ye go to trials and mustna be amuddled she whispered as she hurried back to her counter i hadnt meant surely this isnt the first time youve played for your supper child the minstrels eyes were full of amused irony well no but so take your wellearned reward and dont go arguing with folk who have a bit of copper to fling at you and who recognize the gift when they hear it no mistake youngling you have the gift and sit and eat youve more bones than flesh a good tale that well rune blushed i did exaggerate a bit at the end twasnt gold it was silver but silver wont rhyme and it was that silver that got me herebought me my second instrument paid for lessoning kept me fed while i was learning id be just another tavernmusician otherwise like me you are too polite to say the minstrel smiled then the smile faded there are worse things child than to be a free musician i dont think theres much doubt your gift will get you past the trialsbut you might not find the guild to be all you think it to be rune shook her head stubbornly wondering briefly why shed told this stranger so much and why she so badly wanted his good opinion only a guild minstrel would be able to earn a place in a nobles train only a guild bard would have the chance to sing for royalty im sorry to contradict you sir but ive had my taste of wandering singing my songs out only to know theyll be forgotten in the next drink wondering where my next meal is coming from ill never get a secure life except through the guild and ill never see my songs live beyond me without their patronage he sighed i hope you never regret your decision child but if you shouldor if you need help everwell just ask for talaysen ill stand your friend with those surprising words he rose soundlessly as gracefully as a bird in flight and slipped out of the tent just before he passed out of sight among the press of people rune saw him pull his lute around and begin to strum it she managed to hear the first few notes of a lovesong the words rising golden and glorious from his throat before the crowd hid him from view and the babble of voices obscured the music rune was waiting impatiently outside the guild tent the next morning long before there was anyone there to take her name for the trials it was as the fairward had said hard to miss purple in the main with pennons and edgings of silver and gilt almosttoo much almost gaudy she was joined shortly by three more striplings one welldressed and confident two sweating and nervous more trickled in as the sun rose higher until there was a line of twenty or thirty waiting when the guild registrar an old and sourlooking scribe raised the tentflap to let them file inside he wasnt wearing guild colors but rather a robe of dusty brown velvet a hireling therefore he took his time sharpening his quill until rune was ready to scream with impatience before looking her up and down and asking her name rune child of lista jesaril tavernkeeper that sounded a trifle better than her mothers real position serving wench from whence karthar east and northbelow galzar pass primary instrument fiddle secondary lute he raised an eyebrow the usual order was lute primary fiddle secondary for that matter fiddle wasnt all that common even as a secondary instrument and you will perform first day primary lament of the maiden esme second day secondary the unkind lover third day original the skull hill ghost an awful title but she could hardly use the real name of fiddler girl accompanied on primary fiddle take your place she sat on the backless wooden bench trying to keep herself calm before her was the raised wooden platform on which they would all perform to either side of it were the backless benches like the one she warmed for the aspirants to the guild the back of the tent made the third side and the fourth faced the row of wellpadded chairs for the guild judges although she was first here it was inevitable that they would let others have the preferred first few slots there would be those with fathers already in the guild or those who had coins for bribes still she shouldnt have to wait too longrising with the dawn would give her that much of an edge at least she got to play by midmorning the lament was perfect for fiddle the words were simple and few and the wailing melody gave her lots of scope for improvisation the row of guild judges solemn in their tunics or robes of purple white silk shirts trimmed with gold or silver ribbon depending on whether they were minstrels or bards were a formidable audience their faces were much alike wellfed and very conscious of their own importance you could see it in their eyes as they sat below the platform and took unobtrusive notes they seemed at least mildly impressed even more heartening several of the boys yet to perform looked satisfyingly worried when shed finished she packed up her fiddle and betook herself briskly outto find herself a corner of temple wall to lean against as her knees sagged when the excitement that had sustained her wore off it was several long moments before she could get her legs to bear her weight and her hands to stop shaking it was then that she realized that she hadnt eaten since the night beforeand that she was suddenly ravenous before shed played the very thought of food had been revolting the same cookshop tent as before seemed like a reasonable proposition she paid for her breakfast with some of the windfallcoppers of the night before this morning the tent was crowded and she was lucky to get a scant corner of a bench to herself she ate hurriedly and joined the strollers through the fair once or twice she thought she glimpsed the red hair of talaysen but if it was he he was gone by the time she reached the spot where she had thought hed been there were plenty of other streetsingers though she thought wistfully of the harvest of coin shed garnered the night before as she noted that none of them seemed to be lacking for patronage but now that she was a duly registered entrant in the trials it would be going against custom if not the rules to set herself up among them so instead she strolled and listened and made mental notes for further songs there was many a tale she overheard that would have worked well in songform many a glimpse of silkbedecked lady strangely sad or hectically gay or velvetclad lord sly and foxlike or bold and pompous that brought snatches of rhyme to mind by early evening her head was crammed fulland it was time to see how the guild had ranked the aspirants of the morning the list was posted outside the closed tentflaps and rune wasnt the only one interested in the outcome of the first days trials it took a bit of time to work her way in to look but when she did by the three there she was rune of karthar listed third she all but floated back to her riverside treeroost the second day of the trials was worse than the first the aspirants performed in order lowest ranking to highest that meant that rune had to spend most of the day sitting on the hard wooden bench clutching the neck of her lute in nervous fingers listening to contestant after contestant and sure that each one was much better on his secondary instrument than she was shed only had a year of training on it after all still the song shed chosen was picked deliberately to play up her voice and deemphasize her lutestrumming it was going to be pretty difficult for any of these others to match her high contralto a truly cunning imitation of a boys soprano since most of them had passed puberty at long last her turn came she swallowed her nervousness as best she could took the platform and began privately she thought it was a pretty silly song why on earth any man would put up with the things that lady did to him and all for the sake of a kiss on her cold quiet hand was beyond her still she put all the acting ability she had into it and was rewarded by a murmur of approval when shed finished that voiceive seldom heard one so pure at that late an age she overheard as she packed up her instrument if he passes the third dayyou dont suppose hed agree to become castrati do you i can think of half a dozen courts that would pay red gold to have him she smothered a smileimagine their surprise to discover that it would not be necessary to eunuch her to preserve her voice she lingered to listen to the last of the entrants then waited outside for the posting of the results she nearly fainted to discover that shed moved up to second place i told you said a quiet voice in her ear but are you still sure you want to go through with this she whirled to find the minstrel talaysen standing behind her the sunset brightening his hair and the soft shadows on his face making him appear scarcely older than she im sure she replied firmly one of the judges said today that he could think of half a dozen courts that would pay red gold to have my voice bought and sold like so much mutton wheres the living in that caged behind high stone walls and never let out of the sight of mlords guards lest you take a notion to sell your services elsewhere is that the life you want to lead trudging down roads in the pouring cold rain frightened half to death that youll take sickness and ruin your voicemaybe for good singing with your stomach growling so loud it drowns out the song watching some idiot with half your talent being clad in silk and velvet and eating at the high table while you try and please some brutes of guardsmen in the kitchen in hopes of a few scraps and a corner by the fire she countered no thank you ill take my chances with the guild besides where else would i be able to learn ive got no more silver to spend on instruments or teaching there are those who would teach you for the love of itwelladay youve made up your mind as you will child he replied but his eyes were sad as he turned away and vanished into the crowd again once again she sat the hard bench for most of the day while those of lesser ranking performed this time it was a little easier to bear it was obvious from a great many of these performances that few if any of the boys had the gift to create by the time it was runes turn to perform she judged that counting herself and the firstplace holder there could only be five real contestants for the three open bardic apprentice slots the rest would be suitable only as minstrels singing someone elses songs unable to compose their own she took her place before the critical eyes of the judges and began she realized with a surge of panic as she finished the first verse that they did not approve while she improvised she mentally reviewed the verse trying to determine what it was that had set those slight frowns on the judicial faces then she realized boasting guild bards simply did not admit to being boastful nor did they demean themselves by reacting to the taunts of lesser beings oh holy three quickly she improvised a verse on the folly of youth of how had she been older and wiser shed never have gotten herself into such a predicament she heaved an invisible sigh of relief as the frowns disappeared by the last chorus they were actually nodding and smiling and one of them was tapping a finger in time to the tune she finished with a flourish worthy of a master and waited breathlessly and they applauded dropped their dignity and applauded the performance of the final contestant was an anticlimax none of them had left the tent since this last trial began instead of a list the final results would be announced and they waited in breathless anticipation to hear what they would be several of the boys had already approached rune offering smiling congratulations on her presumed firstplace slot a hush fell over them all as the chief of the judges took the platform a list in his hand first place and first apprenticeship as bardrune son of lista jesaril of karthar pardon my lord rune called out clearly bubbling over with happiness and unable to hold back the secret any longer but its not sonits daughter she had only a split second to take in the rage on their faces before the first staff descended on her head they flung her into the dust outside the tent halfsenseless and her smashed instruments beside her the passersby avoided even looking at her as she tried to get to her feet and fell three times her right arm dangled uselessly it hurt so badly that she was certain that it must be broken but it hadnt hurt half as badly when theyd cracked it as it had when theyd smashed her fiddle that had broken her heart all she wanted to do now was to get to the river and throw herself in with any luck at all shed drown but she couldnt even manage to stand gently lass firm hands took her and supported her on both sides lady be my witness if ever i thought theyd have gone this far id never have let you go through with this farce she turned her head trying to see through tears of pain both of heart and body with eyes that had sparks dancing before them the man supporting her on her left she didnt recognize but the one on the right ttalaysen she faltered i told you id help if you needed it did i not i think you have more than a little need at the moment ththey broke my fiddle talaysen and my lute they broke them and they broke my arm oh rune lass there were tears in his eyes and yet he almost seemed to be laughing as well if ever i doubted youd the makings of a bard you just dispelled those doubts first the fiddle then the luteand only then do you think of your own hurts ah come away lass come where people can care for such a treasure as you stumbling through darkness wrenched with pain carefully supported and guided on either side rune was in no position to judge where or how far they went after some unknown interval however she found herself in a manycolored tent lit with dozens of lanterns partitioned off with curtains hung on wires that crisscrossed the entire dwelling just now most of these were pushed back and a mixed crowd of men and women greeted their entrance with cries of welcome that turned to dismay at the sight of her condition she was pushed down into an improvised bed of soft wool blankets and huge fat pillows while a thin dark girl dressed like a gypsy bathed her cuts and bruises with something that stung then numbed them and a graybearded man tskd over her arm prodded it once or twice then without warning pulled it into alignment when he did that the pain was so incredible that rune nearly fainted by the time the multicolored fireflashing cleared from her eyes he was binding her arm up tightly with thin strips of wood while the girl was urging her to drink something that smelled of herbs and wine before she had a chance to panic talaysen reappeared as if conjured at her side where youre with the free bardsthe real bards not those pompous pufftoads with the guild he said dear child i thought that all that would happen to you was that those inflated bladders of selfimportance would give you a tonguelashing and throw you out on your backside if id had the slightest notion that theyd do this to you id have kidnapped you away and had you drunk insensible till the trials were over i may never forgive myself now drink your medicine but howwhywho are you rune managed between gulps what are you i think might be the better place to start tell her will you erdric were the free bards said the graybearded man as master talaysen told youhes the one who banded us together when he found that there were those who like himself had the gift and the talent but were disinclined to put up with the selfaggrandizement and politics and foolish slavishness to form of guild nonsense we go where we wish and serveor not servewho we will and sing as we damn well please and no foolishness about wholl be offended we also keep a sharp eye out for youngsters like you with the gift and with the spirit to fight the guild weve had our eye on you these three years now youbut how myself for one said a new voice and a bony fellow with hair that kept falling into his eyes joined the group around her you likely dont remember me but i remember youi heard you fiddle in your tavern when i was passing through karthar and i passed the word and im another this one rune recognized he was the man that sold her her lute who had seemed to have been a gypsy peddler selling new and used instruments he had also unaccountably stayed long enough to teach her the rudiments of playing it you see we keep an eye out for all the likely lads and lasses weve marked knowing that soon or late theyd come to the trials usually though theyre not so stubborn as you talaysen smiled i should hope to live the lanky fellow agreed they made the same remark my first day about wanting to have me stay a liltin soprano the rest of me days that was enough for me and they wouldnt even give me the same notice theyd have given a flea the dark girl laughed though i hadnt the wit to think of passing myself off as a boy for the trials butwhy are youtogether rune asked bewildered we band together to give each other help a spot of silver to tide you over an empty month a place to go when youre hurt or ill someone to care for you when youre not as young as you used to be the grayhaired erdric said and to teach and to learn and we have more and better patronage than you or even the guild suspect not everyone finds the precious style of the guild songsters to their taste especially the farther you get from the large cities out in the countryside away from the decadence of courts they like their songs like their food substantial and heartening but why does the guild let you get away with this if youre taking patronage from them runes apprehension given her recent treatment was real and understandable bless you child they couldnt do without us talaysen laughed no matter what you think there isnt an original creative master among em gwena my heart sing her the unkind loveryour version i mean the real and original gwena the dark girl flashed dazzling white teeth in a vulpine grin plucked a gittern from somewhere behind her and began well it was the same melody that rune had sung and some of the wordsthe best phraseswere the same as well but this was no icecold princess taunting her poor knightly admirerer with what hed never touch no this was a teasing shepherdess seeing how far she could harass her cowherd lover and the teasing was kindly meant and what the cowherd claimed at the end was a good deal more than a kiss on her cold quiet hand in fact you might say with justice that the proceedings got downright heated that lament you did the first days another song theyve twisted and tormented most of the popular ballads the guild touts as their own are ours talaysen told her with a grin as you should know seeing as youve written at least half of them gwena snorted but what would you have done if they had accepted me anyway rune wanted to know oh you wouldnt have lasted long can a caged thrush sing soon or late youd have done what i didescaped your gilded cage and wed have been waiting then you were a guild bard somehow she felt shed known that all along but i never hear of one called talaysen and if the lament is yours well i changed my name when i took my freedom likely though you wouldnt recognize it oh she wouldnt you think or are you playing mockmodest with us again gwena shook back her abundant black hair ill make it known to you that youre having your bruises tended by master bard merridon himself merridon runes eyes went wide as she stared at the man who coughed deprecatingly butbuti thought master merridon was supposed to have gone into seclusion the guild would hardly want it known that their pride had rejected em for a pack of gypsy jonglers now would they the lanky fellow pointed out so can i tempt you to join with us rune lass the man shed known as talaysen asked gently id likebut i cant she replied despairingly how could i keep myself itll take months for my arm to heal andmy instruments are splinters anyway she shook her head tears in her eyes they werent much but they were all i had ill have to go home theyll take me in the tavern i can still turn a spit and fill a glass onehanded ah lass didnt you hear erdric we take care of each otherwell care for you till youre whole again the old man patted her shoulder then hastily found her a rag when scanning their faces brought her beliefand tears as for the instruments talaysen vanished and returned again as her sobs quieted ill admit to relief at your words i was halfafraid youd a real attachment to your poor departed friends theyre splinters and i loved them cant be mended but theyre splinters and they were all i had is a different tune altogether what think you of these twain the fiddle and lute he laid in her lap werent new nor were they the kind of gilded carved and ornamented dainties guild musicians boasted but they held their own kind of quiet beauty a beauty of mellow wood and clean lines rune plucked a string on each experimentally and burst into tears again the tone was lovely smooth and golden and these were the kind of instruments shed never dreamed of touching much less owning when the tears had been soothed away the various medicines been applied both internally and externally and introductions made all around rune found herself once again alone with talaysenor merridon though on reflection she liked the name shed first known him by better the rest had drawn curtains on their wires close in about her little corner making an alcove of privacy if youll let me join you she said shyly let he laughed havent we made it plain enough weve been trying to lure you like coneycatchers oh youre one of us rune lass youll not escape us now thenwhat am i supposed to do you heal thats the first thing the second well we dont have formal apprenticeships amongst us by the three theres no few things you could serve as master in and no question about it you could teach most of us a bit about fiddling for one but she looked and felt dismayed one of the reasons i wanted to join the guild was to learn i cant read nor write music theres so many instruments i cant play her voice rose to a soft wail how am i going to learn if a master wont take me as an apprentice enough enough no more weeping and wailing my hearts oversoft as it is he said hastily if youre going to insist on being an apprentice i suppose theres nothing for it will i do as a master to you rune was driven to speechlessness and could only nod holy three lass you make a liar out of me who swore never to take an apprentice wait a moment he vanished around the curtain for a moment then returned here he set down a tiny harp this can be played onehanded and learning the ways of her will keep you too busy to bedew me with any more tears while your arm mends treat her gentlyshes my own very first instrument and she deserves respect rune cradled the harp in her good arm too awestricken to reply well send someone in the morning for your things wherever it is youve cached em lean back thereoh its a proper nursemaid i am he made her comfortable on her pillows covering her with blankets and moving her twono threenew instruments to a place of safety but still within sight he seemed to understand how seeing them made her feel well find you clothing and the like as well that sleepyjuice they gave you should have you nodding shortly just remember one thing before you doze off im not going to be an easy master to serve you wont be spending your days lazing about you know come morning ill set you your very first task youll teach me his eyes lighted with unfeigned eagerness that ghostsong the enemy of my enemy not long after i was accepted into the magic in ithkar anthology the late robert adams who was the coeditor asked me to participate in his friends of the horseclans anthologies as well i was happy to since i liked robert a great deal and this was the result which appeared in volume two robert was an odd duck you either liked him and chuckled over his eccentricities or you passionately hated him his most popular books the horseclans series have not weathered the change in political climate well for some background they are set in a distant future following a nuclear war in which apparently the us and the soviet union both bombed each other back to the stone age the hero of the earliest books is immortal and telepathic having evidently stood in the right place at the wrong time as one of the nukes hit he decides to singlehandedly bring civilization in the us back up to par mostly by uniting the remains of the population with the native americans who being on remote reservations survived intact the villains of the books are the greeks who sustained very little damage since it seems that none of the greater powers thought they were worth bombing back to the stone age they proceed to flourish and conquer in the tradition of alexander eventually moving on to the north american continent however thanks to better living through radiation there are telepathic horses and mutated large cats in north america both of which have teamed up with the horseclansfolk in those more innocent times no one raised the objection that all that longterm radiation would probably render the population sterile rather than producing beneficial mutations the concept of nuclear winter hadnt even occurred to anyone but the possibility of a third worldfirst nuclear war was very real one of the obsessions of the more devoted of horseclans fans was to try and figure out just what the real placenames and proper names were of the locations and characters robert had some formula by which he took english names and places distorted and then phonetically respelled them some of them i never could figure out at any rate it occurred to me that there was another highly mobile ethnic group that could have survived roberts wwiii by being outside the cities the gypsies who would have strenuously resisted being absorbed into the horseclans as they have strenuously resisted being absorbed into every other culture they have come into contact with the fierce heat radiating from the forge was enough to deaden the senses all by itself never mind the creaking and moaning of the bellows and the steady taptapping of kevins youngest apprentice out in the yard working at his assigned horseshoe the stoutlybuilt stone shell was pure hell to work in from may to october you could open windows and doors to the fullest but heat soon built up to the point where thought ceased the mind went numb and the world narrowed to the task at hand but kevin floyd was used to it and he was alive enough to what was going on about him that he sensed that someone had entered his smithy although he dared not interrupt his work to see who it was this was a commissioned pieceand one that could cost him dearly if he did a lessthanperfect job of completing it even under the best of circumstances the tempering of a swordblade was always a touchy bit of business the threat of his overlords wrathand the implied loss of his shopdid not make it less so so he dismissed the feeling of eyes on the back of his neck and went on with the work stolidly for the moment he would ignore the visitor as he ignored the heat the noise and the stink of scorched leather and many long summers worth of sweathorsesweat and mansweatthat permeated the forge only when the blade was safely quenched and lying on the anvil for the next step did he turn to see who his visitor was he almost overlooked her entirely she was so small and was tucked up so invisibly in the shadowy corner where he kept oddments of harness and a pile of leather scraps dark nearly black eyes peered up shyly at him from under a tangled mop of curling black hair as she perched atop his heap of leather bits hugging her thin knees to her chest kevin didnt recognize her that since he knew every man woman and child in northfork by name was cause for a certain alarm he made one step toward her she shrank back into the darkness of the corner eyes going wide with fright he sighed kid i aint gonna hurt you she looked terrified unfortunately kevin frequently had that effect on children much as he liked them he looked like a redfaced hairy ogre and his voice rough and harsh from years of smoke and shouting over the forgenoise didnt improve the impression he made he tried again where you from huh whos your kin she stared at him mouth set he couldnt tell if it was from fear or stubbornness but was beginning to suspect the latter so he persisted and when she made an abortive attempt to flee shot out an arm to bar her way he continued to question her more harshly now but she just shook her head at him frantically and plastered herself against the wall she was either too scared now to answer or wouldnt talk out of pure cussedness jack he finally shouted in exasperation calling for his helper who was around the corner outside the forge manning the bellows leave it for a minute and cmere a brawny adolescent sauntered in the door from the back scratching at his mousecolored hair what he began wheres this come from kevin demanded she aint one of ours an i misdoubt she came with the king jack snorted derision king my left kevin shared his derision but cautionedwhen hes here you call him what he wants no matter hes king of only about as far as he can see hes paid for mercs enough to pound you inta the ground like a tentpeg if you make him mad or theres worse he could do what the hell good is my journeyman gonna be with only one hand jack twisted his face in a grimace of distaste he looked about as intelligent as a brick wall but his sleepy blue eyes hid the fact that he missed very little hrh king robert the third of trihtown had not impressed him shit ah hell king then naw she aint with his bunch i reckon that youngun came with them trader jippos this mornin shes got that look what jippos kevin demanded nobody told me about no jippos thass cause you was in here poundin away at his highasss sword when they rode in its them same bunch as was in five point last month aint no wants posted on em so i figgered they was safe to let be for a bit aw hell kevin glanced at the waiting blade then at the door torn by duty and duty there hadnt been any news about traders from five points and bad news usually traveled faster than goodbutdammit he had responsibility as the duly appointed mayor it was his job to cast his eye over any strangers to northfork apprise them of the town laws see that they knew troublemakers got short shrift and he knew damn well what willum innkeeper would have to say about his dealing with them so tardily as it waspissant fool kept toadying up to king robert trying to get himself appointed mayor dammit he thought furiously i didnt want the damn job but ill be sheepdipped if ill let that suckass take it away from me with his rumormongering and backstabbing hell i have to go deal with these jippos and quick or hell be on my case again on the other hand to leave king roberts sword threequarters finished fortunately before he could make up his mind his dilemma was solved for him a thin wiry man as dark as the child appeared almost magically hardly more than a shadow in the doorway a man so lean he barely blocked the strong sunlight he could have been handsome but for the black eyepatch and the ugly keloid scar that marred the right half of his face for the rest he was obviously no native of any town in king roberts territory he wore soft riding boots baggy pants of a wild scarlet embroidered shirt and vest of blue and black and a scarlet scarf around his neck that matched the pants kevin was surprised he hadnt scared every horse in town with an outfit like that your pardon the man said with so thick an accent that kevin could hardly understand him but i believe something of ours has strayed here and was too frightened to leave before kevin could reply he had turned with the swift suddenness of a lizard and held out his hand to the girl beckoning her to his side she flitted to him with the same lithe grace he had displayed and half hid behind him kevin saw now that she wasnt as young as hed thought in late adolescenceit was her slight build and lack of height that had given him the impression that she was a child i sent chali aseeing where there be the smithy the man continued keeping his one eye on kevin and his arm about the girls shoulders for we were atold to seek the townman there and dear she loves the forgework so she stayed to be awatching she meant no harm gods truth well neither did i kevin protested i was just trying to ask her some questions an she wouldnt answer me im the mayor here i gotta know about strangers again your pardon the man interrupted but she could not give answers chali has been mute for long sinceshow mouse at the mans urging the girl lifted the curls away from her left temple to show the unmistakable scar of a hoofmark aw hellfire big man kevin bullying a little cripple kevin felt about as high as a horseshoe nail shit he said awkwardly look im sorryhell how was i to know now the man smiled a wide flash of pearly white teeth in his dark face you could not petro i am i lead the rom kevin floyd im mayor here the men shook hands kevin noticed that this petros grip was as firm as his own the girl had relaxed noticeably since her clansmans arrival and now smiled brightly at kevin another flash of white against dusky skin she was dressed much the same as her leader but in colors far more muted kevin was grateful as he wasnt sure how much more of that screaming scarlet his eyes could take he gave the man a quick rundown of the rules petro nodded acceptance what of your faiths he asked when kevin had finished are there things we must or must not be adoing is there church about kevin caught the flash of a gold cross at the mans throat well heyno wonder he said church like it was poison a fellow christernot like those damn ehleen priests this was a simple onebarred cross not the ehleen twobarred live and let be was a christers motto a godly man converts by example not words nor forcewhich might well be why there were so few of them kevin and his family were one of only three christer families in town and christer traders werent that common either nothing much he replied king robert he didnt go in for religion last i heard so whats your business here we live what else petro answered matteroffactly we have livestock for trading horses mules donkeysalso metalwork dont know as i care for that last kevin said dubiously scratching his sweaty beard na na not ironwork the trader protested light metals copper brassornament mostly a few kettles pans now that sounds a bit more like tell youyou got conshos harnessstuds that kinda thing you willin to work a swap for shoein the shoes not the shoeing our beasts prefer the hands they know done kevin grinned he was good enough at tools or weaponwork but had no talent at ornament and knew it he could make good use of a stock of pretty bits for harnesses and the like only one frippery could he make and that was more by accident than anything else and since these people were fellow christers and he was short a peaceoffering he usually had one in his apron pocket he felt around among the horseshoe nails until his hand encountered a shape that wasnt a nail and pulled it out here missy he said apologetically little somethin fer scarin you the girl took the cross made of flawed horseshoe nails into strong supple fingers with a flash of delight in her expressive eyes hah a generous apology petro grinned and you cannot know how well comes the fit how so it is said of my people when the christ was to be killed his enemies meant to silence him lest he rouse his followers against them the evil ones made four nailsthe fourth for his heart but one of the rom was there and stole the fourth nail so god blessed us in gratitude to awander wherever we would well hey kevin returned the grin and a thought occurred to him ehrik was getting about the right size to learn riding say you got any ponies maybe a liddle horse gettin on an gentle im lookin for somethin like that for mboy the jippo regarded him thoughtfully i think perhaps yes then you just may see me later on when i finish this chali skipped to keep up with the wiry man as they headed down the dusty street toward the tsera of their kumpania the town of gray woodandstone buildings enclosed inside its shaggy log palisade depressed her and made her feel trappedshe was glad to be heading out to where the kumpania had made their camp her eyes were flashing at petro with the only laughter she could show you did not tell him the rest of the tale elder brother she mindspoke the part that tells how the good god then granted us the right to steal whatever we needed to live there is such a thing as telling more truth than a man wishes to hear petro replied especially to gaje huh but not all gaje i have heard a different tale from you every time we come to a new holding you tell us to always tell the whole of the truth to the horseclans folk no matter how bitter they are not gaje they are not o phral either but they are not gaje i do not know what they are but one does not lie to them but why the rule we have not seen horseclans since before i can remember she objected they are like the wind they call uponthey go where they will but they have the dook so it is wise to be prepared for meeting them at all times i would like to see them one day he regarded her out of the corner of his eye if i am still rom baro you will be hidden if we meet them if i am not i hope you will be wise and hide yourself they have dook i tell youand i am not certain that i wish them to know that we also have it she nodded thoughtfully the rom had not survived this long by giving away secrets do you think my dook is greater than theirs or that they would seek me out if they knew of it it could be i know they value such gifts greatly i am not minded to have you stolen from us for the sake of the children you could bear to one of them she clasped her hands behind her eyes looking downward at the dusty trampled grass as they passed through the open town gate this was the first time petro had ever said anything indicating that he thought her a woman and not a child most of the kumpania including petros wife sara and their boy tibo treated her as an odd mixture of child and phuri dai granted she was tiny perhaps the same injury that had taken her voice had kept her small but she was nearly sixteen wintersand still they reacted to her body as to that of a childs and to her mind as to that of a drabarni of sixty as she frowned a little she pondered petros words and concluded they were wise very wise that the rom possessed draban was not a thing to be bandied about that her own dook was as strong as it was should rightly be kept secret as well yes rom baro i will do as you advise she replied although he did not mindspeak her in return she knew he had heard everything she had told him perfectly well she had so much draban that any human and most beasts could hear her when she chose petro could hear and understand her perfectly for though his mindspeech was not as strong as hers he would have heard her even had he been minddeaf that he had no strong dook was not unusual among the rom since the evil days it was the women that tended to have more draban than the men that was one reason why females had come to enjoy all the freedoms of a man since that timewhen his wife could make a man feel every blow he tended to be less inclined to beat her when his own eyes burned with every tear his daughter shed he was less inclined to sell her into a marriage with someone she feared or hated and when she could blast you with her own pain she tended to be safe from rape as she skipped along beside petro on the worn ruts that led out of the palisade gate and away from town she was vaguely aware of every mind about her she and everyone else in the kumpania had known for a very long time that her dook was growing stronger every year perhaps to compensate for her muteness even the herdguard horses those wise old mares had been impressed and it took a great deal to impress them petro sighed rubbing the back of his neck absently and she could read his surface thoughts easily that was an evil day when illluck led us to the settlement of the chosen a day that ended with poor chali senselessher brother dead and chalis parents captured and burned as witches and every other ablebodied weaponshandy member of the kumpania either wounded or too busy making sure the rest got away alive to avenge the fallen she winced as guilt flooded him as always you gave your eye to save me elder brother that was more than enough i could have done more i could have sent others with your mama and papa i could have taken everyone away from that sty of pigs that nest ofi will not call them chosen of god chosen of o beng perhaps and o beng claims his own elder brother are we not o phral we have more patience than all the gaje in the world we will see the day when o beng takes them chali was as certain of that as she was of the sun overhead and the grass beside the track petros only reply was another sigh he had less faith than she he changed the subject that was making him increasingly uncomfortable so when you stopped being a frighted tawnie juva did you touch the qajo the townsmans heart should we sell him old pika for his little son i think yes he is a good one for gaje pika will like him also it is nearly fall and another winter wandering would be hard on his bones they had made their camp up against a stand of tangled woodland and a good long way off from the palisaded town the camp itself could only be seen from the top of the walls not from the ground that was the way the rom liked thingsthey preferred to be apart from the gaje the tsera was within shouting distance by now and petro sent her off with a pat to her backside the vurdon those neatly built wooden wagons were arranged in a precise circle under the wilderness of trees at the edge of the grasslands with the common fire neatly laid in a pit in the center seven wagons seven familieschali shared petros some thirty seven rom in alland for all they knew the last rom in the world the only rom to have survived the evil days but then not a great deal had survived the evil days those trees for instance showed signs of having once been a purposeful planting but so many generations had passed since the evil days they were now as wild as any forest chali headed not for the camp but for the unpicketed string of horses grazing beyond she wanted to sound out pika if he was willing to stay here this mayor kevin would have his gentle old pony for his son and cheap at the price chali knew pika would guard any child in his charge with all the care he would give one of his own foals pika was a stallion but chali would have trusted a tiny baby to his care petro trusted her judgment in matters of finding their horses homes a few months ago she had allowed him to sell one of their saddlebred stallions and a clutch of mares to mutual satisfaction on the part of horses rom and buyers then it had been a series of sales of mules and donkeys to folk who wound up treating them with good sense and more consideration than they gave to their own wellbeing and in five points she had similarly placed an aging mare petro had raised from a filly and when chali had helped the rom baro strain his meager dook to bid her farewell lisa had been nearly incoherent with gratitude for the fine stable the good feeding the easy work horses were bred into chalis blood for like the rest of this kumpania she was of the lowara natsiyiand the lowara were the horsedealers mostly anyway though there had been some kalderash or coppersmiths among them in the first years by now the kalderash blood was spread thinly through the whole kumpania once or twice in each generation there were artificers but most of rom baro petros people danced to lowara music she called to pika without even thinking his name and the middleaged pony separated himself from a knot of his friends and ambled to her side he rubbed his chestnut nose against her vest and tickled her cheek with his whiskers his thoughts were full of the hope of apples no apples greedy pig do you like this place would you want to stay he stopped teasing her and stood considering breeze blowing wisps of mane and forelock into his eyes and sunlight picking out the white hairs on his nose she scratched behind his ears letting him take his own time about it the grass is good he said finally the gaje horses are not illtreated and my bones ache on cold winter mornings lately a warm stable would be pleasant the blacksmith has a small sonshe let him see the picture she had stolen from the qajos mind of a blondhaired sturdily built bundle of energy the gajo seems kind the horses here like him came the surprising answer he fits the shoe to the hoof not the hoof to the shoe i think i will stay do not sell me cheaply if chali could have laughed aloud she would have pika had been romanos in the rearingand he shared more than a little with that canny trader i will tell romanonot that i need to and dont forget prala if you are unhappy ha the pony snorted with contempt if i am unhappy i shall not leave so much as a hair behind me chali fished a breadcrust out of her pocket and gave it to him then strolled in the direction of romanos vurdon when this kumpania had found itself gifted with dook with more draban than they ever dreamed existed it had not surprised them that they could speak with their horses lowara rom had practically been able to do that before but draban had granted them advantages they had never dared hope for lowara had been good at horsestealing now only the horseclans could better them at it all they needed to do was to sell one of their fourlegged brothers into the hands of the one they wished to relieve of the burdens of wealth all the lowara horses knew how to lift latches unbar gates or find the weak spot in any fence and lowara horses were as glib at persuasion as any of their twolegged friends ninetynine times out of a hundred the lowara would return to the kumpania trailing a string of converts and if the kumpania came across horses that were being mistreated chalis jaw tightened that was what had set the chosen at their throats she remembered that day and night remembered it far too well remembered the pain of the galled beasts that had nearly driven her insane remembered how she and toby had gone to act as decoys while her mother and father freed the animals from their stifling barn remembered the anger and fear the terror in the night and the madness of the poor horse that had been literally goaded into running her and toby down it was just as well that she had been comatose when the chosen of god had burned her parents at the stakethat might well have driven her completely mad that anger made her sight mist with red and she fought it down lest she broadcast it to the herd when she had it under control again she scuffed her way slowly through the dusty flattened grass willing it out of her and into the ground she was so intent on controlling herself that it was not until she had come within touching distance of romanos brightlypainted vurdon that she dared to look up from the earth romano had an audience of children all gathered about him where he sat on the tail of his wooden wagon she tucked up against the worn side of it and waited in the shade without drawing attention to herself for he was telling them the story of the evil days so old simza the drabarni she spoke to the rom baro of her fear and a little of what she had seen giorgi was her son and he had dook enough that he believed her why shouldnt he have believed her tiny ami wanted to know because in those days draban was weak and even the o phral did not always believe in it we were different even among rom we were one of the smallest and least of kumpania then one of the last to leave the old waysperhaps that is why simza saw what she saw perhaps the steel carriages the rom had taken to and the stone buildings they lived in would not let draban through steel carriages rom chal how would such a thing move what horse could pull it that was tomy skeptical as always i do not knowi only know that the memories were passed from simza to yanni to tibo to melalo and so on down to me if you would see look as he had to chali when she was small as he did to every child romano the storyteller opened his mind to the children and they saw with their dook the dim visions of what had been and wondered well though there were those who laughed at him and others of his own kumpania that left to join those who would keep to the cities of the gaje there were enough of them convinced to hold to the kumpania they gave over their gaje ways and returned to the old wooden vurdon pulled by horses practicing their old trades of horsebreeding and metal work staying strictly away from the cities and the irony is that it was the gaje who made this possible for they had become mad with fascination for the ancient days and had begun creating festivals than the yanfi kumpania followed about again came the dim sightshalfremembered music laughter people in wilder garments than ever the rom sported like now asked one of the girls like markets and tradedays no not like now these were special things just for amusement not really for trade i am not certain i understand it they were all a little mad in those times well then the evil days came fire and red death thunder and fearmore people than chali had ever seen alive fleeing mindlessly the wreckage of their cities and their lives but the kumpania was safely traveling out in the countryside with nothing needed that they could not make themselves some others of the rom remembered us and lived to reach us kalderash mostly and we were safe from gaje and their mad ways when have the rom ever been safe he scoffed no if anything we were in more danger yet the gaje wanted our horses our vurdon and gaje law was not there to protect us and there was disease terrible disease that killed more folk than the night of fire had one sickly gajo could have killed us all no we hid at first traveling only by night and keeping off the roads living where man had fled or died out these memories were clearer perhaps because they were so much closer to the way the kumpania lived now hard years though and fearfilleduntil the rom learned again the weapons they had forgotten the bow the knife and learned to use weapons they had never known like the sharp hooves of their fourlegged brothers we lived that way until the old weapons were all exhausted then it was safe to travel openly and to trade we began traveling as we do nowand now life is easier for true god made the gaje to live so that we might borrow from them what we need and that is the tale chali watched with her dook as romano reached out with his mind to all the children seated about him and found what he had been looking for chali felt his exultation of all the children to whom romano had given his memories and his stories there was one in whose mind the memories were still as clear as they were when they had come from romanos tomy had the draban of the storyteller romano had found his successor chali decided that it was wiser not to disturb them for now and slipped away so quietly that they never knew she had been there the scout for clan skaht slipped into the encampment with the evening breeze and went straight to the gathering about chiefs fire his prairiecat had long since reported their impending arrival so the raidleaders had had ample time to gather to hear him well i have good news and bad news daiv mahrtun of skaht announced sinking wearily to the bare earth across the fire from his chief the good news is that these dirtmen look lazy and ripe for the pickingthe bad news is that theyve got traders with em so the peacebanners are up and i mean to tell you theyre the weirdest damn traders i ever saw darker than any ehleeneedress like no clan i knowand he stopped not certain of how much more he wanted to sayand if hed be believed tohnee skaht snorted in disgust and spat into the fire dammit anywayif we break tradepeace word spreads fast agreed his cousin jahn we may have trouble getting other traders to deal with us if we mount a raid while this lots got the peacebanners up there were nearly a dozen clustered about the firepit men and a pair of women old and youngbut all of them were seasoned raiders regardless of age and all of them were profoundly disappointed by the results of daivs scouting foray which traders tohnee asked after a long moment of thought anybody mention a name or a clan you recognized daiv shook his head emphatically i tell you theyre not like any lot ive ever seen or heard tell of they got painted wagons and they aint the big tradewagons more they got whole families not just the menfolkand theyre horsetraders tohnees head snapped up horse before you ask i mindspoke their horses this was a perfect opening for the most disturbing of daivs discoveries this oughta curl your hair the horses wouldnt talk to me it wasnt cause they couldnt and it wasnt cause they was afraid to it was like i was maybe an enemywas surely an outsider and maybe not to be trusted whoever whatever these folks are they got the same kind of alliance with their horses as we have with ours and thats plainly strange wind and sundammit daiv if i didnt know you id be tempted to call you a liar that was dik krooguh whose jaw was hanging loose with total astonishment do the traders mindspeak tohnee asked at nearly the same instant i dunno daiv replied shaking his head i didnt catch any of em at it but that dont mean much my guess would be they do but i cant swear to it i think maybe we need more facts interrupted alis skaht if theyve got horsebrothers id be inclined to say theyre not likely to be a danger to usbut we cant count on that tohnee mm he nodded question is how i took some thought to that daiv replied how about just mosey in openlike dahnah and i could come in like youd sent us to trade with em dahnah was daivs twin sister an archer with no peer in the clan and a strong mindspeaker we could hang around for a couple of days without making em too suspicious and a pair of horseclan kids doin a little dickerin aint gonna make the dirtmen too nervous not while the peacebanners are up tohnee thought that over a while as the fire cast weird shadows on his stony face youve got the sense to call for help if you end up needing itand youve got brighttooth and stubtail backing you the two young prairiecats lounging at daivs side purred agreement all rightit sounds a good enough plan to me tohnee concluded while the rest of the sobered clansfolk nodded slowly you two go in at first morning light and see what you can find and i know i dont need to tell you to be careful but im telling you anyway howard thomson son of king robert thomson was distinctly angered his narrow face was flushed always a bad sign and hed been drinking which was worse when howard drank he thought he owned the world trouble was he was almost right at least in this little corner of it his two swarthy mercbodyguards were between kevin and the doors just what i didnt need kevin thought bleakly taking care that nothing but respect showed on his face a damnfool touchy idiot with a brats disposition tryin to put me between a rock and a hard place i tell you my father sent me expressly to fetch him that blade boy howards face was getting redder by the minute matching his long fiery hair youd better hand it over now before you find yourself lacking a hand ill just bet he sent you kevin growled to himself sure he did you just decided to help yourself more likeand leave me to explain to your father where his piece went while you deny you ever saw me before but his outwardly cool expression didnt change as he replied stolidly your pardon but his highness gave me orders that i was to put it into no ones hands but his and he hasnt sent me written word telling me any different howards face enpurpled as kevin obliquely reminded him that the heir couldnt read or write kevin waited for the inevitable lightning to fall better he should get beaten to a pulp than that king roberts wrath fall on ehrik and keegan which it would if he gave in to howard what with keegan being pregnantbetter a beating he tensed himself and waited for the order except that just at the moment when howard was actually beginning to splutter orders to his two mercbodyguards to take the blacksmith apart salvation in the form of petro and a halfdozen strapping jippos came strolling through the door to the smithy they were technically unarmed but the long knives at their waists were a reminder that this was only a technicality sarishan gajo he said cheerfully we have brought you your pony only then did he seem to notice the heir and his two bodyguards why what is this he asked with obviously feigned surprise do we interrupt some business howard growled something obsceneif he started something now he would be breaking tradepeace and no trader would deal with him or his family again without an extortionate bond being posted for one moment kevin feared that his temper might get the better of him anyway but then the young man pushed past the jippos at the door and stalked into the street leaving his bodyguards to follow as they would kevin sagged against his cold forge only now breaking into a sweat by all thats holy man he told petro earnestly your timing couldnt have been better you saved me from a beatin and thats for damn sure something more than a beating the jippo replied slowly or i misread that one i do not think we will sell any of our beasts there no but he grinned suddenly we lied i fear we did not bring the ponywe brought our other wares you needed six men to carry a bit of copperwork kevin asked incredulously firmly telling himself that he would not begin laughing hysterically out of relief oh nobut i was not of a mind to carry back horseshoes for every beast in our herd by myself i am rom baro not a packmule kevin began laughing after all laughing until his sides hurt out of gratitude for their timely appearance he let them drive a harder bargain with him than he normally would have allowed trading shoes and nails for their whole equippage for about three pounds of brass and copper trinkets and a set of copper pots he knew keegan would lust after the moment she saw them and a very pretty little set of copper jewelry to brighten her spirit she was beginning to show and subject to bouts of depression in which she was certain her pregnancy made her ugly in his eyes this bit of frippery might help remind her that she was anything but he agreed to come by and look at the pony as soon as he finished a delivery of his own he was going to take no chances on howards return he was going to deliver that sword himself now and straight into roberts palsied hands so if that one comes see that he gets no beast nor thing of ours petro concluded chali you speak to the horses most like he will want the king stallion if any chali nodded we could say bakro is none of oursthat hes a wild one that follows our mares petro grinned approval ha a good idea that way nothing of blame comes on us for the restwe wish to leave only pika is that not so the others gathered about him in the shade of his vurdon murmured agreement they had done well enough with their copper and brass jewelry ornaments and pots and with the odd hen or vegetable or sack of grain that had found a mysterious way into a rom kettle or a vurdon well then let us see what we can do to make them unattractive within the half hour the rom horses mules and donkeys little resembled the sleek beasts that had come to the call of their twolegged allies coats were dirty with patches that looked suspiciously like mange hocks were poulticed and looked swollen several of the wise old mares were ostentatiously practicing their limps and there wasnt a hide of an attractive color among them and anyone touching them would be kicked at or nearly bittenthe horses were not minded to have their twolegged brothers punished for their actions narrowed eyes and laidback ears gave the lie to the hilarity within no one really knowledgeable about horses would want to come near this lot and just in time for howard thomson rode into the camp on an oversized duncolored dullard of a gelding only a few moments after the tools of their deceptions had been cleaned up and put away chali briefly touched the beasts mind to see if it was being mistreated only to find it nearly as stupid as one of the mongrels that infested the village he surveyed the copper trinkets with scorn and the sorry herd of horses with disdain then his eye lit upon the king stallion you theretrader he waved his hand at the proud bay stallion who looked back at this arrogant twolegs with the same disdain how much for that beast there the noble prince must forgive us petro fawned while chali was glad for once of her muteness she did not have to choke on her giggles as some of the others were doing but that one is none of ours he is a wild one he follows our mares which we permit in hopes of foals like him out of nags like those you hope for a miracle man howard laughed as close to being in good humor as petro had yet seen him well since hes none of yours you wont mind if my men take him hours later their beasts were ready to founder the king stallion was still frisking like a colt and none of them had come any closer to roping him than they had been when they started the rom were nearly bursting trying to contain their laughter and howard was purple again finally he called off the futile hunt wrenched at the head of his foolish gelding and spurred it back down the road to town and the suppressed laughter died as little amis youngest brother toddled into the path of the lumbering monsterand howard grinned and spurred the gelding at himhard kevin was nearly to the traders camp when he saw the baby wander into the path of howards horseand his heart nearly stopped when he saw the look on the heirs face as he dug his spurs savagely into his geldings flanks the smith didnt even thinkhe just moved he frequently fooled folk into thinking he was slow and clumsy because of his size now he threw himself at the child with every bit of speed and agility he possessed he snatched the toddler curled protectively around it and turned his dive into a frantic roll as if everything had been slowed by a magic spell he saw the horse charging at him and every move horse and rider made howard sawed savagely at the geldings mouth trying to keep it on the path but the gelding shied despite the bite of the bit foamflecks showered from its lips and the foam was spotted with blood at the corners of its mouth it halfreared and managed to avoid the smith and his precious burden by a hairone hoof barely scraped kevins legthen the beast was past thundering wildly toward town kevin didnt get back home until after darkand he was not entirely steady on his feet the stuff the rom drank was a bit more potent than the beer and wine from the tavern or even his own homebrew pacing along beside him lending a supporting shoulder and triumphantly groomed to within an inch of his life and adorned with red ribbons was the pony pika pika was a giftromano wouldnt accept a single clipped coin for him kevin was on a firstname basis with all of the rom now even had a mastered a bit of their tongue not surprising thatseeing as theyd sworn brotherhood with him hed eaten and drunk with them heard their tales listened to their wild bloodstirring musicfelt as if hed come home for the first time rom that was what they called themselves not jipposand o phral which meant the people sort of they danced for himand he didnt wonder that they wouldnt sing or dance before outsiders it would be far too easy for dullard gajo to get the wrong idea from some of those dancesthe women and girls danced with the freedom of the wind and the wildness of the stormand to too many men wild and free meant loose kevin had just been entranced by a way of life hed never dreamed existed pika rolled a notunsympathetic eye at him as he stumbled and leaned in a little closer to him funny about the rom and their horsesyoud swear they could read each others minds they had an affinity that was bordering on witchcraft like that poor little mute child chali kevin had seen with his own eyes how wild the maverick stallion had beenat least when howard and his men had been chasing it but hed also seen chali walk up to him pull his forelock and hop aboard his bare back as if he were no more than a gentle middleaged pony like pika and then watched the two of them pull some trick riding stunts that damn near pulled the eyes out of his sockets it was riding hed remember for a long time and he was right glad hed seen it but he devoutly hoped howard hadnt howard hadnt but one of his men had daiv and dahnah rode up to the traders camp in the early morning leaving brighttooth and stubtail behind them as eyes to the rear the camp appeared little different from any other theyd seenat first glance then you noticed that the wagons were small shaped almost like little houses on wheels and painted like rainbows they were almost distracting enough to keep you from noticing that there wasnt a beast around the encampment not donkey nor horse that was hobbled or picketed i almost didnt believe you daivie his sister said into his mind wonderingly his mare snorted so did he huh thanks a lot sis you catch any broadbeaming she shook her head almost imperceptibly as her mount shifted a little not so much as a stray thought her own thought faded for a moment and she bit her lip now that i think of it thats damned odd these people are buttoned up as tight as a yurt in a windstorm which means what he signaled windstorm to move up beside snowdancer either theyre naturally shielded as well as the best mindspeaker i ever met yet they do have the gift and the first is about as likely as brighttooth sitting down to dinner with an ehleenee priest only if the priest was my dinner sister came the mischievous reply from the grassland behind them with the reply came the mock disgust and nausea from stubtail that his littermate would even contemplate such a notion as eating viletasting ehleenee flesh so where does that leave us daiv asked we go in do a little dickering and see if we can eavesdrop and ill see if i can get any more out of the horses that you did fat chance he replied scornfully but followed in the wake of her mare as she urged her into the camp itself the fire on the hearth that was the only source of light in howards room crackled howard lounged in his thronelike chair in the rooms center his back was to the fire which made him little more than a dark blot to a petitioner and cast all the available light on a petitioners face howard eyed the lanky tavernkeeper who was now kneeling before him with intense speculation you say the smiths been consorting with the heathen traders more than traders mlord willum replied humbly for the past two days theres been a brace of horse barbarians with the traders as well i fear this means no good for the town i knew about the barbarians howard replied leaning back in his padded chair and staring at the flickering shadows on the wall behind willum thoughtfully indeed he did know about the barbarianstwins they were with hair like a summer sun hed spotted the girl riding her beast with careless grace and his loins had ached ever since i fear he grows far too friendly with them mlord his wife and child spend much of the day at the traders camp i think that unlike those of us who are loyal he has forgotten where his duties lie and you havent i take it howard almost smiled mlord knows i am but an honest tavernkeeper and has the honest tavernkeeper informed my father of this possibly treacherous behavior i tried willum replied his eyes not quite concealing his bitterness i have been trying for some time now king robert will not hear a word against the man king robert is a senile old fool howard snapped viciously jerking upright where he sat so that the chair rocked and willum sat back on his heels in startlement king robert is far too readily distracted by pretty toys and pliant wenches his own mouth turned down with a bitterness to equal willumsfor the talented flamehaired local lovely that had been gracing his bed had deserted it last night for his fathers willums eyes narrowed and he crept forward on his knees until he almost touched howards leg perhaps he whispered so softly that howard could barely hear him it is time for a change of rulers chali had been banished to the forest as soon as the bright golden heads of the horseclan twins had been spotted in the grasslands beyond the camp she was not altogether unhappy with her banishmentshe had caught an unwary thought from one of them and had shivered at the strength of it now she did not doubt the rom baros wisdom in hiding her dook that strong would surely ferret out her own and had rather not betray the secret gifts of her people until they knew more about the intent of these two so into the forest she had gone with cloak and firestarter and sack of food and necessaries nor was she alone in her exile petro had deemed it wiser not to leave temptation within howards reach and sent bakro the king stallion with her they had decided to explore the woodsand had wandered far from the encampment to their delight and surprise they had discovered the remains of an apple orchard deep in the heart of the forestthe place had gone wild and reseeded itself several times over and the apples themselves were far smaller than those from a cultivated orchard hardly larger than crabapples but they were still sweetand most of them were ripe they both gorged themselves as much as they dared on the crisp succulent fruits until night had fallen now both were drowsing beneath a tree in chalis camp sharing the warmth of her fire and thinking of nothing in particular when the attack on the rom tsera came chali was awake on the instant her head ringing with the mental anguish of the injuredand god oh god the dying bakro wasnt much behind her in picking up the waves of torment he screamed a trumpeting of defiance and rage she grabbed a handful of mane and pulled herself up onto his back without being consciously aware she had done so and they crashed off into the darkness to the source of that agony but the underbrush they had threaded by day was a series of maddening tangles by night bakros headlong dash ended ignominiously in a tangle of vine and when they extricated themselves from the clawing branches they found their pace slowed to a fumbling crawl the slower they went the more frantic they felt for it was obvious from what they were being bombarded with that the rom were fighting a losing battle and one by one the voices in their heads lost strength then faded until finally there was nothing they stopped fighting their way through the brush then and stood lost in shock in the blackness of the midnight forestutterly completely alone dawn found chali on her knees exhausted face tearstreaked hands bruised from where shed been pounding them on the ground over and over bakro stood over her trembling trembling not from fear or sorrow but from raw red hatred his herd had survived though most had been captured by the enemy twolegs but his twoleg herdchali was all he had left he wanted vengeanceand he wanted it now slowly the hot rage of the stallion penetrated chalis grief i hear you prala i do hear you she sent slowly fumbling her way out of the haze of loss that had fogged her mind kill the stallion trumpeted with mind and voice kill them all she clutched her hands at her throat and encountered the thong that held the little iron cross she pulled it over her head and stared at it dully what good was a god of forgiveness in the light of this slaughter she cast the crossand all it impliedfrom her violently she rose slowly to her feet and put a restraining hand on the stallions neck he ceased his fidgeting and stood absolutely still a great bay statue we will have revenge prala i swear it she told him her own hatred burning as high as his but we shall have it wisely kevin was shoved and kicked down the darkened corridor of the kings manorhouse with brutal indifference smashing up against the hard stone of the walls only to be shoved onward again his head was near to splitting and hed had at least one tooth knocked out the flat sweet taste of blood in his mouth seemed somehow unreal he was angry frightenedand bewildered hed awakened to distant shouts and screams run outside to see a red glow in the direction of the rom campthen hed been set upon from behind whoever it was that had attacked him clubbed him into apparent submission then he had his hands bound behind himand his control broke he began fighting again and was dragged kicking and struggling up to the manorhouse hed seen when his vision had cleared that his attackers were some of king roberts own mercs hed stumbled and nearly fallen on his face from the shockhed figured that the town had been taken by ehleenee or some marauding band the door to king roberts quarters opened and kevin was shoved through it skidding on the flagstone floor to land sprawling on his face at someones feet and here is the last of the suspects my lord he heard willum say unctuously he wrenched himself up onto his knees by brute force lounging at his ease in king roberts favorite chair was howard sumptuously clad and playing with his fathers new sword beside him in the blue and red of howards livery was willum what the hell is that shit supposed to mean asshole kevin was too angry to mind his tongue and a blow from one of the mercs behind him threw him onto his face again made his brains rattle in his head and jarred his teeth to their sockets his vision swam and he saw double for a long moment he pulled himself back into a semikneeling posture with aching difficulty keep a civil tongue in your head in the presence of your king boy willum told him with a faint smile youre suspected of conspiring with those false traders to what invade the town dont make me laugh kevin snorted take over with a handful of men whenwhat the hell do you mean king my father has met with an accident howard purred polishing the blade of the sword he held with a soft cloth the steel glinted redly in the firelight he went mad it seems i was forced to defend myself i have witnesses willum nodded and it seemed to kevin that there was a glint of balefire in the back of the mans eyes so i am king nowby right of arms i have declared that those socalled traders were no such thing at alland i have eliminated their threat slowly kevin began to understand what it was he was saying yougood godthat camp was mostly women children the spawn of vipers will grow to be vipers you broke tradepeace you murdered innocent people babies in their beds that hardly sounds like the words of a loyal subject loyal my ass they deserved my loyaltyall you should get is the contempt of every honest man in this town were the ones whore gonna suffer because of what you just did you broke your sworn word you bastard bound hands or not kevin lunged for the two of them his arms were caught and blows rained down on his head and shoulders still he fought screaming obscenities and only being clubbed halfunconscious kept him from getting to the oathbreakers and tearing their throats out with his teeth when he stopped fighting he was thrown back at howards feet he lay only halfconscious on the cold stone floor and through a mist of dancing sparks could see that howard was purple again take him out and make an example of him the patricide howled burn himhang himtear his guts out no willum laid a restraining hand on his rulers arm not a good ideayou might make him a martyr for those who would doubt you no i have a better idea did we get the horse barbarians as well i seem to remember that you ordered them to be taken the new king regained his normal coloring only the boy howard pouted calming the girl managed to get herself killed damn i wanted that little bitch i thought about having the boy gelded and sold good do that well put it out that it was the horse barbarians that killed the tradersand that the smith conspired with them to raid both the traders and the town well have it that the boy confessed ill have my men start passing the word then by afternoon when the story is spreading well put this fool and his family out of the gatesbanish them the barbarians arent likely to let him live long and they certainly arent likely to give an ear to any tales he might tell howard nodded slowly yesyes indeed willum you are going to go far in my service willum smiled his eyes cast humbly down from his vantage point on the floor kevin saw the balefire he thought hed glimpsed leap into a blaze before being quenched i always intended to my lord chali crept in to the remains of the camp in the gray light before dawn and collected what she could the wagons were charred ruins there were no bodies she supposed with a dull ache in her soul that the murderers had dragged the bodies off to be looted and burned she hoped that the mule would haunt their killers to the end of their days there wasnt much left a few bits of foodstuff of clothing other oddmentscertainly not enough to keep her through the winterbut then she would let the winter take care of itself she had something more to concern her scrabbling through the burned wood into the secret compartments built into the floor of every vurdon she came up with less of use than she had hoped she had prayed for weapons what she mostly found was coin useless to her after searching until the top of the sun was a fingers length above the horizon and dangerously near to betraying her she gave up the search she did manage to collect a bow and several quivers worth of arrowswhich was what she wanted most chali had been one of the best shots in the kumpanianow the gaje would learn to dread her skill she began her oneperson reign of terror when the gates opened in late morning she stood hidden in the trees obscured by the foliage but well within bowshot of the gates an arrow nocked a second loose in her fingers and two more in her teeth the stallion stood motionless at her side she had managed to convince the creatures of the woods about her that she was nothing to fearso a blackbird sang within an arms length of her head and rabbits and squirrels hopped about in the grass at the verge of the forest unafraid everything looked perfectly normal the two men opening the gates died with shafts in their throats before anyone realized that there was something distinctly out of the ordinary this morning when they did realize that there was something wrong the stupid gaje did exactly the wrong thing instead of ducking into cover they ran to the bodies chali dropped two more who trotted out to look then they realized that they were in danger and scrambled to close the gates again she managed to get a fifth before the gates closed fully and the bar on the opposite side dropped with a thud that rang across the plain as they sealed themselves inside now she mounted on bakro and arrowed out of cover someone on the walls shouted but she was out of range before they even had time to realize that she was the source of the attack she clung to bakros back with knees clenched tightly around his barrel pulling two more arrows from the quiver slung at her belt he ran like the wind itself past the walls and around to the back posterngate before anyone could warn the sleepy townsman guarding it that something was amiss she got him too before someone slammed the postern shut and picked off three more injudicious enough to poke their heads over the walls now they were sending arrows of their own after her but they were poor marksmen and their shafts fell short she decided that they were bad enough shots that she dared risk retrieving their arrows to augment her own before sending bakro back under the cover of the forest she snatched at least a dozen sticking up out of the grass where theyd landed leaning down as bakro ran and shook them defiantly at her enemies on the walls as they vanished into the underbrush chalis vengeance had begun kevin was barely conscious only the support of pika on one side and keegan on the other kept him upright ehrik was uncharacteristically silent terribly frightened at the sight of his big strong father reduced to such a state king howard and his minions had been generous piling as much of the familys goods on the ponys back as he could stand before sending the little group out the gates in cold fact that had been willums work and it hadnt been done out of kindness it had been done to make them a more tempting target for the horse barbarians or whatever strange menace it was that now had them hiding behind their stout wooden walls that much kevin could remember and he waited in dull agony for arrows to come at them from out of the forest but no arrows came and the pathetic little group led by a little boy who was doing his best to be brave slowly made their way up the road and into the grasslands chali mindspoke pika and ascertained that the smith had had nothing to do with last nights slaughterthat in fact he was being cast out for objecting to it so she let him bebesides she had other notions in mind she couldnt keep them besieged foreverbut she could make their lives pure hell with a little work she found hornets nests in the orchard she smoked the insects into slumberous stupefication then took the nests down carefully with the help of a scrap of netting and two springy young saplings she soon had an improvised catapult it wasnt very accurate but it didnt have to be all it had to do was get those nests over the palisade which it did the howls from within the walls made her smile for the first time that day next she stampeded the village cattle by beaming pure fear into their minds sending them pounding against the fence of their corral until they broke it down then continuing to build their fear until they ran headlong into the grasslands they might come back they might not the villagers would have to send men out to get them they didand she killed one and wounded five more before their fire drove her back deeper into the forest they brought the cattle inside with thembarely half of the herd she had sent thundering away that made chali smile again with the cattle would come vermin noise muckand perhaps disease and she might be able to add madness to that bakro she broadbeamed unafraid now of being overheard have you found the mindsick weed yet but to her shock it was not bakro who answered her daiv struggled up out of a darkness shot across with lances of red agony it hurt even to thinkand it felt as if every bone in his body had been cracked in at least three places for a very long time he lay without even attempting to move trying to assess his real condition and whereabouts through a haze of pain opening his eyes did not lessen the darkness but an exploratory hand to his face told him that although the flesh was puffed and tender his eyes were probably not damaged and his nose told him of damp earth so he was probably being held in a pit of some kind one with a cover that let in no light either that or it was still dark faint clanks as he moved and his exploring fingers told him that chains encircled his wrists and ankles he tried to lever himself up into a sitting position and quickly gave up the idea his head nearly split in two when he moved it and the bones of his right arm grated a little he started then to mindcall to dahnahthen he remembered hot helpless tears burned his eyes scalded along the raw skin of his face he didnt care windoh wind for he remembered that dahnah was dead killed defending two of the traders tiny children and uselessly for the children had been spitted seconds after she had gone down shed taken one of the bastards with her thoughand stubtail had accounted for another before theyd gotten him as well but daiv couldnt remember seeing brighttooths bodyperhaps the other cat had gotten away he husbanded his strength for a widebeam call opened his mind and heard the stranger bakro came the voice within his mind strong and clear as any of his kin could send have you found the mindsick weed yet he was so startled that he didnt thinkhe just answered who are you he beamed pleasewho are you chali stood frozen when the strangers mind touched her ownthen shut down the channel between them with a ruthless and somewhat frightened haste she kept herself shut down and worked her way deeper into the concealment of the forest worming her way into thickets so thick that a rabbit might have had difficulty in getting through there she sat curled up in a ball shivering with reaction until bakro roused her from her stupor with his own insistent thought i have found the mindsick weed drabarni and something else as well she still felt dazed and confused what she replied raising her head from her knees and found herself looking into a pair of large golden eyes kevin had expected that the horseclan folk would find them eventually what he had not expected was that they would be kind to him and his family he had a moment of dazed recognition of what and who it was that was approaching them across the waving grass he pushed himself away from the pony prepared to die defending his loved ones and fell over on his face in a dead faint when he woke again he was lying on something soft staring up at blue sky and there were two attentive striplings carefully binding up his head when they saw he was awake one of them frowned in concentration and a horseclan warrior strolled up in the next moment youre damn lucky we found you he said speaking slowly so that kevin could understand him he spoke merikan but with an odd accent the words slurring and blurring together your mate was about t fall on her nose and your little one had heatsick not to mention the shape you were in kevin started to open his mouth but the man shook his head dont bother what the pony didnt tell us your mate did his face darkened with anger i knew dirtmen were rottenbut this only one thing she didnt knowthere were two of ours with the traders the nightmare confrontation with howard popped into kevins mind and he felt himself blanch fearing that this friendly barbarian would slit his throat the moment he knew the truth but the moment the memory surfaced the man went absolutely rigid then leapt to his feet shouting the camp boiled up like a nest of angry waspskevin tried to rise as his two attendants sprang to their feet only to pass into oblivion again chali stared into the eyes of the great cat mesmerized my brother is within those walls the cat said to her and i am hurt you must help us true the cat was hurt a long cut along one shoulder more on her flanks chali felt anger stirring within her at the cats imperious tone why should i help you she replied your quarrel is nothing to me the cat licked her injured shoulder a moment then caught her gaze again we have the same enemy she said shortly chali pondered that for a moment and the enemy of my enemyis my friend the cat looked at her with approval that she said purring despite the pain of her wounds is wisdom daiv had just about decided that the mindcall hed caught had been a hallucination born of pain when the stranger touched him again he snatched at the tentatively proffered thoughtthread with neardesperation who are you he gasped please gently brother came a weaker mindvoice joining the first and that was one he knew brighttooth the same her voice strengthened now and carried an odd otherflavor with it as if the first was somehow supporting her how is it with you he steadied himself willing his heart to stop pounding not good theyve put chains on my arms and legs my right arms broken i thinkwhere are you whos with you a friend two friends we are going to try and free you novoice says that she is picking up the thoughts of those dirteaters regarding you and they are not pleasant he shuddered hed had a taste of those thoughts himself and he rather thought hed prefer being sent to the wind we are going to free you my brother brighttooth continued i cannot tell you how for certainbut it will be soon probably tonight be ready it was well past dark chali aided by bakro reached for the mind of yula the cleverest mare of the rom herd within a few moments she had a good idea of the general lay of things inside the stockaded village at least within the mares lineofsightand she knew exactly where the horseclans boy was being kept theyd put him in an unused grain pit a few feet from the corral where the horses had been put yula told chali that they had all been staying very docile hoping to put their captors off their guard well done chali applauded now are you ready for freedom more than ready came the reply do we free the boy as well there was a definite overtone to the mares mindvoice that hinted at rebellion if chali answered in the negative soft heart for hurt colts hmm elder sister na we free him how is your gate fastened contempt was plain one single loop of rawhidefools it is not even a challenqe then here is the plan about an hour after full dark when the nervous guards had begun settling down the mare ambled up to the villager whod been set to guard the grain pit hey old girl he said surprised at the pale shape looming up out of the darkness like a ghost in the moonlight how in hell did you get he did not see the other darker shape coming in behind him the hooves of a second mare lashing into the back of his head ended his sentence and his life at nearly the same moment brighttooth was going over the back wall of the stockade she made a run at the stallion standing rocksteady beneath the wall boosting herself off the scavenged saddle bakro wore there was a brief sound of a scuffle then the cats thoughts touched chalis the guard is dead he tasted awful chali used bakros back as the cat had and clawed her own way over the palisade she let herself drop into the dust of the other side landing as quietly as she could and searched the immediate area with mind touch nothing and noone she slid the bar of the gate back and let bakro in and the two of them headed for the stockade and the grainpits the cat was already there if it had not been for the cats superior nightsight chali would not have been able to find the latch holding it the wooden cover of the pit was heavy chali barely managed to get it raised below her she could see the boys white face peering up at her just touched by the moonlight can you climb she asked hell no he answered ruefully then i must come down to you she had come prepared for this there was a coil of scavenged rope on bakros saddle she tied one end of it to the pommel and dropped the other down into the pit sliding down to land beside the boy once beside him she made an abrupt reassessment not a boy a young man one who might be rather handsome under the dirt and dried blood and bruises she tied the rope around his waist as he tried awkwardly to help from above came an urgent mindcall hurry brighttooth fidgeted the guards are due to report and have not they sense something amiss were ready she answered shortly bakro began backing slowly she had her left arm around the young mans waist holding him steady and guiding him and held to the rope with the other while they walked up the side of the pit it was hardly gracefuland chali was grateful that the pit was not too deepbut at length they reached the top her shoulders were screaming in agony but she let go of him and caught the edge with that hand then let go of the rope and hung for a perilous moment on the verge before hauling herself up she wanted to lie there and recover but there was no time they have found the dead one texal o rako lengo gortiano she spat the young man was trying to get himself onto the rim she grabbed his shoulders while he hissed softly in pain and pulled him up beside her what he asked having sensed something no time she replied grabbing his shoulder and shoving him at bakro she threw herself into the saddle and wasted another precious moment while bakro knelt and she pulled at the young man again catching him offbalance and forcing him to fall facedown across her saddlebow like a sack of grain now my wise ones now the last was broadbeamed to all the herdand even as the perimeter guards began shouting their discovery and torches began flaring all over the town the rom horses began their stampede to freedom the cat was already ahead of them clearing the way with teeth and flashing claws her task was to hold the gate against someone trying to close it chali clung to bakros back with aching legsshe was having her hands full trying to keep the young man from falling off he was in mortal agony every step the stallion took jarring his hurts without mercy but he was fastened to her leg and stirrupiron like a leech the herd was in full gallop nowsweeping everything and everyone aside there was only one thing to stop them the narrowness of the postern gateonly three horses could squeeze through at any one time if there was anyone with a bow and good sense he would have stationed himself there chali heard the first arrow she felt the second hit her arm she shuddered with pain ducked and spread herself over the body in front of her trying to protect her passenger from further shots bakro hesitated for a moment then shouldered aside two mules and a donkey to bully his own way through the gate but not before chali had taken a second wound and a third and a fourth ill say this much for you dirtman youre stubborn the horseclan warriors voice held grudging admiration as it filtered out of the darkness beside kevin he had been detailed to ride at the smiths left hand and keep him from falling out of his saddle he had obviously considered this duty something of an embarrassing ordeal evidently he didnt think it was anymore kevins face was white with pain and he was nearly blind to everything around him but he kept his seat dont call me that i told youafter what they did to my bloodbrothers im not one of them im with youall the way if that means fighting ill fight those oathbreaking childmurdering bastards dont deserve anything but a grave they aint even human anymore not by my way of thinking that was a long speech for him made longer still by the fact that he had to gasp bits of it out between flashes of pain but he meant it every wordand the horseclansman took it at face value simply nodding slowly i just a shout from the forward scout stopped them all dead in their tracks the full moon was nearly as bright as dayand what it revealed had kevins jaw dropping it was a mixed herd of horses mules and donkeysall boneweary and covered with froth and sweat heads hanging as they walked and something slumped over the back of one in the center that gradually revealed itself to be two nearcomatose people seated one before the other and clinging to each other to keep from falling of the horses saddle the clan chief recognized the one in front and slid from his horsess back with a shout the herd approaching them stopped coming the beasts moving only enough to part and let him through then kevin recognized the other and tumbled off his horses back all injuries forgotten while the clan chief and another took the semiconscious boy from the front of the saddle cursing at the sight of the chains on his wrists and ankles it was into kevins arms that chali slumped and he cursed to see the three feathered shafts protruding from her leg and arm chali wanted to stay down in the soft darkness where she could forgetbut they wouldnt let her stay there against her own will she swam slowly up to wakefulness and to full and aching knowledge of how completely alone she was the kumpania was gone and no amount of vengeance would bring it back she was left with nowhere to go and nothing to do with her lifeand no one who wanted her novoice is a fool came the sharp voice in her head she opened her eyes slowly there was brighttooth lying beside her carefully grooming her paw the cat was stretched out along a beautifully tanned fur of dark brown fabric walls stretched above her and chali recognized absently that they must be in a tent how a fool asked a second mindvoice chali saw the tentwall move out of the corner of her eyethe wall opened and became a door and the young man she had helped to rescue bent down to enter he sat himself down beside the cat and began scratching her ears she closed her eyes in delight and purred loudly enough to shake the walls of the tent chali closed her eyes in a spasm of pain and loss their brotherhood only reminded her of what she no longer had i asked you lazy one how a fool chali longed to be able to turn her back on them but the wounds in her side made that impossible she could only turn her face away while tears slid slowly down her cheeksas always soundlessly a firm but gentle hand cupped her chin and turned her head back toward her visitors she squeezed her eyes shut not wanting these gaje to see her loss and her shame at showing it its no shame to mourn said the young man aloud startling her into opening her eyes she had been right about himwith his hurts neatly bandaged and cleaned up he was quite handsome and his gray eyes were very kindand very sad i mourn too he reminded her now she was even more ashamed and bit her lip how could she have forgotten what the cat had told her that he had lost his twinlost her in defending her people for the third time how a fool brighttooth stretched and moved over beside her and began cleaning the tears from her cheeks with a raspy tongue because novoice forgets what she herself told me which is the enemy of my enemy is my brother my friend i said the enemy of my enemy is my friend chali corrected hesitantly entering the conversation at last friend brother all the same the cat replied finishing off her work with a last swipe of her tongue friends are the family you choose not so i youre not gonna be alone not unless you want to the young man said aloud brighttooth is right you can join us join any family in the clan you want there aint a one of them that wouldnt reckon themselves proud to have you as a daughter and a sister there was a certain hesitation in the way he said sister something about that hesitation broke chalis bleak mood what of you she asked would you welcome me as a sister something he sent shyly maybesomething closer than sister she was so astonished that she could only stare at him she saw that he was looking at her in a way that made her very conscious that she was sixteen winters oldin a way that no member of the kumpania had ever looked at her she continued to stare as he gently took one of her hands in his good one it took brighttooth to break the spell pahtwolegs she sent in disgust everything is complicated with you you need clan here is clan for the taking what could be simpler the young man dropped her hand as if it had burned him then began to laugh chali smiled shyly not entirely certain she had truly seen that admiration in his eyes brighttooth has a pretty direct way of seein things he said finally look lets just take this in easy steps right one you get better two we deal with when youre in shape t think about chali nodded threeyoull never be alone again he said in her mind taking her hand in his again not while im around to have a say in it friend brotherwhatever i wont let you be lonely chali nodded again feeling the aching void inside her filling yes she would mourn her dead but she would rejoin the living to do so
