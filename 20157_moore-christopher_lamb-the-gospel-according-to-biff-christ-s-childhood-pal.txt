perfection by what they are or what they are not may you find that which you seek in these pages or outside them may you find perfection and know it by name prologue the angel was cleaning out his closets when the call came halos and moonbeams were sorted into piles according to brightness satchels of wrath and scabbards of lightning hung on hooks waiting to be dusted a wineskin of glory had leaked in the corner and the angel blotted it with a wad of fabric each time he turned the cloth a muted chorus rang from the closet as if hed clamped the lid down on a pickle jar full of hallelujah chorus raziel what in heavens name are you doing the archangel stephan was standing over him brandishing a scroll like a rolledup magazine over a piddling puppy orders the angel asked dirtside i was just there two millennia ago really raziel checked his watch then tapped the crystal are you sure what do you think stephan held out the scroll so raziel could see the burning bush seal when do i leave i was almost finished here now pack the gift of tongues and some minor miracles no weapons its not a wrath job youll be undercover very low profile but important its all in the orders stephan handed him the scroll why me i asked that too and i was reminded why angels are cast out whoa that big stephan coughed clearly an affectation since angels didnt breathe im not sure im supposed to know but the rumor is that its a new book youre kidding a sequel revelations just when you thought it was safe to sin its a gospel a gospel after all this time who levi who is called biff raziel dropped his rag and stood this has to be a mistake it comes directly from the son theres a reason biff isnt mentioned in the other books you know hes a total dont say it but hes such an asshole you talk like

back some chocolate chocolate its a dirtdweller snack youll like it satan invented it devils food you can only eat so much white cake my friend midnight the angel stood on a barren hillside on the outskirts of the holy city of jerusalem he raised his arms aloft and a dry wind whipped his white robe around him arise levi who is called biff a whirlwind formed before him pulling dust from the hillside into a column that took the shape of a man arise biff your time has come the wind whipped into a fury and the angel pulled the sleeve of his robe across his face arise biff and walk again among the living the whirlwind began to subside leaving the manshaped column of dust standing on the hillside in a moment the hillside was calm again the angel pulled a gold vessel from his satchel and poured it over the column the dust washed away leaving a muddy naked man sputtering in the starlight welcome back to the living the angel said the man blinked then held his hand before his eyes as if he expected to see through it im alive he said in a language he had never heard before yes the angel said what are these sounds these words you have been given the gift of tongues ive always had the gift of tongues ask any girl ive known what are these words languages youve been given the gift of languages as were all the apostles then the kingdom has come yes how long two thousand years ago you worthless bag of dog shit said levi who was called biff as he punched the angel in the mouth youre late the angel picked himself up and gingerly touched his lip nice talk to a messenger of the lord its a gift biff said part i the boy god is a comedian playing to an audience that is afraid to laugh voltaire chapter you think you know how this story is going to end but you dont trust me i was there i know the first time i saw the man who would save the world he was sitting near the central well in nazareth with a lizard hanging out of his mouth just the tail end and the hind legs were visible on the outside the head and forelegs were halfway down the hatch he was six like me and his beard had not come in fully so he didnt look much like the pictures youve seen of him his eyes were like dark honey and they smiled at me out of a mop of blueblack curls that framed his face there was a light older than moses in those eyes unclean unclean i screamed pointing at the boy so my mother would see that i knew the law but she ignored me as did all the other mothers who were filling their jars at the well the boy took the lizard from his mouth and handed it to his younger brother who sat beside him in the sand the younger boy played with the lizard for a while teasing it until it reared its little head as if to bite then he picked up a rock and mashed the creatures head bewildered he pushed the dead lizard around in the sand and once assured that it wasnt going anywhere on its own he picked it up and handed it back to his older brother into his mouth went the lizard and before i could accuse out it came again squirming and alive and ready to bite once again he handed it back to his younger brother who smote it mightily with the rock starting or ending the whole process again i watched the lizard die three more times before i said i want to do that too the savior removed the lizard from his mouth and said which part by the way his name was joshua jesus is the greek translation of the hebrew yeshua which is joshua christ is not a last name its the greek for messiah a hebrew word meaning anointed i have no idea what the h in jesus h christ stood for its one of the things i should have asked him me i am levi who is called biff no middle initial joshua was my best friend the angel says im supposed to just sit down and write my story forget about what ive seen in this world but how am i to do that in the last three days i have seen more people more images more wonders than in all my thirtythree years of living and the angel asks me to ignore them yes i have been given the gift of tongues so i see nothing without knowing the word for it but what good does that do did it help in jerusalem to know that it was a mercedes that terrified me and sent me diving into a dumpster moreover after raziel pulled me out and ripped my fingernails back as i struggled to stay hidden did it help to know that it was a boeing that made me cower in a ball trying to rock away my own tears and shut out the noise and fire am i a little child afraid of its own shadow or did i spend twentyseven years at the side of the son of god on the hill where he pulled me from the dust the angel said you will see many strange things do not be afraid you have a holy mission and i will protect you smug bastard had i known what he would do to me i would have hit him again even now he lies on the bed across the room watching pictures move on a screen eating the sticky sweet called snickers while i scratch out my tale on this softassilk paper that reads hyatt regency st louis at the top words words words a million million words circle in my head like hawks waiting to dive onto the page to rend and tear the only two words i want to write why me there were fifteen of uswell fourteen after i hung judasso why me joshua always told me not to be afraid for he would always be with me where are you my friend why have you forsaken me you wouldnt be afraid here the towers and machines and the shine and stink of this world would not daunt you come now ill order a pizza from room service you would like pizza the servant who brings it is named jesus and hes not even a jew you always liked irony come joshua the angel says you are yet with us you can hold him down while i pound him then we will rejoice in pizza raziel has been looking at my writing and is insisting that i stop whining and get on with the story easy for him to say he didnt just spend the last two thousand years buried in the dirt nevertheless he wont let me order pizza until i finish a section so here goes i was born in galilee the town of nazareth in the time of herod the great my father alphaeus was a stonemason and my mother naomi was plagued by demons or at least thats what i told everyone joshua seemed to think she was just difficult my proper name levi comes from the brother of moses the progenitor of the tribe of priests my nickname biff comes from our slang word for a smack upside the head something that my mother said i required at least daily from an early age i grew up under roman rule although i didnt see many romans until i was ten the romans mostly stayed in the fortress city of sepphoris an hours walk north of nazareth thats where joshua and i saw a roman soldier murdered but im getting ahead of myself for now assume that the soldier is safe and sound and happy wearing a broom on his head most of the people of nazareth were farmers growing grapes and olives on the rocky hills outside of town and barley and wheat in the valleys below there were also herders of goats and sheep whose families lived in town while the men and older boys tended the flocks in the highlands our houses were all made of stone and ours had a stone floor although many had floors of hardpacked dirt i was the oldest of three sons so even at the age of six i was being prepared to learn my fathers trade my mother taught my spoken lessons the law and stories from the torah in hebrew and my father took me to the synagogue to hear the elders read the bible aramaic was my first language but by the time i was ten i could speak and read hebrew as well as most of the men my ability to learn hebrew and the torah was spurred on by my friendship with joshua for while the other boys would be playing a round of tease the sheep or kick the canaanite joshua and i played at being rabbis and he insisted that we stick to the authentic hebrew for our ceremonies it was more fun than it sounds or at least it was until my mother caught us trying to circumcise my little brother shem with a sharp rock what a fit she threw and my argument that shem needed to renew his covenant with the lord didnt seem to convince her she beat me to stripes with an olive switch and forbade me to play with joshua for a month did i mention she was besought with demons overall i think it was good for little shem he was the only kid i ever knew who could pee around corners you can make a pretty good living as a beggar with that kind of talent and he never even thanked me brothers children see magic because they look for it when i first met joshua i didnt know he was the savior and neither did he for that matter what i knew was that he wasnt afraid amid a race of conquered warriors a people who tried to find pride while cowering before god and rome he shone like a bloom in the desert but maybe only i saw it because i was looking for it to everyone else he seemed like just another child the same needs and the same chance to die before he was grown when i told my mother of joshuas trick with the lizard she checked me for fever and sent me to my sleeping mat with only a bowl of broth for supper ive heard stories about that boys mother she said to my father she claims to have spoken to an angel of the lord she told esther that she had borne the son of god and what did you say to esther that she should be careful that the pharisees not hear her ravings or wed be picking stones for her punishment then you should not speak of it again i know her husband he is a righteous man cursed with an insane girl for a wife poor thing my father said tearing away a hunk of bread his hands were as hard as horn as square as hammers and as gray as a lepers from the limestone he worked with an embrace from him left scratches on my back that sometimes wept blood yet my brothers and i fought to be the first in his arms when he returned from work each evening the same injuries inflicted in anger would have sent us crying to our mothers skirts i fell asleep each night feeling his hand on my back like a shield fathers do you want to mash some lizards i asked joshua when i saw him again he was drawing in the dirt with a stick ignoring me i put my foot on his drawing did you know that your mother is mad my father does that to her he said sadly without looking up i sat down next to him sometimes my mother makes yipping noises in the night like the wild dogs is she mad joshua asked she seems fine in the morning she sings while she makes breakfast joshua nodded satisfied i guess that madness could pass we used to live in egypt he said no you didnt thats too far farther than the temple even the temple in jerusalem was the farthest place i had been as a child every spring my family took the fiveday walk to jerusalem for the feast of passover it seemed to take forever we lived here then we lived in egypt now we live here again joshua said it was a long way you lie it takes forty years to get to egypt not anymore its closer now it says in the torah my abba read it to me the israelites traveled in the desert for forty years the israelites were lost for forty years i laughed the israelites must be stupid we are the israelites we are yes i have to go find my mother i said when you come back lets play moses and pharaoh the angel has confided in me that he is going to ask the lord if he can become spiderman he watches the television constantly even when i sleep and he has become obsessed with the story of the hero who fights demons from the rooftops the angel says that evil looms larger now than it did in my time and that calls for greater heroes the children need heroes he says i think he just wants to swing from buildings in tight red jammies what hero could touch these children anyway with their machines and medicine and distances made invisible raziel not here a week and he would trade the sword of god to be a web slinger in my time our heroes were few but they were realsome of us could even trace our kinship to them joshua always played the heroesdavid joshua moseswhile i played the evil ones pharaoh ahab and nebuchadnezzar if i had a shekel for every time i was slain as a philistine well id not be riding a camel through the eye of a needle anytime soon ill tell you that as i think back i see that joshua was practicing for what he would become let my people go said joshua as moses okay you cant just say okay i cant no the lord has hardened your heart against my demands whyd he do that i dont know he just did now let my people go nope i crossed my arms and turned away like someone whose heart is hardened behold as i turn this stick into a snake now let my people go okay you cant just say okay why that was a pretty good trick with the stick but thats not how it goes okay no way moses your people have to stay joshua waved his staff in my face behold i will plague you with frogs they will fill your house and your bedchamber and get on your stuff so so thats bad let my people go pharaoh i sorta like frogs dead frogs moses threatened piles of steaming stinking dead frogs oh in that case youd better take your people and go i have some sphinxes and stuff to build anyway dammit biff thats not how it goes i have more plagues for you i want to be moses you cant why not i have the stick oh and so it went im not sure i took to playing the villains as easily as joshua took to being the heroes sometimes we recruited our little brothers to play the more loathsome parts joshuas little brothers judah and james played whole populations like the sodomites outside of lots door send out those two angels so that we can know them i wont do that i said playing lot a good guy only because joshua wanted to play the angels but i have two daughters who dont know anyone you can meet them okay said judah i threw open the door and led my imaginary daughters outside so they could know the sodomites pleased to meet you charmed im sure nice to meet you thats not how it goes joshua shouted youre supposed to try to break the door down then i will smite you blind then you destroy our city james said yes wed rather meet lots daughters let my people go said judah who was only four and often got his stories confused he particularly liked the exodus because he and james got to throw jars of water on me as i led my soldiers across the red sea after moses thats it joshua said judah youre lots wife go stand over there sometimes judah had to play lots wife no matter what story we were doing i dont want to be lots wife be quiet pillars of salt cant talk i dont want to be a girl our brothers always played the female parts i had no sisters to torment and joshuas only sister at the time elizabeth was still a baby that was before we met the magdalene the magdalene changed everything after i overheard my parents talking about joshuas mothers madness i often watched her looking for signs but she seemed to go about her duties like all the other mothers tending to the little ones working in the garden fetching water and preparing food there was no sign of going about on all fours or foaming at the mouth as i had expected she was younger than many of the mothers and much younger than her husband joseph who was an old man by the standards of our time joshua said that joseph wasnt his real father but he wouldnt say who his father was when the subject came up and mary was in earshot she would call to josh then put her finger to her lips to signal silence now is not the time joshua biff would not understand just hearing her say my name made my heart leap early on i developed a littleboy love for joshuas mother that sent me into fantasies of marriage and family and future your father is old huh josh not too old when he dies will your mother marry his brother my father has no brothers why no reason what would you think if your father was shorter than you he isnt but when your father dies your mother could marry someone shorter than you and he would be your father you would have to do what he says my father will never die he is eternal so you say but i think that when im a man and your father dies i will take your mother as my wife joshua made a face now as if he had bitten into an unripe fig dont say that biff i dont mind that shes mad i like her blue cloak and her smile ill be a good father ill teach you how to be a stonemason and ill only beat you when you are a snot i would rather play with lepers than listen to this joshua began to walk away wait be nice to your father joshua bar biffmy own father used my full name like this when he was trying to make a pointis it not the word of moses that you must honor me little joshua spun on his heel my name is not joshua bar biff and it is not joshua bar joseph either its joshua bar jehovah i looked around hoping that no one had heard him i didnt want my only son i planned to sell judah and james into slavery to be stoned to death for uttering the name of god in vain dont say that again josh i wont marry your mother no you wont im sorry i forgive you she will make an excellent concubine dont let anyone tell you that the prince of peace never struck anyone in those early days before he had become who he would be joshua smote me in the nose more than once that was the first time mary would stay my one true love until i saw the magdalene if the people of nazareth thought joshuas mother was mad there was little said of it out of respect for her husband joseph he was wise in the law the prophets and the psalms and there were few wives in nazareth who didnt serve supper in one of his smooth olivewood bowls he was fair strong and wise people said that he had once been an essene one of the dour ascetic jews who kept to themselves and never married or cut their hair but he did not congregate with them and unlike them he still had the ability to smile in those early years i saw him very little as he was always in sepphoris building structures for the romans and the greeks and the landed jews of that city but every year as the feast of firsts approached joseph would stop his work in the fortress city and stay home carving bowls and spoons to give to the temple during the feast of firsts it was the tradition to give first lambs first grain and first fruits to the priests of the temple even first sons born during the year were dedicated to the temple either by promising them for labor when they were older or by a gift of money craftsmen like my father and joseph could give things that they made and in some years my father fashioned mortars and pestles or grinding stones for the tribute while in others he gave tithes of coin some people made the pilgrimage to jerusalem for this feast but since it fell only seven weeks after passover many families could not afford to make the pilgrimage and the gifts went to our simple village synagogue during the weeks leading up to the feast joseph sat outside of his house in the shade of an awning he had made worrying the gnarled olive wood with adze and chisel while joshua and i played at his feet he wore the singlepiece tunic that we all wore a rectangle of fabric with neck hole in the middle belted with a sash so that the sleeves fell to the elbows and the hem fell to the knees perhaps this year i should give the temple my first son eh joshua wouldnt you like to clean the altar after the sacrifices he grinned to himself without looking up from his work i owe them a first son you know we were in egypt at the firsts feast when you were born the idea of coming in contact with blood clearly terrified joshua as it would any jewish boy give them james abba he is your first son joseph shot a glance my way to see if i had reacted i had but it was because i was considering my own status as a first son hoping that my father wasnt thinking along the same lines james is a second son the priests dont want second sons it will have to be you joshua looked at me before he answered then back at his father then he smiled but abba if you should die who will take care of mother if i am at the temple someone will look after her i said im sure of it i will not die for a long time joseph tugged at his gray beard my beard goes white but theres a lot of life in me yet dont be so sure abba joshua said joseph dropped the bowl he was working on and stared into his hands run along and play you two he said his voice little more than a whisper joshua stood and walked away i wanted to throw my arms around the old man for i had never seen a grown man afraid before and it frightened me too can i help i said pointing to the halffinished bowl that lay in josephs lap you go with joshua he needs a friend to teach him to be human then i can teach him to be a man chapter the angel wants me to convey more of joshuas grace grace im trying to write about a sixyearold for christs sakes how much grace could he have its not like joshua walked around professing that he was the son of god every day of the week he was a pretty normal kid for the most part there was the trick he did with the lizards and once we found a dead meadowlark and he brought it back to life and there was the time when we were eight when he healed his brother judahs fractured skull after a game of stone the adulteress got out of hand judah could never get the knack of being an adulteress hed stand there stiff as lots wife you cant do that an adulteress has to be wily and nimblefooted the miracles joshua performed were small and quiet as miracles tend to be once you get used to them but trouble came from the miracles that happened around him without his volition as it were bread and serpents come to mind it was a few days before the passover feast and many of the families of nazareth were not making the pilgrimage to jerusalem that year there had been little rain through our winter season so it was going to be a hard year many farmers could not afford the time away from their fields to travel to and from the holy city my father and joshuas were both working in sepphoris and the romans wouldnt give them time off work beyond the actual feast days my mother had been making the unleavened bread when i came in from playing in the square she held a dozen sheets of the flatbread before her and she looked as if she was going to dash it to the floor any second biff where is your friend joshua my little brothers grinned at me from behind her skirts at home i suppose i just left him what have you boys been doing nothing i tried to remember if i had done anything that should make her this angry but nothing came to mind it was a rare day and id made no trouble both my little brothers were unscathed as far as i knew what have you done to cause this she held out a sheet of the flatbread and there in crispy brown relief on the golden crust was the image of my friend joshuas face she snatched up another sheet of bread and there again was my friend josh graven imagesbig sin josh was smiling mother frowned on smiling well do i need to go to joshuas house and ask his poor insane mother i did this i put joshuas face on the bread i just hoped that she didnt ask me how i had done it your father will punish you when he comes home this evening now go get out of here i could hear my little brothers giggling as i slunk out the door but once outside things worsened women were coming away from their baking stones and each held a sheet of unleavened bread and each was muttering some variation of hey theres a kid on my bread i ran to joshuas house and stormed in without knocking joshua and his brothers were at the table eating mary was nursing joshuas newest little sister miriam you are in big trouble i whispered in joshs ear with enough force to blow out an eardrum joshua held up the flatbread he was eating and grinned just like the face on his bread its a miracle tastes good too said james crunching a corner off of his brothers head its all over town joshua not just your house everyones bread has your face on it he is truly the son of god mary said with a beatific smile oh jeez mother james said yeah jeez mom said judah his mug is all over the passover feast we have to do something they didnt seem to get the gravity of the situation i was already in trouble and my mother didnt even suspect anything supernatural we have to cut your hair what we cannot cut his hair mary said she had always let joshua wear his hair long like an essene saying that he was a nazarite like samson it was just another reason why many of the townspeople thought her mad the rest of us wore our hair cut short like the greeks who had ruled our country since the time of alexander and the romans after them if we cut his hair he looks like the rest of us we can say its someone else on the bread moses mary said young moses yes ill get a knife james judah come with me i said we have to tell the town that the face of moses has come to visit us for the passover feast mary pulled miriam from her breast bent and kissed me on the forehead you are a good friend biff i almost melted in my sandals but i caught joshua frowning at me its not the truth he said it will keep the pharisees from judging you im not afraid of them said the nineyearold i didnt do this to the bread then why take the blame and the punishment for it i dont know seems like i should doesnt it sit still so your mother can cut your hair i dashed out the door judah and james on my heels the three of us bleating like spring lambs behold moses has put his face on the bread for passover behold miracles she kissed me holy moses on a matzo she kissed me the miracle of the serpent it was an omen in a way although i can only say that because of what happened between joshua and the pharisees later on at the time joshua thought it was the fulfillment of a prophecy or thats how we tried to sell it to his mother and father it was late summer and we were playing in a wheat field outside of town when joshua found the nest of vipers a nest of vipers joshua shouted the wheat was so tall i couldnt see where he was calling from a pox on your family i replied no theres a nest of vipers over here really oh i thought you were taunting me sorry a pox off of your family come see i crashed through the wheat to find joshua standing by a pile of stones a farmer had used to mark the boundary of his field i screamed and backpedaled so quickly that i lost my balance and fell a knot of snakes writhed at joshuas feet skating over his sandals and wrapping themselves around his ankles joshua get away from there they wont hurt me it says so in isaiah just in case they havent read the prophets joshua stepped aside sending the snakes scattering and there behind him was the biggest cobra i had ever seen it reared up until it was taller than my friend spreading a hood like a cloak run joshua he smiled im going to call her sarah after abrahams wife these are her children no kidding say goodbye now josh i want to show mother she loves prophecy with that he was off toward the village the giant serpent following him like a shadow the baby snakes stayed in the nest and i backed slowly away before running after my friend i once brought a frog home hoping to keep him as a pet not a large frog a onehanded frog quiet and well mannered my mother made me release him then cleanse myself in the immersion pool the mikveh at the synagogue still she wouldnt let me in the house until after sunset because i was unclean joshua led a fourteenfootlong cobra into his house and his mother squealed with joy my mother never squealed mary slung the baby to her hip kneeled in front of her son and quoted isaiah the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together and a little child shall lead them and the cow and the bear shall feed their young ones shall lie down together and the lion shall eat straw like the ox and the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrices den james judah and elizabeth cowered in the corner too frightened to cry i stood outside the doorway watching the snake swayed behind joshua as if preparing to strike her name is sarah they were cobras not asps i said a whole pile of cobras can we keep her joshua asked ill catch rats for her and make a bed for her next to elizabeths definitely not asps id know an asp if i saw one probably not a cockatrice either id say a cobra actually i didnt know an asp from a hole in the ground shush biff mary said my heart broke with the harshness in my loves voice just then joseph rounded the corner and went through the door before i could catch him no worry he was back outside in an instant jumpin jehoshaphat i checked to see if josephs heart had failed having quickly decided that once mary and i were married the snake would have to go or at least sleep outside but the burly carpenter seemed only shaken and a little dusty from his backward dive through the door not an asp right i asked asps are made small to fit the breasts of egyptian queens right joseph ignored me back away slowly son ill get a knife from my workshop she wont hurt us joshua said her name is sarah shes from isaiah it is in the prophecy joseph mary said i could see joseph searching his memory for the passage although only a layman he knew his scripture as well as anyone i dont remember the part about sarah i dont think its prophecy i offered it says asps and that is definitely not an asp id say shes going to bite joshuas ass off if you dont grab her joseph a guy has to try can i keep her joshua asked joseph had regained his composure by now evidently once you accept that your wife slept with god extraordinary events seem sort of commonplace take her back where you found her joshua the prophecy has been fulfilled now but i want to keep her no joshua youre not the boss of me i suspected that joseph had heard that before just so he said please take sarah back where you found her joshua stormed out of the house his snake following close behind joseph and i gave them a wide berth try not to let anyone see you joseph said they wont understand he was right of course on our way out of the village we ran into a gang of older boys led by jakan the son of iban the pharisee they did not understand there were perhaps a dozen pharisees in nazareth learned men workingclass teachers who spent much of their time at the synagogue debating the law they were often hired as judges and scribes and this gave them great influence over the people of the village so much influence in fact that the romans often used them as mouthpieces to our people with influence comes power with power abuse jakan was only the son of a pharisee he was only two years older than joshua and me but he was well on his way to mastering cruelty if there is a single joy in having everyone you have ever known two thousand years dead it is that jakan is one of them may his fat crackle in the fires of hell for eternity joshua taught us that we should not hatea lesson that i was never able to master along with geometry blame jakan for the former euclid for the latter joshua ran behind the houses and shops of the village the snake behind him by ten steps and me behind her ten steps more as he rounded the corner by the smiths shop joshua ran into jakan knocking him to the ground you idiot jakan shouted rising and dusting himself off his three friends laughed and he spun on them like an angry tiger this one needs to have his face washed in dung hold him the boys turned their focus on joshua two grabbing his arms while the third punched him in the stomach jakan turned to look for a pile to rub joshuas face in sarah slithered around the corner and reared up behind joshua spreading her glorious hood wide above our heads hey i called as i rounded the corner you guys think this is an asp my fear of the snake had changed into a sort of wary affection she seemed to be smiling i know i was sarah swayed from side to side like a wheat stalk in the wind the boys dropped joshuas arms and ran to jakan who had turned and slowly backed away joshua was talking about asps i continued but id have to say that this here is a cobra joshua was bent over still trying to catch his breath but he looked back at me and grinned of course im not the son of a pharisee but hes in league with the serpent jakan screamed he consorts with demons demons the other boys shouted trying to crowd behind their fat friend i will tell my father of this and youll be stoned a voice from behind jakan said what is all this shouting and a sweet voice it was she came out of the house by the smiths shop her skin shone like copper and she had the light blue eyes of the northern desert people wisps of reddishbrown hair showed at the edges of her purple shawl she couldnt have been more than nine or ten but there was something very old in her eyes i stopped breathing when i saw her jakan puffed up like a toad stay back these two are consorting with a demon i will tell the elders and they will be judged she spit at his feet i had never seen a girl spit before it was charming it looks like a cobra to me see there i told you she walked up to sarah as if she were approaching a fig tree looking for fruit not a hint of fear only interest you think this is a demon she said without looking back at jakan wont you be embarrassed when the elders find that you mistook a common snake of the field for a demon it is a demon the girl reached her hand up and the snake made as if to strike then lowered its head until its forked tongue was brushing the girls fingers this is definitely a cobra little boy and these two were probably leading it back to the fields where it would help the farmers by eating rats yep thats what we were doing i said absolutely joshua said the girl turned to jakan and his friends a demon jakan stomped like an angry donkey you are in league with them dont be silly my family has only just arrived from magdala ive never seen these two before but its obvious what they were doing we do it all the time in magdala but then this is a backwater village we do it here too jakan said i waswellthese two make trouble trouble his friends said why dont we let them get on with what they were doing jakan his eyes bouncing from the girl to the snake to the girl again began to lead his friends away i will deal with you two another time as soon as they were around the corner the girl jumped back from the snake and ran toward the door of her house wait joshua called i have to go what is your name im mary of magdala daughter of isaac she said call me maggie come with us maggie i cant i have to go why because ive peed myself she disappeared through the door miracles once we were back in the wheat field sarah headed for her den we watched from a distance as she slid down the hole josh how did you do that i have no idea is this kind of thing going to keep happening probably we are going to get into a lot of trouble arent we what am i a prophet i asked you first joshua stared into the sky like a man in a trance did you see her shes afraid of nothing shes a giant snake whats to be afraid of joshua frowned dont pretend to be simple biff we were saved by a serpent and a girl i dont know what to think about that why think about it at all it just happened nothing happens but by gods will joshua said it doesnt fit with the testament of moses maybe its a new testament i said you arent pretending are you joshua said you really are simple i think she likes you better than she likes me i said the snake right im the simple one i dont know if now having lived and died the life of a man i can write about littleboy love but remembering it now it seems the cleanest pain ive known love without desire or conditions or limitsa pure and radiant glow in the heart that could make me giddy and sad and glorious all at once where does it go why in all their experiments did the magi never try to capture that purity in a bottle perhaps they couldnt perhaps it is lost to us when we become sexual creatures and no magic can bring it back perhaps i only remember it because i spent so long trying to understand the love that joshua felt for everyone in the east they taught us that all suffering comes from desire and that rough beast would stalk me through my life but on that afternoon and for a time after i touched grace at night i would lie awake listening to my brothers breathing against the silence of the house and in my minds eye i could see her eyes like blue fire in the dark exquisite torture i wonder now if joshua didnt make her whole life like that maggie she was the strongest of us all after the miracle of the serpent joshua and i made up excuses to pass by the smiths shop where we might run into maggie every morning we would rise early and go to joseph volunteering to run to the smith for some nails or the repair of a tool poor joseph took this as enthusiasm for carpentry would you boys like to come to sepphoris with me tomorrow joseph asked us one day when we were badgering him about fetching nails biff would your father let you start learning the work of a carpenter i was mortified at ten a boy was expected to start learning his fathers trade but that was a year awayforever when youre nine ii am still thinking about what i will do when i grow up i said my own father had made a similar offer to joshua the day before so you wont become a stonecutter i was thinking about becoming the village idiot if my father will allow it he has a godgiven talent joshua said ive been talking to bartholomew the idiot i said hes going to teach me to fling my own dung and run headlong into walls joseph scowled at me perhaps you two are yet too young next year yes joshua said next year may we go now joseph biff is meeting bartholomew for his lesson joseph nodded and we were off before he inflicted more kindness upon us we actually had befriended bartholomew the village idiot he was foul and drooled a lot but he was large and offered some protection against jakan and his bullies bart also spent most of his time begging near the town square where the women came to fetch water from the well from time to time we caught a glimpse of maggie as she passed a water jar balanced on her head you know we are going to have to start working soon joshua said i wont see you once im working with my father joshua look around you do you see any trees no and the trees we do have olive treestwisted gnarly knotty things right right but youre going to be a carpenter like your father theres a chance of it one word josh rocks rocks look around rocks as far as the eye can see galilee is nothing but rocks dirt and more rocks be a stonemason like me and my father we can build cities for the romans actually i was thinking about saving mankind forget that nonsense josh rocks i tell you chapter the angel will tell me nothing of what happened to my friends of the twelve of maggie all hell say is that they are dead and that i have to write my own version of the story oh hell tell me useless angel storiesof how gabriel disappeared once for sixty years and they found him on earth hiding in the body of a man named miles davis or how raphael snuck out of heaven to visit satan and returned with something called a cell phone evidently everyone has them in hell now he watches the television and when they show an earthquake or a tornado hell say i destroyed a city with one of those once mine was better i am awash in useless angel prattle but about my own time i know nothing but what i saw and when the television makes mention of joshua calling him by his greek name raziel changes the channel before i can learn anything he never sleeps he just watches me watches the television and eats he never leaves the room today while searching for extra towels i opened one of the drawers and there beneath a plastic bag meant for laundry i found a book holy bible it said on the cover thank the lord i did not take the book from the drawer but opened it with my back to the angel there are chapters there that were in no bible i know i saw the names of matthew and john i saw romans and galatiansthis is a book of my time what are you doing the angel asked i covered the bible and closed the drawer looking for towels i need to bathe you bathed yesterday cleanliness is important to my people i know that what you think i dont know that youre not exactly the brightest halo in the bunch then bathe and stand away from the television why dont you go get me some towels ill call down to the desk and he did if i am to get a look at that book i must get the angel to leave the room it came to pass that in the village of japhia the sister village of nazareth that esther the mother of one of the priests of the temple died of bad air the levite priests or sadducees were rich from the tributes we paid to the temple and mourners were hired from all the surrounding villages the families of nazareth made the journey to the next hill for the funeral and for the first time joshua and i were able to spend time with maggie as we walked along the road so she said without looking at us have you two been playing with any snakes lately weve been waiting for the lion to lay down with the lamb joshua said thats the next part of the prophecy what prophecy never mind i said snakes are for boys we are almost men we will begin work after the feast of tabernacles in sepphoris i was trying to sound worldly maggie seemed unimpressed and you will learn to be a carpenter she asked joshua i will do the work of my father eventually yes and you she asked me im thinking of being a professional mourner how hard can it be tear at your hair sing a dirge or two take the rest of the week off his father is a stonemason joshua said we may both learn that skill at my urging my father had offered to take joshua on as an apprentice if joseph approved or a shepherd i added quickly being a shepherd seems easy i went with kaliel last week to tend his flock the law says that two must go with the flock to keep an abomination from happening i can spot an abomination from fifty paces maggie smiled and did you prevent any abominations oh yes i kept all of the abominations at bay while kaliel played with his favorite sheep behind the bushes biff joshua said gravely that was the abomination you were supposed to prevent it was yes whoops oh well i think i would make an excellent mourner do you know the words to any dirges maggie im going to need to learn some dirges i think that when i grow up maggie announced i shall go back to magdala and become a fisherman on the sea of galilee i laughed dont be silly you are a girl you cant be a fisherman yes i can no you cant you have to marry and have sons are you betrothed by the way joshua said come with me maggie and i will make you a fisher of men what the hell does that mean maggie asked i grabbed joshua by the back of his robe and began to drag him away dont pay any attention to him hes mad he gets it from his mother lovely woman but a loony come now josh lets sing a dirge i began improvising what i thought was a good funeral song lalala oh we are really really sad that your mom is dead too bad youre a sadducee and dont believe in an afterlife and your mom is just going to be worm food lala makes you think that you might want to reconsider huh falalalalalawackawacka it sounded great in aramaic really you two are silly gotta go mourning to do see you a fisher of women josh said falalala dont feel badshe was old and had no teeth left lalala come on people you know the words later i said josh you cant keep saying creepy things like that fisher of men you want the pharisees to stone you is that what you want im only doing my fathers work besides maggie is our friend she wouldnt say anything youre going to scare her away no i wont shes going to be with us biff are you going to marry her i dont even know if im allowed to marry at all biff look we were topping the hill into japhia and we could see the crowd of mourners gathering around the village joshua was pointing to a red crest that stood out above the crowdthe helmet crest of a roman centurion the centurion was talking to the levite priest who was arrayed in white and gold his white beard reaching past his belt as we moved into the village we could see twenty or thirty other soldiers watching the crowd why are they here they dont like it when we gather joshua said pausing to study the centurion commander they are here to see that we dont revolt why is the priest talking to him the sadducee wants to assure the roman of his influence over us it wouldnt do to have a massacre on the day of his mothers funeral so hes watching out for us hes watching out for himself only for himself you shouldnt say that about a priest of the temple joshua it was the first time i ever heard joshua speak against the sadducees and it frightened me today i think this priest will learn who the temple belongs to i hate it when you talk like that josh maybe we should go home do you remember the dead meadowlark we found i have a really bad feeling about this joshua grinned at me i could see gold flecks shining in his eyes sing your dirge biff i think maggie was impressed by your singing really you think so nope there was a crowd of five hundred outside the tomb in the front the men had draped striped shawls over their heads and rocked as they prayed the women were separated to the back and except for the wailing of the hired mourners it was as if they didnt exist i tried to catch a glimpse of maggie but couldnt see her through the crowd when i turned again joshua had wormed his way to the front of the men where the sadducee stood beside the corpse of his dead mother reading from a scroll of the torah the women had wrapped the corpse in linen and anointed it with fragrant oils i could smell sandalwood and jasmine amid the acrid sweat of the mourners as i made my way to the front and stood by joshua he looked past the priest and was staring at the corpse his eyes narrowed in concentration he was trembling as if taken by a chill wind the priest finished his reading and began to sing joined by the voices of hired singers who had made the journey all the way from the temple in jerusalem its good to be rich huh i whispered to joshua elbowing him in the ribs he ignored me and balled up his fists at his sides a vein stood out on his forehead as he burned his gaze on the corpse and she moved just a twitch at first the jerk of her hand under the linen shroud i think i was the only one who noticed no joshua dont i said i looked for the romans who were gathered in groups of five at different points around the perimeter of the crowd looking bored their hands resting on the hafts of their short swords the corpse twitched again and raised her arm there was a gasp in the crowd and a boy screamed the men started backing away and the women pushed forward to see what was happening joshua fell to his knees and pressed his fists to his temples the priest sang on the corpse sat up the singers stopped and finally the priest turned to look behind him at his dead mother who had swung her legs off of the slab and looked as if she was trying to stand the priest stumbled back into the crowd clawing at the air before his eyes as if it some vapor was causing this horrible vision joshua was rocking on his knees tears streaming down his cheeks the corpse stood and still covered by the shroud turned as if she was looking around i could see that several of the romans had drawn their swords i looked around and found the commanding centurion standing on the back of a wagon giving signals to his men to stay calm when i looked back i realized that joshua and i had been deserted by the mourners and we stood out in the empty space stop it now josh i whispered in his ear but he continued to rock and concentrate on the corpse who took her first step the crowd seemed to be transfixed by the walking corpse but we were too isolated too alone now with the dead and i knew it would only be seconds before they noticed joshua rocking in the dirt i threw my arm around his throat and dragged him back away from the corpse and into a group of men who were wailing as they backed away is he all right i heard at my ear and turned to see maggie standing beside me help me get him away maggie took one of joshuas arms and i took the other as we dragged him away his body was as stiff as a walking staff and he kept his gaze trained on the corpse the dead woman was walking toward her son the priest who was backing away brandishing the scroll like a sword his eyes as big as saucers finally the woman fell in the dirt twitched then lay still joshua went limp in our arms lets get him out of here i said to maggie she nodded and helped me drag him behind the wagon where the centurion was directing his troops is he dead the centurion asked joshua was blinking as if hed just been awakened from a deep sleep were never sure sir i said the centurion threw his head back and laughed his scale armor rattled with the tossing of his shoulders he was older than the other soldiers grayhaired but obviously lean and strong and totally unconcerned with the histrionics of the crowd good answer boy what is your name biff sir levi bar alphaeus who is called biff sir of nazareth well biff i am gaius justus gallicus undercommander of sepphoris and i think that you jews should make sure your dead are dead before you bury them yes sir i said you girl you are a pretty little thing what is your name i could see that maggie was shaken by the attention of the roman i am mary of magdala sir she wiped at joshuas brow with the edge of her shawl as she spoke you will break someones heart someday eh little one maggie didnt answer but i must have shown some reaction to the question because justus laughed again or perhaps she already has eh biff it is our way sir thats why we jews bury our women when they are still alive it cuts down on the heartbreak the roman took off his helmet ran his hand over his short hair and flung sweat at me go on you two get your friend into the shade its too hot out here for a sick boy go on maggie and i helped joshua to his feet and began to lead him away but when we had gone only a few steps joshua stopped and looked back over his shoulder at the roman will you slay my people if we follow our god he shouted i cuffed him on the back of the head joshua are you insane justus narrowed his gaze at joshua and the smile went out of his eyes whatever they tell you boy rome has only two rules pay your taxes and dont rebel follow those and youll stay alive maggie yanked joshua around and smiled back at the roman thank you sir well get him out of the sun then she turned back to joshua is there something you two would like to tell me its not me i said its him the next day we met the angel for the first time mary and joseph said that joshua had left the house at dawn and they hadnt seen him since i wandered around the village most of the morning looking for joshua and hoping to run into maggie the square was alive with talk of the walking dead woman but neither of my friends was to be found at noon my mother recruited me to watch my little brothers while she went to work with the other women in the vineyard she returned at dusk smelling of sweat and sweet wine her feet purple from walking in the winepress cut loose i ran all over the hilltop checking in our favorite places to play and finally found joshua on his knees in an olive grove rocking back and forth as he prayed he was soaked in sweat and i was afraid he might have a fever strange i never felt that sort of concern for my own brothers but from the beginning joshua filled me with divinely inspired worry i watched and waited and when he stopped his rocking and sat back to rest i faked a cough to let him know i was coming maybe you should stick with lizards for a while longer i failed i have disappointed my father did he tell you that or do you just know it he thought for a moment made as if to brush his hair away from his face then remembered that he no longer wore his hair long and dropped his hands in his lap i ask for guidance but i get no answer i can feel that i am supposed to do things but i dont know what and i dont know how i dont know i think the priest was surprised i certainly was maggie was people will be talking about it for months but i wanted the woman to live again to walk among us to tell of the miracle well it is written two out of three aint bad where is that written dalmatians i thinkdoesnt matter no one else could have done what you did joshua nodded what are people saying they think that it was something the women used to prepare the corpse they are still going through purification for two more days so no one can ask them so they dont know that it was me i hope not joshua dont you understand that you cant do that sort of thing in front of people they arent ready for it but most of them want it they talk about the messiah coming to deliver us all the time dont i have to show them that he has come what do you say to that he was right since i could remember there was always talk of the coming of the messiah of the coming of the kingdom of god of the liberation of our people from the romansthe hills were full of different factions of zealots who skirmished with the romans in hope that they could bring about the change we were the chosen of god blessed and punished like no other on earth when the jews spoke god listened now it was gods turn to speak evidently my best friend was supposed to be the mouthpiece but at that moment i just didnt believe it despite what id seen joshua was my pal not the messiah i said im pretty sure the messiah is supposed to have a beard so its not time yet is that what youre saying right josh im going to know when you dont god sent a messenger to me and he said by the way tell joshua to wait until he can shave before he leads my people out of bondage it could happen dont ask me ask god thats what ive been doing hes not answering it had been getting darker by the minute in the olive grove and i could barely see the shine in joshs eyes but suddenly the area around us was lit up like daylight we looked up to see the dreaded raziel descending on us from above the treetops of course i didnt know he was the dreaded raziel at the time i was just terrified the angel shone like a star above us his features so perfect that even my beloved maggies beauty paled by comparison joshua hid his face and huddled against the trunk of an olive tree i guess he was more easily surprised by the supernatural than i was i just stood there staring with my mouth open drooling like the village idiot fear not for behold i bring you tidings of great joy which shall be to all men for on this day in the city of david is born a savior which is christ the lord then he hovered for a second waiting for his message to sink in joshua uncovered his face and risked a glance at the angel well the angel said it took me a second to digest the meaning of the words and i waited for joshua to say something but he had turned his face skyward and seemed to be basking in the light a silly smile locked on his face finally i pointed a thumb at josh and said he was born in the city of david really said the angel yep his mothers name is mary yep she a virgin he has four brothers and sisters now but at one time yes the angel looked around nervously as if he might expect a multitude of the heavenly host to show up at some point how old are you kid joshua just stared smiling hes ten the angel cleared his throat and fidgeted a bit dropping a few feet toward the ground as he did so im in a lot of trouble i stopped to chat with michael on the way here he had a deck of cards i knew some time had passed but to joshua he said kid were you born in a stable wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger joshua said nothing thats the way his mom tells it i said is he retarded i think youre his first angel hes impressed i think what about you im in trouble because im going to be an hour late for dinner i see what you mean id better get back and check on this if you see some shepherds watching over their flocks by night would you tell themuh tell themthat at some point probably ohten years or so ago that a savior was born could you do that sure okeydokey glory to god in the highest peace on earth goodwill toward men right back at you thanks bye and as quickly as he had come the angel was gone in a shooting star and the olive grove went dark again i could just make out joshuas face as he turned to look at me there you go i said next question i suppose that every boy wonders what he will be when he grows up i suppose that many watch their peers accomplish great things and wonder could i have done that for me to know at ten that my best friend was the messiah while i would live and die a stonecutter seemed too much of a curse for a tenyearold to bear the morning after we met the angel i went to the square and sat with bartholomew the village idiot hoping that maggie would come to the well if i had to be a stonecutter at least i might have the love of an enchanting woman in those days we started training for our lifes work at ten then received the prayer shawl and phylacteries at thirteen signifying our entry into manhood soon after we were expected to be betrothed and by fourteen married and starting a family so you see i was not too young to consider maggie as a wife and i might always have the fallback position of marrying joshuas mother when joseph died the women would come and go fetching water washing clothes and as the sun rose high and the square cleared bartholomew sat in the shade of a tattered date palm and picked his nose maggie never appeared funny how easy heartbreak can come ive always had a talent for it why you cry said bartholomew he was bigger than any man in the village his hair and beard were wild and tangled and the yellow dust that covered him from head to toe gave him the appearance of an incredibly stupid lion his tunic was ragged and he wore no sandals the only thing he owned was a wooden bowl that he ate from and licked clean he lived off of the charity of the village and by gleaning the grain fields there was always some grain left in the fields for the poorit was dictated by the law i never knew how old he was he spent his days in the square playing with the village dogs giggling to himself and scratching his crotch when the women passed he would stick out his tongue and say bleh my mother said he had the mind of a child as usual she was wrong he put his big paw on my shoulder and rubbed leaving a dusty circle of affection on my shirt why you cry he asked again im just sad you wouldnt understand bartholomew looked around and when he saw that we were alone in the square except for his dog pals he said you think too much thinking will bring you nothing but suffering be simple what it was the most coherent thing id ever heard him say do you ever see me cry i have nothing so i am slave to nothing i have nothing to do so nothing makes me its slave what do you know i snapped you live in the dirt you are unclean you do nothing i have to begin working next week and work for a lifetime until i die with a broken back the girl i want is in love with my best friend and hes the messiah im nothing and you youyoure an idiot no im not im a greek a cynic i turned and really looked at him his eyes normally as dull as mud shone like black jewels in the dusty desert of his face whats a cynic a philosopher i am a student of diogenes you know diogenes no but how much could he have taught you your only friends are dogs diogenes went about athens with a lamp in broad daylight holding it in peoples faces saying he was looking for an honest man so he was like the prophet of the idiots no no no bart picked up a small terrier and was gesturing with him to make his point the dog seemed to enjoy it they were all fooled by their culture diogenes taught that all affectations of modern life were false that a man must live simply outdoors carry nothing make no art no poetry no religion like a dog i said yes bart described a flourish in the air with the rat dog exactly the little dog made as if to upchuck from the motion bart put him down and he wobbled away a life without worry right then it sounded wonderful i mean i didnt want to live in the dirt and have other people think me mad like bartholomew but a dogs life really didnt sound bad the idiot had been hiding a deep wisdom all these years im trying to learn to lick my own balls bart said maybe not i have to go find joshua you know he is the messiah dont you wait a minute youre not a jewi thought you didnt believe in any religion the dogs told me he was the messiah i believe them tell joshua i believe them the dogs told you theyre jewish dogs right let me know how the ball licking works out shalom who would have thought that joshua would find his first apostle among the dirt and dogs of nazareth bleh i found joshua at the synagogue listening to the pharisees lecture on the law i stepped through the group of boys sitting on the floor and whispered to him bartholomew says that he knows you are the messiah the idiot did you ask him how long hes known he says the village dogs told him i never thought to ask the dogs he says that we should live simply like dogs carry nothing no affectationswhatever that means bartholomew said that sounds like an essene hes much smarter than he looks hes trying to learn to lick his own balls im sure theres something in the law that forbids that ill ask the rabbi im not sure you want to bring that up to the pharisee did you tell your father about the angel no good ive spoken to joseph hes going to let me learn to be a stonecutter with you i dont want your father to change his mind about teaching me i think the angel would frighten him joshua looked at me for the first time turning from the pharisee who droned on in hebrew have you been crying me no barts stench made my eyes water joshua put his hand on my forehead and all the sadness and trepidation seemed to drain out of me in an instant he smiled better im jealous of you and maggie that cant be good for your neck what trying to lick your own balls its got to be hard on your neck did you hear me im jealous of you and maggie im still learning biff there are things i dont understand yet the lord said i am a jealous god so jealousy should be a good thing but it makes me feel so bad you see the puzzle then jealousy makes you feel bad but god is jealous so it must be good yet when a dog licks its balls it seems to enjoy it but it must be bad under the law suddenly joshua was yanked to his feet by the ear the pharisee glared at him is the law of moses too boring for you joshua bar joseph i have a question rabbi joshua said oh jeez i hid my head in my arms chapter yet another reason that i loathe the heavenly scum with whom i share this room today i found that i had offended our intrepid room service waiter jesus how was i to know when he brought our pizza for dinner i gave him one of the american silver coins that we received from the airport sweet shop called cinnabon he scoffed at mescoffedthen thinking better of it he said señor i know you are foreign so you do not know but this is a very insulting tip better you just sign the room service slip so i get the fee that is added automatically i tell you this because you have been very kind and i know you do not mean to offend but another of the waiters would spit in your food if you should offer him this i glared at the angel who as usual was lying on the bed watching television and for the first time i realized that he did not understand jesus language he did not possess the gift of tongues he had bestowed on me he spoke aramaic to me and he seemed to know hebrew and enough english to understand television but of spanish he understood not a word i apologized to jesus and sent him on his way with a promise that i would make it up to him then i wheeled on the angel you fool these coins these dimes are nearly worthless in this country what do you mean they look like the silver dinars we dug up in jerusalem they are worth a fortune he was right in a way after he called me up from the dead i led him to a cemetery in the valley of ben hiddon and there hidden behind a stone where judas had put it two thousand years ago was the blood moneythirty silver dinars but for a little tarnish they looked just as they did on the day i had taken them and they were almost identical to the coin this country calls the dime except for the image of tiberius on the dinars and some other caesar on the dime we had taken the dinars to an antiquities dealer in the old city which looked nearly the same as it did when id last walked there except that the temple was gone and in its place two great mosques the merchant gave us twenty thousand dollars in american money for them it was this money that we had traveled on and deposited at the hotel desk for our expenses the angel told me the dimes must have the same worth as the dinars and i like a fool believed him you should have told me i said to the angel if i could leave this room i would know myself you have work to do the angel said then he leapt to his feet and shouted at the television the wrath of the lord shall fall upon ye stephanos what in the hell are you shouting at the angel wagged a finger at the screen he has exchanged catherines baby for its evil twin which he fathered with her sister while she was in a coma yet catherine does not realize his evil deed as he has had his face changed to impersonate the bank manager who is foreclosing on catherines husbands business if i was not trapped here i would personally drag the fiend straight to hell for days now the angel had been watching serial dramas on television alternately shouting at the screen or bursting into tears he had stopped reading over my shoulder so i had just tried to ignore him but now i realized what was going on its not real raziel what do you mean its drama like the greeks used to do they are actors in a play no no one could pretend to such evil thats not all spiderman and doctor octopus not real characters in a play you lying dog if youd ever leave the room and look at how real people talk youd know that you yellowhaired cretin but no you stay here perched on my shoulder like a trained bird i am dead two thousand years and even i know better i still need to get a look at that book in the dresser i thought maybe just maybe i could goad the angel into giving me five minutes privacy you know nothing said raziel i have destroyed whole cities in my time sort of makes me wonder if you destroyed the right ones thatd be embarrassing huh then an advertisement came on the screen for a magazine that promised to fill in all the blanks and give the real inside story to all of soap operas soap opera digest i watched the angels eyes widen he grabbed the phone and rang the front desk what are you doing i need that book have them send up jesus i said hell help you get it on our first day of work joshua and i were up before dawn we met near the well and filled the waterskins our fathers had given us then ate our breakfasts flatbread and cheese as we walked together to sepphoris the road although packed dirt most of the way was smooth and easy to walk if rome saw to anything in its territories it was the lifelines of its army as we walked we watched the rockstrewn hills turn pink under the rising sun and i saw joshua shudder as if a chill wind had danced up his spine the glory of god is in everything we see he said we must never forget that i just stepped in camel dung tomorrow lets leave after its light out i just realized it that is why the old woman wouldnt live again i forgot that it wasnt my power that made her arise it was the lords i brought her back for the wrong reason out of arrogance so she died a second time it squished over the side of my sandal well thats going to smell all day but perhaps it was because i did not touch her when ive brought other creatures back to life ive always touched them is there something in the law about taking your camel off the road to do his business there should be if not the law of moses then the romans should have one i mean they wont hesitate to crucify a jew who rebels there should be some punishment for messing up their roads dont you think im not saying crucifixion but a good smiting in the mouth or something but how could i have touched the corpse when it is forbidden by the law the mourners would have stopped me can we stop for a second so i can scrape off my sandal help me find a stick that pile was as big as my head youre not listening to me biff i am listening look joshua i dont think the law applies to you i mean youre the messiah god is supposed to tell you what he wants isnt he i ask but i receive no answer look youre doing fine maybe that woman didnt live again because she was stubborn old people are that way you have to throw water on my grandfather to get him up from his nap try a young dead person next time what if i am not really the messiah you mean youre not sure the angel didnt give it away you think that god might be playing a joke on you i dont think so i dont know the torah as well as you joshua but i dont remember god having a sense of humor finally a grin he gave me you as a best friend didnt he help me find a stick do you think ill make a good stonemason just dont be better at it than i am thats all i ask you stink what have i been saying you really think maggie likes me are you going to be like this every morning because if you are you can walk to work alone the gates of sepphoris were like a funnel of humanity farmers poured out into their fields and groves craftsmen and builders crowded in while merchants hawked their wares and beggars moaned at the roadside joshua and i stopped outside the gates to marvel and were nearly run down by a man leading a string of donkeys laden with baskets of stone it wasnt that we had never seen a city before jerusalem was fifty times larger than sepphoris and we had been there many times for feast days but jerusalem was a jewish cityit was the jewish city sepphoris was the roman fortress city of galilee and as soon as we saw the statue of venus at the gates we knew that this was something different i elbowed joshua in the ribs graven image i had never seen the human form depicted before sinful joshua said shes naked dont look shes completely naked it is forbidden we should go away from here find your father he caught me by my sleeve and dragged me through the gates into the city how can they allow that i asked youd think that our people would tear it down they did a band of zealots joseph told me the romans caught them and crucified them by this road you never told me that joseph told me not to speak of it you could see her breasts dont think about it how can i not think about it ive never seen a breast without a baby attached to it theyre moremore friendly in pairs like that which way to where we are supposed to work my father said to come to the western corner of the city and we would see where the work was being done then come along he was still dragging me his head down stomping along like an angry mule do you think maggies breasts will look like that my father had been commissioned to build a house for a wealthy greek on the western side of the city when joshua and i arrived my father was already there directing the slaves who were hoisting a cut stone into place on the wall i suppose i expected something different i suppose i was surprised that anyone even a slave would do as my father instructed the slaves were nubians egyptians phoenicians criminals debtors spoils of war accidents of birth they were wiry filthy men many wearing nothing more than sandals and a loincloth in another life they might have commanded an army or lived in a palace but now they sweated in the morning chill moving stones heavy enough to break a donkey are these your slaves joshua asked my father am i a rich man joshua no these slaves belong to the romans the greek who is building this house has hired them for the construction why do they do as you ask there are so many of them you are only one man my father hung his head i hope that you never see what the lead tips of a roman whip do to a mans body all of these men have and even seeing it has broken their spirit as men i pray for them every night i hate the romans i said do you little one do you a mans voice from behind hail centurion my father said his eyes going wide joshua and i turned to see justus gallicus the centurion from the funeral at japhia standing among the slaves alphaeus it seems you are raising a litter of zealots my father put his hands on my and joshuas shoulders this is my son levi and his friend joshua they begin their apprenticeship today just boys he said by way of apology justus approached looked quickly at me then stared at joshua for a long time i know you boy ive seen you before the funeral at japhia i said quickly i couldnt take my eyes off of the waspwaisted short sword that hung from the centurions belt no the roman seemed to be searching his memory not japhia ive seen this face in a picture that cant be my father said we are forbidden by our faith from depicting the human form justus glared at him i am not a stranger to your peoples primitive beliefs alphaeus still this boy is familiar joshua stared up at the centurion with a completely blank expression you feel for these slaves boy you would free them if you could joshua nodded i would a mans spirit should be his own to give to god you know there was a slave about eighty years ago who talked like you he raised an army of slaves against rome beat back two of our armies took over all the territories south of rome its a story every roman soldier must learn why what happened i asked we crucified him justus said by the side of the road and his body was eaten by ravens the lesson we all learn is that nothing can stand against rome a lesson you need to learn boy along with your stonecutting just then another roman soldier approached a legionnaire not wearing the cape or the helmet crest of the centurion he said something to justus in latin then looked at joshua and paused in rough aramaic he said hey didnt i see that kid on some bread once wasnt him i said really sure looks like him nope that was another kid on the bread it was me said joshua i backhanded him across the forehead knocking him to the ground no it wasnt hes insane sorry the soldier shook his head and hurried off after justus i offered a hand to help joshua up youre going to have to learn to lie i am but i feel like im here to tell the truth yeah sure but not now i dont exactly know what i expected it would be like working as a stonemason but i know that in less than a week joshua was having second thoughts about not becoming a carpenter cutting great stones with small iron chisels was very hard work who knew look around do you see any trees joshua mocked rocks josh rocks its only hard because we dont know what were doing it will get easier joshua looked at my father who was stripped to the waist chiseling away on a stone the size of a donkey while a dozen slaves waited to hoist it into place he was covered with gray dust and streams of sweat drew dark lines between cords of muscle straining in his back and arms alphaeus joshua called does the work get easier once you know what you are doing your lungs grow thick with stone dust and your eyes bleary from the sun and fragments thrown up by the chisel you pour your lifeblood out into works of stone for romans who will take your money in taxes to feed soldiers who will nail your people to crosses for wanting to be free your back breaks your bones creak your wife screeches at you and your children torment you with open begging mouths like greedy baby birds in the nest you go to bed every night so tired and beaten that you pray to the lord to send the angel of death to take you in your sleep so you dont have to face another morning it also has its downside thanks joshua said he looked at me one eyebrow raised i for one am excited i said im ready to cut some stone stand back josh my chisel is on fire life is stretched out before us like a great bazaar and i cant wait to taste the sweets to be found there josh tilted his head like a bewildered dog i didnt get that from your fathers answer its sarcasm josh sarcasm its from the greek sarkasmos to bite the lips it means that you arent really saying what you mean but people will get your point i invented it bartholomew named it well if the village idiot named it im sure its a good thing there you go you got it got what sarcasm no i meant it sure you did is that sarcasm irony i think whats the difference i havent the slightest idea so youre being ironic now right no i really dont know maybe you should ask the idiot now youve got it what sarcasm biff are you sure you werent sent here by the devil to vex me could be how am i doing so far you feel vexed yep and my hands hurt from holding the chisel and mallet he struck the chisel with his wooden mallet and sprayed us both with stone fragments maybe god sent me to talk you into being a stonemason so you would hurry up and go be the messiah he struck the chisel again then spit and sputtered through the fragments that flew i dont know how to be the messiah so what a week ago we didnt know how to be stonemasons and look at us now it gets easier once you know what youre doing are you being ironic again god i hope not it was two months before we actually saw the greek who had commissioned my father to build the house he was a short softlooking little man who wore a robe that was as white as any worn by the levite priests with a border of interlocking rectangles woven around the hem in gold he arrived in a pair of chariots followed on foot by two body slaves and a halfdozen bodyguards who looked like phoenicians i say a pair of chariots because he rode with a driver in the lead chariot but behind them they pulled a second chariot in which stood the tenfoottall marble statue of a naked man the greek climbed down from his chariot and went directly to my father joshua and i were mixing a batch of mortar at the time and we paused to watch graven image joshua said saw it i said as graven images go i like venus over by the gate better that statue is not jewish joshua said definitely not jewish i said the statues manhood although abundant was not circumcised alphaeus the greek said why havent you set the floor of the gymnasium yet ive brought this statue to display in the gymnasium and theres just a hole in the ground instead of a gymnasium i told you this ground is not suitable for building i cant build on sand ive had the slaves dig down in the sand until they hit bedrock now it has to be backfilled in with stone then pounded but i want to place my statue the greek whined its come all the way from athens would you rather your house fall down around your precious statue dont talk to me that way jew i am paying you well to build this house and i am building this house well which means not on the sand so store your statue and let me do my work well unload it you slaves help unload my statue the greek was talking to joshua and me all of you help unload my statue he pointed to the slaves who had been pretending to work since the greek arrived but who werent sure that it was in their best interest to look like a part of a project about which the master seemed displeased they all looked up with a surprised who me expression on their faces which i noticed was the same in any language the slaves moved to the chariot and began untying the ropes that held the statue in place the greek looked to us are you deaf slaves help them he stormed back to his chariot and grabbed a whip out of the drivers hand those are not slaves my father said those are my apprentices the greek wheeled on him and i should care about that move boys now no joshua said i thought the greek would explode he raised the whip as if to strike what did you say he said no i stepped up to joshuas side my people believe that graven images statues are sinful my father said his voice on the edge of panic the boys are only being true to our god well that is a statue of apollo a real god so they will help unload it as will you or ill find another mason to build my house no joshua repeated we will not right you leprous jar of camel snot i said joshua looked at me sort of disgusted jeez biff too much the greek screeched and started to swing the whip the last thing i saw as i covered my face was my father diving toward the greek i would take a lash for joshua but i didnt want to lose an eye i braced for the sting that never came there was a thump then a twanging sound and when i uncovered my face the greek was lying on his back in the dirt his white robe covered with dust his face red with rage the whip was extended out behind him and on its tip stood the armored hobnail boot of gaius justus gallicus the centurion the greek rolled in the dirt ready to vent his ire on whoever had stayed his hand but when he saw who it was he went limp and pretended to cough one of the greeks bodyguards started to step forward justus pointed a finger at the guard will you stand down or would you rather feel the foot of the roman empire on your neck the guard stepped back into line with his companions the roman was grinning like a mule eating an apple not in the least concerned with allowing the greek to save face so castor am i to gather that you need to conscript more roman slaves to help build your house or is it true what i hear about you greeks that whipping young boys is an entertainment for you not a disciplinary action the greek spit out a mouthful of dust as he climbed to his feet the slaves i have will be sufficient for the task wont they alphaeus he turned to my father his eyes pleading my father seemed to be caught between two evils and unable to decide which was the lesser of them probably he said finally well good then justus said i will expect a bonus payment for the extra work they are doing carry on justus walked through the construction site acting as if every eye was not on him or not caring and paused as he passed joshua and me leprous jar of camel snot he said under his breath old hebrew blessing i ventured you two should be in the hills with the other hebrew rebels the roman laughed tousled our hair then walked away the sunset was turning the hillsides pink as we walked home to nazareth that evening in addition to being almost exhausted from the work joshua seemed vexed by the events of the day did you know thatabout not being able to build on sand he asked of course my fathers been talking about it for a long time you can build on sand but what you build will fall down joshua nodded thoughtfully what about soil dirt is it okay to build on that rock is best but i suppose hard dirt is good i need to remember that we seldom saw maggie in those days after we began working with my father i found myself looking forward to the sabbath when we would go to the synagogue and i would mill around outside among the women while the men were inside listening to the reading of the torah or the arguments of the pharisees it was one of the few times i could talk to maggie without joshua around for though he resented the pharisees even then he knew he could learn from them so he spent the sabbath listening to their teachings i still wonder if this time i stole with maggie somehow represented a disloyalty to joshua but later when i asked him about it he said god is willing to forgive you the sin that you carry for being a child of man but you must forgive yourself for having once been a child i suppose thats right of course its right im the son of god you dolt besides maggie always wanted to talk about me anyway didnt she not always i lied on the sabbath before the murder i found maggie outside the synagogue sitting by herself under a date palm tree i shuffled up to her to talk but kept looking at my feet i knew that if i looked into her eyes i would forget what i was talking about so i only looked at her in brief takes the way a man will glance up at the sun on a sweltering day to confirm the source of the heat wheres joshua were the first words out of her mouth of course studying with the men she seemed disappointed for a moment but then brightened how is your work hard i like playing better what is sepphoris like is it like jerusalem no its smaller but there are a lot of romans there shed seen romans i needed something to impress her and there are graven imagesstatues of people maggie covered her mouth to stifle a giggle statues really i would love to see them then come with us we are leaving tomorrow very early before anyone is awake i couldnt where would i tell my mother i was going tell her that you are going to sepphoris with the messiah and his pal her eyes went wide and i looked away quickly before i was caught in their spell you shouldnt talk that way biff i saw the angel you said yourself that we shouldnt say it i was only joking tell your mother that i told you about a beehive that i found and that you want to go find some honey while the bees are still groggy from the morning cold its a full moon tonight so youll be able to see she just might believe you she might but shell know i was lying when i dont bring home any honey tell her it was a hornets nest she thinks josh and i are stupid anyway doesnt she she thinks that joshua is touched in the head but you yes she thinks youre stupid you see my plan is working for it is written that if the wise man always appears stupid his failures do not disappoint and his success gives pleasant surprise maggie smacked me on the leg that is not written sure it is imbeciles three verse seven there is no book of imbeciles drudges fivefour youre making that up come with us you can be back to nazareth before its time to fetch the morning water why so early what are you two up to were going to circumcise apollo she didnt say anything she just looked at me as if she would see liar written across my forehead in fire it wasnt my idea i said it was joshuas ill go then she said chapter well it worked i finally got the angel to leave the room it went like this raziel called down to the front desk and asked him to send jesus up a few minutes later our latin pal stood at attention at the foot of the angels bed raziel said tell him i need a soap opera digest in spanish i said good afternoon jesus how are you today i am well sir and you as good as can be expected considering this man is holding me prisoner tell him to hurry said raziel he doesnt understand spanish jesus asked not a word of it but dont start speaking hebrew or im sunk are you really a prisoner i wondered why you two never left the room should i call the police no that wont be necessary but please shake your head and look apologetic what is taking so long raziel said give him the money and tell him to go he said he is not allowed to buy publications for you but he can direct you to a place where you can purchase them yourself thats ridiculous hes a servant isnt he he will do as i ask oh my jesus he has asked if you would like to feel the power of his manly nakedness is he crazy i have a wife and two children sadly yes please show him that you are offended by his offer by spitting on him and storming out of the room i dont know sir spitting on a guest i handed him a handful of the bills that hed taught me were appropriate gratuities please it will be good for him very well mister biff he produced an impressive loogie and launched it at the front of the angels robe where it splatted and ran raziel leapt to his feet well done jesus now curse you fuckstick in spanish sorry i was showing off my english i know many swear words well done spanish please pendejo splendid now storm out jesus turned on his heel and left the room slamming the door behind him he spit on me raziel said still not believing it an angel of the lord and he spit on me yes you offended him he called me a fuckstick i heard him in his culture it is an affront to ask another man to buy a soap opera digest for you well be lucky if he ever brings us a pizza again but i want a soap opera digest he said you can buy one just down the street i will be happy to go get one for you not so fast apostle none of your tricks ill get it myself you stay here youll need money i handed him some bills if you leave the room i will find you in an instant you know that absolutely you cannot hide from me wouldnt dream of it hurry now he sort of shuffled sideways toward the door dont try to lock me out im taking a key with me not that i need it or anything being an angel of the lord not to mention a fuckstick i dont even know what that means go go go i shooed him through the door godspeed raziel work on your gospel while im gone right i slammed the door in his face and threw the safety lock raziel has now watched hundreds of hours of american television youd think he would have noticed that people wear shoes when they go outside the book is exactly as i suspected a bible but written in a flowery version of this english ive been writing in the translation of the torah and the prophets from the hebrew is muddled sometimes but the first part seems to be our bible this language is amazingso many words in my time we had very few words perhaps a hundred that we used all the time and thirty of them were synonyms for guilt in this language you can curse for an hour and never use the same word twice flocks and schools and herds of words thats why im supposed to use this language to tell joshuas story ive hidden the book in the bathroom so i can sneak in and read it while the angel is in the room i didnt have time to actually read much of the part of the book they call the new testament but its obvious that it is the story of joshuas life or parts of it anyway ill study it later but now i should go on with the real story i suppose i should have considered the exact nature of what we were doing before i invited maggie to join us i mean there is some difference between the circumcision of an eightdayold baby boy which she had seen before and the same operation on the tenfoot statue of a greek god my goodness that is uh impressive maggie said staring up at the marble member graven image joshua said under his breath even in the moonlight i could tell he was blushing lets do it i pulled a small iron chisel from my pouch joshua was wrapping the head of his mallet with leather to deaden its sound sepphoris slept around us the silence broken only by the occasional bleat of a sheep the evening cook fires had long since gone to coals the dust cloud that stirred through the city during the day had settled and the night air was clean and still from time to time i would catch a sweet whiff of sandalwood coming from maggie and i would lose my train of thought funny the things you remember we found a bucket and turned it upside down for joshua to stand on while he worked he set the tip of my chisel on apollos foreskin and ventured a light tap with the mallet a tiny fragment of marble flaked away give it a good whack i said i cant it will make too much noise no it wont the leather will cover it but i might take the whole end of it off he can spare it maggie said and we both turned to her with our mouths hanging open probably she added quickly im only guessing what do i know im just a girl do you guys smell something we smelled the roman before we heard him heard him before we saw him the romans covered themselves with olive oil before they bathed so if the wind was right or if it was an especially hot day you could smell a roman coming at thirty paces between the olive oil they bathed with and the garlic and dried paste of anchovies they ate with their barley when the legions marched into battle it must have smelled like an invasion of pizza people if theyd had pizzas back then which they didnt joshua took a quick swipe with the mallet and the chisel slipped neatly severing apollos unit which fell to the dirt with a dull thud whoops said the savior shhhhhhhh i shushed we heard the hobnails of the romans boots scraping on stone joshua jumped down from the bucket and looked frantically for a place to hide the walls of the greeks bathhouse were almost completed around the statue so really except for the entrance where the roman was coming there was no place to run hey what are you doing there we stood as still as the statue i could see that it was the legionnaire that had been with justus our first day in sepphoris sir its us biff and joshua remember the kid from the bread the soldier moved closer his hand on the haft of his halfdrawn short sword when he saw joshua he relaxed a bit what are you doing here so early no one is to be about at this hour suddenly the soldier was yanked backward off of his feet and a dark figure fell on him thrusting a blade into his chest over and over maggie screamed and the figure turned to us i started to run stop the murderer hissed i froze maggie threw her arms around me and hid her face in my shirt as i trembled a gurgling sound came from the soldier but he lay still joshua made to step toward the murderer and i threw an arm across his chest to stop him that was wrong joshua said almost in tears you are wrong to kill that man the murderer held his bloody blade up by his face and grinned at us is it not written that moses became a prophet only after killing an egyptian slave driver no master but god sicarii i said yes boy sicarii only when the romans are dead will the messiah come to set us free i serve god by killing this tyrant you serve evil joshua said the messiah didnt call for the blood of this roman the assassin raised his blade and came at joshua maggie and i leapt back but joshua stood his ground the assassin grabbed him by the front of his shirt and pulled him close what do you know of it boy we could clearly see the murderers face in the moonlight maggie gasped jeremiah his eyes went wide with fear or recognition i dont know which he released joshua and made as if to grab maggie i pulled her away mary the anger had left his voice little mary maggie said nothing but i could feel her shoulders heave as she began to sob tell no one of this the murderer said now talking as if he were in a trance he backed away and stood beside the dead soldier no master but god he said then he turned and ran into the night joshua put his hand on maggies head and she immediately stopped crying jeremiah is my fathers brother she said before i go on you should know about the sicarii and to know about them you have to know about the herods so here you go about the time that joshua and i were meeting for the first time king herod the great died after ruling israel under the romans for over forty years it was in fact the death of herod that prompted joseph to bring his family back to nazareth from egypt but thats another story now you need to know about herod herod wasnt called the great because he was a beloved ruler herod the great was in fact a fat paranoid poxridden tyrant who murdered thousands of jews including his own wife and many of his sons herod was called the great because he built things amazing things fortresses palaces theaters harborsa whole city caesarea modeled on the roman ideal of what a city should be the one thing he did for the jewish people who hated him was to rebuild the temple of solomon on mount moriah the center of our faith when h the g died rome divided his kingdom among three of his sons archelaus herod philip and herod antipas it was antipas who ultimately passed sentence on john the baptist and gave joshua over to pilate antipas you sniveling fuckstick if only wed had the word back then it was antipas whose toady pandering to the romans caused bands of jewish rebels to rise up in the hills by the hundreds the romans called all of these rebels zealots as if they were all united in method as well as cause but in fact they were as fragmented as jews of the villages one of the bands that rose in galilee called themselves the sicarii they showed their disapproval of roman rule by the assassination of roman soldiers and officials although certainly not the largest group of zealots by number they were the most conspicuous by their actions no one knew where they came from and no one knew where they went to after they killed but every time they struck the romans did their best to make our lives hell to get us to give the killers up and when the romans caught a zealot they didnt just crucify the leader of the band they crucified the whole band their families and anyone suspected of helping them more than once we saw the road out of sepphoris lined with crosses and corpses my people we ran through the sleeping city stopping only after we had passed through the venus gate where we fell in a heap on the ground gasping we have to take maggie home and get back here for work joshua said you can stay here maggie said i can go by myself no we have to go joshua held his arms out to his sides and we saw the bloody handprints the killer had left on his shirt i have to clean this before someone sees it cant you just make it go away maggie asked its just a stain id think the messiah could get a stain out be nice i said hes not that good at messiah stuff yet it was your uncle after all maggie jumped to her feet you were the one who wanted to do this stupid thing stop joshua said holding his hand up as if he were sprinkling us with silence if maggie hadnt been with us we might be dead now we may still not be safe when the sicarii realize that three witnesses live an hour later maggie was home safe and joshua emerged from the ritual bath outside the synagogue his clothes soaked and rivulets running out of his hair many of us had these mikvehs outside of our homesand there were hundreds outside the temple in jerusalemstone pits with steps leading down both sides into the water so one might walk in over ones head on one side then out on the other after the ritual cleansing was done according to the law any contact with blood called for a cleansing joshua thought it would be a good opportunity to scrub the stain out of his shirt as well cold joshua was shivering and hopping from foot to foot as if on hot coals very cold there was a small stone hut built over the baths so they never got the direct light of the sun consequently they never warmed up evaporation in the dry galilee air chilled the water even more maybe you should come to my house my mother will have a breakfast fire going by now you can warm yourself he wrung out the tail of his shirt and water cascaded down his legs and how would i explain this uh you sinned had an emergency cleansing to do sinned at dawn what sin could i have done before dawn sin of onan i said joshuas eyes went wide have you committed the sin of onan no but im looking forward to it i cant tell your mother that ive committed the sin of onan i havent you could if youre fast ill suffer the cold joshua said the good old sin of onan that brings back memories the sin of onan spilling the old seed on the ground cuffing the camel dusting the donkey flogging the pharisee onanism a sin that requires hundreds of hours of practice to get right or at least thats what i told myself god slew onan for spilling his seed on the ground onans seed not gods gods seed turned out to be my best pal imagine the trouble youd be in if you actually spilled gods seed try explaining that according to the law if you had any contact with nocturnal emissions which are not what come out of your tailpipe at nightwe didnt have cars then you had to purify yourself by baptism and you werent allowed to be around people until the next day around the age of thirteen i spent a lot of time in and out of our mikveh but i fudged on the solitary part of penance i mean its not like that was going to help the problem many a morning i was still dripping and shivering from the bath when i met joshua to go to work spilled your seed upon the ground again hed ask yep youre unclean you know yeah im getting all wrinkly from purifying myself you could stop i tried i think im being vexed by a demon i could try to heal you no way josh im having enough trouble with laying on of my own hands you dont want me to cast out your demon i thought id try to exhaust him first i could tell the scribes and they would have you stoned always trying to be helpful josh was that would probably work but it is written that when the oil of the lamp is used up the wanker shall light his own way to salvation that is not written it is too in uh isaiah is not you need to study your prophets josh how are you going to be the messiah if you dont know your prophets joshua hung his head you are right of course i clapped him on the shoulder youll have time to learn the prophets lets cut through the square and see if there are any girls gathering water of course it was maggie i was looking for it was always maggie by the time we got back to sepphoris the sun was well up but the stream of merchants and farmers that normally poured through the venus gate was not there roman soldiers were stopping and searching everyone who was trying to leave the city sending them back the way they came a group of men and women were waiting outside the gate to go in my father and some of his helpers among them levi my father called he ran to us and herded us to the side of the road whats going on i asked trying to look innocent a roman soldier was murdered last night there will be no work today now you both go home and stay there tell your mothers to keep the children in today if the romans dont find the killer therell be soldiers in nazareth before noon where is joseph joshua asked my father put his arm around joshuas shoulder hes been arrested he must have come to work very early they found him at first light near the body of the dead soldier i only know what has been shouted from inside the gate the romans arent letting anyone in or out of the city joshua tell your mother not to worry joseph is a good man the lord will protect him besides if the romans thought he was the killer he would have been tried already joshua backed away from my father in stiff stumbling steps he stared straight ahead but obviously saw nothing take him home biff ill be along as soon as i can im going to try to find out what theyve done with joseph i nodded and led joshua away by the shoulders when we were a few steps down the road he said joseph came looking for me he was working on the other side of the city the only reason he was near the greeks house is that he was looking for me well tell the centurion we saw who killed the soldier hell believe us and if he believes us believes it was sicarii what will happen to maggie and her family i didnt know what to say joshua was right and my father was wrong joseph was not fine the romans would be questioning him right now maybe torturing him to find out who his accomplices were that he didnt know anything would not save him and a testimony from his son not only wouldnt save him but would send more people to the cross to join him jewish blood was going to be spilled one way or the other over this joshua shook off my hands and ran off the road into an olive grove i started to follow but he suddenly spun on me and the fury of his gaze stopped me in midstride wait he said i need to talk to my father i waited by the road for nearly an hour when joshua walked out of the olive grove he looked as if a shadow had fallen permanently on his face i am lost he said i pointed over my shoulder nazareth that way sepphoris the other way youre in the middle feel better you know what i mean no help from your father then i always felt strange asking about joshuas prayers you had to see him pray especially in those days before we had traveled there was a lot of strain and trembling like someone trying to force a fever to break by sheer will there was no peace in it i am alone joshua said i punched him in the arm hard then you didnt feel that ouch whatd you do that for sorry no one around to answer you youre soooooooo alone i am alone i wound up for a fullbodypowered roundhouse punch then you wont mind if i smite the bejeezus out of you he threw up his hands and jumped back no dont so youre not alone i guess not good then wait here im going to go talk to your father myself i tramped off into the olive grove you dont have to go in there to talk to him he is everywhere yeah right like you know if hes everywhere then how are you alone good point i left joshua standing by the road and went off to pray and thus did i pray heavenly father god of my father and my fathers father god of abraham and isaac god of moses who did lead our people out of egypt god of david and solomonwell you know who you are heavenly father far be it from me to question your judgment being as you are all powerful and the god of moses and all of the above but what exactly are you trying to do to this poor kid i mean hes your son right hes the messiah right are you pulling one of those abraham faithtest things on him in case you didnt notice hes in quite a pickle here having witnessed a murder and his stepfather under arrest by the romans and in all likelihood a lot of our people who you have mentioned on more than one occasion are your favorites and the chosen and of which i am one by the way are going to be tortured and killed unless wei mean hedoes something so what im saying here is could you much as you did with samson when he was backed into a corner weaponless against the philistines throw the kid a bone here with all due respect your friend biff amen i was never very good at prayer storytelling im fine with i in fact am the originator of a universal story that i know has survived to this time because i have heard it on tv it begins two jews go into a bar those two jews me and josh no kidding anyway im not good at prayer but before you think i was a little rough on god theres another thing you need to know about my people our relationship with god was different from other people and their gods sure there was fear and sacrifice and all but essentially we didnt go to him he came to us he told us we were the chosen he told us he would help us to multiply to the ends of the earth he told us he would give us a land of milk and honey we didnt go to him we didnt ask and since he came to us we figure we can hold him responsible for what he does and what happens to us for it is written that he who can walk away controls the deal and if theres anything you learn from reading the bible its that my people walked away a lot you couldnt turn around that we werent off in babylon worshiping false gods building false altars or sleeping with unsuitable women although the latter may be more of a guy thing than a jewish thing and god pretty much didnt mind throwing us into slavery or simply massacring us when we did that we have that kind of relationship with god were family so im not a prayermaster so to speak but that particular prayer couldnt have been that bad because god answered well he left me a message anyway as i emerged from the olive grove joshua held out his hand and said god left a message its a lizard i said it was joshua was holding a small lizard in his outstretched hand yes thats the message dont you see how was i to know what was going on joshua had never lied to me never so if he said that this lizard was a message from god who was i to dispute him i fell to my knees and bowed my head under joshs outstretched hand lord have mercy on me i was expecting a burning bush or something sorry really then to josh i said im not so sure you should take that seriously josh reptiles dont tend to have a great record for getting the message right like for instance oh lets see that adam and eve thing its not that kind of message biff my father hasnt spoken in words but this message is as clear as if his voice had come down from the heavens i knew that i stood up and the message is in my mind when you had been gone only a few minutes this lizard ran up my leg and perched on my hand i realized that it was my father giving me the solution to our problem and the message is you remember when we were little the game we used to play with the lizards sure i do but the message is you remember how i was able to bring them back to life a great trick josh but getting back to the message dont you see if the soldier isnt dead then there was no murder if there was no murder then there is no reason for the romans to harm joseph so all we have to do is see that the soldier is not dead simple of course simple i studied the lizard for a minute looking at it from a number of different angles it was brownish green and seemed quite content to sit there on joshuas palm ask him what were supposed to do now chapter when we got back to nazareth we expected to find joshuas mother hysterical with worry but on the contrary she had gathered joshuas brothers and sisters outside of their house lined them up and was washing their faces and hands as if preparing them for the sabbath meal joshua help me get the little ones ready we are all going to sepphoris joshua was shocked we are the whole village is going to ask the romans to release joseph james was the only one of the children who seemed to understand what had happened to their father there were tear tracks on his cheeks i put my arm around his shoulders hell be fine i said trying to sound cheerful your father is strong theyll have to torture him for days before he gives up the ghost i smiled encouragingly james broke out of my embrace and ran into the house crying mary turned and glared at me shouldnt you be with your family biff oh my breaking heart my bruised ego even though mary had taken position as my emergency backup wife i was crestfallen at her disapproval and to my credit not once during that time of trouble did i wish harm to come to joseph not once after all i was still too young to take a wife and some creepy elder would swoop mary up before i had a chance to rescue her if joseph died before i was fourteen why dont you go get maggie joshua suggested taking only a second from his mission of scrubbing the skin off his brother judahs face her family will want to go with us sure i said and i scampered off to the blacksmiths shop in search of approval from my primary wifetobe when i arrived maggie was sitting outside of her fathers shop with her brothers and sisters she looked as frightened as she had when we first witnessed the murder i wanted to throw my arms around her to comfort her we have a plan i said i mean joshua has a plan are you going to sepphoris with everyone else the whole family she said my father has made nails for joseph theyre friends she tossed her head pointing toward the open shed that housed her fathers forge two men were working over the forge go ahead biff you and joshua go on ahead well be along later she started waving me away and mouthing words silently to me which i didnt pick up what are you saying what what and who is your friend maggie a mans voice coming from near the forge i looked over and suddenly realized what maggie had been trying to tell me uncle jeremiah this is levi bar alphaeus we call him biff he has to go now i started backing away from the killer yes i have to go i looked at maggie not knowing what to do illwei have to well see you in sepphoris maggie said right i said then i turned and dashed away feeling more like a coward than i ever have in my life when we got back to sepphoris there was a large gathering of jews perhaps two hundred outside of the city walls most i recognized as being from nazareth no mob mentality here more a fearful gathering more than half of those gathered were women and children in the middle of the crowd a contingent of a dozen roman soldiers pushed back the onlookers while two slaves dug a grave like my own people the romans did not dally with their dead unless there was a battle ongoing roman soldiers were often put in the ground before the corpse was cool joshua and i spotted maggie standing between her father and her murderous uncle at the edge of the crowd joshua took off toward her i followed but before i got close joshua had taken maggies hand and dragged her into the midst of the crowd i could see jeremiah trying to follow them i dove into the mass and crawled under peoples feet until i came upon a pair of hobnail boots which indicated the lower end of a roman soldier the other end equally roman was scowling at me i stood up semper fido i said in my best latin followed by my most charming smile the soldier scowled further suddenly there was a smell of flowers in my nose and sweet warm lips brushed my ear i think you just said always dog maggie whispered that would be why hes looking so unpleasant then i said out the side of my charming smile in my other ear another familiar if not so sweet whisper sing biff remember the plan joshua said right and so i let loose with one of my famous dirges lalala hey roman guy too bad about your getting stabbed lalala its probably not a message from god or nothing lalala telling you that maybe you should have gone home la la la instead of oppressing the chosen people who god hisownself has said that he likes better than you fa la la la the soldier didnt speak aramaic so the lyrics didnt move him as i had hoped but i think the hypnotic toetappiness of the melody was starting to get him i plunged into my second verse lalala didnt we tell you that you shouldnt eat pork lala although looking at wounds in your chest a dietary change might not have made that big a difference boom shakalakalakalaka boom shakalakalak come on you know the words enough the soldier was yanked aside and gaius justus gallicus stood before us flanked by two of his officers behind him stretched out on the ground was the body of the dead soldier well done biff joshua whispered were offering our services as professional mourners i said with a grin which the centurion was eager not to return that soldier doesnt need mourners he has avengers a voice from the crowd see here centurion release joseph of nazareth he is no murderer justus turned and the crowd parted leaving a path between him and the man who had spoken up it was iban the pharisee standing with several other pharisees from nazareth would you take his place justus asked the pharisee backed away his resolve melting quickly under the threat well justus stepped forward and the crowd parted around him you speak for your people pharisee tell them to give me a killer or would you rather i crucify jews until i get the right one iban was flustered now and began jabbering a mishmash of verses from the torah i looked around and saw maggies uncle jeremiah standing only a few paces behind me when i caught his eye he slipped his hand under his shirtto the haft of a knife i had no doubt joseph didnt kill that soldier joshua shouted justus turned to him and the pharisees took the opportunity to scramble to the back of the crowd i know that justus said you do of course boy no carpenter killed that soldier how do you know that i asked justus motioned to one of his legionnaires and the soldier came forward carrying a small basket the centurion nodded and the soldier upended the basket the stone effigy of apollos severed penis thudded to the ground in front of us uhoh i said because it was a stonecutter justus said my that is impressive maggie said i noticed that joshua was edging toward the body of the soldier i needed to distract justus aha i said someone beat the soldier to death with a stone willie obviously the work of a greek or a samaritanno jew would touch such a thing they wouldnt maggie asked jeez maggie i think you have something to tell me boy justus said joshua had laid hands on the dead soldier i could feel everyones eyes on me i wondered where jeremiah was now was he behind me ready to silence me with a knife or had he made his escape either way i couldnt say a word the sicarii did not work alone if i gave up jeremiah id be dead by a sicarii dagger before the sabbath he cant tell you centurion even if he knew said joshua who had moved back to maggies side for it is written in our holy books that no jew shall rat out another jew regardless of what a weasel one or the other shall be is that written maggie whispered is now joshua whispered back did you just call me a weasel i asked behold a woman at the front of the crowd was pointing to the dead soldier another screamed the corpse was moving justus turned toward the commotion and i took the opportunity to look around for jeremiah he was still there behind me only a few people back but he was staring gapejawed at the dead soldier who was currently standing up and dusting off his tunic joshua was concentrating intently on the soldier but there was none of the sweating or trembling that we had seen at the funeral in japhia to his credit justus although he seemed frightened at first stood his ground as the corpse ambled stifflegged toward him the other soldiers were backing away along with all of the jews except maggie joshua and me i need to report an attack sir the oncedead soldier said performing a very jerky roman salute youreyoure dead justus said am not you have knife wounds all over your chest the soldier looked down touched the wounds gingerly then looked back to his commander seems i have been nicked sir nicked nicked youve been stabbed half a dozen times youre dead as dirt i dont think so sir look im not even bleeding thats because youve bled out son youre dead the soldier began to stagger now started to fall and caught himself i am feeling a little woozy i was attacked last night sir near where they are building that greeks house there he was there he pointed to me and him too he pointed to joshua and the little girl these boys attacked you i could hear scuffling behind me no not them that man over there the soldier pointed to jeremiah who looked around like a trapped animal everyone was so intent on watching the miracle of the talking corpse that they had frozen in place the killer couldnt push his way through the crowd to get away arrest him justus commanded but his soldiers were equally stunned by the resurrection of their cohort now that i think of it the dead soldier said i do remember being stabbed no outlet from the crowd jeremiah turned toward his accuser and drew a blade from under his shirt this seemed to snap the other soldiers out of their trance and they began advancing on the killer from different angles swords drawn at the sight of the blade everyone had moved away from the killer leaving him isolated with no path open but toward us no master but god he shouted then three quick steps and he leapt toward us his knife raised i dove on top of maggie and joshua hoping to shield them but even as i waited for the sharp pain between my shoulder blades i heard the killer scream then a grunt then a protracted moan that ran out of air with a pathetic squeal i rolled over to see gaius justus gallicus with his short sword sunk to the hilt in the solar plexus of jeremiah the killer had dropped his knife and was standing there looking at the romans sword hand looking somewhat offended by it he sank to his knees justus yanked his sword free then wiped the blade on jeremiahs shirt before stepping back and letting the killer fall forward that was him the dead soldier said bastard kilt me he fell forward next to his killer and lay still much better than last time josh i said yes much better maggie said walking and talking you had him going i felt good confident but it was a team effort joshua said i couldnt have done it without everyone giving it their all including god i felt something sharp against my cheek with the tip of his sword justus guided my gaze to apollos stone penis which lay in the dirt next to the two corpses and do you want to explain how that happened the pox i ventured the pox can do that maggie said can rot it right off how do you know that joshua asked her just guessing im sure glad thats all over justus let his sword fall to his side with a sigh go home all of you by order of gaius justus gallicus undercommander of the sixth legion commander of the third and fourth centuries under authority of emperor tiberius and the roman empire you are all commanded to go home and perpetrate no weird shit until i have gotten well drunk and had several days to sleep it off so youre going to release joseph maggie asked hes at the barracks go get him and take him home amen said joshua semper fido i added in latin joshuas little brother judah who was seven by then ran around the roman barracks screaming let my people go let my people go until he was hoarse judah had decided early on that he was going to be moses when he grew up only this time moses would get to enter the promised landon a pony as it turned out joseph had been waiting for us at the venus gate he looked a little confused but otherwise unharmed they say that a dead man spoke joseph said mary was ecstatic yes and walked he pointed out his murderer then he died again sorry joshua said i tried to make him live on but he only lasted a minute joseph frowned did everyone see what you did joshua they didnt know it was my doing but they saw it i distracted everyone with one of my excellent dirges i said you cant risk yourself like that joseph said to joshua its not the time yet if not to save my father when im not your father joseph smiled yes you are joshua hung his head but im not the boss of you josephs smile widened to a grin no i guess not joshua said you neednt have worried joseph i said if the romans had killed you i would have taken good care of mary and the children maggie punched me in the arm good to know joseph said on the road to nazareth i got to walk with maggie a few paces behind joseph and his family maggies family was so distraught over what had happened to jeremiah that they didnt even notice she wasnt with them hes much stronger than he was the last time maggie said dont worry hell be a mess tomorrow oh what did i do wrong oh my faith wasnt strong enough oh i am not worthy of my task hell be impossible to be around for a week or so well be lucky if he stops praying long enough to eat you shouldnt make fun of him hes trying very hard easy for you to say you wont have to hang out with the village idiot until josh gets over this but arent you touched by who he is what he is what good would that do me if i was basking in the light of his holiness all of the time how would i take care of him who would do all of his lying and cheating for him even josh cant think about what he is all of the time maggie i think about him all of the time i pray for him all of the time really do you ever pray for me i mentioned you in my prayers once you did how i asked god to help you not to be such a doofus so you could watch over joshua you meant doofus in an attractive way right of course chapter and the angel said what prophet has this written for in this book is foretold all the events which shall come to pass in the next week in the land of days of our lives and all my children and i said to the angel you fabulously feebleminded bundle of feathers theres no prophet involved they know what is going to happen because they write it all down in advance for the actors to perform so it is written so it shall be done said the angel i crossed the room and sat on the edge of the bed next to raziel his gaze never wavered from his soap opera digest i pushed the magazine down so the angel had to look me in the face raziel do you remember the time before mankind the time when there were only the heavenly host and the lord yes those were the best of times except for the war of course but other than that yes wonderful times and you angels were as strong and beautiful as divine imagination your voices sang praise for the lord and his glory to the ends of the universe and yet the lord saw fit to create us mankind weak twisted and profane right thats when it all started to go downhill if you ask me raziel said well do you know why the lord decided to create us no ours is not to question the will because you are all dumbfucks thats why youre as mindless as the machinery of the stars angels are just pretty insects days of our lives is a show raziel a play its not real get it no and he didnt ive learned that theres a tradition in this time of telling funny stories about the stupidity of people with yellow hair guess where that started i think that we all expected everything to go back to normal after the killer was found but it seemed that the romans were much more concerned with the extermination of the sicarii then they were with a single resurrection to be fair i have to say that resurrections werent that uncommon in those days as i mentioned we jews were quick to get our dead into the ground and with speed theres bound to be errors occasionally some poor soul would fall unconscious during a fever and wake to find himself being wrapped in linen and prepared for the grave but funerals were a nice way to get the family together and there was always a fine meal afterward so no one really complained except perhaps those people who didnt wake before they were buried and if they complainedwell im sure god heard them it paid to be a light sleeper in my time so impressed as they might have been with the walking dead the next day the romans began to round up suspected conspirators the men in maggies family were hauled off to sepphoris at dawn no miracles would come to bring about the release of the prisoners but neither were there any crucifixions announced in the days that followed after two weeks had passed with no word of the fate or condition of the men maggie her mother her aunts and her sisters went to the synagogue on the sabbath and appealed to the pharisees for help the next day the pharisees from nazareth japhia and sepphoris appeared at the roman garrison to appeal to justus for the release of the prisoners i dont know what they said or what sort of leverage they could possibly have used to move the romans but the following day just after dawn the men of maggies family staggered back into our village beaten starving and covered with filth but very much alive there was no feast no celebration for the return of the prisonerswe jews walked softly for a few months to allow the romans to settle down maggie seemed distant in the weeks that followed and josh and i never saw the smile that could make the breath catch in our throats she seemed to be avoiding us rushing out of the square whenever we saw her there or on the sabbath staying so close to the women of her family that we couldnt talk to her finally after a month had passed with absolutely no regard for custom or common courtesy joshua insisted that we skip work and dragged me by the sleeve to maggies house she was kneeling on the ground outside the door grinding some barley with a millstone we could see her mother moving around in the house and hear the sound of her father and older brother simon who was called lazarus working the forge next door maggie seemed to be lost in the rhythm of grinding the grain so she didnt see us approach joshua put his hand on her shoulder and without looking up she smiled you are supposed to be building a house in sepphoris she said we thought it more important to visit a sick friend and who would that be who do you think im not sick in fact ive been healed by the touch of the messiah i think not said joshua she finally looked up at him and her smile evaporated i cant be friends with you two anymore she said things have changed what because your uncle was a sicarii i said dont be silly no because my mother made a bargain to get iban to convince the other pharisees to go to sepphoris and plead for the mens lives what kind of bargain joshua asked i am betrothed she looked at the millstone again and a tear dripped into the powdered grain we were both stunned josh took his hand from her shoulder and stepped back then looked at me as if there was something i could do i felt as if i would start crying at any second myself i managed to choke out who to to jakan maggie said with a sob ibans son the creep the bully maggie nodded joshua covered his mouth and ran a few steps away then threw up i was tempted to join him but instead i crouched in front of maggie how long before youre married im to be married a month after the passover feast mother made him wait six months six months six months thats forever maggie why jakan could be killed in a thousand heinous ways in six months and thats just the ones i can think of right now why someone could turn him in to the romans for being a rebel im not saying who but someone might it could happen im sorry biff dont be sorry for me why would you be sorry for me i know how you feel so im sorry i was thrown for a second i glanced at joshua to see if he could give me a clue but he was still absorbed in splattering his breakfast in the dirt but its joshua who you love i finally said does that make you feel any better well no then im sorry she made as if to reach out to touch my cheek but her mother called her before she made contact right now mary in this house maggie nodded toward the barfing messiah take care of him hell be fine and take care of yourself ill be fine too maggie dont forget i have an emergency backup wife besides its six months a lot can happen in six months its not like we wont see you i was trying to sound more hopeful than i felt take joshua home she said then she quickly kissed me on the cheek and ran into the house joshua was completely against the idea of murdering jakan or even praying for harm to come to him if anything joshua seemed more kindly disposed toward jakan than he had been before going as far as to seek him out and congratulate him on his betrothal to maggie an act that left me feeling angry and betrayed i confronted joshua in the olive grove where he had gone to pray among the twisted tree trunks you coward i said you could strike him down if you wanted to as could you he replied yeah but you can call the wrath of god down upon him id have to sneak up behind him and brain him with a rock theres a difference and you would have me kill jakan for what your bad luck works for me is it so hard for you to give up what you never had i had hope josh you understand hope dont you sometimes he could be mightily dense or so i thought i didnt realize how much he was hurting inside or how much he wanted to do something i think i understand hope im just not sure that i am allowed to have any oh dont start with that everyone gets something but me speech youve got plenty josh wheeled on me his eyes like fire like what what do i have uh i wanted to say something about a really sexy mother but that didnt seem like the sort of thing he wanted to hear uh you have god so do you so does everyone really yes not the romans there are roman jews well youve got uhthat healingraisingthedead thing oh yeah and thats working really well well youre the messiah whats that thats something if you told people you were the messiah theyd have to do what you say i cant tell them why not i dont know how to be the messiah well at least do something about maggie he cant came a voice from behind a tree a golden glow emanated from either side of the trunk whos there joshua called the angel raziel stepped out from behind the tree angel of the lord i said under my breath to josh i know he said in a you seen one you seen em all way he cant do anything the angel repeated why not i asked because he may not know any woman i may not joshua said not sounding at all happy he may not in that he should not or that he cannot i asked the angel scratched his golden head i didnt think to ask its kind of important i said well he cant do anything about mary magdalene i know that they told me to come and tell him that that and that it is time for him to go go where i didnt think to ask i suppose i should have been frightened but i seemed to have passed right through frightened to exasperated i stepped up to the angel and poked him in the chest are you the same angel that came to us before to announce the coming of the savior it was the lords will that i bring that joyful news i just wondered in case all of you angels look alike or something so after you showed up ten years late they sent you with another message i am here to tell the savior that it is time for him to go but you dont know where no and this golden stuff around you this light what is this the glory of the lord youre sure its not stupidity leaking out of you biff be nice he is the messenger of the lord well hell josh hes no help at all if were going to get angels from heaven they should at least know what they are doing blow down walls or something destroy cities oh i dont knowget the whole message im sorry the angel said would you like me to destroy a city go find out where josh is supposed to go how bout that i can do that then do that ill be right back well wait godspeed joshua said in an instant the angel moved behind another tree trunk and the golden glow was gone from the olive grove with a warm breeze you were sort of hard on him joshua said josh being nice isnt always going to get the job done one can try was moses nice to pharaoh before joshua could answer me the warm breeze blew into the olive grove again and the angel stepped out from behind a tree to find your destiny he said what i said what joshua said you are supposed to go find your destiny thats it joshua said yes what about the knowing a woman thing i asked i have to go now grab him josh you hold him and ill hit him but the angel was gone with the breeze my destiny joshua looked at his open empty palms we should have pounded the answer out of him i said i dont think that would have worked oh back to the nice strategy did moses moses should have said let my people go please that would have made the difference it could have worked you dont know so what do you do about your destiny im going to ask the holy of holies when we go to the temple for the passover and so it came to pass that in the spring all of the jews from galilee made the pilgrimage to jerusalem for the passover feast and joshua began the search for his destiny the road was lined with families making their way to the holy city camels carts and donkeys were loaded high with provisions for the trip and all along the column of pilgrims you could hear the bleating of the lambs that would be sacrificed for the feast the road was dry that year and a redbrown cloud of dust wound its way over the road as far as one could see in either direction since we were each the eldest in our families it fell on joshua and me to keep track of all our younger brothers and sisters it seemed that the easiest way to accomplish this was to tie them together so we strung together by height my two brothers and joshs three brothers and two sisters i tied the rope loosely around their necks so it would only choke them if they got out of line i can untie this said james me too said my brother shem but you wont this is the part of the passover where you reenact moses leading you out of the promised land you have to stay with the little ones youre not moses said shem nono im not moses smart of you to notice i tied the end of the rope to a nearby wagon that was loaded high with jars of wine this wagon is moses i said follow it that wagon isnt its symbolic shut the hell up and follow moses thus freed of our responsibilities joshua and i went looking for maggie and her family we knew that maggie and her clan had left after us so we fought backward through the pilgrims braving donkey bites and camel spit until we spotted her royal blue shawl on the hill behind us perhaps a halfmile back we had resolved to just sit by the side of the road to wait until she reached us rather than battle the crowd when suddenly the column of pilgrims started to leave the road altogether moving to the sides in a great wave when we saw the red crest of a centurions helmet come over the top of the hill we understood our people were making way for the roman army there would be nearly a million jews in jerusalem for passovera million jews celebrating their liberation from oppression a very dangerous mix from the roman point of view the roman governor would come from caesarea with his full legion of six thousand men and each of the other barracks in judea samaria and galilee would send a century or two of soldiers to the holy city we used the opportunity to dash back to maggie arriving there at the same time as the roman army the centurion that led the cavalry kicked at me as he passed his hobnail boot missing my head by a hairs breadth i suppose i should be glad he wasnt a standardbearer or i might have been conked with a roman eagle how long do i have to wait before you drive them from the land and restore the kingdom to our people joshua maggie stood there with her hands on her hips trying to look stern but her blue eyes betrayed that she was about to burst into laughter uh shalom to you too maggie joshua said how about you biff have you learned to be an idiot yet or are you behind in your studies those laughing eyes even as the romans passed by only an arms length away god i miss her im learning i said maggie put down the jar shed been carrying and threw her arms out to embrace us it had been months since wed seen her other than passing in the square she smelled of lemons and cinnamon that day we walked with maggie and her family for a couple of hours talking and joking and avoiding the subject that we were all thinking about until maggie finally said are you two coming to my wedding joshua and i looked at each other as if our tongues had suddenly been struck from our mouths i saw that josh was having no luck finding words and maggie seemed to be getting angry well uh maggie its not that were not overjoyed with your good fortune but she took the opportunity to backhand me across the mouth the jar she carried on her head didnt even waver amazing grace that girl had ouch good fortune are you mad my husbands a toad im sick at the thought of him i was just hoping you two would come to help me through the ceremony i think my lip is bleeding joshua looked at me and his eyes went wide uhoh he cocked his head as if listening to the wind what uhoh then i heard the commotion coming from ahead there was a crowd gathered at a small bridgea lot of shouting and waving since the romans had long since passed i assumed someone had fallen in the river uhoh josh said again and he began running toward the bridge sorry i shrugged at maggie then followed josh at the rivers edge no more than a creek really we saw a boy about our age with wild hair and wilder eyes standing waistdeep in the water he was holding something under the water and shouting at the top of his lungs you must repent and atone atone and repent your sins have made you unclean i cleanse you of the evil that you carry like your wallet thats my cousin john joshua said trailing out of the water on either side of john stood our brothers and sisters still tied together but the missing link in the string of siblings was my brother shem who had been replaced by a lot of thrashing and bubbling muddy water in front of john onlookers were cheering on the baptist who was having a little trouble keeping shem under water i think hes drowning shem baptizing joshua said my mother will be happy that shems sins have been cleansed but i have to think were going to be in a lot of trouble if he drowns in the process good point josh said he stepped into the water john stop that john looked at him and seemed a little perplexed cousin joshua yes john let him up he has sinned john said as if that said it all ill take care of his sins you think youre the one dont you well youre not my birth was announced by an angel as well it was prophesied that i would lead youre not the one we should talk about this in another place let him up john hes cleansed john let my brother pop out of the water and i ran down and dragged him and all the other kids out of the river wait the others havent been cleansed they are filthy with sin joshua stepped between his brother james who would have been the next one dunked and the baptist you wont tell mother about this will you halfway between terrified and furious james was tearing at the knots trying to untie the rope from around his neck he clearly wanted revenge on his big brother but at the same time he didnt want to give up his brothers protection from john if we let john baptize you long enough you wont be able to tell your mother will you james me just trying to help out i wont tell james said he looked back at john who was still staring as if hed dash out and grab someone to cleanse any second hes our cousin yes joshua said the son of our mothers cousin elizabeth when did you meet him before i havent then how did you know him i just did hes a loony said james youre both loonies yes a family trait maybe when you get older you can be a loony too you wont tell mother no good joshua said you and biff get the kids moving will you i nodded shooting a glance back to john james is right josh he is a loony i heard that sinner john shouted perhaps you need to be cleansed john and his parents shared supper with us that evening i was surprised that johns parents were older than josepholder than my grandparents even joshua told me that johns birth had been a miracle announced by the angel elizabeth johns mother talked about it all through supper as if it had happened yesterday instead of thirteen years ago when the old woman paused to take a breath joshuas mother started in about the divine announcement of her own sons birth occasionally my mother feeling the need to exhibit some maternal pride that she didnt really feel would chime in as well you know biff wasnt announced by an angel but locusts ate our garden and alphaeus had gas for a month around the time he would have been conceived i think it might have been a sign that certainly didnt happen with my other boys ah mother did i mention that she was besought with a demon after supper joshua and i built our own fire away from the others hoping that maggie would seek us out but it turned out that only john joined us you are not the anointed one john said to joshua gabriel came to my father your angel didnt even have a name we shouldnt be talking about these things joshua said the angel told my father that his son would prepare the way for the lord thats me fine i want nothing more than for you to be the messiah john really john asked but your mother seems so so josh can raise the dead i said john shifted his insane gaze to me and i scooted away from him in case he tried to hit me he cannot john said yep ive seen it twice dont biff josh said youre lying bearing false witness is a sin john said the baptist started to look more panicked than angry im not very good at it joshua said johns eyes went wide now with amazement instead of madness you have done this you have raised the dead and healed the sick i said john grabbed me by the front of my tunic and pulled me close staring into my eyes as if he was looking into my head you arent lying are you he looked at joshua hes not lying is he joshua shook his head i dont think so john released me let out a long sigh then sat back in the dirt the firelight caught tears sparkling in his eyes as he stared at nothing i am so relieved i didnt know what i would do i dont know how to be the messiah neither do i said joshua well i hope you really can raise the dead john said because this will kill my mother we walked with john for the next three days through samaria into judea and finally into the holy city fortunately there werent many rivers or streams along the way so we were able to keep his baptisms to a minimum his heart was in the right place he really did want to cleanse our people of their sins it was just that no one would believe that god would give that responsibility to a thirteenyearold to keep john happy josh and i let him baptize our little brothers and sisters at every body of water we passed at least until joshs little sister miriam developed the sniffles and joshua had to perform an emergency healing on her you really can heal john exclaimed well the sniffles are easy joshua said a little mucus is nothing against the power of the lord wouldwould you mind john said lifting up his tunic and showing his bare privates which were covered with sores and greenish scales cover please cover i yelled drop the shirt and step away thats disgusting joshua said am i unclean ive been afraid to ask my father and i cant go to a pharisee not with my father being a priest i think its from standing in the water all of the time can you heal me i have to say here that i believe that this was the first time joshuas little sister miriam ever saw a mans privates she was only six at the time but the experience so frightened her that she never married the last time anyone heard from her she had cut her hair short put on mens clothes and moved to the greek island of lesbos but that was later have at it josh i said lay your hands upon the affliction and heal it joshua shot me a dirty look then looked back to his cousin john with nothing but compassion in his eyes my mother has some salve you can put on it he said lets see if that works first ive tried salve john said i was afraid you had said joshua have you tried rubbing it with olive oil i asked it probably wont cure you but it might take your mind off of it biff please john is afflicted sorry joshua said come here john oh jeez joshua i said youre not going to touch it are you hes unclean let him live with the lepers joshua put his hands on johns head and the baptists eyes rolled back in his head i thought he would fall and he did waver but remained standing father you have sent this one to prepare the way let him go forth with his body as clean as his spirit joshua released his cousin and stepped back john opened his eyes and smiled i am healed he yelled i am healed john began to raise his shirt and i caught his arm well take your word for it the baptist fell to his knees then prostrated himself before joshua shoving his face against joshs feet you are truly the messiah im sorry i ever doubted you i shall declare your holiness throughout the land uh maybe someday but not now joshua said john looked up from where he had been grasping joshs ankles not now were trying to keep it a secret i said josh patted his cousins head yes it would be best not to tell anyone about the healing john but why we have to find out a couple of things before joshua starts being the messiah i said like what john seemed as if he would start crying again well like where joshua left his destiny and whether or not hes allowed to uh have an abomination with a woman its not an abomination if its with a woman josh added its not nope sheep goats pretty much any animalits an abomination but with a woman its something totally different what about a woman and a goat whats that asked john thats five shekels in damascus i said six if you want to help joshua punched me in the shoulder sorry old joke i grinned couldnt resist john closed his eyes and rubbed his temples as if he might squeeze some understanding out of his mind if he applied enough pressure so you dont want anyone to know that you have the power to heal because you dont know if you can lie with a woman well that and i have no idea how to go about being the messiah josh said yeah and that i said you should ask hillel john said my father says hes the wisest of all of the priests im going to ask the holy of holies joshua said the holy of holies was the ark of the covenantthe box containing the tablets handed down from god to moses no one i knew had ever seen it as it was housed in the inner room at the temple but its forbidden only a priest may enter the chamber of the ark yes thats going to be a problem i said the city was like a huge cup that had been filled to its brim with pilgrims then spilled into a seething pool of humanity around it when we arrived men were already lined up as far as the damascus gate waiting with their lambs to get to the temple a greasy black smoke was on the wind coming from the temple where as many as ten thousand priests would be slaughtering the lambs and burning the blood and fatty parts on the altar cooking fires were burning all around the city as women prepared the lambs a haze hung in the air the steam and funk of a million people and as many animals stale breath and sweat and the smell of piss rose in the heat of the day mixing with the bleating of lambs the bellowing of camels the crying of children the ululations of women and the low buzz of too many voices until the air was thick with sounds and smells and god and history here abraham received the word of god that his people would be the chosen here were the hebrews delivered out of egypt here solomon built the first temple here walked the prophets and the kings of the hebrews and here resided the ark of the covenant jerusalem here did i the christ and john the baptist come to find out the will of god and if we were lucky spot some really delicious girls what you thought it was all religion and philosophy our families made camp outside the northern wall of the city below the battlements of antonia the fortress herod had built in tribute to his benefactor marc antony two cohorts of roman soldiers some twelve hundred strong watched the temple courtyard from the fortress walls the women fed and washed the children while joshua and i carried lambs with our fathers to the temple there was something unsettling about carrying an animal to its death it wasnt that i hadnt seen the sacrifices before nor even eaten the passover lamb but this was the first time id actually participated i could feel the animals breathing on my neck as i carried it slung over my shoulders and amid all the noise and the smells and the movement around the temple there was for a moment silence just the breath and heartbeat of the lamb i guess i fell behind the others because my father turned and said something to me but i couldnt hear the words we went through the gates and into the outer courtyard of the temple where merchants sold birds for the sacrifice and moneychangers traded shekels for a hundred different coins from around the world as we passed through the enormous courtyard where thousands of men stood with lambs on their shoulders waiting to get into the inner temple to the altar to the slaughter i could see no mans face i saw only the faces of the lambs some calm and oblivious others with their eyes rolled back bleating in terror still others seeming to be stunned i swung the lamb from my own shoulders and cradled it in my arms like a child as i backed out toward the gate i know my father and joseph must have come after me but i couldnt see their faces just emptiness where their eyes should have been just the eyes of the lambs they carried i couldnt breathe and i couldnt get out of the temple fast enough i didnt know where i was going but i wasnt going inside to the altar i turned to run but a hand caught my shirt and pulled me back i spun around and looked into joshuas eyes its gods will he said he laid his hands on my head and i was able to breathe again its all right biff gods will he smiled joshua had put the lamb hed been carrying on the ground but it didnt run away i suppose i should have known right then i didnt eat any of the lamb for that passover feast in fact ive never eaten lamb since that day chapter ive managed to sneak into the bathroom long enough to read a few chapters of this new testament that theyve added to the bible this matthew fellow who is obviously not the matthew that we knew seems to have left out quite a little bit like everything from the time joshua was born to the time he was thirty no wonder the angel brought me back to write this book this matthew fellow hasnt mentioned me yet but im still in the early chapters i have to ration myself to keep the angel from getting suspicious today he confronted me when i came out of the bathroom you are spending a lot of time in there you dont need to spend so much time in there i told you cleanliness is very important to my people you werent bathing i would have heard the water running i decided that i needed to go on the offensive if i was going to keep the angel from finding the bible i ran across the room leapt onto his bed and fastened my hands around his throatchoking him as i chanted i havent been laid in two thousand years i havent been laid in two thousand years i havent been laid in two thousand years it felt good there was a rhythm to it i sort of squoze his throat a bit with every syllable i paused for a moment in choking the heavenly host to backhand him across his alabaster cheek it was a mistake he caught my hand then grabbed me by the hair with his other hand and calmly climbed to his feet lifting me into the air by my hair ow ow ow ow ow i said so you have not been laid in two thousand years what does that mean ow ow ow ow i replied the angel set me on my feet but kept his grasp on my hair so it means that i havent had a woman in two millennia arent you picking up any of the vocabulary from the television he glanced at the tv which of course was on i dont have your gift of tongues what does that have to do with choking me i was choking you because you once again are as dense as dirt i havent had sex in two thousand years men have needs what the hell do you think im doing in the bathroom all of that time oh the angel said releasing my hair so you areyou have beenthere is a get me a woman and maybe i wont spend so much time in the bathroom if you get my meaning brilliant misdirection i thought a woman no i cannot do that not yet yet does that mean oh look the angel said turning from me as if i was no more than vapor general hospital is starting and with that my secret bible was safe what did he mean by yet at least this matthew mentions the magi one sentence but thats one more than ive gotten in his gospel so far our second day in jerusalem we went to see the great rabbi hillel rabbi means teacher in hebrewyou knew that right hillel looked to be a hundred years old his beard and hair were long and white and his eyes were clouded over his irises milk white his skin was leatherybrown from sitting in the sun and his nose was long and hooked giving him the aspect of a great blind eagle he held class all morning in the outer courtyard of the temple we sat quietly listening to him recite from the torah and interpret the verses taking questions and engaging in arguments with the pharisees who tried to infuse the law into every minute detail of life toward the end of hillels morning lectures jakan the camelsucking husbandtobe of my beloved maggie asked hillel if it would be a sin to eat an egg that had been laid on the sabbath what are you stupid the lord doesnt give a damn what a chicken does on the sabbath you nimrod its a chicken if a jew lays an egg on the sabbath thats probably a sin come see me then otherwise dont waste my friggin time with that nonsense now go away im hungry and i need a nap all of you scram joshua looked at me and grinned hes not what i expected he whispered knows a nimrod when he seesuhhears one though i said nimrod was an ancient king who died of suffocation after he wondered aloud in front of his guards what it would be like to have your own head stuck up your ass a boy younger than us helped the old man to his feet and began to lead him away toward the temple gate i ran up and took the priests other arm rabbi my friend has come from far away to talk to you can you help him the old man stopped where is your friend right here then why isnt he talking for himself where do you come from kid nazareth joshua said but i was born in bethlehem i am joshua bar joseph oh yeah ive talked to your mother you have sure almost every time she and your father come to jerusalem for a feast she tries to see me she thinks youre the messiah joshua swallowed hard am i hillel snorted do you want to be the messiah joshua looked at me as if i might have the answer i shrugged i dont know josh finally said i thought i was just supposed to do it do you think youre the messiah im not sure i should say thats smart hillel said you shouldnt say you can think youre the messiah all that you want just dont tell anyone but if i dont tell them they wont know exactly you can think youre a palm tree if you want just dont tell anyone you can think youre a flock of seagulls just dont tell anyone you get my meaning now i have to go eat im old and im hungry and i want to go eat now so just in case i die before supper i wont go hungry but he really is the messiah i said oh yeah hillel said grabbing my shoulder then feeling for my head so he could scream into my ear what do you know youre an ignorant kid how old are you twelve thirteen thirteen how could you at thirteen know anything im eightyfour and i dont know shit but youre wise i said im wise enough to know that i dont know shit now go away should i ask the holy of holies joshua said hillel swung at the air as if to slap joshua but missed by a foot its a box i saw it when i could still see and i can tell you that its a box and you know what else if there were tablets in it they arent there now so if you want to talk to a box and probably be executed for trying to get into the chamber where its kept you go right ahead the breath seemed to be knocked out of joshuas body and i thought he would faint on the spot how could the greatest teacher in all of israel speak of the ark of the covenant in such a way how could a man who obviously knew every word of the torah and all the teachings written since how could he claim not to know anything hillel seemed to sense joshuas distress look kid your mother says that some very wise men came to bethlehem to see you when you were born they obviously knew something that no one else knew why dont you go see them ask them about being the messiah so you arent going to tell him how to be the messiah i asked again hillel reached out for joshua but this time without any anger he found joshuas cheek and stroked it with his palsied hand i dont believe there will be a messiah and at this point im not sure it would make a difference to me our people have spent more time in slavery or under the heels of foreign kings than we have spent free so who is to say that it is gods will that we be free at all who is to say that god concerns himself with us in any way beyond allowing us to be i dont think that he does so know this little one whether you are the messiah or you become a rabbi or even if you are nothing more than a farmer here is the sum of all i can teach you and all that i know treat others as you would like to be treated can you remember that joshua nodded and the old man smiled go find your wise men joshua bar joseph what we did was stay in the temple while joshua grilled every priest guard even pharisee about the magi who had come to jerusalem thirteen years before evidently it wasnt as big an event for others as it was for joshs family because no one had any idea what he was talking about by the time hed been at it for a couple of hours he was literally screaming into the faces of a group of pharisees three of them magicians they came because they saw a star over bethlehem they were carrying gold frankincense and myrrh come on youre all old youre supposed to be wise think needless to say they werent pleased who is this boy who would question our knowledge he knows nothing of the torah and the prophets and yet berates us for not remembering three insignificant travelers it was the wrong thing to say to joshua no one had studied the torah harder no one knew scripture better ask me any question pharisee joshua said ask anything in retrospect after having grown up somewhat and having lived died and been resurrected from the dust i realize that there may be nothing more obnoxious than a teenager who knows everything certainly it is a symptom of the age that they think they know everything but now i have some sympathy for those poor men who challenged joshua that day at the temple of course at the time i shouted smite the sonsabitches josh he was there for days joshua wouldnt even leave to eat and i went out into the city to bring him back food first the pharisees but later even some of the priests came to quiz joshua to try to throw him some question about some obscure hebrew king or general they made him recite the lineages from all the books of the bible yet he did not waver myself i left him there to argue while i wandered through the holy city looking for maggie then when i couldnt find her for girls in general i slept at the camp of my parents assuming all the time that joshua was returning each night to his own family but i was wrong when the passover feast was over and we were packing up to leave mary joshuas mother came to me in a panic biff have you seen joshua the poor woman was distraught i wanted to comfort her so i held my arms out to give her a comforting embrace poor mary calm down joshua is fine come let me give you a comforting embrace biff i thought she might slap me hes at the temple jeez a guy tries to be compassionate and what does he get she had already taken off i caught up to her as she was dragging joshua out of the temple by the arm you worried us half to death you should have known you would find me in my fathers house joshua said dont you pull that my father stuff on me joshua bar joseph the commandment says honor thy father and thy mother im not feeling honored right now young man you could have sent a message you could have stopped by the camp joshua looked at me his eyes pleading for me to help him out i tried to comfort her josh but she wouldnt have it later i found the two of them on the road to nazareth and joshua motioned for me to walk with them mother thinks we may be able to find at least one of the magi and if we find that one he may know where the others are mary nodded the one named balthasar the black one he said he came from a village north of antioch he was the only one of the three that spoke any hebrew i didnt feel confident although id never seen a map north of antioch sounded like a large unspecific and scary place is there more yes the other two had come from the east by the silk road their names were melchior and gaspar so its off to antioch joshua said he seemed completely satisfied with the information his mother had given him as if all he needed were the three magis names and hed as much as found them i said youre going to go to antioch assuming that someone there will remember a man who may have lived north of there thirteen years ago a magician mary said a rich ethiopian magician how many can there be well there might not be any did you think of that he might have died he might have moved to another city in that case i will be in antioch joshua said from there i can travel the silk road until i find the other two i couldnt believe my ears youre not going alone of course but josh youre helpless out in the world you only know nazareth where people are stupid and poor no offense mary youll be likeuhlike a lamb among wolves you need me along to watch out for you and what do you know that i dont your latin is horrible your greek is barely passable and your hebrew is atrocious yeah if a stranger comes up to you on the road to antioch and asks you how much money you are carrying what do you tell him that will depend on how much i am carrying no it wont you havent enough for a crust of bread you are a poor beggar but thats not true exactly mary put her arm around her sons shoulders he has a point joshua joshua wrinkled his brow as if he had to think about it but i could tell that he was relieved that i wanted to go along when do you want to leave when did maggie say she was getting married in a month before then i dont want to be here when it happens me either joshua said and so we spent the next few weeks preparing for our journey my father thought i was crazy but my mother seemed happy to have the extra space in the house and pleased that the family wouldnt have to put up a bride price to marry me off right away so youll be gone how long mother asked i dont know its not a terribly long journey to antioch but i dont know how long well be there then well be traveling the silk road im guessing that thats a long journey ive never seen any silk growing around here well take a wool tunic in case it gets cold and that was all i heard from my mother not why are you going not who are you looking for just take a wool tunic jeez my father was more supportive i can give you a little money to travel with or we could buy you a donkey i think the money would be better a donkey couldnt carry both of us and who are these fellows youre looking for magicians i think and you want to talk to magicians because because josh wants to know how to be the messiah oh right and you believe that joshua is the messiah yes but more important than that hes my friend i cant let him go alone and what if hes not the messiah what if you find these magicians and they tell you that joshua is not what you think he is that hes just a normal boy well hell really need me to be there then wont he my father laughed yes i guess he will you come back levi and bring your friend the messiah with you now well have to set three empty places at the table on passover one for elijah one for my lost son and one for his pal the messiah well dont seat joshua next to elijah if those guys start talking religion well never have any peace it came down to only four days before maggies wedding before joshua and i accepted that one of us would have to tell her we were leaving after nearly a whole day of arguing it fell upon me to go to her i saw joshua face down fears in himself that would have broken other men but taking bad news to maggie was one he couldnt overcome i took the task on myself and tried to leave joshua with his dignity you wuss how can i tell her that its too painful to watch her marry that toad first youre insulting toads everywhere and second what makes you think its any easier for me youre tougher than i am oh dont try that you cant just roll over and expect me to not notice that im being manipulated shes going to cry i hate it when she cries i know josh said it hurts me too too much then he put his hand on my head and i suddenly felt better stronger dont try your son of god mumbo jumbo on me youre still a wuss if it be so so be it so it shall be written well it is now josh its written now its strange the word wuss is the same in my ancient aramaic tongue as it is in this language like the word waited for me these two thousand years so i could write it down here strange maggie was washing clothes in the square with a bunch of other women i caught her attention by jumping on the shoulders of my friend bartholomew who was gleefully exposing himself for the viewing pleasure of the nazarene wives with a subtle toss of my head i signaled to maggie to meet me behind a nearby stand of date palms behind those trees maggie shouted yeah i replied you bringing the idiot nope okay she said and she handed her washing to one of her younger sisters and scampered to the trees i was surprised to see her smiling so close to the time of her wedding she hugged me and i could feel the heat rise in my face either from shame or love like there was a difference well youre in a good mood i said why not im using them all up before the wedding speaking of which what are you two bringing me for a present it had better be good if its going to make up for who i have to marry she was joyful and there was music and laughter in her voice pure maggie but i had to turn away hey i was only joking she said you guys dont need to bring me anything were leaving maggie we wont be there she grabbed my shoulder and forced me to face her youre leaving you and joshua youre going away yes before your wedding were going to antioch and from there far into the east along the silk road she said nothing tears welled up in her eyes and i could feel them rising in mine as well this time she turned away we should have told you before i know but really we only decided at passover joshua is going to find the magi who came to his birth and im going with him because i have to she wheeled on me you have to you have to you dont have to you can stay and be my friend and come to my wedding and sneak down to talk to me here or in the vineyard and we can laugh and tease and no matter how horrible it is being married to jakan ill have that ill at least have that i felt as if id be sick to my stomach any second i wanted to tell her that id stay that id wait that if there was the slightest chance that her life wasnt going to be a desert in the arms of her creep husband that i could hold hope i wanted to do whatever i could to take away even a little bit of her pain even up to letting joshua go by himself but in thinking that i realized that joshua must have been feeling the same thing so all i said was im sorry and what about joshua wasnt he even going to say goodbye he wanted to but he couldnt neither of us can i mean we didnt want to have to watch you marry jakan cowards you two deserve each other you can hide behind each other like greek boys just go get away from me i tried to think of something to say but my mind was a soup of confusion so i hung my head and walked away i was almost out of the square when maggie caught up to me i heard her footsteps and turned tell him to meet me behind the synagogue biff the night before my wedding an hour after sunset im not sure maggie he tell him she said she ran back to the well without looking back so i told joshua and on the night before maggies wedding the night before we were to leave on our journey joshua packed some bread and cheese and a skin of wine and told me to meet him by the date palms in the square where we would share supper together you have to go joshua said im going in the morning when you do what you think id back out now no tonight you have to go to maggie i cant go what i mean why sure id been heartbroken when maggie had asked to see joshua and not me but id come to terms with it well as well as one ever comes to terms with an ongoing heartbreak you have to take my place biff theres almost no moon tonight and we are about the same size just dont say much and shell think its me maybe not as smart as normal but she can put that down to worry over the upcoming journey id love to see maggie but she wants to see you why cant you go you really dont know not really then just take my word for it youll see will you do this for me biff will you take my place pretend to be me that would be lying you never lie now youre getting righteous on me i wont be lying you will be oh in that case ill go but there wasnt even time to deceive it was so dark that night that i had to make my way slowly through the village by starlight alone and as i rounded the corner to the back of our small synagogue i was hit with a wave of sandalwood and lemon and girl sweat of warm skin a wet mouth over mine arms around my back and legs around my waist i fell backward on the ground and there was in my head a bright light and the rest of the world existed in the senses of touch and smell and god there on the ground behind the synagogue maggie and i indulged desires we had carried for years mine for her and hers for joshua that neither of us knew what we were doing made no difference it was pure and it happened and it was marvelous and when we finished we lay there holding each other half dressed breathless and sweating and maggie said i love you joshua i love you maggie i said and ever so slightly she loosened her embrace i couldnt marry jakan withouti couldnt let you go withoutwithout letting you know he knows maggie then she really pulled away biff uhoh i thought she might scream that she might leap up and run away that she might do any one of a hundred things to take me from heaven to hell but after only a second she nuzzled close to me again thank you for being here she said we left at dawn and our fathers walked with us as far as the gates of sepphoris when we parted at the gates my father gave me a hammer and chisel to carry with me in my satchel with that you can make enough for a meal anywhere you go my father said joseph gave joshua a wooden bowl out of that you can eat the meal that biff earns he grinned at me by the gates of sepphoris i kissed my father for the last time by the gates of sepphoris we left our fathers behind and went out into the world to find three wise men come back joshua and make us free joseph shouted to our backs go with god my own father said i am i am i shouted hes right here joshua said nothing until the sun was high in the sky and we stopped to share a drink of water well joshua said did she know it was you yes not at first but before we parted she knew was she angry at me no was she angry at you i smiled no you dog he said you really should ask that angel what he meant about you not knowing a woman joshua its really important you know now why i couldnt go yes thanks ill miss her joshua said you have no idea i said every detail i want to know every detail but you arent supposed to know thats not what the angel meant tell me not now not while i can still smell her on my arms joshua kicked at the dirt am i angry with you or happy for you or jealous of you i dont know tell me josh right now for the first time i can remember im happier being your friend than i would be being you can i have that now thinking about that night with maggie behind the synagogue where we stayed together until it was nearly dawn where we made love again and again and fell asleep naked on top of our clothesnow when i think of that i want to run away from here this room this angel and his task find a lake dive down and hide from the eye of god in the dark muck on the bottom strange part ii change jesus was a good guy he didnt need this shit john prine chapter i should have had a plan before i tried to escape from the hotel room i see that now at the time dashing out the door and into the arms of sweet freedom seemed like plan enough i got as far as the lobby it is a fine lobby as grand as any palace but in the way of freedom i need more i noticed before raziel dragged me back into the elevator nearly dislocating my shoulder in the process that there were an inordinate number of old people in the lobby in fact compared to my time there are inordinate numbers of old people everywherewell not on tv but everywhere else have you people forgotten how to die or have you used up all of the young people on television so theres nothing left but gray hair and wrinkled flesh in my time if you had seen forty summers it was time to start thinking about moving on making room for the youngsters if you lasted to fifty the mourners would give you dirty looks when they passed as if you were purposely trying to put them out of business the torah says that moses lived to be years old im guessing that the children of israel were following him just to see when he would drop there was probably betting if i do manage to escape the angel im not going to be able to make my living as a professional mourner not if you people dont have the courtesy to die just as well i suppose id have to learn all new dirges ive tried to get the angel to watch mtv so i can learn the vocabulary of your music but even with the gift of tongues im having trouble learning to speak hiphop why is it that one can busta rhyme or busta move anywhere but you must busta cap in someones ass is ho always feminine and muthafucka always masculine while bitch can be either how many peeps in a posse how much booty before baby got back do you have to be all that to get all up in that and do i need to be dope and phat to be da bomb or can i just be stupid ill not be singing over any dead mothers until i understand the journey the quest the search for the magi we traveled first to the coast neither joshua nor i had ever seen the sea before so as we topped a hill near the city of ptolomais and the endless aquamarine of the mediterranean stretched before us joshua fell to his knees and gave thanks to his father you can almost see the edge of the world joshua said i squinted into the dazzling sun really looking for the edge of the world it looks sort of curved i said what joshua scanned the horizon but evidently he didnt see the curve the edge of the world looks curved i think its round whats round the world i think its round of course its round like a plate if you go to the edge you fall off every sailor knows that joshua said with great authority not round like a plate round like a ball dont be silly joshua said if the world was round like a ball then we would slide off of it not if its sticky i said joshua lifted his foot and looked at the bottom of his sandal then at me then at the ground sticky i looked at the bottom of my own shoe hoping to perhaps see strands of stickiness there like melted cheese tethering me to the ground when your best friend is the son of god you get tired of losing every argument just because you cant see it doesnt mean the world is not sticky joshua rolled his eyes lets go swimming he took off down the hill what about the god i asked you cant see him joshua stopped halfway down the hill and held his arms out to the shining aquamarine sea you cant thats a crappy argument josh i followed him down the hill shouting as i went if youre not going to try im not going to argue with you anymore so what if stickiness is like god you know how he abandons our people and leads them into slavery whenever we stop believing in him stickiness could be like that you could float off into the sky any time now because you dont believe in stickiness its good that you have something to believe in biff im going in the water he ran down the beach shedding his clothes as he went then dove into the surf naked later after wed both swallowed enough salt water to make us sick we headed up the coast to the city of ptolemais i didnt think it would be so salty joshua said yeah i said youd never know it by looking at it are you still angry about your roundearthstickiness theory i dont expect you to understand i said sounding very mature i thought you being a virgin and all joshua stopped and grabbed my shoulder forcing me to wheel around and face him the night you spent with maggie i spent praying to my father to take away the thoughts of you two he didnt answer me it was like trying to sleep on a bed of thorns since we left i was beginning to forget or at least leave it behind but you keep throwing it in my face youre right i said i forgot how sensitive you virgins can be then once again and not for the last time the prince of peace coldcocked me a bony stonecutters fist just over my right eye he hit harder than i remembered i remember white seabirds in the sky above me and just a wisp of clouds across the sky i remember the frothy surf sloshing over my face leaving sand in my ears i remember thinking that i should get up and smite josh upside the head i remember thinking then that if i got up josh might hit me again so i lay there for a moment just thinking so what do you want i said finally from my wet and sandy supinity he stood over me with his fists balled if youre going to keep bringing it up you have to tell me the details i can do that and dont leave anything out nothing ive got to know if im going to understand sin okay can i get up my ears are filling with sand he helped me to my feet and as we entered the seaside city of ptolomais i taught josh about sex down narrow stone streets between high stone walls well most of what we learned from the rabbis was not exactly accurate past men sitting outside their houses mending their nets children selling cups of pomegranate juice women hanging strings of fish from window to window to dry for instance you know that part right after lots wife gets turned to stone and then his daughters get drunk and fornicate with him right after sodom and gomorrah are destroyed well thats not as bad as it sounds i said we passed phoenician women who sang as they pounded dried fish into meal we passed evaporation pools where children scraped the encrusted salt from the rocks and put it into bags but fornication is a sin and fornication with your daughters well thats a i dont know thats a doubledog sin yeah but if you put that aside for a second and you just focus on the two young girls aspect of it its not nearly as bad as it sounds initially oh we passed merchants selling fruit and bread and oil spices and incense calling out claims of quality and magic in their wares there was a lot of magic for sale in those days and the song of solomon thats a lot closer and you can sort of understand solomon having a thousand wives in fact with you being the son of god and all i dont think youd have any problem getting that many girls i mean after you figure out what youre doing and a lot of girls is a good thing youre a ninny arent you i thought youd be more specific what does maggie have to do with lot and solomon i cant tell you about me and maggie josh i just cant we were passing a lick of prostitutes gathered outside the door of an inn their faces were painted their skirts slit up the side to show their legs glistening with oil and they called to us in foreign languages and made tiny dances with their hands as we passed what the hell are they saying i asked joshua he was better with languages i think they were speaking greek they said something about how they like hebrew boys because we can feel a womans tongue better without our foreskins he looked at me as if i might confirm or deny this how much money do we have i asked the inn rented rooms stalls and space under the eave to sleep we rented two adjacent stalls which was a bit of a luxury for us but an important one for joshuas education after all werent we on this journey so he could learn to take his rightful place as the messiah im not sure if i should watch joshua said remember david was running over the roofs and happened onto bathsheba in her bath that set a whole chain of sin in motion but listening wont be a problem i dont think its the same thing are you sure that you dont want to try this yourself josh i mean the angel was never clear about your being with a woman to be honest i was a little frightened myself my experience with maggie hardly qualified me to be with a harlot no you go ahead just describe whats happening and what youre feeling i have to understand sin okay if you insist thank you for doing this for me biff not just for you josh for our people so thats how we ended up with the two stalls josh would be in one while i along with the harlot of my choice instructed him from the other in the fine art of fornication back out at the front of the inn i shopped for my teaching assistant it was an eightharlot inn if thats how you measure an inn i understand that now they measure inns in stars we are in a fourstar inn right now i dont know what the conversion from harlots to stars is anyway there were eight harlots outside the inn that day they ranged in age from only a few years older than us to older than our mothers and they ran the gamut of shapes and sizes having in common only that they were all highly painted and well oiled theyre all soso nastylooking theyre harlots biff theyre supposed to be nastylooking pick one lets go look at some different harlots we had been standing a few doors down from the harlots but they knew we were watching i walked over and stopped close to a particularly tall harlot and said excuse me do you know where we might find a different selection of harlots no offense its just that my friend and i and she pulled open her blouse exposing full breasts that were glistening with oil and flecks of mica and she threw her skirt aside and stepped up so a long leg slid behind me and i could feel the rough hair between her legs grinding against my hip and her rouged nipples brushed my cheek and in that instant profound wood did from my person protrude this one will be fine josh the other harlots let loose with an exaltation of ululation as we led my harlot away you know ululation as the sound an ambulance makes that i get an erection every time one passes the hotel would seem morbid if you didnt know this story of how biff hires a harlot the harlots name was set she was a head and a half taller than me with skin the color of a ripe date wide brown eyes flecked with gold and hair so black that it reflected blue in the dim light of the stable she was the perfect harlot design wide where a harlot should be wide narrow where a harlot should be narrow delicate of ankle and neck sturdy of conscience intrepid and singleminded of goal once she was paid she was an egyptian but she had learned greek and a little latin to help lubricate the discourse of her trade our situation required more creativity than she seemed accustomed to but after a heavy sigh she mumbled something about if you fuck a hebrew make room in the bed for his guilt then pulled me into my stall and closed the gate yes the stalls were used for animals there was a donkey in the stall opposite joshs so whats she doing josh asked shes taking off my clothes what now shes taking off her clothes oh jeez ouch what are you fornicating no shes rubbing her whole body over mine sort of lightly when i try to move she smacks me in the face how does it feel how do you think it feels like someone smacking you you twit i mean how does her body feel do you feel sinful is it like satan rubbing against you does it burn like fire yeah you got it that pretty much has it youre lying oh wow then josh said something in greek that i didnt catch all of and the harlot answered sort of what did she say josh asked i dont know you know my greek is bad mine isnt i couldnt understand what she said her mouth is full set raised up not full she said in greek hey i understood that she has you in her mouth yeah thats heinous it doesnt feel heinous it doesnt no josh i gotta tell you this really isoh my god what whats happening shes getting dressed are you done sinning thats it the harlot said something in greek that i didnt understand what did she say i asked she said that for the amount of money we gave her youre finished do you think you understand fornication now not really well then give her some more money joshua were going to stay here until you learn what you need to know youre a good friend to suffer this for me dont mention it no really joshua said greater love hath no man than he lay down for his friend thats a good one josh you should remember that one for later the harlot then spoke at length you want to know what this is like for me kid this is like a job which means that if you want it done you need to pay for it thats what its like joshua would translate for me later whatd she say i asked she wants the wages of sin which are in this case three shekels thats a bargain pay her much as i triedand i did tryi didnt seem able to convey to joshua what it was he wanted to know i went through a halfdozen more harlots and a large portion of our traveling money over the next week but he still didnt understand i suggested that perhaps this was one of the things that the magician balthasar was supposed to teach joshua truth be told id developed a burning sensation when i peed and i was ready for a break from tutoring my friend in the fine art of sinning its a week or less by sea if we go to selucia then its less than a days walk inland to antioch joshua said after he had been talking to some sailors who were drinking at the inn overland its two to three weeks by sea then i said pretty brave i thought considering id never set foot in a boat in my life we found a widebeamed raisedstern roman cargo ship bound for tarsus that would stop at all the ports along the way including selucia the ships master was a wiry hatchetfaced phoenician named titus inventius who claimed to have gone to sea when he was four and sailed to the edge of the world twice before his balls dropped although what one had to do with the other i never figured out what can you do whats your trade titus asked from under a great straw hat he wore while watching the slaves load jars of wine and oil onto the ship his eyes were black beads set back in caves of wrinkles formed by a lifetime of squinting into the sun well im a stonemason and hes the son of god i grinned i thought that would give us more diversity than just saying we were two stonemasons titus pushed the straw hat back on his head and looked joshua up and down son of god huh hows that pay joshua scowled at me i know stone work and carpentry and we both have strong backs theres not a lot of call for stone work aboard a ship have you been to sea before yes i said no joshua said he was sick that day i said ive been to sea titus laughed fine you go help get those jars on board im taking a load of pigs as far as sidon you two keep them calm and keep them alive in the heat and by that time maybe youll be something of use to me but it costs you as well how much joshua asked how much do you have five shekels i said twenty shekels joshua said i elbowed the messiah in the ribs hard enough to bend him over ten shekels i said five each i meant before when i said five i felt as if i was negotiating with myself and not doing that well then ten shekels plus any work i can find for you but if you puke on my ship youre over the side you hear me ten shekels or not absolutely i said pulling joshua down the dock to where the slaves were loading jars when we were out of earshot of captain titus joshua said you have to tell him that were jews we cant tend pigs i grabbed one of the huge wine jars by the ears and started to drag it toward the ship its okay theyre roman pigs they dont care oh all right joshua said latching onto a jar of his own and hoisting it onto his back then it hit him and he set the jar down again hey wait thats not right the next morning we sailed with the tide joshua me a crew of thirty titus and fifty allegedly roman pigs until we cast off from the dockjosh and i manning one of the long oarsand we were well out of the harbor until we had shipped the oars and the great square sail was ballooned over the deck like the belly of a gluttonous genie until joshua and i climbed to the rear of the ship where titus stood on the raised deck manning one of the two long steering oars and i looked back toward land and could see not a city but a speck on the horizon until then i had no idea that i had a deepseated fear of sailing we are way too far away from land i said way too far you really need to steer closer to the land titus i pointed to land in case titus was unsure as to which way he should go it makes sense dont you think i mean i grew up in an arid country inland where even the rivers are little more than damp ditches my people come from the desert the one time we actually had to cross a sea we walked sailing seemed well unnatural if the lord had meant us to sail we would have been born with uh masts i said thats the dumbest thing youve ever said said joshua can you swim asked titus no i said yes he can joshua said titus grabbed me by the back of the neck and threw me over the stern of the ship chapter the angel and i had been watching a movie about moses raziel was angry because there were no angels in it no one in the movie looked like any egyptian i ever met did moses look like that i asked raziel who was worrying the crust off of a goat cheese pizza in between spitting vitriol at the screen no said raziel but that other fellow looks like pharaoh really yep said raziel he slurped the last of a coke through a straw making a rude noise then tossed the paper cup across the room into the wastebasket so you were there during the exodus right before i was in charge of locusts how was that didnt care for it i wanted the plague of frogs i like frogs i like frogs too you wouldnt have liked the plague of frogs stephan was in charge a seraphim he shook his head as if i should know some sad inside fact about seraphim we lost a lot of frogs i suppose its for the best though raziel said with a sigh you cant have a someone who likes frogs bring a plague of frogs if id done it it would have been more of a friendly gathering of frogs that wouldnt have worked i said well it didnt work anyway did it i mean moses a jew thought it up frogs were unclean to the jews to the jews it was a plague to the egyptians it was like having a big feast of frog legs drop from the sky moses missed it on that one im just glad we didnt listen to him on the plague of pork really he wanted to bring down a plague of pork pigs falling from the sky pig pieces ribs hams feet he wanted everything bloody you know unclean pork and unclean blood the egyptians would have eaten the pork we talked him into just the blood are you saying that moses was a dimwit i wasnt being ironic when i asked this i was aware that i was asking the eternal dimwit of them all still no he just wasnt concerned with results said the angel the lord had hardened pharaohs heart against letting the jews go we could have dropped oxen from the sky and he wouldnt have changed his mind that would have been something to see i said i suggested that it rain fire the angel said howd that go it was pretty we only had it rain on the stone palaces and monuments burning up all of the jews would sort of defeated the purpose good thinking i said well im good with weather said the angel yeah i know i said then i thought about it a second about how raziel nearly wore out our poor room service waiter jesus delivering orders of ribs the day they were the special you didnt suggest fire initially did you you just suggested that it rain barbecued pork didnt you that guy doesnt look anything like moses the angel said that day thrashing in the sea trying to swim to catch the merchant ship that plowed through the water under full sail i first saw that raziel was as he claimed good with weather joshua was leaning over the aftrail of the ship shouting alternately to me then to titus it was pretty obvious that even under the light wind that day i would never catch the ship and when i looked in the direction of shore i could see nothing but water strange the things you think of at times like that what i thought first was what an incredibly stupid way to die next i thought joshua will never make it without me and with that i began to pray not for my own salvation but for joshua i prayed for the lord to keep him safe then i prayed for maggies safety and happiness then as i shrugged off my shirt and fell into a slow crawl in the direction of the shoreline which i knew i would never see the wind stopped just stopped the sea flattened and the only sound i could hear was the frightened cries of the crew of tituss ship which had stopped in the water as if it had dropped anchor biff this way joshua called i turned in the water to see my friend waving to me from the stern of the becalmed ship beside him titus cowered like a frightened child on the mast above them sat a winged figure who after i swam to the ship and was hoisted out by a very frightened bunch of sailors i recognized as the angel raziel unlike the times when we had seen him before he wore robes as black as pitch and the feathers in his wings shone the blueblack of the sea under moonlight as i joined joshua on the raised poop deck at the stern of the ship the angel took wing and gently landed on the deck beside us titus was shielding his head with his arms as if to ward off an attacker and he looked as if he were trying to dissolve between the deck boards you raziel said to the phoenician and titus looked up between his arms no harm is to come to these two titus nodded tried to say something then gave up when his voice broke under the weight of his fear i was a little frightened myself decked out in black the angel was a fearsome sight even if he was on our side joshua on the other hand seemed completely at ease thank you josh said to the angel hes a cur but hes my best friend im good with weather the angel said and as if that explained everything he flapped his massive black wings and lifted off the deck the sea was dead calm until the angel was out of sight over the horizon then the breeze picked up the sails filled and waves began to lap at the bow titus ventured a peek from his cowed position then stood up slowly and took one of the steering oars under his arm im going to need a new shirt i said you can have mine titus said we should sail closer along the coast dont you think i said on the way good master titus said on the way your mother eats the fungus from the feet of lepers i said ive been meaning to speak to her about that titus said so we understand each other i said absolutely titus said crap joshua said i forgot to ask the angel about knowing women again for the rest of the journey titus was much more agreeable and strangely enough we didnt have to man any of the huge oars when we pulled into port nor did we have to help unload or load any cargo the crew avoided us altogether and tended the pigs for us without our even asking my fear of sailing subsided after a day and as the steady breeze carried us north joshua and i would watch the dolphins that came to ride the ships bow wave or lie on the deck at night breathing in the smell of cedar coming off the ships timbers listening to the creaking of rope and rigging and trying to imagine aloud what it would be like when we found balthasar if it hadnt been for joshuas constant badgering about what sex was like it would have been a pleasant journey indeed fornication isnt the only sin josh i tried to explain im happy to help out but are you going to have me steal so i can explain it to you will you have me kill someone next so you can understand it no the difference is that i dont want to kill anyone okay ill tell you again you got your loins and shes got her loins and even though you call them both loins theyre different i understand the mechanics of it what i dont understand is the feeling of it well it feels good i told you that but that doesnt seem right why would the lord make sin feel good then condemn man for it look why dont you try it i said it would be cheaper that way or better yet get married then it wouldnt even be sin then it wouldnt be the same would it josh asked how would i know ive never been married is it always the same for you well in some ways yes in what ways well so far it seems to be moist moist yeah but i cant say its always that way just in my experience maybe we should ask a harlot better yet joshua said looking around ill ask titus hes older and he looks as if hes sinned a lot yeah well if you count throwing jews in the sea id say hes an expert but that doesnt mean joshua had run to the stern of the ship up a ladder to the raised poop deck and to a small opensided tent that acted as the captains quarters under the tent titus reclined on a pile of rugs drinking from a wineskin which i saw him hand to joshua by the time i caught up with him titus was saying so you want to know about fucking well son you have come to the right place ive fucked a thousand women half again as many boys some sheep pigs a few chickens and the odd turtle what is it you want to know stand away from him josh i said taking the wineskin and handing it back to titus as i pushed joshua back the wrath of god could hit him at any moment jeez a turtle thats got to be an abomination titus flinched when i mentioned the wrath of god as if the angel might return to perch on his mast any second joshua stood his ground right now lets just stick with the women part of it if thats all right joshua patted tituss arm to reassure him i knew how that touch felt titus would feel the fear run out of him like water ive fucked every kind of woman there is ive fucked egyptians greeks romans jews ethiopians and women from places that havent even been named yet ive fucked fat ones skinny ones women with no legs women with are you married joshua interrupted before the sailor started into how he had fucked them in a box with a fox in a house with a mouse i have a wife in rome is it the same with your wife and say a harlot what fucking no its not the same at all its moist i said right well yes its moist but thats not i grabbed joshuas tunic and started to drag him away there you have it lets go josh now you know sin is moist make a mental note lets get some supper titus was laughing you jews and your sin you know if you had more gods you wouldnt have to be so worried about making one angry right i said im going to take spiritual advice from a guy who fucks turtles you shouldnt be so judgmental biff joshua said youre not without sin yourself oh you and your holierthanthou attitude you can just do your own sinning from now on if thats how you feel you think i enjoy bedding harlots night after night describing the whole process to you over and over well yeah joshua said thats not the point the point is wellthe point iswell guilt i meanturtles i mean so i was flustered sue me id never look at a turtle again without imagining it being molested by a scruffy phoenician sailor thats not disturbing to you imagine it right now ill wait see hes gone mad titus said you shut up you scurvy viper joshua said what about not being judgmental titus said thats him josh said its different for me and suddenly having said that joshua looked as sad as i had ever seen him he slouched away toward the pigpen where he sat down and cradled his head in his hands as if hed just been crowned with the weight of all the worries of mankind he kept to himself until we left the ship the silk road the main vein of trade and custom and culture from the roman world to the far east terminated where it met the sea at the port city of selucia pieria the harbor city and naval stronghold that had fed and guarded antioch since the time of alexander as we left the ship with the rest of the crew captain titus stopped us at the gangplank he held his hands palm down joshua and i reached out and titus dropped the coins wed paid for passage into our palms i might have been holding a brace of scorpions but you two reached out without a thought it was a fair price to pay joshua said you dont have to return our money i almost drowned your friend im sorry you asked if he could swim before you threw him in he had a chance i looked at joshuas eyes to see if he was joking but it was obvious he wasnt still titus said so perhaps you will be given a chance someday as well joshua said a slim fucking chance i added titus grinned at me follow the shore of the harbor until it becomes a river thats the onrontes follow its left bank and youll be in antioch by nightfall in the market there will be an old woman who sells herbs and charms i dont remember her name but she has only one eye and she wears a tunic of tyran purple if there is a magician in antioch she will know where to find him how do you know this old woman i asked i buy my tiger penis powder from her joshua looked at me for explanation what i said ive had a couple of harlots i didnt exchange recipes then i looked to titus should i have its for my knees the sailor said they hurt when it rains joshua took my shoulder and started to lead me away go with god titus he said put in a good word with the blackwinged one for me titus said once we were into the wash of merchants and sailors around the harbor i said he gave us the money back because the angel scared him you know that so his kindness allayed his fear as well as benefiting us joshua said all the better do you think the priests sacrifice the lambs at passover for better reasons oh right i said having no idea what one had to do with the other wondering still if tigers didnt object to having their penises powdered keeps them from chafing i guess but thats got to be a dangerous job lets go find this old crone i said the shore of the onrontes was a stream of life and color textures and smells from the harbor all the way into the marketplace at antioch there were people of every size and color that i had ever imagined some shoeless and dressed in rags others wearing expensive silks and the purple linen from tyre said to be dyed with the blood of a poisonous snail there were ox carts litters and sedan chairs carried by as many as eight slaves roman soldiers on horseback and on foot policed the crowd while sailors from a dozen nations reveled in drink and noise and the feel of land beneath their feet merchants and beggars and traders and whores scurried for the turn of a coin while selfappointed prophets spouted dogma from atop the mooring posts where ships tied off along the riverholy men lined up and preaching like a line of noisy greek columns smoke rose fragrant and blue over the streaming crowd carrying the smell of spice and grease from braziers in the food booths where men and women hawked their fare in rhythmic haunting songs that all ran together as you walked alongas if one passed his song to the next so you might never experience a second of silence the only thing i had ever seen that approached this was the line of pilgrims leading into jerusalem on the feast days but there we never saw so much color heard so much noise felt so much excitement we stopped at a stand and bought a hot black drink from a wrinkled old man wearing a tanned bird carcass as a hat he showed us how he made the drink from the seeds of berries that were first roasted then ground into powder then mixed with boiling water we got this whole story by way of pantomime as the man spoke none of the languages we were familiar with he mixed the drink with honey and gave it to us but when i tasted it it still didnt seem to taste right it seemed i dont know too dark i saw a woman leading a nanny goat nearby and i took joshuas cup from him and ran after the woman with the womans permission i squirted a bit of milk from the nanny goats udder onto the top of each of our cups the old man protested making it seem as if wed committed some sort of sacrilege but the milk had come out warm and frothy and it served to take away the bitterness of the black drink joshua downed his then asked the old man for two more as well as handing the woman with the goat a small brass coin for her trouble josh gave the second drink back to the old man to taste and after much grimacing he took a sip a smile crossed his toothless mouth and before we left he seemed to be striking some sort of deal with the woman with the goat i watched the old man grind beans in a copper cylinder while the woman milked her goat into a deep clay bowl there was a spice vendor next door and i could smell the cinnamon cloves and allspice that lay loose in baskets on the ground you know i said to the woman in latin when you two get this all figured out try sprinkling a little ground cinnamon on it it just might make it perfect youre losing your friend she said i turned and looked around catching the top of joshuas head just as he turned a corner into the antioch market and a new push of people i ran to catch up to him joshua was bumping people in the crowd as he passed seemingly on purpose and murmuring just loud enough so i could hear him each time he hit someone with a shoulder or an elbow healed that guy healed her stopped her suffering healed him comforted him ooo that guy was just stinky healed her whoops missed healed healed comforted calmed people were turning to look back at josh the way one will when a stranger steps on ones foot except these people all seemed to be either smiling or baffled not annoyed as i expected what are you doing i asked practicing joshua said whoa bad toejam he spun on his heel nearly turning his foot out of his sandal and smacked a short bald man on the back of the head all better now the bald guy turned and looked back to see who had hit him josh was backing down the street hows your toe joshua asked in latin good the bald guy said and he smiled sorta goofy and dreamy like his toe had just sent him a message that all was right with the world go with god and josh spun jumped came down with each hand on a strangers shoulder and shouted yes double healing go with god friends two times i was getting sort of uncomfortable people had started to follow us through the crowd not a lot of people but a few maybe five or six each of them with that dreamy smile on his face joshua maybe you should uh calm down a little can you believe all of these people need healing healed him josh leaned back and whispered in my ear that guy had the pox hell pee without pain for the first time in years scuse me he turned back into the crowd healed healed calmed comforted were strangers here josh youre attracting attention to us this might not be safe its not like theyre blind or missing limbs well have to stop if we run into something serious healed god bless you oh you no speak latin uhgreek hebrew no hell figure it out josh i said we should look for the old woman oh right healed josh slapped the pretty woman very hard in the face her husband a large man in a leather tunic didnt look pleased he pulled a dagger from his belt and started to advance on joshua sorry sir joshua said not backing up couldnt be helped small demon had to be banished from her sent it into that dog over there go with god thank you thank you very much the woman grabbed her husband by the arm and swung him around she still had joshuas handprint on her face but she was smiling im back she said to her husband im back she shook him and the anger seemed to drain out of him he looked back at joshua with an expression of such dismay that i thought he might faint he dropped his knife and threw his arms around his wife joshua ran forward and threw his arms around them both would you stop it please i pleaded but i love these people josh said you do dont you yeah he was going to kill you it happens he just didnt understand he does now glad he caught on lets find the old lady yes then lets go back and get another one of those hot drinks joshua said we found the hag selling a bouquet of monkey feet to a fat trader dressed in striped silks and a wide conical hat woven from some sort of tough grass but these are all back feet the trader protested same magic better price said the hag pulling back a shawl she wore over one side of her face to reveal a milky white eye this was obviously her intimidation move the trader wasnt having it it is a wellknown fact that the front paw of a monkey is the best talisman for telling the future but the back youd think the monkey would see something coming i said and they both looked at me as if id just sneezed on their falafel the old woman drew back as if to cast a spell or maybe a rock at me if that were true i continued i meanabout telling the future with a monkey pawi meanbecause he would have four of thempaws that isand uhnever mind how much are these said joshua holding up a handful of dried newts from the hags baskets the old woman turned to josh you cant use that many the hag said i cant asked joshua these are useless said the merchant waving the hind legs and feet of two and a half former monkeys which looked like tiny people feet except that they were furry and the toes were longer if youre a monkey ill bet they come in handy to keep your butt from dragging on the ground i said ever the peacemaker well how many do i need joshua asked wondering how his diversion to save me had turned into a negotiation for newt crispies how many of your camels are constipated asked the crone joshua dropped the dried newts back into their basket well uh do those work asked the merchant for pluggedup camels i mean never fails the merchant scratched his pointed beard with a monkey foot ill meet your price on these worthless monkey feet if you throw in a handful of newts deal said the crone the merchant opened a satchel he had slung around his shoulder and dropped in his monkey feet then followed them with a handful of newts so how do these work make them into tea and have the camel drink it other end said the crone they go in whole count to one hundred and step back the merchants eyes went wide then narrowed into a squint and he turned to me kid he said if you can count to a hundred ive got a job for you hed love to work for you sir joshua said but we have to find balthasar the magus the crone hissed and backed to the corner of her booth covering all of her face but her milky eye how do you know of balthasar she held her hands in front of her like claws and i could see her trembling balthasar i shouted at her and the old woman nearly jumped through the wall behind her i snickered and was ready to balthasar her again when josh interrupted balthasar came from here to bethlehem to witness my birth said joshua im seeking his counsel his wisdom you would hail the darkness you would consort with demons and fly with the evil djinn like balthasar i wont have you near my booth be gone from here she made the sign of the evil eye which in her case was redundant no no no i said none of that the magus left some uh frankincense at joshuas house we need to return it to him the old woman regarded me with her good eye youre lying yes he is said josh balthasar i screamed in her face it didnt have the same effect as the first time around and i was a little disappointed stop that she said joshua reached out to take her craggy hand grandmother he said our ships captain titus inventius said you would know where to find balthasar please help us the old woman seemed to relax and just when i thought she was going to smile she raked her nails across joshuas hand and leapt back titus inventius is a scalawag she shouted joshua stared at the blood welling up in the scratches on the back of his hand and i thought for a second that he might faint he never understood it when someone was violent or unkind id probably be half a day explaining to him why the old woman scratched him but right then i was furious you know what you know what you know what i was waving my finger under her nose you scratched the son of god thats your ass thats what the magus is gone from antioch and good riddance to him screeched the crone the fat trader had been watching this the whole time without saying a word but now he began laughing so hard that i could barely hear the old woman wheezing out curses so you want to find balthasar do you gods son joshua came out of the stunned contemplation of his wounds and looked at the trader yes sir do you know him who do you think the monkeys feet are for follow me he whirled on his heel and sauntered away without another word as we followed the trader into an alley so narrow that his shoulders nearly touched the sides i turned back to the old crone and shouted your ass hag mark my words she hissed and made the sign of the evil eye again she was a little creepy joshua said looking at the scratches on his hand again dont be judgmental josh youre not without creepiness yourself where do you think this guy is leading us probably somewhere where he can murder and kill us yeah at least one of those chapter since my escape attempt i cant get the angel to leave the room at all not even for his beloved soap opera digest and yes when he left to obtain the first one it would have been a good time to make my escape but i wasnt thinking that way then so back off today i tried to get him to bring me a map because no one is going to know the places im writing about thats why i told him you want me to write in this idiom so people will understand what im saying then why use the names of places that have been gone for thousands of years i need a map no said the angel when i say the journey was two months by camel what will that mean to these people who can cross an ocean in hours i need to know modern distances no said the angel did you know that in a hotel they bolt the bedside lamp to the table thereby making it an ineffective instrument of persuasion when trying to bring an obdurate angel around to your way of thinking thought you should know that pity too its such a substantial lamp but how will i recount the heroic acts of the archangel raziel if i cant tell the locations of his deeds what you want me to write oh then somewhere generally to the left of the great wall that ratbastard raziel showed up looking like hell considering he may have traveled a long distance or not is that what you want or should it read then only a mile out of the port of ptolemais we were once again graced with the shining magnificence of the archangel raziel huh which way do you want it i know what youre thinking that the angel saved my life when titus threw me off the ship and that i should be more forgiving toward him right that i shouldnt try to manipulate a poor creature who was given an ego but no free will or capacity for creative thought right okay good point but do please remember that the angel only intervened on my behalf because joshua was praying for my rescue and do please remember that he could have saved us a lot of difficulty over the years if he had helped us out more often and please dont forget thatdespite the fact that he is perhaps the most handsome creature ive ever laid eyes onraziel is a stone doofus nevertheless the ego stroke worked ill get you a map and he did unfortunately the concierge was only able to find a map of the world provided by an airline that partners with the hotel so who knows how accurate it is on this map the next leg of our journey is six inches long and would cost thirty thousand friendly flyer miles i hope that clears things up the traders name was ahmad mahadd ubaidullaganji but he said we could call him master we called him ahmad he led us through the city to a hillside where his caravan was camped he owned a hundred camels which he drove along the silk road along with a dozen men two goats three horses and an astonishingly homely woman named kanuni he took us to his tent which was larger than both the houses joshua and i had grown up in we sat on rich carpets and kanuni served us stuffed dates and wine from a pitcher shaped like a dragon so what does the son of god want with my friend balthasar ahmad asked before we could answer he snorted and laughed until his shoulders shook and he almost spilled his wine he had a round face with high cheekbones and narrow black eyes that crinkled at the corners from too much laughter and desert wind im sorry my friends but ive never been in the presence of the son of a god before which god is your father by the way well the god i said yep said joshua thats the one and what is your gods name dad said josh were not supposed to say his name dad said ahmad i love it he started giggling again i knew you were hebrews and werent allowed to say your gods name i just wanted to see if you would dad thats rich i dont mean to be rude i said and we are certainly enjoying the refreshments but its getting late and you said you would take us to see balthasar and indeed i will we leave in the morning leave for where josh asked kabul the city where balthasar lives now i had never heard of kabul and i sensed that was not a good thing and how far is kabul we should be there in less than two months by camel ahmad said if i knew then what i know now i might have stood and exclaimed tarnation man thats over six inches and thirty thousand friendly flyer miles but since i didnt know that then what i said was shit i will take you to kabul said ahmad but what can you do to help pay your way i know carpentry joshua said my stepfather taught me how to fix a camel saddle and you he looked at me what can you do i thought about my experience as a stonecutter and immediately rejected it and my training as a village idiot which i thought i could always fall back on wasnt going to help either i did have my newfound skill as a sex educator but somehow i didnt think thered be call for that on a twomonth trip with fourteen men and one homely woman so what could i do what skill had i to gentle the road to kabul if someone in the caravan croaks im a great mourner i said want to hear a dirge ahmad laughed until he shook then called for kanuni to bring him his satchel once he had it in hand he dug inside and pulled out the dried newts hed bought from the old hag here youll be needing these he said camels bite a camel will for no reason spit on you stomp you kick you bellow burp and fart at you they are stubborn at their best and cranky beyond all belief at their worst if you provoke them they will bite if you insert a dehydrated amphibian elbowdeep in a camels bum he considers himself provoked doubly so if the procedure was performed while he was sleeping camels are wise to stealth they bite i can heal that joshua said looking at the huge tooth marks on my forehead we were following ahmads caravan along the silk road which was neither a road nor made of silk it was in fact a narrow path through the rocky inhospitable highland desert of what is now syria into the low inhospitable desert of what is now iraq he said sixty days by camel doesnt that mean that we should be riding not walking youre missing your camel pals arent you josh grinned that snotty sonogod grin of his maybe it was just a regular grin im just tired i was up half the night sneaking up on these guys i know said joshua i had to get up at dawn to fix one of the saddles before we left ahmads tools leave something to be desired you go ahead and be the martyr josh just forget about what i was doing all night im just saying that we should get to ride instead of walking we will josh said just not now the men in the caravan were all riding although several of them as well as kanuni were on horses the camels were loaded down with great packs of iron tools powdered dyes and sandalwood bound for the orient at the first highland oasis we crossed ahmad traded the horses for four more camels and joshua and i were allowed to ride at night we ate with the rest of the men sharing boiled grain or bread with sesame paste the odd bit of cheese mashed chickpeas and garlic occasionally goat meat and sometimes the dark hot drink we had discovered in antioch mixed with date sugar and topped with foaming goats milk and cinnamon at my suggestion ahmad dined alone in his tent while the rest of us would dine under the open awning that we constructed to shelter us from the hottest part of the day in the desert the day gets warmer as it gets later so the hottest part of the day will be in the late afternoon just before sundown brings the hot winds to leach the last moisture from your skin none of ahmads men spoke aramaic or hebrew but they had enough functional latin and greek to tease joshua and me about any number of subjects their favorite of course being my job as chief camel deconstipator the men hailed from a halfdozen different lands many we had never heard of some were as black as ethiopians with high foreheads and long graceful limbs while others were squat and bowlegged with powerful shoulders high cheekbones and long wispy mustaches like ahmads not one of them was fat or weak or slow before we were a week out of antioch we figured out that it only took a couple of men to care for and guide a caravan of camels so we were perplexed at why someone as shrewd as ahmad would bring along so many superfluous employees bandits ahmad said adjusting his bulk to find a more comfortable position atop his camel id need no more than a couple of dolts like you two if it was just the animals that needed tending theyre guards why did you think they were all carrying bows and lances yeah i said giving joshua a dirty look didnt you see the lances theyre guards uh ahmad shouldnt josh and i have lancesi mean when we get to the bandit area weve been followed by bandits for five days now ahmad said we dont need lances joshua said i will not make a man sin by committing an act of thievery if a man would have something of mine he need only ask and i will give it to him give me the rest of your money i said forget it said joshua but you just said yeah but not to you most nights joshua and i slept in the open outside ahmads tent or if the night was especially cold among the camels where we would endure their grunting and snorting to get out of the wind the guards slept in twoman tents except for two who stood guard all night many nights long after the camp was quiet joshua and i would lie looking up at the stars and pondering the great questions of life josh do you think the bandits will rob us and kill us or just rob us rob us then kill us i would think said josh just in case they missed something that we had hidden they could torture its whereabouts out of us good point i said do you think ahmad has sex with kanuni joshua asked i know he does he told me he does what do you think its like with them i mean him so fat and her so you know frankly joshua id rather not think about it but thanks for putting that picture in my head you mean you can imagine them together stop it joshua i cant tell you what sin is like youre going to have to do it yourself whats next ill have to murder someone so i can explain what its like to kill no i dont want to kill well that might be one you have to do josh i dont think the romans are going to go away because you ask them to ill find a way i just dont know it yet wouldnt it be funny if you werent the messiah i mean if you abstained from knowing a woman your whole life only to find out that you were just a minor prophet yeah that would be funny said josh he wasnt smiling kind of funny the journey seemed to go surprisingly fast once we knew we were being followed by bandits it gave us something to talk about and our backs stayed limber as we were always twisting in our saddles and checking the horizon i was almost sad when they finally after ten days on our trail decided to attack ahmad who was usually at the front of the caravan fell back and rode beside us the bandits will ambush us inside that pass just ahead he said the road snaked into a canyon with steep slopes on either side topped by rows of huge boulders and winderoded towers theyre hiding in those boulders on top of either ridge ahmad said dont stare youll give us away joshua said if you know that theyre going to attack why not pull up and defend ourselves they will attack one way or another anyway better an ambush we know about than one we dont and they dont know we know i noticed the squat guards with the mustaches take short bows from pouches behind their saddles and as subtly as a man might brush a cobweb from his eyelash they strung the bows if youd been watching them from a distance youd have hardly seen them move what do you want us to do i asked ahmad try not to get killed especially you joshua balthasar will be very angry indeed if i show up with you dead wait said joshua balthasar knows we are coming why yes laughed ahmad he told me to look for you what you think i help every pair of runts that wander into the market at antioch runts i had momentarily forgotten about the ambush how long ago did he tell you to look for us i dont know right after he first left antioch for kabul maybe ten years ago it doesnt matter now i have to get back to kanuni bandits scare her let them get a good look at her i said well see who scares who dont look at the ridges ahmad said as he rode away the bandits came down the sides of the canyon like a synchronized avalanche driving their camels to the edge of balance pushing a river of rocks and sand before them there were twentyfive maybe thirty of them all dressed in black half of them on camels waving swords or clubs the other half on foot with long spears for gutting a camel rider when they were committed to the charge all of them sliding down the hillsides the guards broke our caravan in the middle leaving an empty spot in the road where the bandits charge would culminate their momentum was so great that the bandits were unable to change direction three of their camels went down trying to pull back our guards moved into two groups three in the front with the long lances the bowmen just behind them when the bowmen were set they let arrows fly into the bandits and as each fell he took two or three of his cohorts down with him until in seconds the charge had turned into an actual avalanche of rolling stones and men and camels the camels bellowed and we could hear bones snapping and men screaming as they rolled into a bloody mass on the silk road as each man rose and tried to charge our guards an arrow would drop him in his tracks one bandit came up mounted on a camel and rode toward the back of the caravan where the three lancers drove him from his mount in a spray of blood every movement in the canyon was met with an arrow one bandit with a broken leg tried to crawl back up the canyon wall and an arrow in the back of his skull cut him down i heard a wailing behind me and before i could turn joshua rode by me at full gallop passing the bowmen and the lancers at our side of the caravan bound for the mass of dead and dying bandits he slung himself off his camels back and was running around the bodies like a madman waving his arms and screaming until i could hear the rasp as his throat went raw stop this stop this one bandit moved trying to get to his feet and our bowmen drew back to cut him down joshua threw his body on top of the bandit and pushed him back to the ground i heard ahmad give the command to hold a cloud of dust floated out of the canyon on the gentle desert breeze a camel with a broken leg bellowed and an arrow in the eye put the animal to rest ahmad snatched a lance out of one of the guards hands and rode to where joshua was shielding the wounded bandit move joshua ahmad said holding the lance at ready this must be finished joshua looked around him all of the bandits and all of their animals were dead blood ran in rivulets in the dust already flies were collecting to feast joshua walked through the field of dead bandits until his chest was pressed against the bronze point of ahmads lance tears streamed down joshuas face this was wrong he screeched they were bandits they would have killed us and stolen everything we had if we had not killed them does your own god your father not destroy those who sin now move aside joshua let this be finished i am not my father and neither are you you will not kill this man ahmad lowered the lance and shook his head balefully he will only die anyway joshua i could sense the guards fidgeting not knowing what to do give me your water skin joshua said ahmad threw the water skin down to joshua then turned his camel and rode back to where the guards waited for him joshua took the water to the wounded bandit and held his head as he drank an arrow protruded from the bandits stomach and his black tunic was shiny with blood joshua put his hand gently over the bandits eyes as if he were telling him to go to sleep then he yanked out the arrow and tossed it aside the bandit didnt even flinch joshua put his hand over the wound from the time that ahmad had ordered them to hold fire none of the guards had moved they watched after a few minutes the bandit sat up and joshua stepped away from him and smiled in that instant an arrow sprouted from the bandits forehead and he fell back dead no joshua wheeled around to face ahmads side of the caravan the guard who had shot still held the bow as if he might have to let fly another arrow to finish the job howling with rage joshua made a gesture as if he were striking the air with his open hand and the guard was lifted back off his camel and slammed into the ground no more joshua screamed when the guard sat up in the dirt his eyes were like silver moons in their sockets he was blind later when neither of us had spoken for two days and joshua and i were relegated to riding far behind the caravan because the guards were afraid of us i took a drink from my water skin then handed it to joshua he took a drink and handed it back thank you josh said he smiled and i knew hed be all right hey joshua do me a favor what remind me not to piss you off okay the city of kabul was built on five rugged hillsides with the streets laid out in terraces and the buildings built partly into the hills there was no evidence of roman or greek influence in the architecture but instead the larger buildings had tile roofs that turned up at the corners a style that joshua and i would see all over asia before our journey was finished the people were mostly rugged wiry people who looked like arabs without the glow in their skin that came from a diet rich in olive oil instead their faces seemed leaner drawn by the cold dry wind of the high desert in the market there were merchants and traders from china and more men who looked like ahmad and his bowmen guards a race whom the chinese referred to simply as barbarians the chinese are so afraid of my people that they have built a wall as high as any palace as wide as the widest boulevard in rome and stretching as far as the eye can see ten times over ahmad said uhhuh i said thinking you lying bagoguts joshua hadnt spoken to ahmad since the bandit attack but he smirked at ahmads story of the great wall just so said ahmad we will stay at an inn tonight tomorrow i will take you to balthasar if we leave early we can be there by noon then youll be the magicians problem not mine meet me in front at dawn that night the innkeeper and his wife served us a dinner of spiced lamb and rice with some sort of beer made from rice which washed two months of desert grit from our throats and put a pleasant haze over our minds to save money we paid for pallets under the wide curving eaves of the inn and although it was some comfort to have a roof over my head for the first time in months i found that i missed looking at the stars as i fell asleep i lay awake half drunk for a long time joshua slept the sleep of the innocent the next day ahmad met us in front of the inn with two of his african guards and two extra camels in tow come on now this may be the end of your journey but it is merely a detour for me ahmad said he threw us each a crust of bread and a hunk of cheese which i took to mean we were to eat our breakfast on the way we rode out of kabul and into the hills until we entered a labyrinth of canyons which meandered through rugged mountains that looked as if they might have been shaped by god out of clay then left to bake in the sun until the clay had turned to a deep golden color that reflected light in a spray that ate up shadows and destroyed shade by noon i had no sense whatsoever of what direction we were traveling nor could i have sworn that we werent retracing our path through the same canyons over and over but ahmads black guards seemed to know their way eventually they led us around a bend to a sheer canyon wall two hundred feet tall that stood out from the other canyon walls in that there were windows and balconies carved into it it was a palace hewn out of solid rock at the base stood an ironclad door that looked as if it would take twenty men to move balthasars house ahmad said prodding his camel to kneel down so he might dismount joshua nudged me with his riding stick hey is this what you expected i shook my head i dont know what i expected maybe something a littlei dont knowsmaller could you find your way back out of these canyons if you had to joshua asked nope you not a chance ahmad waddled over to the great door and pulled a cord that hung down from a hole in the wall somewhere inside we heard the ringing of some great bell only later would we learn that it was the sound of a gong a smaller door within the door opened and a girl stuck her head out what she had the round face and high cheekbones of an oriental and there were great blue wings painted on her face above her eyes its ahmad ahmad mahadd ubaidullaganji ive brought balthasar the boy he has been waiting for ahmad gestured in our direction the girl looked skeptical scrawny you sure thats the one thats the one tell balthasar he owes me whos that with him thats his stupid friend no extra charge for him you bring the monkeys paws the girl asked yes and the other herbs and minerals balthasar asked for okay wait here she closed the door was gone only a second then returned send just the two of them in alone balthasar must examine them then he will deal with you theres no need to be mysterious woman ive been in balthasars house a hundred times now quit dillydallying and open the door silence the girl shouted the great balthasar will not be mocked send in the boys alone then she slammed the little door and we could hear her cackling echo out the windows above ahmad shook his head in disgust and waved us over to the door just go i dont know what hes up to but just go joshua and i dismounted took our packs off the camels and edged over to the huge door joshua looked at me as if wondering what to do then reached for the cord to ring the bell but as he did the door creaked open just wide enough for one of us to enter if we turned sideways it was pitch black inside except for a narrow stripe of light which told us nothing joshua again looked at me and raised his eyebrows im just the stupid noextracharge friend i said bowing after you joshua moved though the door and i followed when we were inside only a few feet the huge door slammed with a sound like thunder and we stood there in complete darkness im sure i could feel things scurrying around my feet in the dark there was a bright flash and a great column of red smoke rose in front of us illuminated by a light coming from the ceiling somewhere it smelled of brimstone and stung my nose joshua coughed and we both backed against the door as a figure stepped out of the smoke heitstood as tall as any two men although he was thin he wore a long purple robe embroidered with strange symbols in gold and silver hooded so we saw no face only glowing red eyes set back in a field of black he held a bright lamp out as if to examine us by the light satan i said under my breath to joshua pressing my back against the great iron door so hard that i could feel rust flakes imbedding in my skin through my tunic its not satan joshua said who would disturb the sanctity of my fortress boomed the figure i nearly wet myself at hearing his voice im joshua of nazareth joshua said trying to be casual but his voice broke on nazareth and this is biff also of nazareth were looking for balthasar he came to bethlehem where i was born many years ago looking for me i have to ask him some questions balthasar is no more of this world the dark figure reached into his robe and pulled out a glowing dagger which he held high then plunged into his own chest there was an explosion a flash and an anguished roar as if someone had killed a lion joshua and i turned and frantically scratched at the iron door looking for a latch we were both making an incoherent terrorized sound that i can only describe as the verbal version of running sort of an extended rhythmic howl that paused only when the last of each lungful of air squeaked out of us then i heard the laughing and joshua grabbed my arm the laughing got louder joshua swung me around to face death in purple as i turned the dark figure threw back his hood and i saw the grinning black face and shaved head of a mana very tall man but a man nonetheless he threw open the robe and i could see that it was indeed a man a man who had been standing on the shoulders of two young asian women who had been hiding beneath the very long robe just fuckin with you he said then he giggled he leapt off of the womens shoulders and took a deep breath before doubling over and hugging himself with laughter tears streamed out of his big chestnut eyes you should have seen the look on your faces girls did you see that the women who wore simple linen robes didnt seem as amused as the man they looked embarrassed and a little impatient as if theyd rather be anywhere else doing anything but this balthasar joshua asked yeah said balthasar who stood up now and was only a little taller than i was sorry i dont get many visitors so youre joshua yes joshua said an edge in his voice i didnt recognize you without the swaddling clothes and this is your servant my friend biff same thing bring your friend come in the girls will attend to ahmad for the time being he stalked off down a corridor into the mountain his long purple robe trailing behind him like the tail of a dragon we stood there by the door not moving until we realized that once balthasar turned a corner with his lamp wed be in darkness again so we took off after him as we ran down the corridor i thought of how far we had traveled and what we had left behind and i felt as if i was going to be sick to my stomach any second wise man i said to joshua my mother has never lied to me said josh that you know of i said chapter well by pretending to have an overactive bladder ive managed to sneak enough time in the bathroom to finish reading this gospel of matthew i dont know who the matthew is that wrote this but it certainly wasnt our matthew while our matthew was a whiz at numbers as you might expect from a tax collector he couldnt write his own name in the sand without making three mistakes whoever wrote this gospel obviously got the information at least secondhand maybe thirdhand im not here to criticize but please he never mentions me not once i know my protests go against the humility that joshua taught but please i was his best friend not to mention the fact that this matthew if that really is his name takes great care in describing joshuas genealogy back to king david but after joshua is born and the three wise men show up at the stable in bethlehem then you dont hear from joshua again until hes thirty thirty as if nothing happened from the manger until john baptized us jeez anyway now i know why i was brought back from the dead to write this gospel if the rest of this new testament is anything like the book of matthew they need someone to write about joshuas life who was actually there me i cant believe i wasnt even mentioned once its all i can do to keep from asking raziel what in the hell happened he probably showed up a hundred years too late to correct this matthew fellow oh my theres a frightening thought edited by the moron angel i cant let that happen and the ending where did he get that ill see what this next guy this mark has to say but im not getting my hopes up the first thing that we noticed about balthasars fortress was that there were no right angles no angles period only curves as we followed the magus through corridors and from level to level we never saw so much as a squaredoff stair step instead there were spiral ramps leading from level to level and although the fortress spread all over the cliff face no room was more than one doorway away from a window once we were above the ground level there was always light from the windows and the creepy feeling wed had when we entered quickly passed away the stone of the walls was more yellow in color than the limestone of jerusalem yet it had the same smooth appearance overall it gave the impression that you were walking through the polished entrails of some huge living creature did you build this place balthasar i asked oh no he said without turning around this place was always here i simply had to remove the stone that occupied it oh i said having gained no knowledge whatsoever we passed no doors but myriad open archways and round portals which opened into chambers of various shapes and sizes as we passed one eggshaped doorway obscured by a curtain of beads balthasar mumbled the girls stay in there girls i said girls joshua said yes girls you ninnies balthasar said humans much like yourselves except smarter and better smelling well i knew that i mean wed seen the two of them hadnt we i knew what girls were he pressed on until we came to the only other door i had seen since we entered this one another huge ironclad monster held closed with three iron bolts as big around as my arm and a heavy brass lock engraved with strange characters the magus stopped and tilted an ear to the door his heavy gold earring clinked against one of the bolts he turned to us and whispered and for the first time i could clearly see that the magus was very old despite the strength of his laugh and the spring in his step you may go anywhere you wish while you stay here but you must never open this door xiong zai xiong zai i repeated to joshua in case hed missed it xiong zai he nodded with total lack of understanding mankind i suppose is designed to run onto be motivated bytemptation if progress is a virtue then this is our greatest gift for what is curiosity if not intellectual temptation and what progress is there without curiosity on the other hand can you call such a profound weakness a gift or is it a design flaw is temptation itself at fault for mans woes or is it simply the lack of judgment in response to temptation in other words who is to blame mankind or a bad designer because i cant help but think that if god had never told adam and eve to avoid the fruit of the tree of knowledge that the human race would still be running around naked dancing in wonderment and blissfully naming stuff between snacks naps and shags by the same token if balthasar had passed that great ironclad door that first day without a word of warning i might have never given it a second glance and once again much trouble could have been avoided am i to blame for what happened or is it the author of temptation god hisownself balthasar led us into a grand chamber with silks festooned from the ceiling and the floor covered with fine carpets and pillows wine fruit cheese and bread were laid out on several low tables rest and refresh said balthasar ill be back after i finish my business with ahmad then he hurried off leaving us alone so i said find out what you need to from this guy then we can get on the road and on to the next wise man im not sure its going to be that quick in fact we may be here quite some time maybe years years joshua were in the middle of nowhere we cant spend years here biff we grew up in the middle of nowhere whats the difference girls i said what about them joshua asked dont start we heard laughter rolling down the corridor into the room and shortly it was followed by balthasar and ahmad who threw themselves down among the pillows and began eating the cheeses and fruits that had been set out so balthasar said ahmad tells me that you tried to save a bandit and in the process blinded one of his men without so much as touching him very impressive joshua hung his head it was a massacre grieve balthasar said but consider also the words of the master laotzu weapons are instruments of misfortune those who are violent do not die naturally ahmad joshua said what will happen to the guard the one i he is no good to me anymore said ahmad a shame too he was the best bowman of the lot ill leave him in kabul hes asked me to give his pay to his wife in antioch and his other wife in dunhuang i suppose he will become a beggar who is laotzu i asked you will have plenty of time to learn of master laotzu said balthasar tomorrow i will assign you a tutor to teach you qi the path of the dragons breath but for now eat and rest can you believe a chinaman can be so black laughed ahmad have you ever seen such a thing i wore the leopard skin of the shaman when your father was just a twinkle in the great river of stars ahmad i mastered animal magic before you were old enough to walk and i had learned all the secrets of the sacred egyptian magic texts before you could sprout a beard if immortality is to be found among the wisdom of the chinese masters then i shall be chinese as long as it suits me no matter the color of my skin or the place of my birth i tried to determine balthasars age from what he was claiming he would have to be very old indeed as ahmad was not young himself yet his movements were spry and as far as i could see he had all of his teeth and they were perfect there was none of the feeble dotage that id seen in our elders at home how do you stay so strong balthasar i asked magic he grinned there is no magic but that of the lord joshua said balthasar scratched his chin and replied quietly then presumably none without his consent eh joshua joshua slouched and stared at the floor ahmad burst out laughing his magic isnt so mysterious boys balthasar has eight young concubines to draw the poisons from his old body thats how he stays young holy moly eight i was astounded aroused envious does that room with the ironclad door have something to do with your magic joshua asked gravely balthasar stopped grinning ahmad looked from joshua to the magus and back bewildered let me show you to your quarters said balthasar you should wash and rest lessons tomorrow say goodbye to ahmad youll not see him again soon our quarters were spacious bigger than the houses wed grown up in with carpets on the floor chairs made of dark exotic hardwoods carved into the shapes of dragons and lions and a table that held a pitcher and basin for washing each of our rooms held a desk and cabinet full of instruments for painting and writing and something neither of us had ever seen a bed a halfwall divided the space between joshuas room and mine so we were able to lie in the beds and talk before falling asleep just as we had in the desert i could tell that joshua was deeply troubled about something that first night you seem i dont know deeply troubled josh its the bandits could i have raised them all of them i dont know could you i thought about it i thought that i could make them all walk and breathe again i thought i could make them live but i didnt even try why because i was afraid they would have killed us and robbed us if i had its what balthasar said those who are violent do not die naturally the torah says an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth they were bandits but were they bandits always would they have been bandits in the years to come sure once a bandit always a bandit they take an oath or something besides you didnt kill them but i didnt save them and i blinded that bowman that wasnt right you were angry thats no excuse what do you mean thats no excuse youre gods son god wiped out everyone on earth with a flood because he was angry im not sure thats right scuse me we have to go to kabul i need to restore that mans sight if i can joshua this bed is the most comfortable place ive ever been can we wait to go to kabul i suppose joshua was quiet for a long time and i thought that he might have fallen asleep i didnt want to sleep but i didnt want to talk about dead bandits either hey josh what what do you think is in that room with the iron door what did he call it xiong zai said josh yeah xiong zai what do you think that is i dont know biff maybe you should ask your tutor xiong zai means house of doom in the parlance of feng shui said tiny feet of the divine dance of joyous orgasm she knelt before a low stone table that held an earthenware teapot and cups she wore a red silk robe trimmed with golden dragons and tied with a black sash her hair was black and straight and so long that she had tied it in a knot to keep it from dragging on the floor as she served the tea her face was heartshaped her skin as smooth as polished alabaster and if shed ever been in the sun the evidence had long since faded she wore wooden sandals held fast by silk ribbons and her feet as you might guess from her name were tiny it had taken me three days of lessons to get the courage up to ask her about the room she poured the tea daintily but without ceremony as she had each of the previous three days before my lessons but this time before she handed it to me she added to my cup a drop of a potion from a tiny porcelain bottle that hung from a chain around her neck whats in the bottle joy i called her joy her full name was too ungainly for conversation and when id tried other diminutives tiny feet divine dance and orgasm she hadnt responded positively poison joy said with a smile the lips of her smile were shy and girlish but the eyes smiled a thousand years sly ah i said and i tasted the tea it was rich and fragrant just as it had been before but this time there was a hint of bitterness biff can you guess what your lesson is today joy asked i thought you would tell me whats in that house of doom room no that is not the lesson today balthasar does not wish you to know what is in that room guess again my fingers and toes had begun to tingle and i suddenly realized that my scalp had gone numb youre going to teach me how to make the firepowder that balthasar used the day we arrived no silly joys laugh had the musical sound of a clear stream running over rocks she pushed me lightly on the chest and i fell over backward unable to move todays lesson isare you ready i grunted it was all i could do my mouth was paralyzed todays lesson is if someone puts poison in your tea dont drink it uhhuh i sort of slurred so balthasar said i see that tiny feet of the divine dance of joyous orgasm has revealed what she keeps in the little bottle around her neck the magus laughed heartily and leaned back on some cushions is he dead asked joshua the girls laid my paralyzed body on some pillows next to joshua then propped me up so i could look at balthasar beautiful gate of heavenly moisture number six who i had only just met and didnt have a nickname for yet put some drops on my eyes to keep them moist as i seemed to have lost the ability to blink no said balthasar hes not dead hes just relaxed joshua poked me in the ribs and of course i didnt respond really relaxed he said beautiful gate of heavenly moisture number six handed joshua the little vial of eye drops and excused herself she and the other girls left the room can he see and hear us joshua asked oh yes hes completely alert hey biff im learning about chi joshua shouted into my ear it flows all around us you cant see it or hear it or smell it but its there you dont need to shout said balthasar which is what i would have said if i could have said anything joshua put some drops in my eyes sorry then to balthasar this poison where did it come from i studied under a sage in china who had been the emperors royal poisoner he taught me this and many other of the magics of the five elements why would an emperor need a poisoner a question that only a peasant would ask an answer that only an ass would give said joshua balthasar laughed so be it child of the star a question asked in earnest deserves an earnest answer an emperor has many enemies to dispatch but more important he has many enemies who would dispatch him the sage spent most of his time concocting antidotes so theres an antidote to this poison joshua said poking me in the ribs again in good time in good time have some more wine joshua i wish to discuss with you the three jewels of the tao the three jewels of the tao are compassion moderation and humility an hour later four chinese girls came and picked me up wiped the floor where i had drooled and carried me to our quarters as they passed the great ironclad door i could hear scraping and a voice in my head that said hey kid open the door but the girls made no notice of it back in my room the girls bathed me and poured some rich broth into me then put me to bed and closed my eyes i could hear joshua enter the room and shuffle around preparing for bed balthasar says he will have joy give you the antidote to the poison soon but first you have a lesson to learn he says that this is the chinese way of teaching strange dont you think had i been able to make a sound i would have agreed yes indeed it was strange so you know balthasars concubines were eight in number and their names were tiny feet of the divine dance of joyous orgasm beautiful gate of heavenly moisture number six temptress of the golden light of the harvest moon delicate personage of two fu dogs wrestling under a blanket feminine keeper of the three tunnels of excessive friendliness silken pillows of the heavenly softness of clouds pea pods in duck sauce with crispy noodle and sue and i found myself wondering as a man does about origins and motivations and suchas each of the concubines was more beautiful than the last regardless of what order you put them in which was weirdso after several weeks passed and i could no longer stand the curiosity scratching at my brain like a cat in a basket i waited until one of the rare occasions when i was alone with balthasar and i asked why sue short for susanna balthasar said so there you go their full names were somewhat ungainly and to try to pronounce them in chinese produced a sound akin to throwing a bag of silverware down a flight of steps ting tong yang wing etc so joshua and i called the girls as follows joy number six two fu dogs moon tunnels pillows pea pods and of course sue which we couldnt figure out how to shorten except for a group of men who brought supplies from kabul every two weeks and while there would do any heavy moving the eight young women did everything around the fortress despite the remoteness and the obvious wealth that the fortress housed there were no guards i found that curious over the next week joy tutored me in the characters that i would need to know to read the book of the divine elixirs or the nine tripods of the yellow emperor and the book of liquid pearl in nine cycles and of the nine elixirs of the divine immortals the plan was that once i became conversant in these two ancient texts i would be able to assist balthasar in his quest for immortality that by the way was the reason that we were there the reason that balthasar had followed the star to bethlehem at joshuas birth and the reason that he had put ahmad on notice to look for a jew seeking the african magus balthasar sought immortality and he believed that joshua held the key to it of course we didnt know that at the time my concentration while studying the symbols was particularly acute helped by the fact that i could not move a muscle each morning two fu dogs and pillows both named for their voluptuousness which evidently came with considerable strength would pull me from bed squeeze me over the latrine bathe me pour some broth into me then take me to the library and prop me in a chair while joy lectured on chinese characters which she painted with a wet brush on large sheets of slate set on easels sometimes the other girls would stay and pose my body into various positions that amused them and as much as i should have been annoyed by the humiliation the truth be told watching pillows and two fu dogs jiggle in paroxysms of girlish laughter was fast becoming the high point of my paralyzed day at midday joy would take a break while two or more of the other girls squoze me over the latrine poured more broth into me and then teased me mercilessly until joy returned clapped her hands and sent them away well scolded joy was the bullox concubine of them all despite her tiny feet sometimes during these breaks joshua would leave his own lessons and come to the library to visit why have you painted him blue asked joshua he looks good blue said pea pods two fu dogs and tunnels stood by with paintbrushes admiring their work well hes not going to be happy with this when he gets the antidote i can tell you that then to me joshua said you know you do sort of look good blue biff ive appealed to joy on your behalf but she says she doesnt think youve learned your lesson yet you have learned your lesson though havent you stop breathing for a second if the answer is yes i did i thought so joshua bent and whispered in my ear its about that room behind the iron door thats the lesson they want you to learn i got the feeling that if i asked about it id be propped up there next to you he stood up i have to go now the three jewels to learn dont you know im on compassion its not as hard as it sounds two days later joy came to my room in the morning with some tea she pulled the tiny bottle from inside her dragon robe and held it close in front of my eyes you see the two small corks a white one on one side of the vessel and a black one on the other the black one is the poison i gave you the white one is the antidote i think youve learned your lesson i drooled in response while sincerely hoping she hadnt mixed up the corks she tipped the little bottle over a teacup then poured some tea down my throat with half of it going down the front of my shirt as well that will take a while to work you may experience some discomfort as the poison wears off joy dropped the little bottle down into its nest of chinese cleavage then kissed me on the forehead and left if i could i would have snickered at the blue paint she had on her lips as she walked away ha some discomfort she had said for the better part of ten days id had no sensation in my body at all then suddenly things started to work again imagine rolling out of your warm bed in the morning intooh i dont knowa lake of burning oil jumpin jehoshaphat joshua im about to crawl out of my skin here we were in our quarters about an hour after id taken the antidote balthasar had sent joshua to find me and bring me to the library supposedly to see how i was doing josh put his hand on my forehead but instead of the usual calm that accompanied that gesture it felt as if hed lain a hot branding iron across my skin i knocked his hand aside thanks but its not helping maybe a bath joshua suggested tried it jeez this is driving me mad i hopped around in a circle because i didnt know what else to do maybe balthasar has something that can help joshua said lead on i said i cant just sit here we headed off down the corridor going down several levels on the way to the library as we descended one of the spiral ramps i grabbed joshuas arm josh look at this ramp you notice anything he considered the surface and leaned out to look at the sides of the tread no should i how about the walls and ceilings the floors you notice anything joshua looked around theyre all solid rock yes but what else look hard think of the houses we built in sepphoris now do you notice anything no tool marks exactly i said i spent a lot of time over the last two weeks staring at walls and ceilings with nothing much else to look at theres not the slightest evidence of a chisel a pick a hammer anything its as if these chambers had been carved by the wind over a thousand years but you know thats not the case so whats your point joshua said my point is that theres more going on with balthasar and his girls than he lets on we should ask them no we shouldnt josh dont you get it we need to find out whats going on without them knowing that we know why why why because the last time i asked a question i was poisoned thats why and i believe that if balthasar didnt think you had something that he wants id have never seen the antidote but i dont have anything said joshua honestly you might have something you dont know you have but you cant just go asking what it is we need to be devious tricky sneaky but im not good at any of those things i put my arm around my friends shoulders not always so great being the messiah huh chapter i could kick that punks punk ass the angel said jumping on the bed shaking a fist at the television screen raziel i said you are an angel of the lord he is a professional wrestler i think its understood that you could kick his punk ass this has gone on for a couple of days now the angel has found a new passion the front desk has called a dozen times and sent a bellman up twice to tell the angel to quiet down besides its just pretend raziel looked at me as if i had slapped him dont start with that again these are not actors the angel back flipped on the bed ooo ooo you see that ho popped him with a chair thaz right you go girl she nasty its like that now talk shows featuring the screaming ignorant soap operas and wrestling and the angel guards the remote control like its the ark of the covenant this i told him is why the angels were never given free will this right here because you would spend your time watching this really raziel said and he muted the tv for what seemed like the first time in days then tell me levi who is called biff if by watching this i am abusing the little freedom ive been given while carrying out this task then what would you say of your people by my people you mean human beings i was stalling i didnt remember the angel ever making a valid point before and i wasnt prepared for it hey dont blame me ive been dead for two thousand years i wouldnt have let this sort of thing happen uhhuh said the angel crossing his arms and striking a pose of incredulity that he had learned from a gangster rapper on mtv if there was anything i learned from john the baptist it was that the sooner you confess a mistake the quicker you can get on to making new and better mistakes oh that and dont piss off salome that was a big one too okay weve fucked up i said thaz whut im talkin about said the angel entirely too satisfied with himself yeah where was he when we needed him and his sword of justice at balthasars fortress probably in greece watching wrestling meanwhile when we got to the library balthasar was sitting before the heavy dragon table eating a bit of cheese and sipping wine while tunnels and pea pods poured a sticky yellow wax on his bald head then spread it around with small wooden paddles the easels and slates from my lessons had been stacked out of the way against the shelves full of scrolls and codices you look good blue balthasar said yeah everybody says that the paint once set didnt wash off but at least my skin had stopped itching come in sit have wine they brought cheese from kabul this morning try some joshua and i sat in chairs across the table from the magus josh completely true to form disregarded my advice and asked balthasar outright about the iron door the aspect of the jolly wizard became suddenly grave there are some mysteries one must learn to live with did not your own god tell moses that no one must look upon his face and the prophet accepted that so you must accept that you cannot know what is in the room with the iron door he knows his torah and prophets and writings too joshua said to me balthasar knows more about solomon than any of the rabbis or priests in israel thats swell josh i handed him a hunk of cheese to keep him amused to balthasar i said but you forget gods butt you dont hang out with the messiah for most of your life without picking up a little torah knowledge yourself what said the magus just then the girls grabbed the edges of the hardened wax shell theyd made on balthasars head and ripped it off in one swift movement ouch you vicious harpies cant you warn me when youre going to do that get out the girls tittered and hid their satisfied grins behind delicate fans painted with pheasants and plum blossoms they fled the library leaving a trail of girlish laughter in the hall as they passed isnt there an easier way to do that asked joshua balthasar scowled at him dont you think that after two hundred years if there was an easier way to do it i would have found it joshua dropped his cheese two hundred years i chimed in you get a hairstyle you like stick with it not that you could call that hair per se balthasar wasnt amused whats this about gods butt or that you could call that style for that matter i added rising and going to a copy of the torah that id seen on the shelves fortunately it was a codexlike a modern bookotherwise id have been unwinding a scroll for twenty minutes and the drama would have been lost i quickly flipped to exodus right heres the part you were talking about and he said thou canst not see my face for there shall no man see me and live right well then god puts his hand over moses as he passes but he says i will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back parts but my face shall not be seen so said balthasar so god let moses see his butt so using your example you owe us gods butt so tell us whats going on with that room with the iron door brilliant i paused and studied the blueness of my fingernails while savoring my victory thats the silliest thing ive ever heard said balthasar his momentary loss of composure was replaced by the calm and slightly amused attitude of the master what if i told you that it is dangerous for you to know about what is behind that iron door now but once you have training you will not only know but you will gain great power from the knowledge when i think you are ready i promise to show you what is behind that door but you must promise to study and learn your lessons can you do that are you forbidding us to ask questions asked joshua oh no im simply denying you some of the answers for the time being and trust me time is the one thing that i have plenty of joshua turned to me i still dont know what i am supposed to learn here but im sure i havent learned it yet he was pleading me with his eyes to not push the issue i decided to let it drop besides i didnt relish the idea of being poisoned again how long is this going to take i asked these lessons i mean some students take many years to learn the nature of chi you will be provided for while you are here years can we think about it take as long as you like balthasar stood now i must go to the girls quarters they like to rub their naked breasts over my scalp right after its been waxed and is at its smoothest i gulped joshua grinned and looked at the table in front of him i often wondered not just then but most of the time if joshua had the ability to turn off his imagination when he needed to he must have otherwise i dont know how he would have ever triumphed over temptation i on the other hand was a slave to my imagination and it was running wild with the image of balthasars scalp massage well stay well learn well do what is needed i said joshua burst out laughing then calmed himself enough to speak yes we will stay and learn balthasar but first i have to go to kabul and finish some business of course you do said balthasar you can leave tomorrow ill have one of the girls show you the way but for now i must say good night the wizard stalked off leaving joshua to collapse into a fit of giggles and me to wonder how i might look with my head shaved in the morning joy came to our rooms wearing the garb of a desert trader a loose tunic soft leather boots and pantaloons her hair was tied up under a turban and she carried a long riding crop in her hand she led us through a long narrow passageway that went deep into the mountain then emerged out of the side of a sheer cliff we climbed a rope ladder to the top of the plateau where pillows and sue waited with three camels saddled and outfitted for a short journey there was a small farm on the plateau with several pens full of chickens some goats and a few pigs in a pen were going to have a tough time getting these camels down that ladder i said joy scowled and wrapped the tail of her turban around her face so that only her eyes showed theres a path down she said then she tapped her camel on the shoulder with her crop and rode off leaving joshua and me to scramble onto our animals and follow the road down from the plateau was just wide enough for a single camel to sway his way down without falling but once down on the desert floor much like the entrance to the canyon where the fortresss entrance lay if you didnt know it was there you would never have found it an added measure of security for a fortress that had no guards i thought joshua and i tried to engage joy in conversation several times during the journey to kabul but she was cranky and abrupt and often just rode away from us probably depressed that shes not torturing me i speculated i can see how that might bring her down said joshua maybe if you could get your camel to bite you i know that always brightens my mood i rode on ahead without another word its wildly irritating to have invented something as revolutionary as sarcasm only to have it abused by amateurs once in kabul joy led the search for the blinded guard by asking every blind beggar that we passed in the marketplace have you seen a blind bowman who arrived by camel caravan a little more than a week ago joshua and i trailed several steps behind her trying desperately to keep from grinning whenever she looked back joshua had wanted to point out the flaw in joys method while i on the other hand wanted to savor her doofuscosity as passive revenge for having been poisoned there was none of the competence and selfassured nature she showed at the fortress she was clearly out of her element and i was enjoying it you see i explained to joshua what joy is doing is ironic yet thats not her intent thats the difference between irony and sarcasm irony can be spontaneous while sarcasm requires volition you have to create sarcasm no kidding said josh why do i waste my time with you we indulged joys search for the blind man for another hour before directing her inquiries to the sighted and to men from the camel caravans in particular once she started asking sighted people it was a short time before we were directed to a temple where the blinded guard was said to have staked his begging territory there he is said joshua pointing to a ragged pile of human being beckoning to the worshipers as they moved in and out of the temple it looks like things have been tough on him i said amazed that the guard who had been one of the most vital and frightening men id ever seen had been reduced to such a pathetic creature in so short a time then again i was discounting the theatrics of it all a great injustice has been done here said josh he moved to the guard and gently put his hand on the blind mans shoulder brother i am here to relieve your suffering pity on the blind said the guard waving around a wooden bowl calm now said joshua placing his hand over the blind mans eyes when i remove my hand you will see again i could see the strain in joshuas face as he concentrated on healing the guard tears trickled down his cheeks and dripped on the flagstones i thought of how effortless his healings had been in antioch and realized that the strain was not coming from the healing but from the guilt he carried for having blinded the man in the first place when he removed his hand and stepped away both he and the guard shivered joy stepped away from us and covered her face as if to ward off bad air the guard stared into space just as he had while he had been begging but his eyes were no longer white can you see joshua said i can see but everything is wrong peoples skin appears blue no he is blue remember my friend biff were you always blue no only recently then the guard seemed to see joshua for the first time and his expression of wonderment was replaced by hatred he leapt at joshua drawing a dagger from his rags as he moved he would have split my friends rib cage in a single swift blow if joy hadnt swept his feet out from under him at the last second even so he was up in an instant going for a second attack i managed to get my hand up in time to poke him in the eyes just as joy kicked him in the back of the neck driving him to the ground in agony my eyes he cried sorry i said joy kicked the knife out of the guards reach i put an arm around joshuas chest and pushed him back you need to put some distance between you and him before he can see again but i only meant to help him said joshua blinding him was a mistake josh he doesnt care all he knows is that you are the enemy all he knows is that he wants to destroy you i dont know what im doing even when i try to do the right thing it goes wrong we need to go said joy she took one of joshuas arms while i took the other and we led him away before the guard could gather his senses for another attack joy had a list of supplies that balthasar wanted her to bring back to the fortress so we spent some time tracking down large baskets of a mineral called cinnabar from which we would extract quicksilver as well as some spices and pigments joshua followed us through the market in a daze until we passed a merchant who was selling the black beans from which was made the dark drink wed had in antioch buy me some joshua said joy buy me some of those she did and joshua cradled the bag of beans like an infant all the way back to the fortress we rode most of the way in silence but when the sun had gone down and we were almost to the hidden road that led up to the plateau joy galloped up beside me how did he do it she asked what i saw him heal that mans eyes how did he do it i know many kinds of magic but i saw no spells cast no potions mixed its very powerful magic all right i checked over my shoulder to see if joshua was paying attention he was hugging his coffee beans and mumbling to himself as he had for the whole trip praying i presume tell me how its done joy said i asked joshua but hes just chanting and looking stunned well i could tell you how its done but you have to tell me whats going on behind the ironclad door i cant tell you that but perhaps we can trade other things she pulled the tail of her turban away from her face and smiled she was stunningly beautiful in the moonlight even in mens clothes i know over a thousand ways to bring pleasure to a man and thats only what i know personally the other girls have as many tricks that theyd be willing to show you too yeah but how is that useful to me what do i need to know about pleasing a man joy ripped her turban off her head and smacked me across the back of the head with it sending a small cloud of dust drifting into the night youre stupid and youre blue and the next time i poison you i will be sure to use something without an antidote even the wise and inscrutable joy could be goaded i guess i smiled i will accept your paltry offerings i said with as much pomposity as an adolescent boy can muster and in return i will teach the greatest secret of our magic a secret of my own invention we call it sarcasm lets make coffee when we get home said joshua it was some challenge to try to drag out the process of how joshua had returned the guards sight especially since i hadnt the slightest idea myself but through careful misdirection obfuscation subterfuge guile and complete balderdash i was able to barter that lack of knowledge into months of outrageous knob polishing by the beauteous joy and her comely minions somehow the urgency of knowing what was behind the ironclad door and the answers to other enigmas of balthasars fortress abated and i found myself quite content pursuing the lessons the wizard assigned me during the day while stretching my imagination to its limit with the mathematical combinations of the night there was the drawback that balthasar would kill me if he knew that i was availing myself of the charms of his concubines but is the pilfered fruit not sweetened by the stealing oh to be young and in love with eight chinese concubines meanwhile joshua took to his studies with characteristic zeal fueled in no little bit by the coffee he drank every morning until he nearly vibrated through the floor with enthusiasm look at this do you see biff when asked the master confucius says recompense injury with justice and kindness with kindness yet laotzu says recompense injury with kindness dont you see joshua would dance around scrolls trailing out behind him hoping that somehow i would share his enthusiasm for the ancient texts and i tried i really did no i dont see the torah says an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth that is justice exactly said joshua i think laotzu is correct kindness precedes justice as long as you seek justice by punishment you can only cause more suffering how can that be right this is a revelation i learned how to boil down goat urine to make explosives today i said thats good too said joshua it could happen like that any time of the day or night joshua would come blazing out of the library in the middle of the night interrupt me in the midst of some complex oily tangle of pea pod and pillows and tunnelswhile number six familiarized us with the five hundred jade gods of various depths and texturesand hed avert his eyes just long enough for me to towel off before hed shove some codex in my hand and force me to read a passage while he waxed enthusiastic on the thoughts of some longdead sage the master says that the superior man may indeed endure want but the inferior man when he experiences want will give into unbridled excess hes talking about you biff youre the inferior man im so proud i told him as i watched number six forlornly pack her gods into the warmed brass case where they resided thank you for coming here to tell me that i was given the task of learning waidan which is the alchemy of the external my knowledge would come from the manipulation of the physical elements joshua on the other hand was learning neidan the alchemy of the internal his knowledge would come from the study of his own inner nature through the contemplation of the masters so while joshua read scrolls and books i spent my time mixing quicksilver and lead phosphorous and brimstone charcoal and philosophers stone trying somehow to divine the nature of the tao joshua was learning to be the messiah and i was learning to poison people and blow stuff up the world seemed very much in order i was happy joshua was happy balthasar was happy and the girlswell the girls were busy although i passed the iron door every day and the niggling voice persisted what was behind it wasnt important to me and neither were the answers to the dozen or so questions that joshua and i should have put to our generous master before we knew it a year had passed then two more and we were celebrating the passage of joshuas seventeenth birthday in the fortress balthasar had the girls prepare a feast of chinese delicacies and we drank wine late into the night and long after that and even when we had returned to israel we always ate chinese food on joshuas birthday im told it became a tradition not only with those of us who knew joshua but with jews everywhere do you ever think of home joshua asked me the night of his birthday feast sometimes i said what do you think of maggie i said sometimes my brothers sometimes my mother and father but always maggie even with all your experiences since you still think of maggie joshua had become less and less curious about the essence of lust initially i thought that his lack of interest had to do with the depth of his studies but i then realized that his interest was fading along with the memory of maggie joshua my memory of maggie isnt about what happened the night before we left i didnt go to see her thinking that we would make love a kiss was more than i expected i think of maggie because i made a place in my heart for her to live and its empty it always will be it always was she loved you im sorry biff i dont know how to heal that i would if i could i know josh i know i didnt want to talk about home anymore but josh deserved to get off his chest whatever it was that was bothering him and if not to me to whom do you ever think of home yes thats why i asked you know the girls were cooking bacon today and that made me think of home why i dont remember anyone ever cooking bacon at home i know but if we ate some bacon no one at home would ever know i got up and walked over to the halfwall that divided our rooms there was moonlight coming through the window and joshuas face had caught it and was glowing in that annoying way that it sometimes did joshua youre the son of god youre the messiah that impliesoh i dont knowthat youre a jew you cant eat bacon god doesnt care if we eat bacon i can just feel it really he still feel the same way about fornication yep masturbation yep killing stealing bearing false witness coveting thy neighbors wife et cetera no change of heart on those nope just bacon interesting you would have thought thered be something about bacon in the prophecies of isaiah yeah makes you wonder doesnt it youre going to need more than that to usher in the kingdom of god josh no offense we cant go home with hi im the messiah god wanted you to have this bacon i know we have much more to learn but breakfasts will be more interesting go to sleep josh as time passed i seldom saw joshua except at mealtimes and before we went to sleep nearly all my time was taken up with my studies and helping the girls maintain the fortress while nearly all of joshuas time was spent with balthasar which would eventually become a problem this is not good biff joy said in chinese id learned to speak her language well enough that she seldom spoke greek or latin anymore balthasar is getting too close with joshua he seldom sends for one of us to join him in his bed now youre not implying that joshua and balthasar are uh playing shepherd are you because i know thats not true joshua isnt allowed of course the angel had said he couldnt know a woman he hadnt said anything about a creepy old african wizard oh i dont care if theyre buggering their eyeballs out said joy balthasar mustnt fall in love why do you think that there are eight of us i thought it was a matter of budget i said you havent noticed that one of us will never spend two nights in a row with balthasar or that we dont speak with him beyond what is required for our duties and lessons i had noticed but it never occurred to me that there was something out of the ordinary we hadnt gotten to the chapter on wizardconcubine behavior in the book yet so so i think he is falling in love with joshua that is not good well im with you on that one i wasnt happy the last time someone fell in love with him but why does it matter here i cant tell you but there has been more commotion coming from the house of doom said joy you have to help me if im right we have to stop balthasar well observe them tomorrow while we adjust the flow of chi in the library no joy not library chi the stuff in the library is too heavy i hate library chi chi or qi the breath of the dragon the eternal energy that flows through all things in balance as it should be it was half yin half yang half light half dark half male half female the chi in the library was always getting fucked up while the chi in the rooms with just cushions or with lightweight furniture seemed well adjusted and balanced i dont know why but i suspected it had a lot to do with joys need to make me move heavy things the next morning joy and i went to the library to spy on joshua and balthasar while we redirected the librarys chi joy carried a complex brass instrument she called a chi clock which was supposed to be able to detect the flow of chi the magus was noticeably irritated as soon as we entered the room must this be done now joy bowed very sorry master but this is an emergency she turned and barked commands at me like a roman centurion move that table over there cant you see that it rests on the tigers testicles then point those chairs so they face the doorway they lie on the dragons navel were lucky someone hasnt broken a leg yeah lucky i said straining to move the huge carved table wishing that joy had recruited a couple of the other girls to help id been studying feng shui for more than three years now and i still couldnt detect the least bit of chi coming or going joshua had reconciled the elusive energy by saying that it was just an oriental way to express god all around us and in all things that may have helped him toward some sort of spiritual understanding but it was about as effective as trained sheep when it came to arranging furniture can i help joshua asked no shouted balthasar standing up we will continue in my quarters the old wizard turned and glared at joy and me and we are not to be disturbed under any circumstances he took joshua by the shoulder and led him out of the room so much for spying i said joy consulted the chi clock and patted a cabinet filled with calligraphy materials this most certainly rides on the horn of the ox it must be moved she pronounced they are gone i said we dont have to pretend at this anymore who is pretending that cabinet channels all the yin into the hall while the yang circles like a bird of prey joy stop it i know youre making this stuff up she dropped the brass instrument to her side i am not yes you are and here i thought id push my credibility a bit just to see i checked the yang in this room yesterday it is in perfect balance joy dropped to her hands and knees crawled under one of the huge carved dragon tables curled up into a ball and began to cry im no good at this balthasar wants us all to know it but ive never understood it if you want the elegant torture of a thousand pleasant touches i can do it you want someone poisoned castrated or blown up im your man but this feng shui stuff is just just stupid i supplied no i was going to say difficult now ive angered balthasar and we have no way of knowing what is happening between him and joshua and we must know i can find out i said polishing my nails on my tunic but i have to know why im finding out how will you find out i have ways that are more subtle and crafty than all your chinese alchemy and direction of energies now whos making things up id lost most of my credibility by dragging out the arcanehebrewknowledgeforsexualfavors ruse until i had actually claimed credit for receiving the tablets of the ten commandments as well as constructing the ark of the covenant what its not my fault joshua was the one who would never let me be moses when we were kids if i find out will you tell me what is going on the head concubine chewed at an elegantly lacquered nail as she thought about it you promise not to tell anyone if i tell you not even your friend joshua i promise then do what you will but remember your lessons from the art of war i considered the words of suntzu which joy had taught me be extremely subtle even to the point of formlessness be extremely mysterious even to the point of soundlessness thereby you can be the director of the opponents fate so after considering strategy carefully running and rejecting the various scenarios in my head working out what seemed a nearly foolproof plan and making sure the timing was perfect i went into action that very night as i lay in my bed and joshua in his i called forth all my powers of subtlety and mysteriousness hey josh i said balthasar sodomizing you no vice versa absolutely not you get the feeling hed like to he was quiet for a second then he said hes been very attentive lately and he giggles at everything i say why because joy says its not good if he falls in love with you well its not if hes expecting any sodomizing ill tell you that thats going to be one disappointed magus no worse than that she wont tell me what but its really really bad biff i realize you may not think so but from my way of thinking sodomizing the son of god is really really bad good point but i think she means something to do with whatever is behind the iron door until i find out you have to keep balthasar from falling in love with you ill bet he was myrrh said josh bastard he brings the cheapest gift and now he wants to sodomize me my mother told me the myrrh went bad after a week too did i mention that joshua was not a myrrh fan chapter meanwhile back at the hotel room raziel has given up his hopes to be a professional wrestler and has resumed his ambition to be spiderman he made the decision after i pointed out that in genesis jacob wrestles an angel and wins in short a human defeated an angel raziel kept insisting that he didnt remember that happening and i was tempted to bring the gideon bible in out of the bathroom and show him the reference but ive just started reading the gospel of mark and id lose the book if the angel found out about it i thought matthew was bad skipping right from joshuas birth to his baptism but mark doesnt even bother with the birth its as if joshua springs forth full grown from the head of zeus okay bad metaphor but you know what i mean mark begins with the baptism at thirty where did these guys get these stories i once met a guy in a bar who knew a guy whos sisters best friend was at the baptism of joshua bar joseph of nazareth and heres the story as best as he could remember it well at least mark mentions me once and then its totally out of context as if i was just sitting around doing nothing and joshua happened by and asked me to tag along and mark tells of the demon named legion yeah i remember legion compared to what balthasar called up legion was a wuss i asked balthasar if he was smitten with me joshua said over supper oh no said joy we were eating in the girls quarters it smelled really good and the girls would rub our shoulders while we ate just what we needed after a tough day of studying you werent supposed to let him know we were on to him what did he say he said that hed just come off of a hard breakup and he wasnt ready for a relationship because he just needed to spend a little time getting to know himself but that hed love it if we could just be friends he lies said joy he hasnt had a breakup in a hundred years i said josh you are so gullible guys always lie about stuff like that thats the problem with your not being allowed to know women it means you dont understand the most fundamental nature of men which is were lying pigs well say anything to get what we want thats true said joy the other girls nodded in agreement but said josh the superior man does not even for the space of a single meal act contrary to virtue according to confucius of course said i but the superior man can get laid without lying im talking about the rest of us so should i be worried about this trip he wants me to take with him joy nodded gravely and the other girls nodded with her i dont see why i said what trip he says well only be gone a couple of weeks he wants to go to a temple at a city in the mountains he believes that the temple was built by solomon its called the temple of the seal and why do you have to go along he wants to show me something uhoh i said uhoh echoed the girls not unlike a greek chorus except of course they were speaking chinese in the week leading up to joshua and balthasars departure i managed to talk pea pods into taking on a huge risk during her shift in balthasars bed i picked pea pods not because she was the most athletic and nimble of the girls which she was nor because she was the lightest of foot and most stealthy which she was also but because she was the one who had taught me to make bronze castings of the chinese characters that were the mark of my name my chop and she could be trusted to get the most accurate impression of the key that balthasar wore on the chain around his neck oh yes there was a key to the ironclad door joy had let it slip where balthasar kept it but i was sure that she was too loyal to him to steal it pea pods on the other hand was more fickle in her loyalties and lately i had been spending a lot of time with her on and off by the time you return ill know whats going on here i whispered to joshua as he climbed onto his camel find out what you can from balthasar i will but be careful dont do anything while im gone i think this trip whatever it is that we are going to see has something to do with the house of doom im just going to look around you be careful the girls and i stood at the top of the plateau and waved until joshua and the magus leading the extra camel loaded with supplies rode out of sight then one by one we made our way down the rope ladder to the passageway in the cliffs face the entrance to the passageway and the tunnel for perhaps thirty cubits were just wide enough for one man to pass through if he stooped and i always managed to bruise an elbow or a shoulder along the way which allowed me to show off my ability to curse in four languages by the time i got to the chamber of the elements where we practiced the art of the nine elixirs pea pods had the small furnace stoked to a red heat and was adding ingots of brass to a small stone crucible from the wax impression we had made a wax duplicate of the key from that wed made a plaster mold which wed fired to melt out the wax now wed have one chance to cast the key because once the metal cooled in the plaster mold the only way to release it was to break off the plaster when we broke off the mold pea pods held the end of what looked like a brass dragon on a stick thats some key i said the only locks id ever seen were big bulky iron boys nothing elegant enough for a key like this when are you going to use it asked pea pods her eyes went wide like those of an excited child times like that i almost fell in love with her but fortunately i was always distracted by joys sophistication pillows maternal fussing number sixs dexterity or any one of the other charms that were heaped upon me daily i understood completely balthasars strategy to keep from falling in love with any one of them joshuas situation on the other hand was harder to figure because he enjoyed spending time with the girls trading stories from the torah for legends of the storm dragons and the monkey king he said that there was an innate kindness born in women that hed never seen in a man and he liked being around them his strength in resisting their physical charms astounded me perhaps even more than the other miraculous things id seen him do over the years i couldnt relate to the act of raising someone from the dead but turning down a beautiful woman that took courage beyond my understanding ill take it from here i said to pea pods i didnt want her to be involved any further in case things didnt turn out well when asked pea pods meaning when would i attempt to open the door tonight when you have all gone to live in the world of pleasant dreams i tweaked her nose affectionately and she giggled it was the last time i ever saw her in one piece at night the halls of the fortress were lit by the ambient light from the moon and the stars that filtered in from the windows everywhere we went we carried a clay oil lamp which made the serpentine curves of the passageways seem even more like the inside of a huge creature as they swallowed up the dim orange light after several years with balthasar i could find my way through the main living quarters of the fortress without any light at all so i carried an unlit lamp with me until i had passed the girls quarters stopping at the beaded doorway to listen for their gentle snores once i was well away from the girls door i lit my lamp using one of the fire sticks that id invented using some of the same chemicals we used to make the explosive black powder the fire stick made a soft pop as i struck it on the stone wall and i could swear i heard it echo from the hall up ahead as i made my way to the ironclad door i could smell burning brimstone and i thought it strange that the smell of the fire stick had stayed with me then i saw joy standing by the door holding an oil lamp and the charred remains of the fire stick shed used to light it let me see the key she said what key dont be foolish i saw what was left of the mold in the room of the elements i took the key from where id tucked it in my belt and handed it to joy she examined it by lamplight turning it this way and that pea pods cast this she said matteroffactly did she take the impression as well i nodded joy didnt seem angry and pea pods was the only one of the girls skilled enough in metallurgy to have done the casting so why deny it getting the impression must have been the hard part joy said balthasar is fierce about guarding this key ill have to ask her what she did to distract him could be a good thing to know huh for both of us she smiled seductively then turned toward the door and pushed aside the brass plate that covered the keyhole in that second i felt as if a frozen dagger had been dragged over my spine no i grabbed her hand dont i was overcome with a feeling of revulsion that wrenched my insides we cant joy smiled again and pushed my hand away i have seen many wondrous things since i came here but there has never been anything that was harmful you planned this you must want to know what is in here as much as i do i wanted to stop her i even tried to take the key away from her but she grabbed my arm and pushed into a pressure point that made my whole left side go numb she raised an eyebrow as if to ask do you really want to try that knowing what i can do to you and i stepped back she put the dragon key into the lock and turned it three times there was a clicking of machinery finer than anything i had ever heard then she withdrew the key and shot the three heavy iron bolts as she pulled the door open there was a rush of air as if something had moved by us very quickly and my lamp went out joshua told me what had happened later and i put the timing together myself as joy and i were opening the room they called the house of doom joshua and balthasar were camped in the arid mountains of what is now afghanistan the night was crisp and the stars shone with a cold blue light like loneliness or infinity they had eaten some bread and cheese then settled in close to the fire to share the last of a flask of fortified wine balthasars second that evening have i told you of the prophecy that sent me in search of you when you were born joshua you spoke of the star my mother told me of the star yes the three of us followed that star and by chance we met up in the mountains east of kabul and finished the journey together but the star wasnt the reason we went it was only our means of navigation we made the journey because each of us was looking for something at the end me joshua said yes but not just you but what it is said was brought with you in the temple where we travel now there lies a set of clay tabletsvery oldthe priests say that they date back to the time of solomon and they foretell the coming of a child who will have power over evil and victory over death they say he will carry the key to immortality me immortality nope i think you do you just dont know it yet nope im sure said joshua its true that i have brought people back from the dead but never for very long ive gotten better at healing over the years but my backfromthedead stuff still needs work i need to learn more which is why i have taught you and why i am taking you to the temple now so you may read the tablets yourself but you must have the power of immortality within you no really i havent a clue i am two hundred and sixty years old joshua ive heard that but i still cant help you you look good though i mean for two hundred and sixty at this point balthasar started to sound desperate joshua i know that you have power over evil biff has told me of you banishing demons in antioch little ones joshua said modestly you must have power over death as well or it does me no good what i am able to do comes through my father i didnt bargain for it joshua i am preserved by a pact with a demon if you do not have the powers foretold in the prophecy i will never be free i will never have peace i will never have love every minute of my life i must have my will focused on controlling the demon should my will fail the destruction would be unlike anything the world has ever seen i know how it is im not allowed to know a woman joshua said although it was an angel that told me not a demon but still you know its hard sometimes i really like your concubines the other night pillows was giving me a back rub after a long day of studying and i started getting this massive by the golden tenderloin of the calf balthasar exclaimed leaping to his feet his eyes wide with terror the old man began loading his camel thrashing around in the darkness like a madman joshua was following him trying to calm him down fearing he might have a fit any second what what it is out the magus said help me pack up we must go back the demon is out i stood cringing in the dark waiting for disaster to fall for mayhem to reign for pain and pestilence and no good to manifest then joy struck a fire stick and lit our lamps we were alone the iron door hung open into a very small room it too lined with iron the entire room was just big enough to contain a small bed and a chair every span of the black iron walls was inlaid with golden symbols pentagrams and hex symbols and a dozen others i had never seen before joy held her lamp close to the wall these are symbols of containment joy said i used to hear voices coming from in here there was nothing in here when i opened the door i could see in the second before the lamp blew out then what blew it out the wind i dont think so i felt something brush me as it passed just then someone in the girls quarters screamed then a chorus of screams joined in primal screams of absolute terror and pain instantly joys eyes filled with tears what have i done i took her sleeve and dragged her down the passage toward the girls quarters snatching up two heavy lances that were supporting a tapestry as we passed and handing one to her as we rounded the curves i could see an orange light ahead and soon i could see that it was fire blazing on the stone walls from broken oil lamps the screaming was reaching a higher pitch but every few seconds a voice was removed from the chorus until there was only one as we approached the beaded doorway into the concubines chamber the screaming stopped and a severed human head rolled in front of us the creature stepped through the curtain oblivious to the flames that licked the walls around it its massive body filling the passageway the reptilian skin on its shoulders and its tall pointed ears grating against the walls and ceiling in its talonlike hand it held the bloody torso of one of the girls hey kid it said its voice like a sword point dragged across stone a yellow light coming from behind its dinnerplatesized cats eyes it took you long enough as they rode back to the fortress balthasar explained to joshua about the demon his name is catch and he is a demon of the twentyseventh order a destroyer angel before the fall as far as i could tell he was first called up to assist solomon in building the great temple but something got out of hand and with the help of a djinn solomon was able to send the demon back to hell i found the seal of solomon and the incantation for raising the demon almost two hundred years ago in the temple of the seal oh joshua said so thats why they call it that i thought it had something to do with one of the barky sea animals i had to become an acolyte and study with the priests there for years before i was allowed access to the seal but what is a few years against immortality i was given immortality but only so long as the demon walks the earth and as long as he is on earth he must be fed joshua thats the curse that goes with being this destroyers master he must be fed i dont understand he feeds on your will no he feeds on human beings it is only my will that keeps him in check or it was until i was able to build the iron room and put golden symbols on the wall that would hold the demon ive been able to keep him in the fortress i made him build for twenty years now and it has been some respite until then he was with me every minute everywhere i went didnt that attract enemies to you no unless he is in his eating form i am the only one who can see catch in his noneating form hes small the size of a child and he can do little harm except for being incredibly irritating when he feeds however hes fully ten cubits tall and he can tear a man in half with the swipe of his claw no enemies are not a problem joshua why do you think there are no guards at the fortress in those years before the girls came to live there some bandits attacked what happened to them is legend now in kabul and no one has tried since the problem is that if my will were to fail he would be set loose again on the world as he was in the time of solomon i dont know what could stop him and you cant send him back to hell joshua asked i can with the seal and the right incantation which is why i was going to the temple of the seal which is why you are here if you are the messiah predicted in isaiah and on the clay tablets in the temple then you are the direct descendant of david and therefore solomon i believe that you can send the demon back and keep me from suffering the fate of his return why what happens to you if he is sent back to hell i will assume the aspect of my true age which i would guess by this time would be dust but you have the gift of immortality you can stop that from happening so this demon from hell is loose and we are returning to the fortress without the seal of solomon or this incantation to do exactly what i hope to bring him back under control of my will the room has always held him before i didnt know i truly didnt know know what that my will had been broken by my feelings for you you love me how was i to know the magus sighed and joshua laughed here despite the dire circumstances of course you do but it is not me its what i represent i am not sure yet what i am to do but i know that i am here in the name of my father you love life so much that you would brave hell to hold on to it its only natural that you would love the one who gave you that life then you can banish the demon and preserve my life of course not im just saying that i understand how you feel i dont know where she found the strength but the diminutive joy came from behind me and hurled the heavy lance with as much power as any soldier i felt my own knees starting to buckle in the face of the demon the bronze tip of the lance seemed to find its way between two of the monsters armored chest scales and drove itself a span deep under the weight of the heavy shaft the demon gasped and roared opening his massive maw to show rows of sawedged teeth he grabbed the shaft of the lance and attempted to pull it out his huge biceps quivering with the strain he looked sadly down at the spear then at joy and said oh foul woe upon you you have kilt me most dead then he fell back and the floor shook with the impact of his huge body whatd he say whatd he say joy asked digging her nails into my shoulder the demon had spoken in hebrew he said that you killed him well duh said the concubine strangely enough duh sounds exactly the same in all languages i had started to inch forward to see if anyone was still alive in the girls quarters when the demon sat up just kidding he said im not kilt and he plucked the spear from his chest with less effort than it might take to brush away a fly i threw my own lance but didnt wait to see where it hit i grabbed joy and ran where she said far i said no she said grabbing my tunic and jerking me around a corner causing me to nearly coldcock myself on the wall to the cliff passage we were in total darkness now neither one of us having thought to grab a lamp and i was trusting my life to joys memory of these stone halls as we ran we could hear the demons scales scraping the walls and the occasional curse in hebrew as he found a low ceiling perhaps he could see in the dark somewhat but not a lot better than we could duck joy said pushing my head down as we entered the narrow passage that led to the cliff above i crouched in this passage the way the monster had to crouch to move in the normalsized halls and i suddenly realized the brilliance of joys choice in taking this route we were just seeing the moonlight breaking in through the opening in the cliffs face when i heard the monster hit the bottleneck of the passage fuck ouch you weasels im going to crunch your little heads between my teeth like candied dates whatd he say asked joy he says that you are a sweet of uncommon delicacy he did not say that believe me my translation is as close as you want to the truth i heard a horrible scraping noise from inside the passage as we climbed out on the ledge and up the rope ladder to the top of the plateau joy helped me up then pulled the ladder up behind us we ran to the stable where the camel saddles and other supplies were normally kept there were only the three camels that joshua and balthasar had taken and no horses so i couldnt figure out why we were taking the time to stop until i saw joy filling two water skins at the cistern behind the stable well never make it to kabul without water joy said and what happens when we make it to kabul can anyone there help what in the hell is that thing if i knew would i have opened that door she was remarkably calm for someone who had just lost her friends to a hideous beast i guess not but i didnt see it come out of there i felt something but nothing that size act biff dont think act she handed me a water skin and i held it in the cistern trying to listen for the sound of the monster over the bubbles as it filled all i could hear was the occasional bleating of the goats and the sound of my own pulse in my ears joy corked her water skin then went about opening the pig and goat pens shooing the animals out onto the plateau lets go she shouted to me she took off down the path toward the hidden road i pulled the water skin from the cistern and followed as quickly as i could there was enough moonlight to make traveling fairly easy but since i hadnt even seen the road in daylight i didnt want to try to negotiate its deadly cutbacks at night without a guide we had almost made the first leg of the road when we heard a hideous wailing and something heavy landed in the dust in front of us when i could get my breath again i stepped up to find the bloodied carcass of a goat there joy said pointing down the mountainside to something moving among the rocks then it looked up at us and there was no mistaking the glowing yellow eyes back joy said pulling me back from the road is that the only way down that or diving off the edge its a fortress rememberits not supposed to be easy to get in and out of we made our way back to the rope ladder tossed it over the side and started down as joy made it to the ledge and ducked into the cave something heavy hit me on the right shoulder my arm went numb with the impact and i let go of the ladder mercifully my feet had tangled in the rungs as i fell and i found myself hanging upside down looking into the cave entrance where joy stood i could hear the terrified goat that had hit me screaming as it fell into the abyss then there was a distant thump and the screaming stopped hey kid youre a jew arent you said the monster from above none of your business i said joy grabbed the ladder and pulled me inside the cave ladder and all just as another goat came screaming past i fell on my face in the dust and sputtered trying to breathe and spit at the same time its been a long time since ive eaten a jew a good jew sticks to your ribs thats the problem with chinese you eat six or seven of them and in a half hour youre hungry again no offense miss whatd he say joy asked he says he likes kosher food will that ladder hold him i made it myself swell i said we heard the ropes creak with the strain as the monster climbed onto the ladder chapter joshua and balthasar rode into kabul at a time of night when only cutthroats and whores were about the whores offering the cutthroat discount after midnight to promote business the old wizard had fallen asleep to the rhythm of his camels loping gait an act that nearly baffled joshua as much as the whole demon business as he spent most of his time on camelback trying not to upchuckseasickness of the desert they call it joshua flicked the old mans leg with the loose end of his camels bridle and the magus came awake snorting what is it are we there can you control the demon old man are we close enough for you to regain control balthasar closed his eyes and joshua thought that he might be going to sleep again except his hands began to tremble with some unseen effort after a few seconds he opened his eyes again i cant tell well you could tell that he was out that was like a wave of pain in my soul im not in intimate contact with the demon at all times we are probably too far away still horses joshua said theyll be faster lets go wake up the stable master joshua led them through the streets to the stable where we had boarded our camels when we came to town to heal the blinded bandit there were no lamps burning inside but a halfnaked whore posed seductively in the doorway special for cutthroats she said in latin two for one but no refunds if the old man cant do the business it had been so long since hed heard the language that it took joshua a second to respond thank you but were not cutthroats joshua said he stepped past her and pounded on the door she ran a fingernail down his back as he waited what are you maybe theres another special joshua didnt even look back hes a twohundredandsixtyyearold wizard and im either the messiah or a hopeless faker uh yeah i think there is a special rate for fakers but the wizard has to pay full price joshua could hear stirring inside of the stable masters house and a voice calling for him to hold his horses which is what stable masters always say when they make you wait joshua turned to the whore and touched her gently on the forehead go and sin no more he said in latin right and what do i do for a living then shovel shit just then the stable master threw open the door he was short and bowlegged and wore a long mustache that made him look like a driedup catfish what is so important that my wife couldnt handle it your wife the whore ran her nail across the back of joshuas neck as she passed him and stepped into the house missed your chance she said woman what are you doing out here anyway asked the stable master joy scurried out onto the landing and pulled a short broadbladed black dagger from the folds of her robe the ends of the rope ladder were swaying in front of her as the monster descended no joy i said reaching out to pull her back into the cave you cant hurt it dont be so sure she turned and grinned at me then ran the dagger twice over the thick ropes on one side leaving it attached by only a few fibers then she reached up a few rungs and sliced most of the way through the other side of the ladder i couldnt believe how easily shed cut through the rope she stepped back into the passageway and held the blade up so it caught the starlight glass she said from a volcano its a thousand times sharper than any edge on an iron blade she put the dagger away and pulled me back into the passageway just far enough so we could see the entrance and the landing i could hear the monster coming closer then a huge clawed foot appeared in silhouette in the entrance then the other foot we held our breath as the monster reached the cut section of the ladder nearly a whole massive thigh was visible now and one of his talonlike hands was reaching down for a new hold when the ladder snapped suddenly the monster hung sideways swinging from his hold on a single rope in front of the entrance he looked right at us the fury in his yellow eyes replaced for a moment by confusion his leathery bat ears rose in curiosity and he said hey then the second rope snapped and he plunged out of our view we ran out to the landing and looked over the edge it was at least a thousand feet to the floor of the valley we could only see several hundred feet down in the dark but it was several hundred feet of cliff face that was conspicuously monsterless nice i said to joy we need to go now you dont think that did it did you hear anything hit bottom no i said neither did i she said we had better get going wed left the water skins at the top of the plateau and joy wanted to grab some from the kitchen but i dragged her toward the front entrance by the collar we need to get as far away from here as we can dying of thirst is the least of my worries once we were in the main area of the fortress there was enough light to negotiate the hallways without a lamp which was good because i wouldnt let joy stop to light one as we rounded the stairway to the third level joy jerked me back almost off my feet and i turned around as mad as a cat what lets get out of here i screamed at her no this is the last level with windows im not going through the front door not knowing if that thing is outside it dont be ridiculous it would take a man on a fast horse a half hour to make it around from the other side but what if it didnt fall all the way what if it climbed back up that would take hours come on joy we could be miles away from here by the time he gets here from the other side no she swept my feet out from under me and i landed flat on my back on the stone floor by the time i was on my feet again she had run through the front chamber and was hanging out the window as i approached her she held her finger to her lips its down there waiting i pulled her aside and looked down sure enough the beast was looming in front of the iron door waiting to grab the edge in its claws and rip it open as soon as we threw the bolts maybe it cant get in i whispered it couldnt get through the other iron door you didnt understand the symbols all over that room did you i shook my head they were containment symbolsto contain a djinn or a demon the front door doesnt have any on it it wont hold him back so why isnt he coming in why chase us when we will come right to him just then the monster looked up and i threw myself back from the window i dont think he saw me i whispered spraying joy with spit then the monster began to whistle it was a happy tune lighthearted something like you might whistle while you were polishing the bleached skull of your latest victim im not stalking anyone or anything the monster said much louder than would have been required had he been talking to himself nope not me just standing here for a second oh well no one is here i guess ill be on my way he began to whistle again and we could hear footsteps getting quieter along with the whistling they werent moving away they were just getting quieter joy and i looked out the window to see the huge beast doing an exaggerated pantomime of walking just as his whistle fizzled what i shouted down angry now did you think we wouldnt look the monster shrugged it was worth a try i figured i wasnt dealing with a genius when you opened the door in the first place whatd he say whatd he say joy chanted behind me he said he doesnt think youre very smart tell him that im not the one who has spent all these years locked in the dark playing with myself i pulled back from the window and looked at joy do you think he could fit though this window she eyed the window yes then im not going to tell him it might make him angry joy pushed me aside stepped up on the windowsill turned around and faced me then pulled up her robe and peed backward out the window her balance was amazing from the growling below i gathered that her accuracy wasnt bad either she finished and jumped down i looked out the window at the monster who was shaking urine from its ears like a wet dog sorry i said language problem i didnt know how to translate the monster growled and the muscles in its shoulders tensed beneath the scales then it let loose with a punch that sent its fist completely through the iron skin of the door run joy said where the passage to the cliff you cut the ladder just run she pulled me along behind her guiding us through the dark as she had before duck she shouted just a second after i realized that wed entered the smaller passageway by using the sensitive stoneceilingsensing nerves in my forehead we made it halfway down the passageway to the cliff when i heard the monster hit and curse there was a pause then a horrible grinding noise so intense that we had to shield our ears from the assault then came the smell of burning flesh dawn broke just as joshua and balthasar rode into the canyon entrance to the fortress how about now joshua asked do you feel the demon now balthasar shook his head balefully were too late he pointed to where the great round door had once stood now it was a pile of bent and broken pieces hanging on what was left of the huge hinges what in the name of satan have you done joshua said he jumped off his horse and ran into the fortress leaving the old man to follow as best he could the noise in the narrow passageway was so intense that i cut pieces of cloth from my sleeves with joys dagger and stuffed them in our ears then i lit one of the fire sticks to see what the monster was doing joy and i stood there gapedjawed watching as the beast worried away at the stone of the passage his claws moving in a blur of speed throwing smoke and dust and stone shards into the air as he went his scales burning from the friction and growing back as fast as they burned away he hadnt come far perhaps five feet toward us but eventually he would widen the passage enough and pull us out like a badger digging termites out of the nest i could see now how the fortress had been built without tool marks the creature moved so quicklyliterally wearing away the walls with his claws and scalesthat the stone was polished as it was cut we had already made two ascents up what was left of the ladder to the top of the plateau only to have the monster come around and chase us back down it before we could get to the road the second time he pulled the ladder up then returned to the interior of the fortress to resume his hellish digging ill jump before ill let that thing get me i said to joy she looked over the edge of the cliff into the endless darkness below you do that she said let me know how it goes i will but first ill pray and i did i prayed so hard that beads of sweat popped out on my forehead and ran over my tightly closed eyes i prayed so hard that even the constant screeching of the monsters scales against the stone was drowned out for a moment there i was sure that it was just me and god as was his habit with me god remained quiet and i suddenly realized how frustrated joshua must have been asking always for a path to follow a course of action and being answered by nothing but silence when i opened my eyes again dawn had broken over the cliff and light was streaming into the passageway by full daylight the demon was even scarier there was blood and gore all over him from the massacre of the girls and even as he relentlessly wore away at the stone flies buzzed around him but as each tried to light on him it died instantly and fell to the floor the stench of rotting flesh and burning scales was almost overwhelming and that alone nearly sent me over the side of the cliff the beast was only three or four cubits out of reach from us and every few minutes he would rear back then throw his claw forward to try and grab at us joy and i huddled on the landing over the cliff face looking for any purchase any handhold that would get us away from the beast up down or sideways across the cliff face the fear of heights had suddenly become very minor i was beginning to be able to feel the breeze from the monsters talons as he lunged into the narrow opening at us when i heard balthasars deep bass shout from behind the beast the monster filled the whole opening so i couldnt see behind it but he turned around and his spadetipped tail whipped around us nearly lacerating our skin as it passed joy drew the glass knife from her robe and slashed at the tail nicking the scales but apparently not causing the monster enough trouble to turn around balthasar will tame you you son of a shiteating lizard joy screamed just then something came shooting through the opening and we ducked out of the way as it sailed into space and fell out of sight to the canyon floor screeching like a falcon on the dive what was that joy was trying to squint into infinity to see what the monster had thrown that was balthasar i said oops said joy joshua yanked the great spadetipped tail and the demon swung around with a ferocious snarl joshua held on to the tail even as the demons claws whistled by his face what is your name demon joshua said you wont live long enough to say it said the demon he raised his claw again to strike joshua yanked his tail and the demon froze no thats not right what is your name my name is catch said the demon dropping his arm to his side in surrender i know you youre the kid arent you they used to talk about you in the old days time for you to go home joshua said cant i eat those two outside on the ledge first no satan awaits you they are really irritating she peed on me no id be doing you a favor you dont want to hurt them now do you the demon laid his ears back and bowed his enormous head no i dont want to hurt them youre not angry anymore joshua said the monster shook his head he was already bent nearly double in the narrow passage but now he prostrated himself before joshua and covered his eyes with his claws well im still angry balthasar screamed joshua turned to see the old man covered with blood and dirt his clothes torn from where his broken bones had ripped through them on impact he was healed now only minutes after the fall but not much better for having made the trip you survived that fall i told you as long as the demon is on earth im immortal but that was a first hes never been able to hurt me before he wont again you have control over him because i dont joshua turned around and put his hand on the demons head this evil creature once beheld the face of god this monster once served in heaven obtained beauty lived in grace walked in light now he is the instrument of suffering he is hideous of aspect and twisted in nature hey watch it said the demon what i was going to say is that you cant blame him for what he is he has never had what you or any other human has had he has never had free will that is so sad said the demon one moment catch i will let you taste that which you have never known for one moment i will grant you free will the demon sobbed joshua took his hand from the demons head then dropped his tail and walked out of the narrow passageway into the fortress hall balthasar stood beside him waiting for the demon to emerge from the passageway are you really able to do that give him free will well see wont we catch crawled out of the passageway and stood up now just ducking his head great viscous tears rolled down his scaled cheeks over his jaws and dripped to the stone floor where they sizzled like acid thank you he growled free will balthasar said how does that make you feel the demon snatched up the old man like a rag doll and tucked him under his arm it makes me feel like throwing you off the fucking cliff again no said joshua he leapt forward and touched the demons chest in that instant the air popped as the vacuum where the demon had stood was filled balthasar fell to the floor and groaned well that free will thing wasnt such a great idea said balthasar sorry compassion got the better of me i dont feel well the magus said he sat down hard on the floor and let out a long dry rasp of breath joy and i came out of the passage to find joshua bent over balthasar who was actively aging as we looked on hes two hundred and sixty years old joshua said with catch gone his age is catching up the wizards skin had gone ashen and the whites of his eyes were yellow joy sat on the floor and gently cradled the old mans head in her lap wheres the monster i asked back in hell joshua said help me get balthasar to his bed ill explain later we carried balthasar to his bedchamber where joy tried to pour some broth into him but he fell asleep with the bowl at his lips can you help him i asked no one in particular joy shook her head hes not sick hes just old it is written to every thing there is a season joshua said i cant change the seasons balthasars time has come round at last then he looked at joy and raised his eyebrows you peed on the demon he had no right to complain before i came here i knew a man in hunan whod pay good money for that balthasar lingered for ten more days toward the end looking more like a skeleton wrapped in old leather than a man in his last days he begged joshua to forgive him his vanity and he called us to his bedside over and over to tell us the same things as he would forget what hed told us only a few hours before you will find gaspar in the temple of the celestial buddha in the mountains to the east there is a map in the library gaspar will teach you he is truly a wise man not a charlatan like me he will help you become the man you need to be to do what you must do joshua and biff well you might not turn out terrible its cold where you are going buy furs along the way and trade the camels for the woolly ones with two humps hes delirious i said joy said no there really are woolly camels with two humps oh sorry joshua balthasar called if nothing else remember the three jewels then the old man closed his eyes and stopped breathing he dead i asked joshua put his ear to the old mans heart hes dead what was that about three jewels the three jewels of the tao compassion moderation and humility balthasar said compassion leads to courage moderation leads to generosity and humility leads to leadership sounds wonky i said compassion joshua whispered nodding toward joy who was silently crying over balthasar i put my arm around her shoulders and she turned and sobbed into my chest what will i do now balthasar is dead all of my friends are dead and you two are leaving come with us joshua said uh sure come with us but joy did not come with us we stayed in balthasars fortress for another six months waiting for winter to pass before we went into the high mountains to the east i cleaned the blood from the girls quarters while joy helped joshua to translate some of balthasars ancient texts the three of us shared our meals and occasionally joy and i would have a tumble for old times sake but it felt as if the life had gone out of the place when it came time for us to leave joy told us of her decision i cant go with you to find gaspar women are not allowed in the monastery and i have no desire to live in the backwater village nearby balthasar has left me much gold and everything in the library but it does me no good out here in the mountains i will not stay in this tomb with only the ghosts of my friends for company soon ahmad will come as he does every spring and i will have him help me take the treasure and the scrolls to kabul where i will buy a large house and hire servants and i will have them bring me young boys to corrupt i wish i had a plan i said me too said josh the three of us celebrated joshuas eighteenth birthday with the traditional chinese food then the next morning joshua and i packed up the camels and prepared to head east are you sure youll be all right until ahmad comes joshua asked joy dont worry about me you go learn to be a messiah she kissed him hard on the lips he squirmed to get loose from her and he was still blushing as he climbed onto his camel and you she said to me you will come to see me in kabul on your way back to israel or i will put such a curse on you as youll never be free of it she took the little yingyang vial full of poison and antidote from around her neck and put it around mine it might have seemed a strange gift to anyone else but i was the sorceresss apprentice and it seemed perfect to me she tucked the black glass knife into my sash no matter how long it takes come back and see me i promise i wont paint you blue again i promised her and we kissed and i climbed on my camel and joshua and i rode off i tried not to look back once again to another woman who had stolen my heart we rode a half a furlong apart each of us considering the past and future of our lives who we had been and who we were going to be and it was a couple of hours before i caught up with joshua and broke the silence i thought of how joy had taught me to read and speak chinese to mix potions and poisons to cheat at gambling to perform slight of hand and where and how to properly touch a woman all of it without expecting anything in return are all women stronger and better than me yes he said it was another day before we spoke again part iii compassion torah torah torah war cry of the kamikaze rabbis chapter we were twelve days into our journey following balthasars meticulously drawn map when we came to the wall so i said what do you think of the wall its great said joshua its not that great i said there was a long line waiting to get through the giant gate where scores of bureaucrats collected taxes from caravan masters as they passed through the gatehouses alone were each as big as one of herods palaces and soldiers rode horses atop the wall patrolling far into the distance we were a good league back from the gate and the line didnt seem to be moving this is going to take all day i said why would they build such a thing if you can build a wall like this then you ought to be able to raise an army large enough to defeat any invaders laotzu built this wall joshua said the old master who wrote the tao i dont think so what does the tao value above all else compassion those other two jewel things no inaction contemplation steadiness conservatism a wall is the defense of a country that values inaction but a wall imprisons the people of a country as much as it protects them thats why balthasar had us go this way he wanted me to see the error in the tao one cant be free without action so he spent all that time teaching us the tao so we could see that it was wrong no not wrong not all of it the compassion humility and moderation of the tao these are the qualities of a righteous man but not inaction these people are slaves to inaction you worked as a stonecutter josh i said nodding toward the massive wall you think this wall was built through inaction the magus wasnt teaching us about action as in work it was action as in change thats why we learned confucius firsteverything having to do with the order of our fathers the law manners confucius is like the torah rules to follow and laotzu is even more conservative saying that if you do nothing you wont break any rules you have to let tradition fall sometime you have to take action you have to eat bacon thats what balthasar was trying to teach me ive said it before joshand you know how i love baconbut i dont think bacon is enough for the messiah to bring change joshua said a messiah has to bring change change comes through action balthasar once said to me theres no such thing as a conservative hero he was wise that old man i thought about the old magus as i looked at the wall stretching over the hills then at the line of travelers ahead of us a small city had grown up at the entrance to the wall to accommodate the needs of the delayed travelers along the silk road and it boiled with merchants hawking food and drink along the line screw it i said this is going to take forever how long can it be lets go around a month later when we had returned to the same gate and we were standing in line to get through joshua asked so what do you think of the wall now i mean now that weve seen so much more of it i think its ostentatious and unpleasant i said if they dont have a name for it you should suggest that and so it came to pass that through the ages the wall was known as the ostentatious and unpleasant wall of china at least i hope thats what happened its not on my friendly flyer miles map so i cant be sure we could see the mountain where gaspars monastery lay long before we reached it like the other peaks around it it cut the sky like a huge tooth below the mountain was a village surrounded by high pasture we stopped there to rest and water our camels the people of the village all came out to greet us and they marveled at our strange eyes and joshuas curly hair as if we were gods that had been lowered out of the heavens which i guess was true in joshs case but you forget about that when youre around someone a lot an old toothless woman who spoke a dialect of chinese similar to the one we had learned from joy convinced us to leave the camels in the village she traced the path up the mountain with a craggy finger and it was obvious that the path was both too narrow and too steep to accommodate the animals the villagers served us a spicy meat dish with frothy bowls of milk to wash it down i hesitated and looked at joshua the torah forbade us to eat meat and dairy at the same meal im thinking this is a lot like the bacon thing joshua said i really dont feel that the lord cares if we wash down our yak with a bowl of milk yak thats what this is the old woman told me well sin or not im not eating it ill just drink the milk its yak milk too im not drinking it use your own judgment it served you so well in the past like oh when you decided we should go around the wall you know i said weary of having the whole wall thing brought up again i never said you could use sarcasm whenever you wanted to i think youre using my invention in ways that it was never intended to be used like against you see see what i mean we left the village early the next morning carrying only some rice balls our waterskins and what little money we had left we left our three camels in the care of the toothless old woman who promised to take care of them until we returned i would miss them they were the spiffy doublehumpers wed picked up in kabul and they were comfortable to ride but more important none of them had ever tried to bite me theyre going to eat our camels you know we wont be gone an hour before one of them is turning on a spit they wont eat the camels joshua forever believing in the goodness of human beings they dont know what they are they think that theyre just tall food theyre going to eat them the only meat they ever get is yak you dont even know what a yak is do too i said but the air was getting thin and i was too tired to prove myself at the time the sun was going down behind the mountains when we finally reached the monastery except for a huge wooden gate with a small hatch in it it was constructed entirely of the same black basalt as the mountain on which it stood it looked more like a fortress than a place of worship makes you wonder if all three of your magi live in fortresses doesnt it hit the gong said joshua there was a bronze gong hanging outside the door with a padded drumstick standing next to it and a sign in a language that we couldnt read i hit the gong we waited i hit the gong again and we waited the sun went down and it began to get very cold on the mountainside i rang the gong three times loud we ate our rice balls and drank most of our water and waited i pounded the bejezus out of the gong and the hatch opened a dim light from inside the gate illuminated the smooth cheeks of a chinese man about our age what he said in chinese we are here to see gaspar i said balthasar sent us gaspar sees no one your aspect is dim and your eyes are too round he slammed the little hatch this time joshua pounded on the gong until the monk returned let me see that drumstick the monk said holding his hand out through the little port joshua gave him the drumstick and stepped back go away and come back in the morning the monk said but weve traveled all day joshua said were cold and hungry life is suffering the monk said he slammed the little door leaving us in almost total darkness maybe thats what youre supposed to learn i said lets go home no we wait said joshua in the morning after joshua and i had slept against the great gate huddled together to conserve warmth the monk opened the little hatch you still here he couldnt see us as we were directly below the window yes i said can we see gaspar now he craned his neck out the hatch then pulled it back in and produced a small wooden bowl from which he poured water on our heads go away your feet are misshapen and your eyebrows grow together in a threatening way but he slammed the hatch and so we spent the day outside the gate me wanting to go down the mountain joshua insisting that we wait there was frost in our hair when we woke the next morning and i felt my very bones aching the monk opened the hatch just after first light you are so stupid that the village idiots guild uses you as a standard for testing said the monk actually im a member of the village idiots guild i retorted in that case said the monk go away i cursed eloquently in five languages and was beginning to tear at my hair in frustration when i spotted something large moving in the sky overhead as it got closer i saw that it was the angel wearing his aspect of black robe and wings he carried a flaming bundle of sticks and pitch which trailed a trail of flames and thick black smoke behind him in the sky when he had passed over us several times he flew off over the horizon leaving a smoky pattern of chinese characters that spelled out a message across the sky surrender dorothy i was just fuckin with you as balthasar used to say raziel didnt really write surrender dorothy in the sky the angel and i watched the wizard of oz together on television last night and the scene at the gates of oz reminded me of when joshua and i were at the monastery gate raziel said he identified with glinda good witch of the north i would have thought flying monkey but i believe his choice was a blond one i have to admit that i felt some sympathy for the scarecrow although i dont believe i would have been singing about the lack of a brain in fact amid all the musical laments over not having a heart a brain or the nerve did anyone notice that they didnt have a penis among them i think it would have shown on the lion and the tin man and when the scarecrow has his pants destuffed you dont see a flying monkey waving an errant straw johnson around anywhere do you i think i know what song id be singing oh i would while away the hours wanking in the flowers my heart all full of song id be gilding all the lilies as i waved about my willie if i only had a schlong and suddenly it occurred to me as i composed the above opus that although raziel had always seemed to have the aspect of a male i had no idea if there were even genders among the angels after all raziel was the only one id ever seen i leapt from my chair and confronted him in the midst of an afternoon looney tunes festival raziel do you have equipment equipment a package a taliwacker a unit a dickdo you have one no said the angel perplexed that i would be asking why would i need one for sex dont angels have sex well yes but we dont use those so there are female angels and male angels yes and you have sex with female angels correct with what do you have sex female angels i just told you no do you have a sex organ yes show me i dont have it with me oh i realized that there are some things id really rather not know about anyway he didnt write in the sky and in fact we didnt see raziel again but the monks did let us into the monastery after three days they said that they made everybody wait three days it weeded out the insincere the entire twostory structure that was the monastery was fashioned of rough stone none larger than could have been lifted into place by a single man the rear of the building was built right into the mountainside the structure seemed to have been built under an existing overhang in the rock so there was minimal roofing exposed to the elements what did show was made of terracotta tiles that lay on a steep incline obviously to shed any buildup of snow a short and hairless monk wearing a saffroncolored robe led us across an outer courtyard paved with flagstone through an austere doorway into the monastery the floor inside was stone and though immaculately clean it was no more finished than the flagstone of the courtyard there were only a few windows more like arrow slits cut high in the wall and little light penetrated the interior once the front door was closed the air was thick with incense and filled with a buzzing chorus of male voices producing a rhythmic chant that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once and made it seem as if my ribs and kneecaps were vibrating from the inside whatever language they were chanting in i didnt understand but the message was clear these men were invoking something that transcended this world the monk led us up a narrow stairway into a long narrow corridor lined with open doorways no higher than my waist as we passed i could see that these must be the monks cells and each was just large enough to accommodate a small man lying down there was a woven mat on the floor and a woolen blanket rolled up at the top of each cell but there was no evidence of personal possessions nor storage for any there were no doors to close for privacy in short it was very much like what i had grown up with which didnt make me feel any better about it nearly five years of the relative opulence at balthasars fortress had spoiled me i yearned for a soft bed and a halfdozen chinese concubines to handfeed me and rub my body with fragrant oils well i said i was spoiled at last the monk led us into a large open chamber with a high stone ceiling and i realized that we were no longer in a manmade structure but a large cave at the far end of the cave was a stone statue of a man seated crosslegged his eyes closed his hands before him with the first fingers and thumbs forming closed circles lit by the orange light of candles a haze of incense smoke hanging about his shaved head he appeared to be praying the monk our guide disappeared into the darkness at the sides of the cave and joshua and i approached the statue cautiously stepping carefully across the rough floor of the cave we had long since lost our surprise and outrage at graven images the world at large and the art we had seen in our travels served to dampen even that grave commandment bacon joshua said when i asked him about it this great room was the source of the chanting we had been hearing since entering the monastery and after seeing the monks cells we determined that there must be at least twenty monks adding their voices to the droning although the way the cave echoed it might have been one or a thousand as we approached the statue trying to ascertain what sort of stone it was made from it opened its eyes is that you joshua it said in perfect aramaic yes said joshua and who is this this is my friend biff now he will be called twentyone when he needs to be called and you shall be twentytwo while you are here you have no name the statue wasnt a statue of course it was gaspar the orange light of the candles and his complete lack of motion or expression had only made him appear to be made of stone i suppose we were also thrown off because we were expecting a chinese this man looked as if he was from india his skin was even darker than ours and he wore the red dot on his head that we had seen on indian traders in kabul and antioch it was difficult to tell his age as he had no hair or beard and there wasnt a line in his face hes the messiah i said the son of god you came to see him at his birth still no expression from gaspar he said the messiah must die if you are to learn kill him tomorrow scuse me i said tomorrow you will learn feed them said gaspar another monk who looked almost identical to the first monk came out of the dark and took joshua by the shoulder he led us out of the chapel chamber and back to the cells where he showed joshua and me our accommodations he took our satchels away from us and left he returned in a few minutes with a bowl of rice and a cup of weak tea for each of us then he went away having said nothing since letting us in chatty little guy i said joshua scooped some rice into his mouth and grimaced it was cold and unsalted should i be worried about what he said about the messiah dying tomorrow do you think you know how youve never been completely sure whether you were the messiah or not yeah tomorrow if they dont kill you first thing in the morning tell them that the next morning number seven monk awakened joshua and me by whacking us in the feet with a bamboo staff to his credit number seven was smiling when i finally got the sleep cleared from my eyes but that was really a small consolation number seven was short and thin with high cheekbones and widely set eyes he wore a long orange robe woven from rough cotton and no shoes he was cleanshaven and his head was also shaved except for a small tail that grew out at the crown and was tied with a string he looked as if he could be anywhere from seventeen to thirtyfive years old it was impossible to tell should you wonder about the appearance of monks two through six and eight through twenty just imagine number seven monk nineteen times or at least thats how they appeared to me for the first few months later im sure except that we were taller and roundeyed joshua and i or monks twentyone and twentytwo would have fit the same description when one is trying to shed the bonds of ego a unique appearance is a liability thats why they call it a uniform but alas im getting ahead of myself number seven led us to a window that was obviously used as a latrine waited while we used it then took us to a small room where gaspar sat his legs crossed in a seemingly impossible position with a small table before him the monk bowed and left the room and gaspar asked us to sit down again in our native aramaic we sat across from him on the floorno thats not right we didnt actually sit we lay on the floor on our sides propped up on one elbow the way we would have been at the low tables at home we sat after gaspar produced a bamboo staff from under the table and with a motion as fast as a striking cobras whacked us both on the side of the head with it i said sit he said then we sat jeez i said rubbing the knot that was swelling over my ear listen gaspar said holding the stick up to clarify exactly what he meant we listened as if they were going to discontinue sound any second and we needed to stock up i think i even stopped breathing for a while good said gaspar laying the stick down and pouring tea into three simple bowls on the table we looked at the tea sitting there steamingjust looked at it gaspar laughed like a little boy all the graveness and authority from a second ago gone from his face he could have been a benevolent older uncle in fact except for the obviously indian features he reminded me a lot of joseph joshuas stepfather no messiah gaspar said switching to chinese now do you understand yes joshua and i said in unison in an instant the bamboo stick was in his hand and the other end was bouncing off of joshuas head i covered my own head with my arms but the blow never came did i strike the messiah gaspar asked joshua joshua seemed genuinely perplexed he paused rubbing the spot on his head when another blow caught him over his other ear the sound of the impact sharp and harsh in the small stone room did i strike the messiah gaspar repeated joshuas dark brown eyes showed neither pain nor fear just confusion as deep as the confusion of a calf who has just had its throat cut by the temple priest the stick whistled through the air again but this time i caught it in midswing wrenched it out of gaspars hand and tossed it out the narrow window behind him i quickly folded my hands and looked at the table in front of me begging your pardon master i said but if you hit him again ill kill you gaspar stood but i was afraid to look at him or joshua for that matter ego said the monk he left the room without another word joshua and i sat in silence for a few minutes thinking and rubbing our goose eggs well it had been an interesting trip and all but joshua wasnt very well going to learn much about being the messiah from someone who hit him with a stick whenever it was mentioned and that i supposed was the reason we were there so onward i drank the bowl of tea in front of me then the one that gaspar had left two wise men down one to go i said wed better find some breakfast if were going to travel joshua looked at me as perplexed as he had at gaspar a few minutes before do you think he needs that stick number seven monk handed us our satchels bowed deeply then went back into the monastery and closed the door leaving joshua and me standing there by the gong it was a clear morning and we could see the smoke of cook fires rising from the village below we should have asked for some breakfast i said this is going to be a long climb down im not leaving josh said youre kidding i have a lot more to learn here like how to take a beating maybe im not sure gaspar will let me back in he didnt seem too pleased with me you threatened to kill him i did not i warned that id kill him big difference so youre not going to stay and there it was the question was i going to stay with my best friend eat cold rice sleep on a cold floor take abuse from a mad monk and very likely have my skull split open or was i going to go go where home back to kabul and joy despite the long journey it seemed easier to go back the way i had come at least some level of familiarity would be waiting there but if i was making easy choices why was i there in the first place are you sure you have to stay here josh cant we go find melchior i know i have things to learn here joshua picked up the drumstick and rang the gong in a few minutes the little port opened in the door and a monk we had never seen before stuck his face in the opening go away your nature is dense and your breath smells like a yaks ass he slammed the hatch joshua rang the gong again i dont like that whole thing about killing the messiah i cant stay here joshua not if hes going to hit you i have a feeling im going to get hit quite a few more times until i learn what he needs me to know i have to go yes you do but i could stay no trust me you have to leave me now so you wont later ill see you again he turned away from me and faced the door oh you dont know anything else but you know that all of a sudden yes go biff goodbye i walked down the narrow path and nearly stumbled over a precipice when i heard the hatch in the door open where are you going shouted the monk home i said good go frighten some children with your glorious ignorance i will i tried to keep my shoulders steady as i walked away but it felt like someone was ripping my soul through the muscles of my back i would not turn around i vowed and slowly painfully i made my way down the path convinced that i would never see joshua again chapter ive settled into some sort of droning routine here at the hotel and in that way it reminds me of those times in china my waking hours are filled with writing these pages watching television trying to irritate the angel and sneaking off to the bathroom to read the gospels and i think its the latter thats sent my sleeping hours into a landscape of nightmare that leaves me spent even when i wake ive finished mark and again this fellow talks of a resurrection of acts beyond the time of my and joshuas death its a similar story to that told by the matthew fellow the events jumbled somewhat but basically the story of joshuas ministry but its the telling of the events of that last week of passover that chills me the angel hasnt been able to keep the secret that joshuas teachings survived and grew to vast popularity hes stopped even changing the channel at the mention of joshua on television as he did when we first arrived but is this the book from which joshuas teachings are drawn i dream of blood and suffering and loneliness so empty that an echo cant survive and i wake up screaming soaked in my own sweat and even after im awake the loneliness remains for a while last night when i awoke i thought i saw a woman standing at the end of my bed and beside her the angel his black wings spread and touching the walls of the room on either side then before i could get my wits about me the angel wrapped his wings around the woman and she disappeared in the darkness of them and was gone i think i really woke up then because the angel was lying there on the other bed staring into the dark his eyes like black pearls catching the red blinking aircraft lights that shone dimly through the window from the tops of the buildings across the street no wings no black robe no woman just raziel staring nightmare the angel asked memory i said had i been asleep i remember that same red blinking light ever so dim playing on the cheekbone and the bridge of the nose of the woman in my nightmare it was all i could see of her face and those elegant contours fit into the recesses of my memory like a key in the tumblers of a lock releasing cinnamon and sandalwood and a laugh sweeter than the best day of childhood two days after i had walked away i rang the gong outside the monastery and the little hatch opened to reveal the face of a newly shaven monk the skin of his bald scalp still a dozen shades lighter in color than that of his face what he said the villagers ate our camels i said go away your nostrils flare in an unpleasant manner and your soul is somewhat lumpy joshua let me in i dont have anywhere to go i cant just let you in josh whispered you have to wait three days like everyone else then loudly and obviously for someone insides benefit he said you appear to be infested by bedouins now go away and he slammed the hatch i stood there and waited in a few minutes he opened the hatch infested by bedouins i said give me a break im new did you bring food and water to last you yes the toothless woman sold me some dried camel meat there was a special thats got to be unclean said josh bacon joshua remember oh yeah sorry ill try to sneak some tea and a blanket out to you but it wont be right away then gaspar will let me back in he was perplexed why you left in the first place he said if anyone needed to learn some discipline well you know therell be punishment i think sorry i left you you didnt he grinned looking sillier than normal with his twotoned head ill tell you one thing ive learned here already whats that when im in charge if someone knocks they will be able to come in making someone who is seeking comfort stand out in the cold is a crock of rancid yak butter amen i said josh slammed the little hatch obviously the prescribed way of closing it i stood and wondered how joshua when he finally learned how to be the messiah would work the phrase crock of rancid yak butter into a sermon just what we jews needed i thought more dietary restrictions the monks stripped me naked and poured cold water over my head then brushed me vigorously with brushes made from boars hair then poured hot water on me then scrubbed then cold water until i screamed for them to stop at that point they shaved my head taking generous nicks out of my scalp as they did so rinsed away the hair that stuck to my body and handed me a fresh orange robe a blanket and a wooden rice bowl later i was given a pair of slippers woven from some sort of grass and i made myself some socks from woven yak hair but this was the measure of my wealth for six years a robe a blanket a bowl some slippers and some socks as monk number eight led me to meet with gaspar i thought of my old friend bartholomew and how much he would have loved the idea of my newfound austerity he often told of how his cynic patriarch diogenes carried a bowl with him for years but one day saw a man drinking from his cupped palm and declared i have been a fool burdened all these years by the weight of a bowl when a perfectly good vessel lay at the end of my wrist yeah well thats all well and good for diogenes but when it was all i had if anyone had tried to take my bowl they would have lost the vessel at the end of their wrist gaspar sat on the floor in the same small room eyes closed hands folded on his knees before him joshua sat facing him in the same position number eight monk bowed out of the room and gaspar opened his eyes sit i did these are the four rules for which you may be expelled from the monastery one a monk will have no sexual intercourse with anyone even down to an animal joshua looked at me and cringed as if he expected me to say something that would anger gaspar i said right no intercourse two a monk whether in the monastery or in the village shall take no thing that is not given three if a monk should intentionally take the life of a human or one like a human either by his hand or by weapon he will be expelled one like a human i asked you shall see said gaspar four a monk who claims to have reached superhuman states or claims to have attained the wisdom of the saints having not done so will be expelled do you understand these four rules yes i said joshua nodded understand that there are no mitigating circumstances if you commit any of these offenses as judged by the other monks you must leave the monastery again i said yes and then gaspar went into the thirteen rules for which a monk could be suspended from the monastery for a fortnight the first of these was the heartbreaker no emission of semen except in a dream and then the ninety offenses for which one would receive an unfavorable rebirth if the sins were not repented these ranged from destroying any kind of vegetation or deliberately depriving an animal of life to sitting in the open with a woman or claiming to a layman to have superhuman powers even if you had them overall there was an extraordinary number of rules over a hundred on decorum dozens for settling disputes but remember we were jews raised under the influence of the pharisees who judged virtually every event of daytoday life against the law of moses and with balthasar we had studied confucius whose philosophy was little more than an extensive system of etiquette i had no doubt joshua could do this and there was a chance i could handle it too if gaspar didnt use that bamboo rod too liberally and if i could conjure enough wet dreams hey i was eighteen years old and had just lived five years in a fortress full of available concubines i had a habit okay monk number twentytwo gaspar said to joshua you shall begin by learning how to sit i can sit i said and you number twentyone will shave the yak thats just an expression right it wasnt a yak is an extremely large extremely hairy buffalolike animal with dangerouslooking black horns if youve ever seen a water buffalo imagine it wearing a fullbody wig that drags the ground now sprinkle it with musk manure and sour milk youve got yourself a yak in a cavelike stable the monks kept one female yak which they let out during the day to wander the mountain paths to graze on what i dont know there didnt seem to be enough living plant life to support an animal of that size the yaks shoulder was higher than my head but there didnt seem to be enough plant life in all of judea for a herd of goats either and herding was one of the main occupations what did i know the yak provided just enough milk and cheese to remind the monks that they didnt get enough milk and cheese from one yak for twentytwo monks the animal also provided a long coarse wool which needed to be harvested twice a year this venerated duty along with combing the crap and grass and burrs out of the wool fell to me theres not much to know about yaks beyond that except for one important fact that gaspar felt i needed to learn through practice yaks hate to be shaved it fell to monks eight and seven to bandage me set my broken legs and arm and clean off the yak dung that had been so thoroughly stomped into my body i would tell you the distinction of those two solemn students if i could think of any but i cant the goal of all of the monks was to let go of the ego the self and but for a few more lines on the faces of the older men they looked alike dressed alike and behaved alike i on the other hand was quite distinct from the others despite my shaved head and saffron robe as i had bandages over half of my body and three out of four limbs splinted with bamboo after the yak disaster joshua waited until the middle of the night to crawl down the hall to my cell the soft snores of monks filled the halls and the soft turbulence of the bats that entered their cave through the monastery echoed off the stone walls like the death panting of epileptic shadows does it hurt joshua said sweat streamed from my face despite the chilly temperature i can hardly breathe seven and eight had wrapped my broken ribs but every breath was a knife in the side joshua put his hand on my forehead ill be all right josh you dont have to do that why wouldnt i he said keep your voice down in seconds my pain was gone and i could breathe again then i fell asleep or passed out from gratitude i dont know which when i awoke with the dawn joshua was still kneeling beside me his hand still pressed against my forehead he had fallen asleep there i carried the combed yak wool to gaspar who was chanting in the great cavern temple it amounted to a fairly large bundle and i set it on the floor behind the monk and backed away wait gaspar said holding a single finger in the air he finished his chant then turned to me tea he said he led and i followed to the room where he had received joshua and me when we had first arrived sit he said sit dont wait i sat and watched him make a charcoal fire in a small stone brazier using a bow and fire drill to start the flames first in some dried moss then blowing it onto the charcoal i invented a stick that makes fire instantly i said i could teach gaspar glared at me and held up the finger again to poke my words out of the air sit he said dont talk dont wait he heated water in a copper pot until it boiled then poured it over some tea leaves in an earthenware bowl he set two small cups on the table then proceeded to pour tea from the bowl hey doofus i yelled youre spilling the fucking tea gaspar smiled and set the bowl down on the table how can i give you tea if your cup is already full huh i said eloquently parables were never my strong suit if you want to say something say it so of course joshua and buddhists were the perfect people to hang out with straight talkers that they were gaspar poured himself some tea then took a deep breath and closed his eyes after perhaps a whole minute passed he opened them again if you already know everything then how will i be able to teach you you must empty your cup before i can give you tea why didnt you say so i grabbed my cup tossed the tea out the same window id tossed gaspars stick then plopped the cup back on the table im ready i said go to the temple and sit gaspar said no tea he was obviously still not happy about my almostthreat on his life i backed out of the door bowing a courtesy joy had taught me one more thing gaspar said i stopped and waited number seven said that you would not live through the night number eight agreed how is it that you are not only alive but unhurt i thought about it for a second before i answered something i seldom do then i said perhaps those monks value their own opinions too highly i can only hope that they have not corrupted anyone elses thinking go sit gaspar said sitting was what we did to learn to sit to be still and hear the music of the universe was why we had come halfway around the world evidently to let go of ego not individuality but that which distinguishes us from all other beings when you sit sit when you breathe breathe when you eat eat gaspar would say meaning that every bit of our being was to be in the moment completely aware of the now no past no future nothing dividing us from everything that is its hard for me a jew to stay in the moment without the past where is the guilt and without the future where is the dread and without guilt and dread who am i see your skin as what connects you to the universe not what separates you from it gaspar told me trying to teach me the essence of what enlightenment meant while admitting that it was not something that could be taught method he could teach gaspar could sit the legend went i pieced it together from bits dropped by the master and his monks that gaspar had built the monastery as a place to sit many years ago he had come to china from india where he had been born a prince to teach the emperor and his court the true meaning of buddhism which had been lost in years of dogma and overinterpretation of scripture upon arriving the emperor asked gaspar what have i attained for all of my good deeds nothing said gaspar the emperor was aghast thinking now that he had been generous to his people all these years for nothing he said well then what is the essence of buddhism vast amphibians said gaspar the emperor had gaspar thrown from the temple at which time the young monk decided two things one that he would have a better answer the next time he was asked the question and two that hed better learn to speak better chinese before he talked to anyone of importance hed meant to say vast emptiness but hed gotten the words wrong the legend went on to say that gaspar then came to the cave where the monastery was now built and sat down to meditate determined to stay there until enlightenment came to him nine years later he came down from the mountain and the people of the village were waiting for him with food and gifts master we seek your most holy guidance what can you tell us they cried i really have to pee said the monk and with that all of the villagers knew that he had indeed achieved the mind of all buddhas or no mind as we called it the villagers begged gaspar to stay with them and they helped him build the monastery at the site of the very cave where he had achieved his enlightenment during the construction the villagers were attacked many times by vicious bandits and although he believed that no being should be killed he also felt that these people should have a way to defend themselves so he meditated on the subject until he devised a method of selfdefense based on various movements he learned from the yogis in his native india which he taught to the villagers then to each of the monks as they joined the monastery he called this discipline kung fu which translates method by which short bald guys may kick the bejeezus out of you our training in kung fu began with the hopping posts after breakfast and morning meditation number three monk who seemed to be the oldest of the monks led us to the monastery courtyard where we found a stack of posts perhaps two feet long and about a spans width in diameter he had us set the posts on end in a straight line about a half a stride away from each other then he told us to hop up on one of the posts and balance there after both of us spent most of the morning picking ourselves up off the rough stone paving we each found ourselves standing on one foot on the end of a pole now what i asked now nothing number three said just stand so we stood for hours the sun crossed the sky and my legs and back began to ache and we fell again and again only to have number three bark at us and tell us to jump back up on the post when darkness began to fall and we both had stood for several hours without falling number three said now hop to the next post i heard joshua sigh heavily i looked at the line of posts and could see the pain that lay ahead if we were going to have to hop this whole gauntlet joshua was next to me at the end of the line so he would have to hop to the post i was standing on not only would i have to jump to the next post and land without falling but i would have to make sure that my takeoff didnt knock over the post i was leaving now said number three i leapt and missed the landing the post tipped out from under me and i hit the stone headfirst sending a white flash before my eyes and a bolt of fire down my neck before i could gather my wits joshua tumbled over on top of me thank you he said grateful to have landed on a soft jew rather than hard flagstone back up number three said we set up our posts again then hopped up on them again this time both of us made it on the first try then we waited for the command to take the next leap the moon rose high and full and we both stared down the row of poles wondering how long it would take us before we could hop the whole row wondering how long number three would make us stay there thinking about the story of how gaspar had sat for nine years i couldnt remember ever having felt so much pain which is saying something if youve been yakstomped i was trying to imagine just how much fatigue and thirst i could bear before i fell when number three said enough go sleep thats it joshua asked as he hopped off his post and winced upon landing why did we set up twenty posts if we were only going to use three why were you thinking of twenty when you can only stand on one answered three i have to pee i said exactly said the monk so there you have it buddhism each day we went to the courtyard and arranged the posts differently randomly number three added posts of different heights and diameters sometimes we had to hop from one post to the other as quickly as possible other times we stood in one place for hours ready to move in an instant should number three command it the point it seemed was that we could not anticipate anything nor could we develop a rhythm to the exercise we were forced to be ready to move in any direction without forethought number three called this controlled spontaneity and for the first six months in the monastery we spent as much time atop the posts as we did in sitting meditation joshua took to the kung fu training immediately as he did to the meditation i was as the buddhists say more dense in addition to the normal duties of tending the monastery our gardens and milking the yak mercifully a task i was never assigned every ten days or so a group of six monks would go to the village with their bowls and collect alms from the villagers usually rice and tea sometimes dark sauces yak butter or cheese and on rare occasions cotton fabric from which new robes would be made for the first year joshua and i were not allowed to leave the monastery at all but i started to notice a pattern of strange behavior after each trip to the village for alms four or five monks would disappear into the mountains for several days nothing was ever said of it either when they left or when they returned but it seemed that there was some sort of rotation with each monk only leaving every third or fourth time with the exception of gaspar who left more often finally i worked up the courage to ask gaspar what was going on and he said it is a special meditation you are not ready go sit gaspars answer to most of my questions was go sit and my resentment meant that i wasnt losing the attachment to my ego and therefore i wasnt going anywhere in my meditation joshua on the other hand seemed completely at peace with what we were doing he could sit for hours not moving and then perform the exercise on the posts as if hed spent an hour limbering up how do you do it i asked him how do you think of nothing and not fall asleep that had been one of the major barriers to my enlightenment if i sat still for too long i fell asleep and evidently the sound of snoring echoing through the temple disturbed the meditations of the other monks the recommended cure for this condition was to drink huge quantities of green tea which did indeed keep me alert but also replaced my no mind state with constant thoughts of my bladder in fact in less than a year i attained total bladder conciousness joshua on the other hand was able to completely let go of his ego as he had been instructed it was in our ninth month at the monastery in the midst of the most bitter winter i can even imagine when joshua having let go of all constructions of self and vanity became invisible chapter i have been out among you eating and talking and walking and walking and walking for hours without having to turn because of a wall in my way the angel woke me this morning with a new set of clothes strange to the feel but familiar to the sight from television jeans sweatshirt and sneakers as well as some socks and boxer shorts put these on im taking you out for a walk said raziel as if i were a dog i said exactly as if you were a dog the angel was also wearing modern american garb and although he was still strikingly handsome he looked so uncomfortable that the clothes might have been held to his body with flaming spikes where are we going i told you out where did you get the clothes i called down and jesus brought them up there is a clothing store in the hotel come now raziel closed the door behind us and put the room key in his jeans pocket with the money i wondered if hed ever had pockets before i wouldnt have thought to use them i didnt say a word as we rode the elevator down to the lobby and made our way out the front doors i didnt want to ruin it to say something that would bring the angel to his senses the noise in the street was glorious the cars the jackhammers the insane people babbling to themselves the light the smells i felt as if i must have been in shock when we first traveled here from jerusalem i didnt remember it being so vivid i started to skip down the street and the angel caught me by the shoulder his fingers dug into my muscles like talons you know that you cant get away that if you run i can catch you and snap your legs so you will never run again you know that if you should escape even for a few minutes you cannot hide from me you know that i can find you as i once found everyone of your kind you know these things yes let go of me lets walk i hate walking have you ever seen an eagle look at a pigeon thats how i feel about you and your walking i should point out i suppose what raziel was talking about when he said that he once found everyone of my kind it seems that he did a stint centuries ago as the angel of death but was relieved of his duties because he was not particularly good at them he admits that hes a sucker for a hardluck story perhaps that explains his fascination with soap operas anyway when you read in the torah about noah living to be nine hundred and moses living to be a hundred and forty well guess who led the chorus line in the off this mortal coil shuffle thats where he got the blackwinged aspect that ive talked about before even though they fired him they let him keep the outfit can you believe that noah was able to postpone death for eight hundred years by telling the angel that he was behind in his paperwork would that raziel could be that incompetent at his current task look raziel pizza i pointed to a sign buy us pizza he took some money out of his pocket and handed it to me you do it you can do it right yes we had commerce in my time i said sarcastically we didnt have pizza but we had commerce good can you use that machine he pointed to a box that held newspapers behind glass if it doesnt open with that little handle then no the angel looked perturbed how is it that you can receive the gift of tongues and suddenly understand all languages and there is no gift that can tell you how things work in this time tell me that look maybe if you didnt hog the remote all the time i would learn how to use these things i meant that i could have learned more about the outside world from television but raziel thought i meant that i needed more practice pushing the channel buttons knowing how to use the television isnt enough you have to know how everything in this world works and with that the angel turned and stared through the window of the pizza place at the men tossing disks of dough into the air why raziel why do i need to know about how this world works if anything youve tried to keep me from learning anything not anymore lets go eat pizza raziel he wouldnt explain any further but for the rest of the day we wandered the city spending money talking to people learning in the late afternoon raziel inquired of a bus driver as to where we might go to meet spiderman i could have gone another two thousand years without seeing the kind of disappointment i saw on raziels face when the bus driver gave his answer we returned here to the room where raziel said i miss destroying cities full of humans i know what you mean i said even though it was my best friend who had caused that sort of thing to go out of fashion and not a moment too soon but the angel needed to hear it theres a difference between bearing false witness and saving someones feelings even joshua knew that joshua youre scaring me i said talking to the disembodied voice that floated before me in the temple where are you i am everywhere and nowhere joshuas voice said how come your voice is in front of me then i didnt like this at all yes my years with joshua had jaded me in regard to supernatural experiences but my meditation hadnt yet brought me to the place where i wouldnt react to my friend being invisible i suppose it is the nature of a voice that it must come from somewhere but only so that it may be let go gaspar had been sitting in the temple and at the sound of our voices he rose and came over to me he didnt appear to be angry but then he never did why gaspar said to me meaning why are you talking and disturbing everyones meditation with your infernal noise you barbarian joshua has attained enlightenment i said gaspar said nothing meaning so thats the idea you unworthy spawn of a razorburned yak i could tell thats what he meant by the tone in his voice so hes invisible mu joshuas voice said mu meaning nothing beyond nothingness in chinese in an act of distinctly uncontrolled spontaneity gaspar screamed like a little girl and jumped four feet straight in the air monks stopped chanting and looked up what was that thats joshua i am free of self free of ego joshua said there was a little squeak and then a nasty stench infused us i looked at gaspar and he shook his head he looked at me and i shrugged was that you gaspar asked joshua me in the sense that i am part of all things or me in the sense of i am the one who poofed the gefilte gas asked josh the latter said gaspar no said josh you lie i said as amazed at that as i was at the fact that i couldnt see my friend i should stop talking now having a voice separates me from all that is with that he was quiet and gaspar looked as if he were about to panic dont go away joshua the abbot said stay as you are if you must but come to the tea chamber at dawn tomorrow gaspar looked to me you come too i have to train on the poles in the morning i said you are excused gaspar said and if joshua talks to you anymore tonight try to persuade him to share our existence then he hurried off in a very unenlightened way that night i was falling asleep when i heard a squeak in the hall outside of my cell then an incredibly foul odor jolted me awake joshua i crawled out of my cell into the hall there were narrow slots high in the walls through which moonlight could sift but i saw nothing but faint blue light on the stone joshua is that you how could you tell joshuas disembodied voice said well honestly you stink josh the last time we went to the village for alms a woman gave number fourteen and me a thousandyearold egg it didnt sit well cant imagine why i dont think youre supposed to eat an egg after oh two hundred years or so they bury them leave them there then dig them up is that why i cant see you no thats because of my meditation ive let go of everything ive achieved perfect freedom youve been free ever since we left galilee its not the same thats what i came to tell you that i cant free our people from the rule of romans why not because thats not true freedom any freedom that can be given can be taken away moses didnt need to ask pharaoh to release our people our people didnt need to be released from the babylonians and they dont need to be released from the romans i cant give them freedom freedom is in their hearts they merely have to find it so youre saying youre not the messiah how can i be how can a humble being presume to grant something that is not his to give if not you who josh angels and miracles your ability to heal and comfort who else is chosen if not you i dont know i dont know anything i wanted to say goodbye ill be with you as part of all things but you wont perceive me until you become enlightened you cant imagine how this feels biff you are everything you love everything you need nothing okay you wont be needing your shoes then right possessions stand between you and freedom sounded like a yes to me do me one favor though okay of course listen to what gaspar has to say to you tomorrow and give me time to think up an intelligent answer to someone whos invisible and crazy i thought to myself joshua was innocent but he wasnt stupid i had to come up with something to save the messiah so he could save the rest of us im going to the temple to sit ill see you in the morning not if i see you first funny said josh gaspar looked especially old that morning when i met him in the tea room his personal quarters consisted of a cell no bigger than my own but it was located just off the tea room and had a door which he could close it was cold in the morning in the monastery and i could see our breath as gaspar boiled the water for tea soon i saw a third puff of breath coming from my side of the table although there was no person there good morning joshua gaspar said did you sleep or are you free from that need no i dont need sleep anymore said josh youll excuse twentyone and i as we still require nourishment gaspar poured us some tea and fetched two rice balls from a shelf where he kept the tea he held one out for me and i took it i dont have my bowl with me i said worried that gaspar would be angry with me how was i to know the monks always ate breakfast together this was out of order your hands are clean said gaspar then he sipped his tea and sat peacefully for a while not saying a word soon the room heated up from the charcoal brazier that gaspar had used to heat the tea and i was no longer able to see joshuas breath evidently hed also overcome the gastric distress of the thousandyearold egg i began to get nervous aware that number three would be waiting for joshua and me in the courtyard to start our exercises i was about to say something when gaspar held up a finger to mark silence joshua gaspar said do you know what a bodhisattva is no master i dont gautama buddha was a bodhisattva the twentyseven patriarchs since gautama buddha were also bodhisattvas some say that i myself am a bodhisattva but the claim is not mine there are no buddhas said joshua indeed said gaspar but when one reaches the place of buddhahood and realizes that there is no buddha because everything is buddha when one reaches enlightenment but makes a decision that he will not evolve to nirvana until all sentient beings have preceded him there then he is a bodhisattva a savior a bodhisattva by making this decision grasps the only thing that can ever be grasped compassion for the suffering of his fellow humans do you understand i think so said joshua but the decision to become a bodhisattva sounds like an act of ego a denial of enlightenment indeed it is joshua it is an act of selflove are you asking me to become a bodhisattva if i were to say to you love your neighbor as you love yourself would i be telling you to be selfish there was silence for a moment and as i looked at the place where joshuas voice was originating he gradually started to become visible again no said joshua why asked gaspar love thy neighbor as thou lovest thyselfand here there was a long pause when i could imagine joshua looking to the sky for an answer as he so often did then for he is thee and thou art he and everything that is ever worth loving is everything joshua solidified before our eyes fully dressed looking no worse for the wear gaspar smiled and those extra years that he had been carrying on his face seemed to fade away there was a peace in his aspect and for a moment he could have been as young as we were that is correct joshua you are truly an enlightened being i will be a bodhisattva to my people joshua said good now go shave the yak said gaspar i dropped my rice ball what and you find number three and commence your training on the posts let me shave the yak i said ive done it before joshua put his hand on my shoulder ill be fine gaspar said and on the next moon after alms you shall both go with the group into the mountains for a special meditation your training begins tonight you shall receive no meals for two days and you must bring me your blankets before sundown but ive already been enlightened protested josh good shave the yak said the master i suppose i shouldnt have been surprised when joshua showed up the next day at the communal dining room with a bale of yak hair and not a scratch on him the other monks didnt seem surprised in the least in fact they hardly looked up from their rice and tea in my years at gaspars monastery i found it was astoundingly difficult to surprise a buddhist monk especially one who had been trained in kung fu so alert were they to the moment that one had to become nearly invisible and completely silent to sneak up on a monk and even then simply jumping out and shouting boo wasnt enough to shake their chakras to get a real reaction you pretty much had to poleax one of them with a fighting staff and if he heard the staff whistling through the air there was a good chance hed catch it take it away from you and pound you into damp pulp with it so no they werent surprised when joshua delivered the fuzz harvest unscathed how i asked that being pretty much what i wanted to know i told her what i was doing said joshua she stood perfectly still you just told her what you were going to do yes she wasnt afraid so she didnt resist all fear comes from trying to see the future biff if you know what is coming you arent afraid thats not true i knew what was comingnamely that you were going to get stomped by the yak and that im not nearly as good at healing as you areand i was afraid oh then im wrong sorry she must just not like you thats more like it i said vindicated joshua sat on the floor across from me like me he wasnt permitted to eat anything but we were allowed tea hungry yes you starving how did you sleep last night without your blanket i mean it was cold but i used the training and i was able to sleep i tried but i shivered all night long its not even winter yet josh when the snow falls well freeze to death without a blanket i hate the cold you have to be the cold said joshua i liked you better before you got enlightened i said now gaspar started to oversee our training personally he was there every second as we leapt from post to post and he drilled us mercilessly through the complex hand and foot movements we practiced as part of our kung fu regimen i had a funny feeling that id seen the movements before as he taught them to us then i remembered joy doing her complex dances in balthasars fortress had gaspar taught the wizard or vice versa as we sat in meditation sometimes all through the night he stood behind us with his bamboo rod and periodically struck us on the back of the head for no reason i could discern whys he keep doing that i didnt do anything i complained to joshua over tea hes not hitting you to punish you hes hitting you to keep you in the moment well im in the moment now and at the moment id like to beat the crap out of him you dont mean that oh what im supposed to want to be the crap i beat out of him yes biff joshua said somberly you must be the crap but he couldnt keep a straight face and he started to snicker as he sipped his tea finally spraying the hot liquid out his nostrils and collapsing into a fit of laughter all of the other monks who evidently had been listening in started giggling as well a couple of them rolled around on the floor holding their sides its very difficult to stay angry when a room full of bald guys in orange robes start giggling buddhism gaspar made us wait two months before taking us on the special meditation pilgrimage so it was well into winter before we made that monumental trek snow fell so deep on the mountainside that we literally had to tunnel our way out to the courtyard every morning for exercise before we were allowed to begin joshua and i had to shovel all of the snow out of the courtyard which meant that some days it was well past noon before we were able to start drilling other days the wind whipped down out of the mountains so viciously that we couldnt see more than a few inches past our faces and gaspar would devise exercises that we could practice inside joshua and i were not given our blankets back so i for one spent every night shivering myself to sleep although the high windows were shuttered and charcoal braziers were lit in the rooms that were occupied there was never anything approaching physical comfort during the winter to my relief the other monks were not unaffected by the cold and i noticed that the accepted posture for breakfast was to wrap your entire body around your steaming cup of tea so not so much as a mote of precious heat might escape someone entering the dining hall seeing us all balled up in our orange robes might have thought he stumbled into a steaming patch of giant pumpkins at least the others including joshua seemed to find some relief from the chill during their meditations having reached that state im told where they could indeed generate their own heat i was still learning the discipline sometimes i considered climbing to the back of the temple where the cave became narrow and hundreds of fuzzy bats hibernated on the ceiling in a great seething mass of fur and sinew the smell might have been horrid but it would have been warm when the day finally came for us to take the pilgrimage i was no closer to generating my own heat than i had been at the start so i was relieved when gaspar led five of us to a cabinet and issued yakwool leggings and boots to each of us life is suffering said gaspar as he handed joshua his leggings but it is more expedient to go through it with ones legs intact we left just after dawn on a crystal clear morning after a night of brutal wind that had blown much of the snow off the base of the mountain gaspar led five of us down the mountain to the village sometimes we trod in the snow up to our waists other times we hopped across the tops of exposed stones suddenly making our training on the tops of the posts seem much more practical than i had ever thought possible on the mountainside a slip from one of the stones might have sent us plunging into a powderfilled ravine to suffocate under fifty feet of snow the villagers received us with great celebration coming out of their stone and sod houses to fill our bowls with rice and root vegetables ringing small brass bells and blowing the yak horn in our honor before quickly retreating back to their fires and slamming their doors against the cold it was festive but it was brief gaspar led us to the home of the toothless old woman who joshua and i had met so long ago and we all bedded down in the straw of her small barn amid her goats and a pair of yaks her yaks were much smaller than the one we kept at the monastery more the size of normal cattle i found out later that ours was the progeny of the wild yaks that lived in the high plateaus while hers were from stock that had been domesticated for a thousand years after the others had gone to sleep i snuck into the old womans house in search of some food it was a small stone house with two rooms the front one was dimly lit by a single window covered with a tanned and stretched animal hide that transmitted the light of the full moon as a dull yellow glow i could only make out shapes not actual objects but i felt my way around the room until i laid my hand on what had to be a bag of turnips i dug one of the knobby vegetables from the bag brushed the dirt from the surface with my palm then sunk in my teeth and crunched away a mouthful of crisp earthy bliss i had never even cared for turnips up to that time but i had just decided that i was going to sit there until i had transferred the entire contents of that bag to my stomach when i heard a noise in the back room i stopped chewing and listened suddenly i could see someone standing in the doorway between the two rooms i drew in my breath and held it then i heard the old womans voice speaking chinese with her peculiar accent to take the life of a human or one like a human to take a thing that is not given to claim to have superhuman powers i was slow but suddenly i realized that the old woman was reciting the rules for which a monk could be expelled from the monastery as she came into the dim light from the window she said to have intercourse with anyone even down to an animal and at that second i realized that the toothless old woman was completely naked a mouthful of chewed turnip rolled out of my mouth and down the front of my robe the old woman close now reached out i thought to catch the mess but instead she caught what was under my robe do you have superhuman powers the old woman said pulling on my manhood which much to my amazement nodded an answer i need to say here that it had been over two years since we had left balthasars fortress and another six months before that since the demon had come and killed all of the girls but joythus curtailing my regular supply of sexual companions i want to go on record that i had been steadfast in adhering to the rules of the monastery allowing only those nocturnal emissions as were expelled during dreams although i had gotten pretty good in directing my dreams in that direction so all that mental discipline and meditation wasnt completely useless so that said i was in a weakened state of resistance when the old woman leathery and toothless as she might have been compelled me by threat and intimidation to share with her what the chinese call the forbidden monkey dance five times imagine my chagrin when the man who would save the world found me in the morning with a twisted burl of chinese croneflesh orally affixed to my fleshy pagoda of expandable joy even as i snored away in transcendent turnipdigesting oblivion ahhhhhhhhhhh said joshua turning to the wall and throwing his robe over his head ahhhhhhhhhhh i said roused from my slumber by the disgusted exclamation of my friend ahhhhhhhhhh said the old woman i think her speech was generously obstructed if i do say so myself jeez biff joshua stuttered you canti meanlust isjeez biff what i said like i didnt know what youve ruined sex for me for all time joshua said whenever i think of it this picture will always come up in my mind so i said pushing the old woman away and shooing her into the back room so joshua turned around and looked me in the eye then grinned widely enough to threaten the integrity of his ears so thanks i stood and bowed i am here only to serve i said grinning back gaspar sent me to look for you hes ready to leave okay id better you know say goodbye i gestured toward the back room joshua shuddered no offense he said to the old woman who was out of sight in the other room i was just surprised want a turnip i said holding up one of the knobby treats joshua turned and started out the door jeez biff he was saying as he left chapter another day spent wandering the city with the angel another dream of the woman standing at the foot of my bed and i awoke finallyafter all these yearsto understand what joshua must have felt at least at times as the only one of his kind i know he said again and again that he was the son of man born of a woman one of us but it was the paternal part of his heritage that made him different now since im fairly sure i am the only person walking the earth who was doing so two thousand years ago i have an acute sense of what it is to be unique to be the one and only its lonely thats why joshua went into those mountains so often and stayed so long in the company of the creature last night i dreamed that the angel was talking to someone in the room while i slept in the dream i heard him say maybe it would be best just to kill him when he finishes snap his neck shove him into a storm sewer strange though there wasnt the least bit of malice in the angels voice on the contrary he sounded very forlorn thats how i know it was a dream i never thought id be happy to get back to the monastery but after trudging through the snow for half the day the dank stone walls and dark hallways were as welcoming as a warmly lit hearth half of the rice we had collected as alms was immediately boiled then packed into bamboo cylinders about a hand wide and as long as a mans leg then half of the root vegetables were stored away while the rest were packed into satchels along with some salt and more bamboo cylinders filled with cold tea we had just enough time to chase the chill out of our limbs by the cook fires then gaspar had us take up the cylinders and the satchels and he led us out into the mountains i had never noticed when the other monks left on the pilgrimage of secret meditation that they were carrying so much food and with all this food much more than we could eat in the four or five days we were gone why had joshua and i been training for this by fasting traveling higher into the mountains was actually easier for a while as the snow had been blown off the trail it was when we came to the high plateaus where the yak grazed and the snow drifted that the going became difficult we took turns at the head of the line plowing a trail through the snow as we climbed the air became so thin that even the highly conditioned monks had to stop frequently to catch their breaths at the same time the wind bit through our robes and leggings as if they werent there that there was not enough air to breathe yet the movement of the air would chill our bones i suppose is ironic yet i was having a hard time appreciating it even then i said why couldnt you just go to the rabbis and learn to be the messiah like everyone else do you remember any snow in the story of moses no did the lord appear to moses in the form of a snow bank i dont think so did elijah ascend to heaven on a chariot of ice nope did daniel come forth unharmed from a blizzard no our people are about fire joshua not ice i dont remember any snow in all of the torah the lord probably doesnt even go to places where it snows this is a huge mistake we never should have come we should go home as soon as this is over and in conclusion i cant feel my feet i was out of breath and wheezing daniel didnt come forth from the fire joshua said calmly well who can blame him it was probably warm in there he came forth unharmed from the lions den said josh here said gaspar stopping any further discussion he put down his parcels and sat down where i said we were under a low overhang out of the wind and mostly out of the snow but it was hardly what you could call shelter still the other monks including joshua shed their packs and sat affecting the meditation posture and holding their hands in the mudra of allgiving compassion which strangely enough is the same hand gesture that modern people use for okay makes you think we cant be here theres no here here i said exactly said gaspar contemplate that so i sat joshua and the others seemed impervious to the cold and as frost formed on my eyelashes and clothing the light dusting of ice crystals that covered the ground and rocks around each of them began to melt as if there was a flame burning inside of them whenever the wind died i noticed steam rising off of gaspar as his damp robe gave up its moisture to the chill air when joshua and i first learned to meditate we had been taught to be hyperaware of everything around us connected but the state that my fellow monks were in now was one of trance of separation of exclusion they had each constructed some sort of mental shelter in which they were happily sitting while i quite literally was freezing to death joshua i need a little help here i said but my friend didnt move a muscle if it werent for the steady stream of his breath i would have thought him frozen himself i tapped him on the shoulder but received no response whatsoever i tried to get the attention of each of the other four monks but they too gave no reaction to my prodding i even pushed gaspar hard enough to knock him over yet he stayed in the sitting position looking like a statue of the buddha that had tumbled from its pedestal still as i touched each of my companions i could feel the heat coming off of him since it was obvious that i wasnt going to learn how to reach this trance state in time to save my own life my only alternative was to take advantage of theirs at first i arranged the monks in a large pile trying to keep the elbows and knees out of the eyes and yarbles out of respect and in the spirit of the infinitely compassionate buddha and stuff although the warmth coming off them was impressive i found that i could only keep one side of me warm at a time soon by arranging my friends in a circle facing outward and sitting in the middle i was able to construct an envelope of comfort that kept the chill at bay ideally i could have used a couple of more monks to stretch over the top of my hut to block the wind but as the buddha said life is suffering and all so i suffered after i heated some tea on number seven monks head and tucked one of the cylinders of rice under gaspars arm until it was warm i was able to enjoy a pleasant repast and dropped off to sleep with a full belly i awoke to what sounded like the entire roman army trying to slurp the anchovies out of the mediterranean sea when i opened my eyes i saw the source of the noise and nearly tumbled over backward trying to back away a huge furry creature half again as tall as any man i had ever seen was trying to slurp the tea out of one of the bamboo cylinders but the tea had frozen to slush and the creature looked as if he might suck the top of his head in if he continued yes he looked sort of like a man except his entire body was covered with a long white fur his eyes were as large as a cows with crystal blue irises and pinpoint pupils thick black eyelashes knitted together when he blinked he had long black nails on his hands which were similar to a mans except twice the size and the only clothing he wore at all were some sort of boots that looked to be made of yak skin the impressive array of tackle swinging between the creatures legs tipped me off to his maleness i looked around at the circle of monks to see if anyone had noticed that our supplies were being raided by a woolly beast but they were all deeply entranced the creature slurped again from the cylinder then pounded on the side of it with his hand as if to dislodge the contents then looked at me as if asking for help whatever terror i felt melted away the second i looked into the creatures eyes there wasnt the hint of aggression there not a glint of violence or threat i picked up the cylinder of tea that i had heated on number threes head it sloshed in my hand indicating that it hadnt frozen during my nap so i held it out to the creature he reached over joshuas head and took the cylinder pulled the cork from the end and drank greedily i took the moment to kick my friend in the kidney josh snap out of it you need to see this i got no response so i reached around and pinched my friends nostrils shut to master meditation the student must first master his breath the savior made a snorting sound and came out of his trance gasping and twisting in my grip he was facing me when i finally let go what josh said i pointed behind him and joshua turned around to witness the full glory of the big furry white guy holy moly big furry jumped back cradling his tea like a threatened infant and made some vocalization which wasnt quite language but if it had been it would probably have translated as holy moly as well it was nice to see joshuas masterful control slip to reveal a vulnerable underbelly of confusion whati mean whoi mean what is that not a jew i said helpfully pointing to about a yard of foreskin well i can see its not a jew but that doesnt narrow it down much does it strangely i seemed to be enjoying this much more than my two semiterrified cohorts well do you remember when gaspar gave us the rules of the monastery and we wondered about the one that said we were not to kill a human or someone like a human yes well hes someone like a human i guess okay joshua climbed to his feet and looked at big furry big furry straightened up and looked at joshua tilting his head from side to side joshua smiled big furry smiled back black lips really long sharp canines big teeth i said very big teeth joshua held his hand out to the creature the creature reached out to joshua and ever so gently took the messiahs smaller hand in his great pawand wrenched joshua off his feet catching him in a hug and squeezing him so hard that his beatific eyes started to bug out help squeaked joshua the creature licked the top of joshuas head with a long blue tongue he likes you i said hes tasting me joshua said i thought of how my friend had fearlessly yanked the tail of the demon catch of how he had faced so many dangers with total calm i thought of the times he had saved me both from outside dangers and from myself and i thought of the kindness in his eyes that ran deeper than sea and i said naw he likes you i thought id try another language to see if the creature might better comprehend my meaning you like joshua dont you yes you do yes you do he wuvs his widdle joshua yes he does baby talk is the universal language the words are different but the meaning and sound is the same the creature nuzzled joshua up under its chin then licked his head again this time leaving a steaming trail of greenteastained saliva behind on my friends scalp yuck said joshua what is this thing its a yeti said gaspar from behind me obviously having been roused from his trance an abominable snowman this is what happens when you fuck a sheep i exclaimed not an abomination josh said abominable the yeti licked him on the cheek joshua tried to push away to gaspar he said am i in danger gaspar shrugged does a dog have a buddha nature please gaspar joshua said this is a question of practical application not spiritual growth the yeti sighed and licked joshs cheek again i guessed that the creature must have a tongue as rough as a cats as joshuas cheek was going pink with abrasion turn the other cheek josh i said let him wear the other one out im going to remember this joshua said gaspar will he harm me i dont know no one has ever gotten that close to him before usually he comes while we are in trance and disappears with the food we are lucky to even get a glimpse of him put me down please said josh to the creature please put me down the yeti set joshua back on his feet on the ground by this time the other monks were coming out of their trances number seventeen squealed like a frying squirrel when he saw the yeti so close the yeti crouched and bared his teeth stop that barked joshua to seventeen youre scaring him give him some rice said gaspar i took the cylinder i had warmed and handed it to the yeti he popped off the top and began scooping out rice with a long finger licking the grains off his fingers like they were termites about to make their escape meanwhile joshua backed away from the yeti so that he stood beside gaspar this is why you come here why after alms you carry so much food up the mountain gaspar nodded hes the last of his kind he has no one to help him gather food no one to talk to but what is he what is a yeti we like to think of him as a gift he is a vision of one of the many lives a man might live before he reaches nirvana we believe he is as close to a perfect being as can be achieved on this plane of existence how do you know he is the only one he told me he talks no he sings wait as we watched the yeti eat each of the monks came forward and put his cylinders of food and tea in front of the creature the yeti looked up from his eating only occasionally as if his whole universe resided in that bamboo pipe full of rice yet i could tell that behind those iceblue eyes the creature was counting figuring rationing the supplies we had brought where does he live i asked gaspar we dont know a cave somewhere i suppose he has never taken us there and we dont look for it once all the food was put before the yeti gaspar signaled to the other monks and they started backing out from under the overhang into the snow bowing to the yeti as they went it is time for us to go gaspar said he doesnt want our company joshua and i followed our fellow monks back into the snow following a path they were blazing back the way we had come the yeti watched us leave and every time i looked back he was still watching until we were far enough away that he became little more than an outline against the white of the mountain when at last we climbed out of the valley and even the great sheltering overhang was out of sight we heard the yetis song nothing not even the blowing of the rams horn back home not the war cries of bandits not the singing of mourners nothing i had ever heard had reached inside of me the way the yetis song did it was a high wailing but with stops and pulses like the muted sound of a heart beating and it carried all through the valley the yeti held his keening notes far longer than any human breath could sustain the effect was as if someone was emptying a huge cask of sadness down my throat until i thought id collapse or explode with the grief it was the sound of a thousand hungry children crying ten thousand widows tearing their hair over their husbands graves a chorus of angels singing the last dirge on the day of gods death i covered my ears and fell to my knees in the snow i looked at joshua and tears were streaming down his cheeks the other monks were hunched over as if shielding themselves from a hailstorm gaspar cringed as he looked at us and i could see then that he was indeed a very old man not as old as balthasar perhaps but the face of suffering was upon him so you see the abbot said he is the only one of his kind alone you didnt have to understand the yetis language if he had one to know that gaspar was right no hes not said joshua im going to him gaspar took joshuas arm to stop him everything is as it should be no said joshua it is not gaspar pulled his hand back as if he had plunged it into a flamea strange reaction as i had actually seen the monk put his hand in flame with less reaction as part of the kung fu regimen let him be i said to gaspar not sure at the time why i was doing it joshua headed back into the valley by himself having not said another word to us hell be back when its time i said what do you know snapped gaspar in a distinctly unenlightened way youll be working off your karma for a thousand years as a dung beetle just to evolve to the point of being dense i didnt say anything i simply bowed then turned and followed my brother monks back to the monastery it was a week before joshua returned to us and it was another day before he and i actually had time to speak we were in the dining hall and joshua had eaten his own rice as well as mine in the meantime i had applied a lot of thought to the plight of the abominable snowman and more important to his origins do you think there were a lot of them josh yes never as many as there are men but there were many more what happened to them im not sure when the yeti sings i see pictures in my head i saw that men came to these mountains and killed the yeti they had no instinct to fight most just stood in place and watched as they were slaughtered perplexed by mans evil others ran higher and higher into the mountains i think that this one had a mate and a family they starved or died of some slow sickness i cant tell is he a man i dont think he is a man said joshua is he an animal no i dont think hes an animal either he knows who he is he knows he is the only one i think i know what he is joshua regarded me over the rim of his bowl well well do you remember the monkey feet balthasar bought from the old woman in antioch how they looked like little human feet yes and you have to admit that the yeti looks very much like a man more like a man than he does any other creature right well what if he is a creature who is becoming a man what if he isnt really the last of his kind but the first of ours what made me think of it was how gaspar talks about how we work off our karma in different incarnations as different creatures as we learn more in each lifetime we may become a higher creature as we go well maybe creatures do that too maybe as the yeti needs to live where it is warmer he loses his fur or as the monkeys need to i dont know run cattle and sheep they become bigger not all at once but through many incarnations maybe creatures evolve the way gaspar believes the soul evolves what do you think joshua stroked his chin for a moment and stared at me as if he was deep in thought while at the same time i thought he might burst out laughing any second id spent a whole week thinking about this this theory had vexed me through all of my training all of my meditations since wed made the pilgrimage to the yetis valley i wanted some sort of acknowledgment from joshua for my effort if nothing else biff he said that may be the dumbest idea youve ever had so you dont think its possible why would the lord create a creature only to have it die out why would the lord allow that joshua said what about the flood all but noah and his family were killed but that was because people had become wicked the yeti isnt wicked if anything his kind have died out because they have no capacity for wickedness so youre the son of god you explain it to me it is gods will said joshua that the yeti disappear because they had no trace of wickedness i said sarcastically if the yeti isnt a man then hes not a sinner either hes innocent joshua nodded staring into his nowempty bowl yes hes innocent he stood and bowed to me which was something he almost never did unless we were training im tired now biff i have to sleep and pray sorry josh i didnt mean to make you sad i thought it was an interesting theory he smiled weakly at me then bowed his head and shuffled off to his cell over the next few years joshua spent at least a week out of every month in the mountains with the yeti going up not only with every group after alms but often going up into the mountains by himself for days or in the summer weeks at a time he never talked about what he did while in the mountains except he told me that the yeti had taken him to the cave where he lived and had shown him the bones of his people my friend had found something with the yeti and although i didnt have the courage to ask him i suspect the bond he shared with the snowman was the knowledge that they were both unique creatures nothing like either of them walked the face of the earth and regardless of the connection each might feel with god and the universe at that time in that place but for each other they were utterly alone gaspar didnt forbid joshuas pilgrimages and indeed he went out of his way to act as if he didnt notice when twentytwo monk was gone yet i could tell there was some unease in the abbot whenever joshua was away we both continued to drill on the posts and after two years of leaping and balancing dancing and the use of weapons were added to our routine joshua refused to take up any of the weapons in fact he refused to practice any art that would bring harm to another being he wouldnt even mimic the action of fighting with swords and spears with a bamboo substitute at first gaspar bristled at joshuas refusal and threatened to banish him from the monastery but when i took the abbot aside and told him the story of the archer joshua had blinded on the way to balthasars fortress the abbot relented he and two of the older monks who had been soldiers devised for joshua a regimen of weaponless fighting that involved no offense or striking at all but instead channeled the energy of an attacker away from oneself since the new art was practiced only by joshua and sometimes myself the monks called it jewdô meaning the way of the jew in addition to learning kung fu and jewdô gaspar set us to learning to speak and write sanskrit most of the holy books of buddhism had been written in that language and had yet to be translated into chinese which joshua and i had become fluent in this is the language of my boyhood gaspar said before beginning our lessons you need to know this to learn the words of gautama buddha but you will also need this language when you follow your dharma to your next destination joshua and i looked at each other it had been a long time since we had talked about leaving the monastery and the mention of it put us on edge routine feeds the illusion of safety and if nothing else there was routine at the monastery when will we leave master i asked when it is time said gaspar and how will we know it is time to leave when the time for staying has come to an end and we will know this because you will finally give us a straight and concrete answer to a question instead of being obtuse and spooky i asked does the unhatched tadpole know the universe of the fullgrown frog evidently not joshua said correct said the master meditate upon it as joshua and i entered the temple to begin our meditation i said when the time comes and we know that the time has come for us to leave i am going to lump up his shiny little head with a fighting staff meditate upon it said josh i mean it hes going to be sorry he taught me how to fight i said im sure of it im sorry already you know he doesnt have to be the only one bopped in the noggin when nogginboppin time rolls around i said joshua looked at me as if id just awakened him from a nap all the time we spend meditating what are you really doing biff im meditatingsometimeslistening to the sound of the universe and stuff but mostly youre just sitting there ive learned to sleep with my eyes open that wont help your enlightenment look when i get to nirvana i want to be well rested dont spend a lot of time worrying about it hey i have discipline through practice ive learned to cause spontaneous nocturnal emissions thats an accomplishment the messiah said sarcastically okay you can be snotty if you want to but when we get back to galilee you walk around trying to sell your love your neighbor because he is you claptrap and ill offer the wet dreams at will program and well see who gets more followers joshua grinned i think well both do better than my cousin john and his hold them underwater until they agree with you sermon i havent thought about him in years do you think hes still doing that just then number two monk looking very stern and unenlightened stood and started across the temple toward us his bamboo rod in hand sorry josh im going nomind i dropped to the lotus position formed the mudra of the compassionate buddha with my fingers and lickitysplit was on the sittingstill road to oneness with allthatness despite gaspars veiled warning about our moving on we again settled into a routine this one including learning to read and write the sutras in sanskrit but also joshuas time with the yeti i had gotten so proficient in the martial arts that i could break a flagstone as thick as my hand with my head and i could sneak up on even the most wary of the other monks flick him on the ear and be back in lotus position before he could spin to snatch the stillbeating heart from my chest actually no one was really sure if anyone could do that every day number three monk would declare it time for the snatching the stillbeating heart from the chest drill and every day he would ask for volunteers after a brief wait when no one volunteered wed move onto the next drill usually the maiming a guy with a fan drill everyone wondered if number three could really do it but no one wanted to ask we knew how buddhist monks liked to teach one minute youre curious the next a bald guy is holding a bloody piece of pulsating meat in your face and youre wondering why the sudden draft in the thorax area of your robe no thanks we didnt need to know that badly meanwhile joshua became so adept at avoiding blows that it was as if hed become invisible again even the best fighting monks of whom i was not one had trouble laying a hand on my friend and often they ended up flat on their backs on the flagstones for their trouble joshua seemed his happiest during these exercises often laughing out loud as he narrowly dodged the thrust of a sword that would have taken his eye sometimes he would take the spear away from number three only to bow and present it to him with a grin as if the grizzled old soldier had dropped it instead of having it finessed from his grip when gaspar witnessed these displays he would leave the courtyard shaking his head and mumbling something about ego leaving the rest of us to collapse into paroxysms of laughter at the abbots expense even numbers two and three who were normally the strict disciplinarians managed to mine a few smiles from their everso furrowed brows it was a good time for joshua meditation prayer exercise and time with the yeti seemed to have helped him to let go of the colossal burden hed been given to carry for the first time he seemed truly happy so i was stunned the day my friend entered the courtyard with tears streaming down his cheeks i dropped the spear i was drilling with and ran to him joshua hes dead joshua said i embraced him and he collapsed into my arms sobbing he was wearing wool leggings and boots so i knew immediately that hed just returned from one of his visits into the mountains a piece of ice fell from over his cave i found him under it crushed he was frozen solid so you couldnt joshua pushed me back and held me by the shoulders thats just it i wasnt there in time i not only couldnt save him i wasnt even there to comfort him yes you were i said joshua dug his fingers into my shoulders and shook me as if i was hysterical and he was trying to get my attention then suddenly he let go of me and shrugged im going to the temple to pray ill join you soon fifteen and i have three more movements to practice my sparring partner waited patiently at the edge of the courtyard spear in hand watching joshua got almost to the doors before he turned do you know the difference between praying and meditating biff i shook my head praying is talking to god meditating is listening ive spent most of these last six years listening do you know what ive heard again i said nothing not a single thing biff now i have some things i want to say im sorry about your friend i said i know he turned and started inside josh i called he paused and looked over his shoulder at me i wont let that happen to you you know that right i know he said then he went inside to give his father a divine asschewing the next morning gaspar summoned us to the tea room the abbot looked as if he had not slept in days and whatever his age he was carrying a century of misery in his eyes sit he said and we did the old man of the mountain is dead who thats what i called the yeti the old man of the mountain he has passed on to his next life and it is time for you to go joshua said nothing but sat with his hands folded in his lap staring at the table what does one have to do with the other i asked why should we leave because the yeti has died we didnt know he even existed until we had been here for two years but i did said gaspar i felt a heat rising in my faceim sure that my scalp and ears must have flushed because gaspar scoffed at me there is nothing else here for you there was nothing here for you from the beginning i would not have allowed you to stay if you werent joshuas friend it was the first time hed used either of our names since wed arrived at the monastery number four will meet you at the gate he has the possessions you arrived with as well as some food for your journey we cant go home joshua said at last i dont know enough yet no said gaspar i suspect that you dont but you know all that you will learn here if you come to a river and find a boat at the edge you will use that boat to cross and it will serve you well but once across the river do you put the boat on your shoulders and carry it with you on the rest of your journey how big is the boat i asked what color is the boat asked joshua how far is the rest of the journey i queried is biff there to carry the oars or do i have to carry everything asked josh no screamed gaspar no you dont take the boat along on the journey it has been useful but now its simply a burden its a parable you cretins joshua and i bowed our heads under gaspars anger as the abbot railed joshua smiled at me and winked when i saw the smile i knew that hed be okay gaspar finished his tirade then caught his breath and resumed in the tone of the tolerant monk that we were used to as i was saying there is no more for you to learn joshua go be a bodhisattva for your people and biff try not to kill anyone with what we have taught you here so do we get our boat now joshua asked gaspar looked as if he were about to explode then joshua held his hand up and the old man remained silent we are grateful for our time here gaspar these monks are noble and honorable men and we have learned much from them but you honorable abbot are a pretender you have mastered a few tricks of the body and you can reach a trance state but you are not an enlightened being though i think you have glimpsed enlightenment you look everywhere for answers but where they lie nevertheless your deception hasnt stopped you from teaching us we thank you gaspar hypocrite wise man bodhisattva gaspar sat staring at joshua who had spoken as if he were talking to a child the old man went about fixing the tea more feebly now i thought but maybe that was my imagination and you knew this gaspar asked me i shrugged what enlightened being travels halfway around the world following a star on the rumor that a messiah has been born he means across the world said josh i mean around the world i elbowed joshua in the ribs because it was easier than explaining my theory of universal stickiness to gaspar the old guy was having a rough day as it was gaspar poured tea for all of us then sat down with a sigh you were not a disappointment joshua the three of us knew as soon as we saw you that you were a being unlike any other brahman born to flesh my brother said what gave it away i said the angels on the roof of the stable gaspar ignored me but you were still an infant and whatever it was that we were looking for you were not itnot yet anyway we could have stayed i suppose and helped to raise you protect you but we were all dense balthasar wanted to find the key to immortality and there was no way that you could give him that and my brother and i wanted the keys to the universe and those were not to be found in bethlehem either so we warned your father of herods intent to have you killed we gave him gold to get you out of the country and we returned to the east melchior is your brother gaspar nodded we were princes of tamil melchior is the oldest so he would have inherited our lands but i would have received a small fiefdom as well like siddhartha we eschewed worldly pleasures to pursue enlightenment how did you end up here in these mountains i asked chasing buddhas gaspar smiled i had heard that there lived a sage in these mountains the locals called him the old man of the mountain i came looking for the sage and what i found was the yeti who knows how old he really was or how long hed been here what i did know was that he was the last of his kind and that he would die before long without help i stayed here and i built this monastery along with the monks who came here to study i have been taking care of the yeti since you two were just infants now he is gone i have no purpose and i have learned nothing whatever there was to know here died under that lump of ice joshua reached across the table and took the old mans hand you drill us every day in the same movements we practice the same brush strokes over and over we chant the same mantras why so that these actions will become natural spontaneous without being diluted by thought right yes said gaspar compassion is the same way said joshua thats what the yeti knew he loved constantly instantly spontaneously without thought or words thats what he taught me love is not something you think about it is a state in which you dwell that was his gift wow i said i came here to learn that said josh you taught it to me as much as the yeti me gaspar had been pouring the tea as joshua spoke and now he noticed that hed overfilled his cup and the tea was running all over the table who took care of him fed him looked after him did you have to think about that before you did it no said gaspar joshua stood thanks for the boat gaspar didnt accompany us to the front gate as he promised number four was waiting for us with our clothes and the money we had when we arrived six years before i picked up the yingyang vial of poison that joy had given me and slipped the lanyard over my head then i pushed the sheathed black glass dagger into the belt of my robe and tucked my clothes under my arm you will go to find gaspars brother number four asked number four was one of the older monks one of the ones who had served the emperor as a soldier and a long white scar marked his head from the middle of his shaved scalp to his right ear which had healed to a forked shape tamil right joshua said go south it is very far there are many dangers along the way remember your training we will good number four turned on his heel and walked into the monastery then shut the heavy wooden gate no no four dont embarrass yourself with a sappy goodbye i said to the gate no really please no scenes joshua was counting our money out of a small leather purse its just what we left with them good no thats not good weve been here six years biff this money should have doubled or tripled during that time what by magic no they should have invested it he turned and looked back at the gate you dumb bastards maybe you should spend a little less time studying how to beat each other up and a little more time on managing your money spontaneous love i said yeah gasparll never get that one either thats why they killed the yeti you know that dont you who the mountain people they killed the yeti because they couldnt understand a creature who wasnt as evil as they were the mountain people were evil all men are evil thats what i was talking to my father about what did he say fuck em really yeah at least he answered you i got the feeling that he thinks its my problem now makes you wonder why he didnt burn that on one of the tablets here moses heres the ten commandments and heres an extra one that says fuck em he doesnt sound like that for emergencies i continued in my perfect impressionofgod voice i hope its warm in india joshua said and so at the age of twentyfour joshua of nazareth did go down into india part iv spirit he who sees in me all things and all things in me is never far from me and i am never far from him the bhagavad gita chapter the road was just wide enough for the two of us to walk side by side the grass on either side was as high as an elephants eye we could see blue sky above us and exactly as far along the path as the next curve which could have been any distance away because theres no perspective in an unbroken green trench wed been traveling on this road most of the day and passed only one old man and a couple of cows but now we could hear what sounded like a large party approaching us not far off perhaps two hundred yards away there were mens voices a lot of them footsteps some dissonant metal drums and most disturbing the continuous screams of a woman either in pain or terrified or both young masters came a voice from somewhere near us i jumped in the air and came down in a defensive stance my black glass knife drawn and ready josh looked around for the source of the voice the screaming was getting closer there was a rustling in the grass a few feet away from the road then again the voice young masters you must hide an impossibly thin male face with eyes that seemed a size and a half too large for his skull popped out of the wall of grass beside us you must come kali comes to choose her victims come now or die the face disappeared replaced by a craggy brown hand that motioned for us to follow into the grass the womans scream hit crescendo and failed as if the voice had broken like an overtightened lute string go said joshua pushing me into the grass as soon as i was off of the road someone caught my wrist and started dragging me through the sea of grass joshua latched onto the tail of my shirt and allowed himself to be dragged along as we ran the grass whipped and slashed at us i could feel blood welling up on my face and arms even as the brown wraith pulled me deeper into the sea of green above the rasping of my breath i heard men shouting from behind us then a thrashing of the grass being trampled they follow said the brown wraith over his shoulder run unless you want your heads to decorate kalis altar run over my shoulder to josh i said he says run or it will be bad behind josh outlined against the sky i saw long swordlike spear tips the sort of thing one might use for beheading someone okeydokey said josh it had taken us over a month to get to india most of the journey through hundreds of miles of the highest most rugged country we had ever seen amazingly enough there were villages scattered all through the mountains and when the villagers saw our orange robes doors were flung wide and larders opened we were always fed given a warm place to sleep and welcomed to stay as long as we wished we offered obtuse parables and irritating chants in return as was the tradition it wasnt until we came out of the mountains onto a brutally hot and humid grassland that we found our mode of dress was drawing more disdain than welcome one man of obvious wealth he rode a horse and wore silk robes cursed us as we passed and spit at us other people on foot began to take notice of us as well and we hurried off into some high grass and changed out of our robes i tucked the glass dagger that joy had given me into my sash what was he going on about i asked joshua he said something about tellers of false prophecies pretenders enemies of the brahman whatever that is im not sure what else well it looks like were more welcome here as jews than as buddhists for now said joshua all the people have those marks on their foreheads like gaspar had i think without one of those were going to have to be careful as we traveled into the lowlands the air felt as thick as warm cream and we could feel the weight of it in our lungs after so many years in the mountains we passed into the valley of a wide muddy river and the road became choked with people passing in and out of a city of wooden shacks and stone altars there were humpedback cattle everywhere even grazing in the gardens but no one seemed to bear them any mind the last meat i ate was what was left of our camels i said lets find a booth and buy some beef there were merchants along the road selling various wares clay pots powders herbs spices copper and bronze blades iron seemed to be in short supply and tiny carvings of what seemed to be a thousand different gods most of them having more limbs than seemed necessary and none of them looking particularly friendly we found grain breads fruits vegetables and bean pastes for sale but nowhere did we see any meat we settled on some bread and spicy bean paste paid the woman with roman copper coin then found a place under a large banyan tree where we could sit and look at the river while we ate id forgotten the smell of a city the fetid mélange of people and waste and smoke and animals and i began to long for the clean air of the mountains i dont want to sleep here joshua lets see if we can find a place in the country we are supposed to follow this river to the sea to reach tamil where the river goes so go the people the riverwider than any in israel but shallow yellow with clay and still against the heavy airseemed more like a huge stagnant puddle than a living moving thing in this season anyway dotting the surface a halfdozen skinny naked men with wild white hair and not three teeth apiece shouted angry poetry at the top of their lungs and tossed water into glittering crests over their heads i wonder how my cousin john is doing said josh all along the muddy riverbank women washed clothes and babies only steps from where cattle waded and shat men fished or pushed long shallow boats along with poles and children swam or played in the mud here and there the corpse of a dog bobbed flyblown in the gentle current maybe theres a road inland a little away from the stench joshua nodded and climbed to his feet there he said pointing to a narrow path that began on the opposite bank of the river and disappeared into some tall grass well have to cross i said be nice if we could find a boat to take us said josh you dont think we should ask where the path leads no said joshua looking at a crowd of people who were gathering nearby and staring at us these people all look hostile what was that you told gaspar about love was a state you dwell in or something yeah but not with these people these people are creepy lets go the creepy little brown guy who was dragging me through the elephant grass was named rumi and much to his credit amid the chaos and tumble of a headlong dash through a leviathan marshland pursued by a muderous band of clanging shouting spearwaving decapitation enthusiasts rumi had managed to find a tigerno small task when you have a kung fu master and the savior of the world in tow eek a tiger rumi said as we stumbled into a small clearing a mere depression really where a cat the size of jerusalem was gleefully gnawing away on the skull of a deer rumi had expressed my sentiments exactly but i would be damned if i was going to let my last words be eek a tiger so i listened quietly as urine filled my shoes youd think all the noise would have frightened him josh said just as the tiger looked up from his deer i noticed that our pursuers seemed to be closing on us by the second that is the way it is usually done said rumi the noise drives the tiger to the hunter maybe he knows that i said so hes not going anywhere you know theyre bigger than i imagined tigers i mean sit down said joshua pardon me i said trust me joshua said remember the cobra when we were kids i nodded to rumi and coaxed him down as the tiger crouched and tensed his hind legs as if preparing to leap which is exactly what he was doing as the first of our pursuers broke into the clearing from behind us the tiger leapt sailing over our heads by half again the height of a man the tiger landed on the first two men coming out of the grass crushing them under his enormous forepaws then raking their backs as he leapt again after that all i could see was spear points scattering against the sky as the hunters became well you know men screamed the woman screamed the tiger screamed and the two men who had fallen under the tiger crawled to their feet and limped back toward the road screaming rumi looked from the dead deer to joshua to me to the dead deer to joshua and his eyes seemed to grow even larger than before i am deeply moved and eternally grateful for your affinity with the tiger but that is his deer and it appears that he has not finished with it perhaps joshua stood up lead on i dont know which way not that way i said pointing in the direction of the screaming bad guys rumi led us through the grass to another road which we followed to where he lived its a pit i said its not that bad said joshua looking around there were other pits nearby people were living in them you live in a pit i said hey ease up joshua said he saved our lives it is a humble pit but it is home said rumi please make yourself comfortable i looked around the pit had been chipped out of sandstone and was about shoulder deep and just wide enough to turn a cow around in which i would find out was a crucial dimension the pit was empty except for a single rock about knee high have a seat you may have the rock said rumi joshua smiled and sat on the rock rumi sat on the floor of the pit which was covered with a thick layer of black slime please sit said rumi gesturing to the floor beside him im sorry we can only afford one rock i didnt sit rumi you live in a pit i pointed out well yes that is true where do untouchables live in your land untouchable yes the lowest of the low the scum of the earth none of the higher caste may acknowledge my existence i am untouchable well no wonder you live in a fucking pit no joshua said he lives in a pit because hes untouchable hes not untouchable because he lives in a pit hed be untouchable if he lived in a palace isnt that right rumi oh like thats going to happen i said im sorry the guy lived in a pit theres more room since my wife and most of my children died said rumi until this morning it was only vitra my youngest daughter and me but now she is gone too there is plenty of room for you if you wish to stay joshua put his hand on rumis narrow shoulder and i could see the effect it had the pain evaporating from the untouchables face like dew under a hot sun i stood by being wretched what happened to vitra joshua asked they came and took her the brahmans as a sacrifice on the feast of kali i was looking for her when i saw you two they gather children and men criminals untouchables and strangers they would have taken you and day after tomorrow they would have offered your head to kali so your daughter is not dead i asked they will hold her until midnight on the night of the feast then slaughter her with the other children on the wooden elephants of kali i will go to these brahmans and ask for your daughter back joshua said theyll kill you rumi said vitra is lost even your tiger cannot save you from kalis destruction rumi i said look at me please explain brahmans kali elephants everything go slow act as if i know nothing like that takes imagination joshua said clearly violating my implied if not expressed copyright on sarcasm yeah we have court tv in the hotel room why there are four castes said rumi the brahmans or priests kshatriyas or warriors vaisyas who are farmers or merchants and the sudras who are laborers there are many subcastes but those are the main ones each man is born to a caste and he remains in that caste until he dies and is reborn as a higher caste or lower caste which is determined by his karma or actions during his last life we know from karma i said were buddhist monks heretics rumi hissed bite me you bugeyed scrawny brown guy i said you are a scrawny brown guy no youre a scrawny brown guy no you are a scrawny brown guy we are all scrawny brown guys joshua said making peace yeah but hes bugeyed and you are a heretic youre a heretic no you are a heretic were all scrawny brown heretics said joshua calming things down again well of course im scrawny i said six years of cold rice and tea and not a scrap of beef for sale in the whole country you would eat beef you heretic shouted rumi enough shouted joshua no one may eat a cow cows are the reincarnations of souls on their way to the next life holy cow josh said that is what i am saying joshua shook his head as if trying to straighten jumbled thoughts you said that there were four castes but you didnt mention untouchables harijans untouchables have no caste we are the lowest of the low we may have to live many lifetimes before we even ascend to the level of a cow and then we may become higher caste then if we follow our dharma our duty as a higher caste we may become one with brahma the universal spirit of all i cant believe you dont know this have you been living in a cave i was going to point out that rumi was in no position to criticize where we had been living but joshua signaled me to let it go instead i said so you are lower on the caste system than a cow i asked yes so these brahmans wont eat a cow but they will take your daughter and kill her for their goddess and eat her said rumi hanging his head at midnight on the night of the feast they will take her and the other children and tie them to the wooden elephants they will cut off the childrens fingers and give one to the head of each brahman household then they will catch her blood in a cup and everyone in the household will taste it they may eat the finger or bury it for good luck after that the children are hacked to death on the wooden elephants they cant do that joshua said oh yes the cult of kali may do anything they wish it is her city kalighat calcutta on the friendly flyer map my little vitra is lost we can only pray that she is reincarnated to a higher level joshua patted the untouchables hand why did you call biff a heretic when he told you that we were buddhist monks that gautama said that a man may go directly from any level to join brahma without fulfilling his dharma that is heresy that would be better for you wouldnt it since youre on the bottom of the ladder you cannot believe what you do not believe rumi said i am an untouchable because my karma dictates it oh yeah i said no sense sitting under a bodhi tree for a few hours when you can get the same thing through thousands of lifetimes of misery of course thats ignoring the fact that youre a gentile and going to suffer eternal damnation either way said josh yeah leaving that out altogether but well get your daughter back joshua said joshua wanted to rush into kalighat and demand the return of rumis daughter and the release of all the other victims in the name of what was good and right joshuas solution to everything was to lead with righteous indignation and there is a time and a place unto that but there is also a time for cunning and guile ecclesiastes or something i was able to talk him into an alternate plan by using flawless logic josh did the vegemites smite the marmites by charging in and demanding justice at the end of a sword i think not these brahmans cut off and eat the fingers of children i know theres no fingercutting commandment josh but still im guessing that these people think differently than we do they call the buddha a heretic and he was one of their princes how do you think theyll receive a scrawny brown kid claiming to be the son of a god who doesnt even live in their area good point but we still have to save the child of course how extreme sneakiness youll have to be in charge then first we need to see this city and this temple where the sacrifices will be held joshua scratched his head his hair had mostly grown back but was still short the vegemites smote the marmites yeah excretions threesix i dont remember that i guess i need to brush up on my torah the statue of kali over her altar was carved from black stone and stood as tall as ten men she wore a necklace of human skulls around her neck and a girdle made of severed human hands at her hips her open maw was lined with a saw blade of teeth over which a stream of fresh blood had been poured even her toenails curved into vicious blades which dug into the pile of twisted graven corpses on which she stood she had four arms one holding a cruel serpentine sword another a severed head by the hair the third hand she held crooked as if beckoning her victims to the place of dark destruction to which all are destined and the fourth was posed downward in a manner presenting the goddesss handgirded hips as if asking the eternal question does this outfit make me look fat the raised altar lay in the middle of an open garden that was surrounded by trees the altar was wide enough that five hundred people could have stood in the shadow of the black goddess deep grooves had been cut in the stone to channel the blood of sacrifices into vessels so it could be poured through the goddesss jaws leading to the altar was a wide stonepaved boulevard which was lined on either side by great elephants carved from wood and set on turntables so they could be rotated the trunks and front feet of the elephants were stained rusty brown and here and there the trunks exhibited deep gouges from blades that had hewn through a child into the mahogany vitra isnt being kept here joshua said we were hiding behind a tree near the temple garden dressed as natives fake caste marks and all having lost when we drew lots i was the one dressed as a woman i think this is a bodhi tree i said just like buddha sat under its so exciting im feeling sort of enlightened just standing here really i can feel ripe bodhies squishing between my toes joshua looked at my feet i dont think those are bodhies there was a cow here before us i lifted my foot out of the mess cows are overrated in this country under the buddhas tree too is nothing sacred theres no temple to this temple joshua said we have to ask rumi where the sacrifices are kept until the festival he wont know hes untouchable these guys are brahmansprieststhey wouldnt tell him anything that would be like a sadducee telling a samaritan what the holy of holies looked like then we have to find them ourselves joshua said we know where theyre going to be at midnight well get them then i say we find these brahmans and force them to stop the whole festival well just storm up to their temple and tell them to stop it yes and they will yes thats cute josh lets go find rumi i have a plan chapter you make a very attractive woman rumi said from the comfort of his pit did i tell you that my wife has passed on to her next incarnation and that i am alone yeah you mentioned that he seemed to have given up on us getting his daughter back what happened to the rest of your family anyway they drowned im sorry in the ganges no at home it was the monsoon season little vitra and i had gone to the market to buy some swill and there was a sudden downpour when we returned he shrugged i dont mean to sound insensitive rumi but there is a chance that your loss could have been caused byoh i dont knowperhaps the fact that you live in a fucking pit thats not helping biff joshua said you said you had a plan right rumi am i correct in assuming that these pits when someone is not living in them are used for tanning hides yes it is work that only untouchables may do that would account for the lovely smell i assume you use urine in the tanning process right yes urine mashed brains and tea are the main ingredients show me the pit where the urine is condensed the rajneesh family is living there thats okay well bring them a present josh do you have any lint in the bottom of your satchel what are you up to alchemy i said the subtle manipulation of the elements watch and learn when it was not being used the urine pit was the home of the rajneesh family and they were more than happy to give us loads of the white crystals that covered the floor of their home there were six in the family father mother an almost grown daughter and three little ones another little son had been taken for sacrifice at the festival of kali like rumi and all the other untouchables the rajneesh family looked more like skeletons mummified in brown leather than people the untouchable men went about the pits naked or wearing only a loincloth and even the women were dressed in tatters that barely covered themnothing as nice as the stylish sari that i had purchased in the marketplace mr rajneesh commented that i was a very attractive woman and encouraged me to drop by after the next monsoon joshua pounded chunks of the crystallized mineral into a fine white powder while rumi and i collected charcoal from under the heated dying pit a firebox had been gouged out of the stone under the pit which the untouchables used to render the flowers from the indigo shrub into fabric dye i need brimstone rumi do you know what that is a yellow stone that burns with a blue flame and gives off a smoke that smells like rotten eggs oh yes they sell it in the market as some sort of medicine i handed the untouchable a silver coin go buy as much of it as you can carry oh my this will be more than enough money may i buy some salt with what is left buy what you need with whats left over just go rumi skulked away and i went to help joshua process the saltpeter the concept of abundance was an abstract one to the untouchables except as it pertained to two categories suffering and animal parts if you wanted decent food shelter or clean water you would be sorely disappointed among the untouchables but if you were in the market for beaks bones teeth hides sinew hooves hair gallstones fins feathers ears antlers eyeballs bladders lips nostrils poop chutes or any other inedible part of virtually any creature that walked on swam under or flew over the subcontinent of india then the untouchables were likely to have what you wanted lying around conveniently stored beneath a thick blanket of black flies in order to fashion the equipment i needed for my plan i had to think in terms of animal parts fine unless you need say a dozen short swords bows and arrows and chain mail for thirty soldiers and all you have to work with is a stack of nostrils and three mismatched poop chutes it was a challenge but i made do as joshua moved among the untouchables surreptitiously healing their maladies i barked out my orders i need eight sheep bladdersfairly drytwo handfuls of crocodile teeth two pieces of rawhide as long as my arms and half again as wide no i dont care what kind of animal just not too ripe if you can manage it i need hair from an elephants tail i need firewood or dried dung if you must eight oxtails a basket of wool and a bucket of rendered fat and a hundred scrawny untouchables stood there eyes as big as saucers just staring at me while joshua moved among them healing their wounds sicknesses and insanities without any of them suspecting what was happening wed agreed that this was the wisest tack to take as we didnt want a bunch of healthy untouchables athletically bounding through kalighat proclaiming that they had been cured of all ills by a strange foreigner thus attracting attention to us and spoiling my plan on the other hand neither could we stand there and watch these people suffer knowing that wewell joshuahad the power to help them hed also taken to poking one of them in the arm with his finger anytime anyone said the word untouchable later he told me that he just hated passing up the opportunity for palpable irony i cringed when i saw joshua touching the lepers among them as if after all these years away from israel a tiny pharisee stood on my shoulder and screamed unclean well i said after id finished my orders do you want your children back or not we dont have a bucket said one woman or a basket said another okay fill some of the sheep bladders with rendered fat and bundle the wool in some kind of hide now go we dont have a lot of time and they all stood and looked at me big eyes sores healed parasites purged they just looked at me look i know my sanskrit isnt great but you do know what i am asking a young man stepped forward we do not want to anger kali by depriving her of her sacrifices youre kidding right kali is the bringer of destruction without which there can be no rebirth she is the remover of the bondage that ties us to the material world if we anger her she will deprive us of her divine destruction i looked at joshua across the crowd do you understand this fear he said can you help i asked in aramaic im not good at fear joshua said in hebrew i thought for a second as two hundred eyes pinned me to the sandstone on which i stood i remembered the redstained gashes on the wooden elephant statues at the altar of kali death was their deliverance was it what is your name i asked the man who had stepped out of the crowd nagesh he said stick out your tongue nagesh he did and i threw back the cloth that covered my head and loosened it around my neck then i touched his tongue destruction is a gift you value yes said nagesh then i shall be the instrument of the goddesss gift with that i pulled the black glass dagger from the sheath in my sash held it up before the crowd while nagesh stood passive wideeyed i drove my thumb under his jaw pushed his head back and brought the dagger down across his throat i lowered him to the ground as the red liquid spurted over the sandstone i stood and faced the crowd again holding the dripping blade over my head you owe me you ungrateful fucks i have brought to your people the gift of kali now bring me what i ask for they moved really quickly for people who were on the edge of starvation after the untouchables scattered to do my bidding joshua and i stood over the bloodstained body of nagesh that was fantastic joshua said absolutely perfect thanks had you been practicing all that time we were in the monastery you didnt see me push the pressure point in his neck then no not at all gaspars kung fu training the rest of course was from joy and balthasar i bent over and opened nageshs mouth then took the yingyang vial from around my neck and put a drop of the antidote on the untouchables tongue so he can hear us now like when joy poisoned you joshua asked i pulled back one of nageshs eyelids and watched the pupil contract slowly in the sunlight no i think hes still unconscious from me holding the pressure point i didnt think the poison would work quickly enough i could only get a drop of poison on my finger when i loosened my sari i knew it would keep him down i just wasnt sure it would put him down well you are truly a magus now biff im impressed joshua you healed a hundred people today half of them were probably dying i did some sleight of hand my friends enthusiasm was undeterred whats the red stuff pomegranate juice i cant figure out where you concealed it no actually i was going to ask you about that what i held my arm up and showed joshua where i had slashed my own wrist the source of blood for the show i had been holding it against my leg and as soon as i removed the pressure the blood started spurting again i sat down hard on the sandstone and my vision began to tunnel down to a pinpoint i was hoping you could help me out with this i said before i fainted you need to work on that part of the trick joshua said when i came to i might not always be around to fix your wrist he was speaking hebrewthat meant for my ears only i saw joshua kneeling above me then beyond him the sky was blotted out by curious brown faces the recently murdered nagesh was in the front of the crowd hey nagesh howd the rebirth go i asked in sanskrit i must have strayed from my dharma in my last life nagesh said i have been reincarnated once again as an untouchable and i have the same ugly wife you challenged master levi who is called biff i said of course you didnt move up youre lucky youre not a stink bug or something see destruction isnt the big favor you all thought it was we brought the things you asked for i hopped to my feet feeling incredibly rested and energized nice i said to joshua i feel like i just had one of those strong coffees you used to make at balthasars i miss coffee said josh i looked at nagesh i dont suppose you we have swill never mind i said then i said one of those things that as a boy growing up in galilee you never think youll hear yourself say okay untouchables bring me the sheep bladders rumi said that the goddess kali was served by a host of blackskinned female demons who sometimes during the feast would bring men to corners of the altar and copulate with them as blood rained down from the goddesss sawtooth maw above okay josh youre one of them i said what are you gonna be the goddess kali of course you got to be god last time what last time all of the last times i turned to my intrepid minions untouchables paint him up theyre not going to buy that a burrheaded jewish kid is their goddess of destruction o ye of little faith i said three hours later we were again crouched beneath a tree near the temple of kali we were both dressed as women covered from head to toe by our saris but i was looking much lumpier under mine due to kalis extra arms and garland of severed heads played tonight by painted sheep bladders filled with explosives and suspended around my neck by long strands of elephant tail hair any observers who might get close enough to notice my protrusions were quickly deterred by the smell coming off of joshua and me we had used the goo from the bottom of rumis pit to paint our bodies black i didnt have the courage to ask what the substance had been in life but if there was a place where they allowed vultures to ripen in the sun before pounding them into a smooth paste and mixing it with just the right amount of buffalo squat then rumi called it home the untouchables had also painted huge red rings around joshuas eyes fitted him with a ropey wig of oxtails and affixed to his torso six pert little breasts fashioned from pitch stay away from any open flame your tits will go up like volcanos why did i have to have six and you only had to have two because i am the goddess and have to wear the garland of skulls and the extra arms wed made my arms from rawhide using my primary arms as models then drying the molded arms in place over the fire the women made a harness that held the extra arms in place under my own then we painted the arms black with the same black goo they were a little wobbly but they were light and would look realistic enough in the dark it was still hours from the height of the ceremony at midnight when the children would be hacked to death but we wanted to be there in time to stop the revelers from cutting off the childrens fingers if we could now the wooden elephants were empty on their turntables but the altar of kali was already filling with gruesome tribute the heads of a thousand goats had been laid on the altar before the goddess and the blood ran slick over the stones and in the grooves that channeled it into large brass pots at the corners of the altar female acolytes carried the pots up a narrow ladder at the back of the great statue of kali then dumped them through some sort of reservoir that fed it through the goddesss jaws below by torchlight worshipers danced in the sticky shower as the blood flowed down upon them look those women are dressed like me joshua said except they only have two breasts each technically theyre not dressed theyre painted you make a very attractive female demon josh did i tell you that this isnt going to work of course its going to work i guessed that there were already ten thousand worshipers in the temple square dancing chanting and beating drums a procession of thirty men came down the main boulevard each carrying a basket under his arm as they reached the altar each man dumped the contents of the basket over the rows of bloody goat heads what are those joshua asked those are exactly what you think they are theyre not the heads of the children no i think those are the heads of strangers who happened down the road we were on before rumi came along to pull us into the grass after the severed heads were dispersed across the altar the female acolytes came out of the crowd dragging the headless corpse of a man which they laid on the steps leading to the altar each one mimed having intercourse with the corpse then rubbed their genitalia against the bloody stump of its neck before dancing away blood and ochre dripping down the insides of their thighs theres sort of a theme developing here i said i think im going to be sick joshua said mindful breath i said using one of the phrases that gaspar was always barking at us when we were learning meditation i knew that if joshua could stay with the yeti for days at a time without freezing to death he could certainly conjure up the bodily control to keep from throwing up the sheer magnitude of the carnage was all that was keeping me from vomiting it was as if the atrocity of the whole scene couldnt fit in my mind all at once so i could only see just enough for my sanity and my stomach to remain intact a shout went up in the crowd now and i could see a torchlit sedan chair being carried above the heads of the worshipers on it reclined a halfnaked man with a tiger skin wrapped around his hips his skin painted light gray with ashes his hair was plaited with grease and he wore the bones of a human hand as a skullcap around his neck hung a necklace of human skulls high priest i said they arent even going to notice you biff how can you even get their attention after theyve seen all this they havent seen what im going to show them as the sedan chair emerged from the crowd in front of the altar we could see a procession following it tied to the back of the sedan chair was a line of naked children most of them not more than five or six their hands tied together a less ornately dressed priest on either side of them to steady them the priests began to untie the children and take them to the great wooden elephants lining the boulevard here and there in the crowd i could see people beginning to brandish edged weapons short swords axes and the longbladed spears joshua and i had seen over the elephant grass the high priest was sitting on the headless corpse shouting a poem about the divine release of kalis destruction or something here we go i said pulling the black glass dagger from under my sari take this joshua looked at the blade shimmering in the torchlight i wont kill anyone he said tears were streaming down his cheeks drawing long red lines through the black and if anything making him look more fierce thats fine but youll need to cut them loose right he took the knife from me josh you know whats coming youve seen it before nobody else here has especially those kids you cant carry all of them so they have to have enough of their wits about them to follow you i know you can keep them from being afraid put your teeth in joshua nodded and slipped the row of crocodile teeth attached to a piece of rawhide under his upper lip leaving the teeth to protrude like fangs i put in my own false fangs then ran into the dark to circle the crowd as i approached the rear of the altar i pulled the special torch id made from under my girdle of human hands actually my girdle of human hands was made of dried goats udders stuffed with straw but the untouchable women had done a pretty good job as long as no one bothered to count fingers through kalis stone legs i could see the priests tying each of the children on the trunk of a wooden elephant as soon as the bonds were tight each priest drew a bronze blade and held it aloft ready to strike off a finger as soon as the high priest gave the signal i struck the tip of my torch on the edge of the altar screamed for all i was worth then threw my sari off and ran up the steps as the torch burst into dazzling blue flame that trailed sparks behind me as i ran i hopped across the array of goat heads and stood between the legs of the statue of kali my torch held aloft in one hand one of my severed heads swinging by the hair in the other i am kali i screamed fear me it came out sort of mumbled through my fake teeth some of the drums stopped and the high priest turned around and looked at me more because of the bright light of the torch than my fierce proclamation i am kali i shouted again goddess of destruction and all this disgusting crap you have here they werent getting it the priest signaled for the other priests to come around me from the sides some of the female acolytes were already trying to make their way across the dance floor of decapitations toward me i mean it bow down to me the priests charged on i did have the crowds attention though unfortunately they werent cowering in fear at my angry goddessness i could see joshua moving around the wooden elephants the guarding priests having left their posts to come after me really i mean it maybe it was the teeth i spit them out toward the nearest of my attackers running across a sea of slick bloody heads is evidently a pretty difficult task not if youve spent the last six years of your life hopping from the top of one post to another even in ice and snow but for the runofthemill homicidal priest its a tough row to hoe the priests and acolytes were slipping and sliding among the goat and human heads falling over each other smacking into the feet of the statue one even impaling himself on a goats horn when he fell one of the priests was only a few feet away from me now trying not to fall on his own blade as he crawled over the mess i will bring destructionoh fuck it i said i lit the fuse on the severed head i held in my hand then swung it between my legs and tossed it in a steep arch over my head it trailed sparks on its way into the black goddesss open maw then disappeared i kicked the approaching priest in the jaw then danced across the goat heads leapt over the head of the high priest and was halfway to joshua at the first wooden elephant when kali with a deafening report breathed fire out over the crowd and the top of her head blew off finally i had the crowds attention they were trampling each other to get away but i had their attention i stood in the middle of the boulevard swinging my second severed head in a circle waiting for the fuse to burn down before i let it sail over the heads of the receding crowd it exploded in the air sending a circle of flame across the sky and no doubt deafening some of the worshipers who were close joshua had seven of the children around him clinging to his legs as he moved to the next elephant several of the priests had recovered and were storming down the steps of the altar toward me knives in hand i pulled another head from my garland lit the fuse and held it out to them ah ah ah i cautioned kali goddess of destruction wrath et cetera at the sight of the sparking fuse they stopped and began to backpedal now thats the sort of respect you should have shown before i started whirling the head by the hair and the priests lost all semblance of courage and turned and ran i hurled the head back up the boulevard onto the altar where it exploded sending a spray of real severed goat heads in all directions josh duck goat heads joshua pushed the children to the ground and fell over them until the pieces settled he glared at me a second then went on to free the other children i hurled three more heads into different directions and now the entire temple square was nearly deserted but for joshua the children a few injured worshipers and the dead i had built the bombs without any shrapnel in them so those who had been injured had been trampled in the panic and the dead were those who had already been sacrificed to kali i think we pulled it off without killing anyone as joshua led the children down the wide boulevard and out of the temple square i covered our exit backing down the boulevard my last explosive head swinging in one hand my torch in the other once i saw that joshua and the children were safely away i lit the fuse whirled the head around and let it fly toward the black goddess bitch i said i was out of sight when it exploded joshua and i got as far as a limestone cliff overlooking the ganges before we had to stop to let the children rest they were tired and hungry but mostly they were hungry and we had brought nothing for them to eat at least after joshuas touch they werent afraid and that gave them some peace josh and i were too jangled to sleep so we sat up as the children lay down on the rocks around us and snored like kittens joshua held rumis little daughter vitra and before long her face was smeared with black paint from nuzzling his shoulder all through the night as he rocked the child all i heard joshua say was no more blood no more blood at first light we could see thousands no tens of thousands of people gathering at the banks of the river all dressed in white except for a few old men who were naked they moved into the water and stood facing east heads raised in anticipation dotting the river as far as the eye could see as the sun became a molten fingernail of light on the horizon the muddy surface of the river turned golden the gold light reflected off its surface onto the buildings the shanties the trees the palaces making everything in sight including the worshipers appear to have been gilded and worshipers they were for we could hear their songs from where we sat and although we could not discern the words we could hear that these were the songs of god are those the same people from last night i said they would have to be wouldnt they i dont understand these people i dont understand their religion i dont understand how they think joshua stood and watched the indians bowing and singing to the dawn looking occasionally to the face of the child that slept on his shoulder this is testament to the glory of gods creation whether these people know it or not how can you say that the sacrifices to kali the way the untouchables are treated whatever they might believe in practice their religion is hideous youre right its not right to condemn this child because she was not born a brahman of course not then is it right to condemn her because she is not born a jew what do you mean a man who is born a gentile may not see the kingdom of god are we as hebrews any different from them the lambs at the temple on passover the wealth and power of the sadducees while others go hungry at least the untouchables can reach their reward eventually through karma and rebirth we dont allow any gentile to do so you cant compare what they do to gods law we dont sacrifice human beings we feed our poor we take care of the sick unless the sick are unclean joshua said but josh were the chosen its gods will but is it right he wont tell me what to do so ill say and i say no more youre not just talking about eating bacon are you gautama the buddha gave the way to people of all births to find the hand of god with no blood sacrifice our doors have been marked with blood for too long biff so thats what you think youre going to do bring god to everyone yes after a nap of course i meant after a nap joshua held the little girl so i could see her face as she slept on his shoulder when the children awoke we led them back to their families at the pits handing them into the arms of their mothers who snatched each child away from us as if we were devils incarnate they glared over their shoulders as they carried the babies back to their pits grateful bunch i said they are afraid that weve angered kali and weve brought them another hungry mouth still why did they help us if they didnt want their children back because we told them what to do thats what they do what they are told thats how the brahmans keep them in line if they do what they are told then perhaps they will not be untouchables next life thats depressing joshua nodded we only had little vitra to return to her father now and i was sure that rumi would be happy to see his daughter his distress over losing her had basically been the reason he had saved our lives as we came over the sandstone rise we could see that rumi was not alone in his pit rumi stood on his sitting rock stark naked sprinkling salt on his erect member as a large humpbacked cow which nearly filled the rest of the pit licked at the salt joshua held vitra so she faced away from the pit then backed away as if he didnt want to disturb the moment of beefy intimacy a cow rumi i exclaimed i thought you people had beliefs thats not a cow thats a bull joshua said oh thats got to be your superbonus abomination there where we come from whole cities get destroyed for that kind of thing rumi i reached over and put my hand over vitras eyes stay away from daddy honey or youll turn into a pillar of salt but this is my wife reincarnated oh dont try that one on me rumi for six years i lived in a buddhist monastery where the only female company was a wild yak i know from desperate joshua grabbed my arm you didnt relax im just making a point youre the messiah here josh what do you think i think we need to go to tamil and find the third magus he set vitra down and rumi quickly pulled up his loincloth as the child ran to him go with god rumi joshua said may shiva watch over you you heretics thank you for returning my daughter joshua and i gathered up our clothes and satchels then bought some rice in the market and set out for tamil we followed the ganges south until we came to the sea where joshua and i washed the gore of kali from our bodies we sat on the beach letting the sun dry our skin as we picked pitch out of our chest hairs you know josh i said as i fought a particularly stubborn gob of tar that had stuck in my armpit when you were leading those kids out of the temple square and they were so little and weak but none of them seemed afraidwell it was sort of heartwarming yep i love all the little children of the world you know really he nodded green and yellow black and white good to knowwait green no not green i was just fuckin with you chapter tamil as it turned out was not a small town in southern india but the whole southern peninsula an area about five times the size of israel so looking for melchior was akin to walking into jerusalem on any given day and saying hey im looking for a jewish guy anyone seen him what we had going for us was that we knew melchiors occupation he was an ascetic holy man who lived a nearly solitary life somewhere along the coast and that he like his brother gaspar had been the son of a prince we found hundreds of different holy men or yogis most of them living in complete austerity in the forest or in caves and usually they had twisted their bodies into some impossible posture the first of these i saw was a yogi who lived in a leanto on the side of a hill overlooking a small fishing village he had his feet tucked behind his shoulders and his head seemed to be coming from the wrong end of his torso josh look that guy is trying to lick his own balls just like bartholomew the village idiot these are my people josh these are my people i have found home well i hadnt really found home the guy was just performing some sort of spiritual discipline thats what yoga means in sanskrit discipline and he wouldnt teach me because my intentions werent pure or some claptrap and he wasnt melchior it took six months and the last of our money and we both saw our twentyfifth birthdays before we found melchior reclining in a shallow stone nook in a cliff over the ocean seagulls were nesting at his feet he was a hairier version of his brother which is to say he was slight about sixty years old and he wore a caste mark on his forehead his hair and beard were long and white shot with only a few stripes of black and he had intense dark eyes that seemed to show no white at all he wore only a loincloth and he was as thin as any of the untouchables we had met in kalighat joshua and i clung to the side of the cliff while the guru untied from the human knot hed gotten himself into it was a slow process and we pretended to look at the seagulls and enjoy the view so as not to embarrass the holy man by seeming impatient when he finally achieved a posture that did not appear as if it had been caused by being run over by an ox cart joshua said weve come from israel we were six years with your brother gaspar in the monastery i am i know who you are said melchior his voice was melodic and every sentence he spoke seemed as if he were beginning to recite a poem i recognize you from when i first saw you in bethlehem you do a mans self does not change only his body i see you grew out of the swaddling clothes yes some time ago not sleeping in that manger anymore no some days i could go for a nice manger some straw maybe a blanket not that i need any of those luxuries nor does anyone who is on the spiritual path but still ive come to learn from you joshua said i am to be a bodhisattva to my people and im not sure how to go about it hes the messiah i said helpfully you know the messiah you know son of god yeah son of god joshua said yeah i said yeah said joshua so what do you have for us i asked and who are you biff i said my friend said josh yeah his friend said i and what do you seek actually id like to not have to hang on to this cliff a lot longer my fingers are going numb yeah said josh yeah said i find yourself a couple of nooks on the cliff there are several empty yogis ramata and mahara recently moved on to their next rebirth if you know where we can find some food we would be grateful joshua said its been a long time since weve eaten and we have no money time then for your first lesson young messiah i am hungry as well bring me a grain of rice joshua and i climbed across the cliff until we found two nooks tiny caves really that were close to each other and not so far above the beach that falling out would kill us each of our nooks had been gouged out of the solid rock and was just wide enough to lie down in tall enough to sit up in and deep enough to keep the rain off if it was falling straight down once we were settled i dug through my satchel until i found three old grains of rice that had worked their way into a seam i put them in my bowl then carried the bowl in my teeth as i made my way back to melchiors nook i did not ask for a bowl said melchior joshua had already skirted the cliff and was sitting next to the yogi with his feet dangling over the edge there was a seagull in his lap presentation is half the meal i said quoting something joy had once said melchior sniffed at the rice grains then picked one up and held it between his bony fingertips its raw yes it is we cant eat it raw well i would have served it up steaming with a grain of salt and a molecule of green onion if id known you wanted it that way yeah we had molecules in those days back off very well this will have to do the holy man held the bowl with the rice grains in his lap then closed his eyes his breathing began to slow and after a moment he appeared not to be breathing at all josh and i waited and looked at each other and melchior didnt move his skeletal chest did not rise with breath i was hungry and tired but i waited and the holy man didnt move for almost an hour considering the recent nook vacancies on the cliff face i was a little concerned that melchior might have succumbed to some virulent yogikilling epidemic he dead i asked cant tell poke him no hes my teacher a holy man im not poking him hes untouchable joshua couldnt resist the irony he poked him instantly the yogi opened his eyes pointed out to sea and screamed look a seagull we looked when we looked back the yogi was holding a full bowl of rice here go cook this so began joshuas training to find what melchior called the divine spark the holy man was stern with me but his patience with joshua was infinite and it was soon evident that by trying to be part of joshuas training i was actually holding him back so on our third morning living in the cliff i took a long satisfying whiz over the side and is there anything so satisfying as whizzing from a high place then climbed to the beach and headed into the nearest town to look for a job even if melchior could make a meal out of three grains of rice id scraped all the stray grains out of both my and joshuas satchels the yogi might be able to teach a guy to twist up and lick his own balls but i couldnt see that there was much nourishment in it the name of the town was nicobar and it was about twice the size of sepphoris in my homeland perhaps twenty thousand people most of whom seemed to make their living from the sea either as fishermen traders or shipbuilders after inquiring at only a few places i realized that for once it wasnt my lack of skills that were keeping me from making a living it was the caste system it extended far deeper into the society than rumi had told me subcastes of the larger four dictated that if you were born a stonecutter your sons would be stonecutters and their sons after them and you were bound by your birth to never do any other job regardless of how good or bad you were at it if you were born a mourner or a magician you would die a mourner or a magician and the only way youd get out of death or magic was to die and be reincarnated as something else the one skill that didnt seem to require belonging to a caste was village idiot but the hindus seemed to thrust the more eccentric holy men into this role so i found no openings there i did have my bowl and my experience at collecting alms for the monastery so i tried my hand at begging but every time i would get a good corner staked out along would hop some onelegged blind guy to steal my action by the late afternoon i had one tiny copper coin and the steward of the beggars guild had come along to warn me that if he caught me begging in nicobar again hed see that i was admitted to the guild by the immediate removal of my arms and legs i bought a handful of rice at the market and was skulking out of town my bowl before me and my head down like a good monk when i saw before me a most delicate set of toes painted vermilion and followed by a dainty foot an elegant ankle ajangle with copper bangles an inviting calf decorated with hennaed designs as intricate as lace and from there a bright skirt led me up the seam to a bejeweled navel full breasts haltered in yellow silk lips like plums a nose as long and straight as a roman statues and wide brown eyes shaded in blue and lined to make them look the size of a tigers they drank me in youre a stranger she said one long finger on my chest stopped me on the spot i tried to hide my rice bowl in my shirt and in a fabulous display of sleight of hand ended up spilling the grains down my front im from galilee in israel never heard of it is it far she reached into my shirt and began to pick out the rice grains that had caught against my sash running her fingernail along my stomach muscles and dropping the grains one by one into my bowl very far ive come here with my friend to obtain sacred and ancient knowledge that kind of thing what is your name biffor levi who is called biff we do that who is called thing a lot in israel follow me biff ill show you some ancient and sacred knowledge she hooked her finger into my sash and walked into a nearby doorway for some reason completely confident that i would follow inside amid piles of colorful pillows strewn about the floors and deep carpets the likes of which i hadnt seen since balthasars fortress stood a carved camphorwood stand on which a large codex lay open the book was bound in brass filigreed with copper and silver and the pages were made of a parchment finer than i had ever seen the woman pushed me toward the book and left her hand on my back as i looked at the open page the handwritten script was gilded and so ornate that i could barely make out the words which didnt matter anyway because it was the illustration that caught my eye a man and a woman nude each perfect the man had the woman facedown on a rug her feet hooked over his shoulders her arms held behind her as he entered her i tried to call on my buddhist training and discipline to keep from embarrassing myself in front of the strange woman ancient sacred wisdom she said the book was a gift from a patron the kama sutra its called thread of desire the buddha said that desire is the source of all suffering i said feeling like the kung fu master that i knew i was do they look like they are suffering no i began to tremble i had been too long out of the company of women far too long would you like to try that that suffering with me yes i said all the training all the discipline all the control gone in a word do you have twenty rupees no then suffer she said and she stepped away see i told you then she walked away trailing the scent of sandalwood and roses behind her as she went to the door her hips waving goodbye to me all the way across the room the bangles on her arms and ankles ringing like tiny temple bells calling me to worship at her secret grotto at the door she crooked a finger for me to follow her out and i did my name is kashmir she said come back ill teach you ancient and sacred knowledge one page at time twenty rupees each i took my stupid pathetic useless grains of rice and went back to my holy stupid useless stupid male friends at the cliff i brought some rice i said to joshua when i had climbed to my nook in the cliff melchior can do his rice thing and well have enough for supper josh was sitting on the shelf of his nook his legs folded into the lotus position hands in the mudra of the compassionate buddha melchior is teaching the path to the divine spark joshua said first you have to quiet the mind thats why theres so much physical discipline attention to breath you have to be so completely in control that you can see past the illusion of your body and how is that different from what we did in the monastery its subtle but its different there the mind would ride the wave of action you could meditate while on the exercise posts shooting arrows fighting there was no goal because there was no place to be but in the moment here the goal is to see beyond the moment to the soul i think im getting a glimpse im learning the postures melchior says that an accomplished yogi can pass his entire body through a hoop the size of his head thats great josh useful now let me tell you about this woman i met so i jumped over to joshs ledge and began to tell him about my day the woman the kama sutra and my opinion that this just might be the sort of ancient spiritual information a young messiah might need her name is kashmir which means soft and expensive but shes a prostitute biff prostitutes didnt bother you when you were making me help you learn about sex they still dont bother me its just that you dont have any money i got the feeling she likes me i think maybe shell do me pro bono if you know what i mean i elbowed him in the ribs and winked you mean for the public good you forget your latin pro bono means for the public good oh i thought it meant something else shes not going to do me for that no probably not said josh so the next day first thing i made may way back to nicobar determined to find a job but by noon i found myself sitting on the street next to one of the blind nolegged beggar kids the street was packed with traders haggling making deals exchanging cash for goods and services and the kid was making a killing on the spare change i was astounded at the amount in the kids bowl there must have been enough for three kama sutra pages right there not that i would steal from a blind kid look scooter you look a little tired you want me to watch the bowl while you take a break get your hand out of there the kid caught my wrist me the kung fu master he was quick i can tell what youre doing okay fine how about i show you some magic tricks a little sleight of hand oh thatll be fun im blind look make up your mind im going to call for the guildmaster if you dont go away so i went away despondent defeatednot money enough to look at the edge of a page of the kama sutra i skulked back to the cliffs climbed up to my nook and resolved to console myself with some cold rice left over from last nights supper i opened my satchel and ahhh i leapt back josh what are you doing in there and there he was his beatific old joshua face with the sole of a foot on either side like big ears a few vertebrae showing one hand my yingyang amulet vial and a jar of myrrh get out of there howd you get in there ive mentioned our satchels before the greeks called them wallets i guess you would call them duffel bags they were made of leather had a long strap we could throw over our shoulder and i suppose if youd asked me before i would have said you could get a whole person in one if you had to but not in one piece melchior taught me it took me all morning to get in here i thought id surprise you worked can you get out i dont think so i think my hips are dislocated okay wheres my black glass knife its at the bottom of the bag why did i know you were going to say that if you get me out ill show you what else i learned melchior taught me how to multiply the rice a few minutes later joshua and i were sitting on the ledge of my nook being bombarded by seagulls the seagulls were attracted by the huge pile of cooked rice that lay between us on the ledge thats the most amazing thing ive ever seen except that you really couldnt see it done one minute you had a handful of rice the next a bushel melchior says that it usually takes a lot longer for a yogi to learn to manipulate matter like this how much longer thirty forty years most of the time they pass on before they learn so this is like the healing part of your uh legacy this isnt like the healing biff this can be taught given the time i tossed a handful of rice into the air for some seagulls tell you what melchior obviously doesnt like me so hes not going to teach me anything lets trade knowledge i brought rice to joshua had him multiply it then sold the surplus in the market and eventually i started trading fish instead of rice because i could raise twenty rupees in fewer trips but before that i asked joshua to come to town with me we went to the market which was thick with traders haggling making deals exchanging cash for goods and services and over on the side a blind and legless beggar was making a killing on the change scooter id like you to meet my friend joshua my names not scooter said the waif a half hour later scooter could see again and miraculously his severed legs had been regenerated you bastards said scooter as he ran off on clean new pink feet go with god joshua said now i guess well see how easy it is to earn a living i shouted after the kid he didnt seem very pleased said josh hes only learning to express himself forget him others are suffering as well and so it came to pass that joshua of nazareth moved among them healing them and performing miracles and all the little blind children of nicobar did see again and all the lame did stand up and walk the little fuckers and so the exchange of knowledge began what i was learning from kashmir and the kama sutra for what joshua was learning from the holy man melchior each morning before i went to town and before joshua went to learn from his guru we met on the beach and shared ideas and breakfast usually some rice and a fresh fish roasted over the fire wed gone long enough without eating animal flesh we had decided despite what melchior and gaspar tried to teach us this ability to increase the bounty of foodimagine what we can do for the people of israel of the world yes josh for it is written give a man a fish and he eats for a day but teach a man to be a fish and his friends eat for a week that is not written where is that written amphibians fiveseven theres no friggin amphibians in the bible plague of frogs ha gotcha how longs it been since you had a beating please you cant hit anyone you have to be at total peace with all creation so you can find sparky the wonder spirit the divine spark whatever thouch oh great and what am i supposed to do hit the messiah back turn the other cheek go ahead turn it as i said thus did the enlightened exchange of sacred and ancient teachings begin the kama sutra sayeth when a woman winds her small toes into the armpit hair of the man and the man hops upon one foot while supporting the woman on his lingam and a butter churn then the achieved position is called rhinoceros balancing a jelly donut whats a jelly donut joshua asked i dont know its a vedic term lost to antiquity but it is said to have had great significance to the keepers of the law oh the katha upanishad sayeth beyond the senses are the objects and beyond the objects is the mind beyond the mind is pure reason and beyond reason is the spirit in man whats that supposed to mean you have to think about it but it means that theres something eternal in everyone thats swell whats with the guys on the bed of nails a yogi must leave his body if he is going to experience the spiritual so he leaves through the little holes in his back lets start again the kama sutra sayeth when a man applies wax from the carnuba bean to a womans yoni and buffs it with a lintfree cloth or a papyrus towel until a mirror shine is achieved then it is called readying the mongoose for tradein look she sells me pieces of sheepskin parchment and each time after were finished im allowed to copy the drawings im going to tie them all together and make my own codex you did that that looks like it hurts this from a guy i had to break out of a wine jar with a hammer yesterday yeah well it wouldnt have happened if id remembered to grease my shoulders like melchior taught me joshua turned the drawing to get a different angle on it youre sure this doesnt hurt no not if you keep your bottom away from the incense burners no i mean her oh her well who knows ill ask her the bhagavad gita sayeth i am impartial to all creatures and no one is hateful or dear to me but men devoted to me are in me and i am in them whats the bhagavad gita its like a long poem in which the god krishna advises the warrior arjuna as he drives his chariot into battle really whats he advise him he advises him not to feel bad about killing the enemy because they are essentially already dead you know what id advise him if i was a god id advise him to get someone else to drive his friggin chariot the real god wouldnt be caught dead driving a chariot well you have to look at it as a parable otherwise it sort of reeks of false gods our people dont have good luck with false gods josh theyrei dont knowfrowned upon we get killed and enslaved when we mess with them ill be careful the kama sutra sayeth when a woman props herself up on the table and inhales the steam of the eucalyptus tea while gargling a mixture of lemon water and honey and the man takes the woman by the ears and enters her from behind while looking out the window at the girl across the street hanging out her laundry to dry then the position is called distracted tiger hacking up a fur ball i couldnt find that one in the book so she dictated it to me from memory kashmirs quite the scholar she had the sniffles but agreed to my lesson anyway i think shes falling for me how could she not youre a very charming fellow why thank you josh youre welcome biff okay tell me about your little yoga thing the bhagavad gita sayeth just as the widemoving wind is constantly present in space so all creatures exist in me understand it to be so is that the kind of advice youd give someone whos riding into battle youd think krishna would be saying stuff like look out an arrow duck youd think joshua sighed the kama sutra sayeth the position of rampant monkey collecting coconuts is achieved when a woman hooks her fingers into the mans nostrils and performs a hokeypokey motion with her hips and the man while firmly stroking the womans uvula with his thumbs swings his lingam around her yoni in a direction counter to that in which water swirls down a drain water has been observed swirling down the drain in different directions in different places this is a mystery but a good rule of thumb for achieving rampant monkey is to just go in the direction counter to which your own personal drain swirls your drawings are getting better joshua said in the first one i thought she had a tail im using the calligraphy techniques we learned in the monastery only using them to draw figures josh are you sure it doesnt bother you talking about this stuff when youll never be allowed to do it no its interesting it doesnt bother you when i talk about heaven does it should it look a seagull the katha upanishad sayeth for a man who has known him the light of truth shines for one who has not known there is darkness the wise who have seen him in every being on leaving this life attain life immortal thats what youre looking for huh the divine spark thing its not for me biff josh im not a satchel of sand here i didnt spend all of my time studying and meditating without getting some glimpse of the eternal thats good to know of course it helps when angels show up and you do miracles and stuff too well yes i guess it would but thats not a bad thing we can use that when we get home you have no idea what im talking about do you not a clue our training went on for two years before i saw the sign that called us home life was slow but pleasant there by the sea joshua became more efficient at multiplying food and while he insisted on living an austere lifestyle so he could remain unattached to the material world i was able to get a little money ahead in addition to paying for my lessons i was able to decorate my nook just some erotic drawings curtains some silk cushions and buy a few personal items such as a new satchel an ink stone and a set of brushes and an elephant i named the elephant vana which is sanskrit for wind and although she certainly earned her name i regret it was not due to her blazing speed feeding vana was not a difficulty with joshuas ability to turn a handful of grass into a fodder farm but no matter how hard joshua tried to teach her yoga she was not able to fit into my nook i consoled joshua that it was probably the climb and not his failure as a yoga guru that deterred vana if she had fingers josh shed be snuggling up with me and seagulls right now vana didnt like being on the beach when the tide came and washed sand between her toes so she lived in a pasture just above the cliff she did however love to swim and some days rather than ride her on the beach all the way to nicobar i would have her swim into the harbor just under water with only her trunk showing and me standing on her forehead look kashmir im walking on water im walking on water so eager was my erotic princess to share my embrace that rather than wonder at the spectacle as did the other townsfolk she could only reply park the elephant in back the first few times she said it i thought she was referring to a kama sutra position that we had missed pages stuck together perhaps but it turned out such was not the case kashmir and i became quite close as my studies progressed after we went through all the positions of the kama sutra twice kashmir was able to take things to the next level by introducing tantric discipline into our lovemaking so skillful did we become at the meditative art of coupling that even in the throes of passion kashmir was able to polish her jewelry count her money or even rinse out a few delicates i myself had so mastered the discipline of controlled ejaculation that often i was halfway home before release was at last achieved it was on my way home from kashmirsas vana and i were cutting through the market so that i could show my friends the exbeggar boys the possible rewards for the man of discipline and character to wit i had an elephant and they did notthat i saw outlined on the wall of a temple of vishnu a dirty water stain caused by condensation mold and windblown dust which described the face of my best friends mother mary yeah she does that said joshua when i swung over the edge of his nook and announced the news he and melchior had been meditating and the old man as usual appeared to be dead she used to do it all the time when we were kids she sent james and me running all over the place washing down walls before people saw sometimes her face would appear in a pattern of water drops in the dust or the peelings from grapes would fall just so in a pattern after being taken out of the wine press usually it was walls you never told me that i couldnt tell you the way you idolized her youd have been turning the pictures into shrines so they were naked pictures melchior cleared his throat and we both looked at him joshua either your mother or god has sent you a message it doesnt matter who sent it the message is the same it is time for you to go home we would be leaving for the north in the morning and nicobar was south so i left joshua to pack our things on vana while i walked into town to break the news to kashmir oh my she said all the way back to galilee do you have money for the journey a little but not with you no well okay bye i could swear i saw a tear in her eye as she closed the door the next morning with vana loaded with my drawings and art supplies my cushions curtains and rugs my brass coffeepot my tea ball and my incense burner my pair of breeding mongooses mongeese their bamboo cage my drum set and my umbrella my silk robe my sun hat my rain hat my collection of carved erotic figurines and joshuas bowl we gathered on the beach to say goodbye melchior stood before us in his loincloth the wind whipping the tails of his white beard and hair around his face like fierce clouds there was no sadness in his face but then he had endeavored his entire life to detach from the material world which we were part of hed already done this a long time ago joshua made as if to embrace the old man then instead just poked him in the shoulder once and only once i saw melchior smile but you havent taught me everything i need to know josh said youre right i have taught you nothing i could teach you nothing everything that you needed to know was already there you simply needed the word for it some need kali and shiva to destroy the world so they may see past the illusion to divinity in them others need krishna to drive them to the place where they may perceive what is eternal in them others may perceive the divine spark in themselves only by realizing through enlightenment that the spark resides in all things and in that they find kinship but because the divine spark resides in all does not mean that all will discover it your dharma is not to learn joshua but to teach how will i teach my people about the divine spark before you answer remember were talking about biff too you must only find the right word the divine spark is infinite the path to find it is not the beginning of the path is the word is that why you and balthasar and gaspar followed the star to find the path to the divine spark in all men the same reason that i came to find you we were seekers you are that which is sought joshua you are the source the end is divinity in the beginning is the word you are the word part v lamb i am light now i fly now i see myself beneath myself now a god dances through me friedrich nietzsche chapter we rode vana north toward the silk road skirting the great indian desert that had almost killed alexander the greats forces as they returned to persia after conquering half of the known world three centuries before although it would have saved a month to cut through the desert joshua was not confident about his ability to conjure enough water for vana a man should learn the lessons of history and although i insisted that alexanders men had probably been tired from all that conquering while josh and i had basically been sitting around at the beach for two years he insisted we take the less hostile route through delhi and north into what is now pakistan until we joined the silk road once again a little ways down the silk road i thought we received another message from mary we had stopped to have a short rest when we resumed the journey vana happened to walk over where she had just done her business and the pile was pressed into the perfect likeness of a womans face dark poo against the light gray dust look josh theres another message from your mother josh glanced and looked away thats not my mother but look in the elephant poop its a womans face i know but its not my mother its distorted because of the medium it doesnt even look like her look at the eyes i had to climb to the back of the elephant to get another angle on it he was right it wasnt his mother i guess youre right the medium obscured the message thats what im saying ill bet it looks like someones mom though with the detour around the desert we were nearly two months getting to kabul although vana was an intrepid walker as i have mentioned she was a less than agile climber so we often had to take long detours to get her through the mountains of afghanistan josh and i both knew that we could not take her into the high rocky desert once we passed kabul so we agreed to leave the elephant with joy if we could find the erstwhile courtesan once in kabul we asked around the market for any news of a chinese woman named tiny feet of the divine dance of joyous orgasm but no one had heard of her nor had they seen a woman simply named joy after a full day of searching joshua and i were about to abandon the search for our friend when i remembered something she had once said to me i asked a local tea seller is there a woman who lives around here a very rich woman perhaps who calls herself the dragon lady or something like that oh yes sir the fellow said and he shuddered as he spoke as if a bug had run across his neck she is called the cruel and accursed dragon princess nice name i said to joy as we rode through the massive stone gates into the courtyard of her palace a woman alone it helps to have your reputation precede you said the cruel and accursed dragon princess she looked almost exactly as she had almost nine years ago when we had left except perhaps that she wore a little more jewelry she was petite and delicate and beautiful she wore a white silk robe embroidered with dragons and her blueblack hair hung down her back almost to her knees held in place by a single silver band that just kept it from sweeping around her shoulders when she turned nice elephant she added shes a present joshua said shes lovely do you have a couple of camels you can spare joy i asked oh biff i had really hoped that you two would sleep with me tonight well id love to but josh is still sworn off the muffin young men i have a number of manboys i keep around for well you know not those either joshua said oh joshua my poor little messiah ill bet no one made you chinese food for your birthday this year either we had rice joshua said well well see what the accursed dragon princess can do to make up for that said joy we climbed down from the elephant and exchanged hugs with our old friend then a stern guard in bronze chain mail led vana away to the stables and four guards with spears flanked us as joy led us into the main house a woman alone i said looking at the guards that seemed to stand at every doorway in my heart darling joy said these arent friends family or lovers these are employees is that the accursed part of your new title joshua said i could drop it just be the cruel dragon princess if you two want to stay on we cant weve been called home joy nodded dolefully and led us into the library filled with balthasars old books where coffee was served by young men and women who joy had obviously brought from china i thought of all the girls my friends and my lovers who had been killed by the demon so long ago and swallowed my coffee around a lump in my throat joshua was as excited as i had seen him in a long time it might have been the coffee you wont believe the wonderful things ive learned since i left here joy about being the agent of change change is at the root of belief you know and about compassion for everyone because everyone is part of another and most important that there is a bit of god in each of usin india they call it the divine spark he rambled on like that for an hour and eventually my melancholy passed and i was infected by joshuas enthusiasm for the things he had learned from the magi yes i added and josh can climb inside a standardsize wine amphora you have to bust him out with a hammer but its interesting to watch and you biff joy asked smiling into her cup well after supper ill show you a little something i like to call water buffalo teasing the seeds out of the pomegranate that sounds dont worry its not that hard to learn i have pictures we were four days at joys palace enjoying comfort food and drink such as we hadnt experienced since wed last seen her i could have stayed forever but on the morning of the fifth day joshua stood at the entrance to joys bedchamber his satchel slung over his shoulder he didnt say a word he didnt have to we shared breakfast with joy and she met us at the gate to say goodbye thanks for the elephant she said thanks for the camels joshua said thanks for the sex book joy said thanks for the sex i said oh i forgot you owe me a hundred rupees joy said i had told her about kashmir the cruel and accursed dragon princess grinned at me just kidding be well my friend keep that amulet i gave you and remember me huh of course i kissed her and climbed on my camels back then coaxed him to his feet joy embraced joshua and kissed him on the lips hard and long he didnt seem to be trying to push her away hey we had better go josh i said joy held the messiah at arms length and said you are always welcome here you know that josh nodded then climbed on his camel go with god joy he said as we rode through the gates of the palace the guards shot fire arrows that trailed long tails of sparks over us until they exploded above the road ahead joys last goodbye to us a tribute to the friendship and arcane knowledge we had all shared it scared the bejeezus out of the camels after we had been on the road awhile joshua asked did you say goodbye to vana i intended to but when i went to the stable she was practicing her yoga and i didnt want to disturb her no kidding really she was sitting in one of the postures you taught her joshua smiled it didnt hurt anything for him to believe that the journey on the silk road through the high deserts took us over a month but it was fairly uneventful except for one attack by a small group of bandits when i caught the first two spears they flung at me and flung them right back wounding the two who had thrown them they turned and ran the weather was mild or as mild as one can expect in a deadly and brutal desert but by now joshua and i had traveled so much in this sort of harsh country that there was little that affected us just before we reached antioch however a sandstorm whipped up out of the desert that left us hiding between our camels for two days breathing through our shirts and washing the mud out of our mouths every time we took a drink the storm settled enough to travel and we were at a veritable gallop in the streets of antioch when joshua located an inn by impacting with its sign on his forehead he was knocked back off his camel and sat up in the street with blood streaming down his face are you hurt badly i asked kneeling beside him i could barely see in the driving dust joshua looked at the blood on his hands where he had touched his forehead i dont know it doesnt hurt that badly but i cant tell inside i said helping him to his feet and through the door of the inn shut the door the innkeeper shouted as the wind whipped through the room were you born in a barn yeah said joshua he was i said angels on the roof though shut the damn door said the innkeeper i left joshua sitting there by the door while i went out and found shelter for the camels when i returned joshua was wiping his face with a linen cloth that someone had handed to him a couple of men stood over him eager to help i handed the cloth to one of them and examined joshs wounds youll live a big bump and two cuts but youll live you cant do the healing thing on joshua shook his head hey look at this one of the travelers who had helped joshua said holding up the piece of linen joshua had used to wipe his face the dust and blood from joshs face had left a perfect likeness on the linen even handprints where hed gotten blood from his head wound can i keep this the fellow said he was speaking latin but with a strange accent sure i said where are you fellahs from were from the ligurian tribe from the territories north of rome a city on the po river called turin have you heard of it no i havent you know you fellahs can do what you want with that cloth but out on my camel ive got some erotic drawings from the east that are going to be worth something someday i can let you have them for a very fair price the turinians went off holding their pathetic swath of muddy cloth like it was some kind of holy relic ignorant bastards wouldnt know art if you nailed them to it i bandaged joshuas wounds and we checked into the inn for the night in the morning we decided to keep our camels and take the land route home through damascus as we passed out of the gates of damascus on the final leg home joshua started to worry im not ready to be the messiah biff if im being called home to lead our people i dont even know where to start i understand the things i want to teach but i dont have the words yet melchior was right about that before anything you have to have the word well its not just going to come to you in a flash here on the damascus road josh that sort of thing doesnt happen youre obviously supposed to learn what you need to know in its own time to everything a season yada yada yada my father could have made learning all this easier he could have just told me what i was supposed to do i wonder how maggies doing you think she got fat im trying to talk about god here about the divine spark about bringing the kingdom to our people i know you are so am i do you want to do all of that without help i guess not well thats why i was thinking about maggie she was smarter than us before we left shes probably smarter than us now she was smart wasnt she she wanted to be a fisherman said josh grinning i could tell that the thought of seeing maggie tickled him you cant tell her about all the whores josh i wont or joy and the girls or the old woman with no teeth i wont tell her about any of them not even the yak there was nothing with the yak the yak and i werent even on speaking terms you know she probably has a dozen children by now i know i sighed they should be mine and mine joshua sighed back i looked at him as he rode beside me in a sea of gently loping camel waves he was staring off at the horizon looking forlorn yours and mine you think they should be yours and mine sure why not you know i love all the little you are such a doofus sometimes do you think shell remember us i mean how we all were back then i thought about it and shuddered i hope not no sooner did we pass into galilee than we began to hear about what john the baptist was doing in judea hundreds have followed him into the desert we heard in gischala some say he is the messiah one man told us in baca herod is afraid of him said a woman in cana hes another crazy holy man said a roman soldier in sepphoris the jews breed them like rabbits i hear he drowns anyone who doesnt agree with him first sensible idea ive heard since i was sent to this accursed territory may i have your name soldier i asked caius junius of the sixth legion thank you well keep you in mind to josh i said caius junius front of the line when we start shoving romans out of the kingdom into the fiery abyss what did you say said the roman no no dont thank me you earned it right at the front of the line you go caius biff josh barked and once he had my attention he whispered try not to get us thrown into prison before we get home please i nodded and waved to the legionnaire as we rode away just crazy jew talk pay no attention whimper fidelis i said we have to find john after we see our families joshua said do you think that hes really claiming to be the messiah no but it sounds like he knows how to get the word out we rode into nazareth a half hour later i suppose we expected more upon our arrival cheering maybe little children running at our heels begging for tales of our great adventures tears and laughter kisses and hugs strong shoulders to bear the conquering heroes through the streets what wed forgotten was that while we were traveling having adventures and experiencing wonders the people of nazareth had been living through the same old daytoday crapa lot of days had passed and a lot of crap when we rode up to joshuas old house his brother james was working outside under the awning shaving a piece of olive wood into a strut for a camel saddle i knew it was james the moment i saw him he had joshuas narrow hooked nose and wide eyes but his face was more weathered than joshs and his body heavier with muscle he looked ten years older than joshua rather than the two years younger that he was he put down his spoke shave and stepped out in the sunlight holding up a hand to shield his eyes joshua joshua tapped his camel on the back of his knees with the long riding crop and the beast lowered him to the ground james joshua climbed off the camel and went to his brother his arms out as if to embrace him but james stepped back ill go tell mother that her favorite son has returned james turned away and i saw the tears literally shoot out of joshuas eyes into the dust james joshua was pleading i didnt know when james turned and looked his half brother in the eye there was no pity there no grief just anger two months ago joshua joseph died two months ago he asked for you i didnt know joshua said still holding his arms out for the embrace that wasnt going to come go inside mother has been waiting for you she starts every morning wondering if this is the day youll return go inside he turned away as joshua went past him into the house then james looked up at me the last thing he said was tell the bastard i love him the bastard i said as i coaxed my camel to let me down thats what he always called joshua i wonder how the bastard is doing i wonder where the bastard is today always talking about the bastard and mother yammering on always about how joshua did this and joshua did that and what great things joshua would do when he returned and all the while im the one looking out for my brothers and sisters taking care of them when father got sick taking care of my own family still was there any thanks a kind word no i was doing nothing more than paving joshuas road you have no idea what its like to always be second to joshua really i said youll have to tell me about that sometime i said tell josh if he needs me ill be at my fathers house my father is still alive isnt he yes and your mother too oh good i didnt want to put one of my brothers through breaking the painful news i turned and led my camel away go with god levi james said i turned james it is written to the work you are entitled but not the fruits thereof ive never heard that where is that written in the bhagavad gita james its a long poem about going into battle and this warriors god tells him not to worry about killing his kinsmen in battle because they are already dead they just dont know it yet i dont know what made me think of it my father hugged me until i thought hed broken my ribs then he handed me off to my mother who did the same until she seemed to come to her senses then she began to cuff me about the head and shoulders with her sandal which she had whipped off with surprising speed and dexterity for a woman her age seventeen years youre gone and you couldnt write you dont know how to read so you couldnt send word smart mouth i fended off the blows by directing their energy away from me as i had been taught at the monastery and soon two small boys who i didnt recognize were catching the brunt of the beating fearing lawsuits from small strangers i caught my mothers arms and hugged them to her sides as i looked at my father nodded to the two little ones and raised my eyebrows as if to say who are the squirts those are your brothers moses and japeth my father said moses is six and japeth is five the little guys grinned both were missing front teeth probably sacrificed to the squirming harpy i was currently holding at bay my father beamed as if to say i can still build the aqueductlay a little pipe if you know what i meanwhen i need to i scowled as if to say look i was barely able to hold on to my respect for you when i found out what you did to make the first three of us these little fellows are only evidence that youve no memory for suffering mother if i let you go will you calm down i looked over her shoulder at japeth and moses i used to tell people she was besought by a demon do you guys do that i winked at them they giggled as if to say please end our suffering kill us kill us now or kill this bitch that plagues us like the torments of job okay maybe i was just imagining thats what they were saying maybe they were just giggling i let my mother go and she backed off japeth moses mother said come meet biff youve heard your father and me talk about our oldest disappointmentwell this is him now run and get your other brothers ill go fix something nice my brothers shem and lucius brought their families and joined us for dinner and we all lay around the table as mother served us something nice im not sure what it was i know ive said that i was the oldest of three brothers and obviously with the squirts it was five but dammit by the time i met japeth and moses i was too old to have the time to torment them so they never really paid their dues as brothers they were more like oh pets mother ive brought you a gift from the east i said running out to the camel to retrieve a package what is it its a breeding mongoose i said tapping on the cage the little scamp tried to bite the pad off of my finger but theres only one well there were two but one escaped so now theres one theyll attack a snake ten times their size it looks like a rat i lowered my voice and whispered conspiratorially in india the women train them to sit on their heads like hats very fashionable of course the fad hasnt reached galilee yet but in antioch no selfrespecting woman will go out of the house without wearing a mongoose really said mother looking at the mongoose in a new light she took the cage and stowed it gently away in the corner as if it contained a delicate egg rather than a vicious miniature of herself so said mother waving to her two daughtersinlaw and the halfdozen grandchildren that loitered near the table your brothers married and gave me grandchildren im happy for them mother shem and lucius hid their grins behind a crust of flatbread the same way they did when we were little and mother was giving me hell all the places you traveled you never met a nice girl you could settle down with no mother you can marry a gentile you know it would break my heart but why did the tribes almost wipe out the benjamites if it wasnt so a desperate boy could marry a gentile if he needs to not a samaritan but you know some other gentile if you have to thanks mother ill keep that in mind mother pretended to find some lint or something on my collar which she picked at while she said so your friend joshua never married either you heard about his little sister miriam didnt you here her voice went to a conspiratorial whisper started wearing mens clothes and ran off to the island of lesbos back to normal nudging tone thats greek you know you boys didnt go to greece on your travels did you no mother i really have to go i tried to stand and she grabbed me its because your father has a greek name isnt it i told you alphaeus change the name but you said you were proud of it well i hope youre proud of it now whats next lucius here will start hanging jews on crosses like the other romans im not a roman mother lucius said wearily lots of good jews have latin names not that it matters mother but how do you think they get more greeks to my mothers credit she stopped for a second to think i used the lull to escape nice to see you guys i nodded to all of my relatives old and new ill come by and visit before i go i have to go check on joshua and i was out the door i threw the door open at joshuas old house without even knocking nearly coldcocking joshuas brother judah in the process josh youve got to bring the kingdom soon or im going to have to kill my mother she still plagued by demons asked judah who looked exactly as he had when he was four except for the beard and the receding hairline but he was as wideeyed and goofy of smile as he had ever been no i was just being hopeful when i used to say that will you join us for supper said mary thank god she had aged gone a little thicker around the hips and waist developed some lines at the corner of her eyes and mouth now she was just the second or third most beautiful creature on earth love to i said james must have been home with his wife and children as i guessed were the other sisters and brothers except for miriam and id already been apprised of her whereabouts at the table it was only mary joshua judah his pretty wife ruth and two little redheaded girls that looked like their mother i expressed my condolences for the familys loss and joshua filled me in on the timing of events about the time that i spotted marys portrait on the temple wall in nicobar joseph had taken ill with some disease of the water he started peeing blood and in a week he was bedridden he lingered only a week longer before he died hed been buried for two months now i looked at joshua as mary related this part of the story and he shook his head meaning too long in the grave theres nothing i can do mary had known nothing about a message calling us home even if you two had only been in damascus youd have been lucky to get here in time he went so fast she was strong had recovered somewhat from the loss but joshua appeared to still be in shock you have to go find joshuas cousin john mary said hes been preaching about the coming of the kingdom of preparing the way for the messiah weve heard i said ill stay here with you mother joshua said james is right i have responsibilities ive shirked them too long mary touched her sons face and looked in his eyes you will leave in the morning and you will find john the baptist in judea and you will do what god has ordained you do since he placed you in my womb your responsibilities are not to a bitter brother or an old woman joshua looked at me can you leave in the morning i know its soon after being gone so long actually i thought id stay josh your mother needs someone to look after her and shes still a relatively attractive woman i mean a guy could do worse judah aspirated an olive pit and began coughing furiously until joshua pounded him on the back and the pit shot across the room leaving judah gasping and staring at me through watery red eyes i put my hand on joshua and judahs shoulders i think i can learn to love you both as sons i looked at the pretty but shy ruth who was tending the little girls and you ruth i hope that you can learn to love me as a slightly older but incredibly attractive close uncle and you mary will you go with joshua to judea biff mary interrupted sure first thing in the morning joshua and judah were still staring at me as if theyd both been smacked in the face with a large fish what i said how long have you guys known me jeez grow a sense of humor our father died said joshua yeah but not today i said ill meet you here in the morning the next morning as we rode through the square we passed bartholomew the village idiot who looked no worse or less filthy for the years gone by and who seemed to have come to some sort of understanding with his doggy friends instead of jumping all over him as they always had now they sat quietly before him in a group as if listening to a sermon where have you been bart called to us in the east why did you go there we were looking for the divine spark joshua said but we didnt know that when we left where are you going to judea to find john the baptist he should be easier to find than the spark can i come sure i said bring your things i dont have any things then bring your stench that will follow on its own bartholomew said and thus we became three chapter ive finally finished reading these stories by matthew mark luke and john these guys make the whole thing seem like an accident like five thousand people just showed up on a hill one morning if that was the case getting them all there was the miracle let alone feeding them we busted our asses to organize sermons like that and sometimes we even had to put joshua in a boat and float him offshore while he preached just to keep him from getting mobbed that boy was a security nightmare and thats not all there were two sides to joshua his preaching side and his private side the guy who stood there railing at the pharisees was not the same guy who would sit around poking untouchables in the arm because it cracked him up he planned the sermons he calculated the parables although he may have been the only one in our group that understood any of them what im saying is that these guys matthew mark luke and john they got some of it right the big stuff but they missed a lot like thirty years for instance ill try to fill it in which is why i guess the angel brought me back from the dead and speaking of the angel im about convinced that hes gone psycho no psycho isnt a word i had back in my time but enough television and ill have a whole new vocabulary it applies i believe for instance that psycho was the perfect term for john the baptist more about him later raziel took me to a place where you wash clothes today a laundromat we were there all day he wanted to make sure i knew how to wash clothes i may not be the sharpest arrow in the quiver but its laundry for christs sake he quizzed me for an hour about sorting whites and colors i may never get this story told if the angel keeps deciding to teach me life lessons tomorrow miniature golf i can only guess that raziel is trying to prepare me to be an international spy bartholomew and his stench rode one camel while joshua and i shared the other we rode south to jerusalem then east over the mount of olives into bethany where we saw a yellowhaired man sitting under a fig tree i had never seen a yellowhaired person in israel other than the angel i pointed him out to joshua and we watched the blond man long enough to convince ourselves that he wasnt one of the heavenly host in disguise actually we pretended to watch him we were watching each other bartholomew said is there something wrong you two seem nervous its just that blond kid i said trying to look in the courtyards of the large houses as we passed maggie lives here with her husband joshua said looking at me relieving no tension whatsoever i knew that said bart hes a member of the sanhedrin high up they say the sanhedrin was a council of priests and pharisees who made most of the decisions for the jewish community as far as the romans would allow them anyway aside from the herods and pontius pilate the roman governor they were the most powerful men in israel i was really hoping jakan would die young they have no children joshua said what josh was saying was that it was strange that jakan hadnt divorced maggie for being barren my brother told me i said we cant go see her i know i said although i wasnt sure why not we finally found john in the desert north of jericho preaching on the bank of the jordan river his hair was as wild as ever and now he had a beard that was just as out of control he wore a rough tunic that was belted with a sash of unscraped camel skin there was a crowd of perhaps five hundred people there standing in sun so hot that you had to check road signs to make sure you hadnt accidentally taken the turnoff to hell we couldnt tell what john was talking about from a distance but as we got closer we heard him say no im not the one im just getting things ready theres one thats coming after me and im not qualified to carry his jockstrap whats a jockstrap joshua asked its an essene thing bartholomew answered they wear them on their manhood very tightly to control their sinful urges then john spotted us over the crowd we were on camelback there said john pointing you remember me telling you that one would come well there he is right there im not kidding thats him on the camel on the left behold the lamb of god the crowd looked back at josh and me then laughed politely as if to say oh right he just happened along right when you were talking about him what we dont know from a shill when we see one joshua glanced nervously at me then at bart then at me then he grinned sheepishly as one might expect from a lamb at the crowd between gritted teeth he asked so am i supposed to give john my jockstrap or something just wave and say go with god bart said waving herewaving there josh mumbled through a grin go with god thank you very much go with god nice to see you wavingwaving louder josh were the only ones who can hear you josh turned to us so the crowd couldnt see his face i didnt know i was going to need a jockstrap nobody told me jeez you guys thus did begin the ministry of joshua bar joseph ish nazareth the lamb of god so whos the big guy john asked as we sat around the fire that evening night crawled across the desert sky like a black cat with phosphorus dandruff bartholomew rolled with his dogs down by the riverbank thats bartholomew joshua said hes a cynic and the village idiot of nazareth for over thirty years i added he gave up his position to follow joshua hes a slut and hes the first one baptized in the morning he stinks more locusts biff no thanks im full i stared down at my bowl of roasted locusts and honey you were supposed to dip the locusts in the honey for a sweet and nutritious treat it was all john ate so this divine spark all that time away thats what you found its the key to the kingdom john josh said thats what i learned in the east that im supposed to bring to our people that god is in all of us we are all brothers in the divine spark i just dont know how to spread the word well first you cant call it the divine spark the people wont understand it this thing its in everyone its permanent its a part of god not god the creator my father the part of god thats spirit holy ghost john said with a shrug call it the holy ghost people understand that a ghost is in you and they understand that it goes on after you and youll just have to make them believe that its god thats perfect joshua said smiling so this holy ghost john said biting a locust in half its in every jew but gentiles dont have it right i mean whats the point after the kingdom comes i was getting to that said josh it took john the better part of the night to deal with the fact that joshua was going to let gentiles into the kingdom but finally the baptist accepted it although he kept looking for exceptions even sluts even sluts joshua said especially sluts i said youre the one who is cleansing people of their sins so they will be forgiven joshua added i know but gentile sluts in the kingdom he shook his head assured now by the messiah himself that the world was going to hell in a handbasket which really shouldnt have surprised him since that had been his message for over ten years that and identifying sluts let me show you where youll be staying shortly after i had met him on the road to jerusalem john had joined the essenes you couldnt be born an essene because they were all celibate even in marriage they also refrained from intoxicating drink adhered strictly to jewish dietary law and were absolutely maniacal about cleansing themselves physically of sin which had been the big selling point for john they had a thriving community in the desert outside of jericho called qumran a small city of stone and brick homes a scriptorium for copying scrolls and aqueducts that ran out of the mountains to fill their ritual baths a few of them lived in the caves above the dead sea where they stored the jars that held their sacred scrolls but the most zealous of the essenes which included john didnt even allow themselves the comfort of a cave he showed us accommodations near his own its a pit i screamed three pits to be exact i suppose theres something to be said for having a private pit bartholomew with his many canine pals was already settling into his new pit oh john josh said remind me to tell you about karma so for over a year while joshua was learning from john how to say the words that would make people follow him i lived in a pit it makes sense if you think about it for seventeen years joshua had spent his time either studying or sitting around being quiet so what did he know about communicating the last message hed gotten from his father was two words so he wasnt getting his speaking skills from that side of the family on the other hand john had been preaching for those same seventeen years and that squirrelly bastard could preach standing waist deep in the jordan he would wave his arms and roll his eyes and stir the air with a sermon that would make you believe the clouds were going to open and the hand of god hisownself was going to reach down grab you by the balls and shake you till the evil rattled out of you like loose baby teeth an hour of johns preaching and you were not only lining up to be baptized youd jump right in the river and try to breathe the bottom muck just to be relieved of your own wretchedness joshua watched and listened and learned john was an absolute believer in who joshua was and what he was going to do as far as he understood anyway but the baptist worried me john was attracting the attention of herod antipas herod had married his brother philips wife herodia without her obtaining a divorce which was forbidden by jewish law an absolute outrage by the more severe laws of the essenes and a subject that fit well into johns pervasive slut theme i was starting to notice soldiers from herods personal guard hovering around the edge of johns crowds when he preached i confronted the baptist one evening when he came out of the wilderness in one of his evangelical rages to ambush me joshua bartholomew and a new guy as we sat around eating our locusts slut john shouted with his thunder of elijah voice waving a finger under barts nose yeah john bartholomews been getting laid a lot i said evangelizing for sarcasm almost said bart i mean with another human being bart oh sorry never mind john wheeled on the new guy who put his hands up im new he said thus rebuked john spun to face joshua celibate joshua said always have been always will be not happy about it finally john turned to me slut john im cleansed you baptized me six times today joshua elbowed me in the ribs what it was hot point is i counted fifty soldiers in the crowd today so ease up a little on the slut talk youre backed up or something you really need to rethink this no marriage no sex no fun ascetic thing and the honeyandlocust livingina pit thing said the new guy hes no different than melchior or gaspar joshua said they were both ascetics melchior and gaspar werent running around calling the provincial governor a slut in front of hundreds of people its a big difference and its going to get him killed i am cleansed of sin and unafraid said john sitting down by the fire now some of his verve gone yeah are you cleansed of guilt because youre going to have the blood of thousands on your hands when the romans come to get you in case you havent noticed they dont just kill the leaders of a movement theres a thousand crosses on the road to jerusalem where zealots died and they werent all leaders i am unafraid john hung his head until the ends of his hair were dipping into the honey in his bowl herodia and herod are sluts hes as close as we have to a jewish king and hes a slut joshua pushed his cousins hair out of his eyes and squeezed the wild mans shoulder if it be so then so be it as the angel foretold you were born to preach the truth i stood up and tossed my locusts into the fire showering sparks over john and joshua ive only met two people whose births were announced by angels and threequarters of them are loony and i stormed off to my pit amen said the new guy that night as i was falling asleep i heard joshua scrambling in the pit next to mine as if a bug or an idea had roused him from his bedroll hey he said what i replied i just did the math three quarters of two is one and a half said the new guy who had moved into the pit on the other side of josh so johns either all crazy and youre half crazy or youre threequarters crazy and johns threequarters crazy orwellactually its a constant ratio id have to graph it out for you so what are you saying nothing said the new guy im new the next morning joshua leapt out of his pit shook off the scorpions and after a long morning whiz kicked some dirt clods into my pit to thunk me from my slumber this is it joshua said come down to the river im going to have john baptize me today which will make it different from yesterday in what way youll see i have a feeling and off he went the new guy prairiedogged up out of his pit he was tall the new guy and the morning sun caught on his bald scalp as he looked around he noticed some flowers growing where joshua had just relieved himself lush blossoms of a halfdozen vibrant colors stood surrounded by the deadest landscape on the planet hey were those there yesterday that always happens i said we dont talk about it wow said the new guy can i tag along with you guys sure i said and thus did we become four at the river john preached to a small gathering as he lowered joshua into the water as soon as joshua went under the water a rift opened across the desert sky which was still pink with the dawn and out of the rift came a bird that looked to be fashioned from pure light and everyone on the riverbank said ooh and ahh and a big voice boomed out of the heavens saying this is my son with whom i am well pleased and as quickly as it had come the spirit was gone but the gatherers at the riverbank stood with their mouths open in amazement staring yet into the sky and john came to his senses then and remembered what he was doing and lifted joshua out of the water and joshua wiped the water out of his eyes looked at the crowd who stood stunned with mouths hanging open and he said unto them what no really josh thats what the voice said this is my son with whom i am well pleased joshua shook his head and chewed a breakfast locust i cant believe he couldnt wait until i came up youre sure it was my father sounded like him the new guy looked at me and i shrugged actually it sounded like james earl jones but i didnt know that back then thats it said joshua im going into the desert like moses did forty days and forty nights joshua got up and started walking into the desert from here on out im fasting until i hear something from my father that was my last locust i wish i could say that said the new guy as soon as joshua was out of sight i ran to my pit and packed my satchel i was a half day getting to bethany and another hour asking around before someone could direct me to the house of jakan prominent pharisee and member of the sanhedrin the house was made of the goldentinged limestone that marked all of jerusalem and there was a high wall around the courtyard jakan had done very well for himself the prick you could house a dozen families from nazareth in a house this size i paid two blind guys a shekel each to stand by the wall so i could climb on their shoulders how much did he say this was he said it was a shekel doesnt feel like a shekel would you guys quit feeling your shekels and stand still im going to fall i peeped over the top of the wall and there sitting under the shade of an awning working at a small loom was maggie if she had changed it was only that shed become more radiant more sensuous more of a woman and less of a girl i was stunned i guess i expected some sort of disappointment thinking that my time and my love might have shaped a memory that the woman could never live up to then i thought perhaps the disappointment was yet to come she was married to a rich man a man who when i knew him had been a bully and a dolt and what had always really made maggies memory in my mind was her spirit her courage and her wit i wondered if those things could have survived all these years with jakan i started to shake bad balance or fear i dont know but i put my hand on top of the wall to steady myself and cut myself on some broken pottery that had been set in mortar along the top ouch dammit biff maggie said as she looked me in the eye right before i tumbled off the shoulders of the blind guys i had just climbed to my feet when maggie came around the corner and hit me fullfrontal womanhood full speed leading with lips she kissed me so hard that i could taste blood from my cut lips and it was glorious she smelled the samecinnamon and lemon and girl sweatand felt better than memory could ever allow when she finally relaxed her embrace and held me at arms length there were tears in her eyes and mine he dead said one of the blind men dont think so i can hear him breathing sure smells better than he did biff your face cleared up maggie said you recognized me with the beard and everything i wasnt sure at first she said so i was taking a risk jumping you like that but in the midst of it all i recognized that she pointed to where my tunic had tented out in the front and then she grabbed that betraying rascal shirtfront and all and led me down the wall toward the gate by it come on in you cant stay long but we can catch up are you okay she said looking over her shoulder giving me a squeeze yeah yeah im just trying to think of a metaphor he got a woman from up there i heard one of the old blind guys say yeah i heard her drop boost me up ill feel around in the courtyard with maggie over wine i said so you really didnt recognize me of course i recognized you ive never done that before i just hope no one saw me they still stone women for that i know oh maggie i have so much to tell you she took my hand i know she looked into my eyes past my eyes her blue eyes looking for something beyond me hes fine i said finally hes gone into the desert to fast and wait for a message from the lord she smiled there was a little of my blood in the corners of her mouth or maybe that was wine hes come home to take his place as the messiah then yes but i dont think the way people think people think that john might be the messiah john ishes hes really pissing herod off maggie offered i know are you and josh going to stay with john i hope not i want joshua to leave i just have to get him away from john long enough to see whats going on maybe this fast the iron lock on the gate to the courtyard rattled then the whole gate shook maggie had locked it behind us after wed entered a man cursed evidently jakan was having trouble with his key maggie stood and pulled me to my feet look im going to a wedding in cana next month with my sister martha the week after tabernacles jakan cant go hes got some meeting of the sanhedrin or something come to cana bring joshua ill try she ran to the closest wall and held her hand in a stirrup over but maggie dont be a wuss step handsstep shouldersand over be careful of the pottery on top and i randid exactly as shed said one foot in the stirrup one on her shoulder and over the wall before jakan could get in the gate got one said one of the old blind guys as i tumbled down on top of them hold her still while i stick it in i was sitting on a boulder waiting for joshua when he came out of the desert i held out my arms to hug him and he fell forward letting me catch him i lowered him to the rock where i had been sitting he had been smart enough to coat all the exposed parts of his skin with mud probably mixed from his own urine to protect it from burning but in a few spots on his forehead and hands the mud had crumbled away and the skin was gone burned to raw flesh his arms were as thin as a small girls they swam in the wide sleeves of his tunic you okay he nodded i handed him a water skin i had been keeping cool in the shade he drank in little sips pacing himself locust i said holding up one of the crispy torments between my thumb and forefinger at the sight of it i thought joshua would vomit the water he had just drunk just kidding i said i whipped open the mouth of my satchel revealing dates fresh figs olives cheese a halfdozen flat loaves of bread and a full wineskin id sent the new guy into jericho the day before to bring back the food josh looked at the food spilling out of the satchel and grinned then covered his mouth with his hand ow ouch ow whats wrong lipschapped myrrh i said pulling a small jar of the ointment from the satchel and handing it to him an hour later the son of god was refreshed and rejuvenated and we sat sharing the last of the wine the first that joshua had had since wed come home from india over a year ago so what did you see in the desert the devil the devil yep he tempted me power wealth sex that sort of thing i turned him down what did he look like he was tall tall the prince of darkness the serpent of temptation the source of all corruption and evil and all you can say about him is he was tall pretty tall oh good ill be on the lookout then joshua said pointing at the new guy hes tall too i realized then that the messiah might be a little tipsy not the devil josh well who is he then im philip said the new guy im going with you to cana tomorrow joshua wheeled around to me and almost fell off his rock were going to cana tomorrow yes maggies there josh shes dying chapter philip who was called the new guy asked that we go to cana by way of bethany as he had a friend there that he wanted to recruit to follow along with us i tried to get him to join with john the baptist philip said but he wouldnt stand for the eatinglocusts livinginpits thing anyway hes from cana im sure hed love to have a visit home as we came into the square of bethany philip called out to a blond kid who was sitting under a fig tree he was the same yellowhaired kid that joshua and i had seen when we first passed through bethany over a year ago hey nathaniel philip called come join me and my friends on the way to cana theyre from nazareth joshua here might be the messiah might be i said nathaniel walked out into the street to look at us shading his eyes against the sun he couldnt have been more than sixteen or seventeen he barely had the fuzz of a beard on his chin can anything good come out of nazareth he said joshua biff bartholomew philip said this is my friend nathaniel i know you joshua said i saw you when we last passed through here then inexplicably nathaniel fell to his knees in front of joshuas camel and said you are truly the messiah and the son of god joshua looked at me then at philip then at the kid prostrating himself on camels feet because ive seen you before you believe that im the messiah even though a minute ago nothing good could come out of nazareth sure why not said nathaniel and josh looked at me again as if i could explain it meanwhile bartholomew who was on foot along with his pack of doggie followers whom he had disturbingly begun to refer to as his disciples went over to nathaniel and helped the boy to his feet stand up if youre coming with us nathaniel prostrated himself before bartholomew now you are truly the messiah and the son of god no im not bart said lifting the kid to his feet he is bart pointed to joshua nathaniel looked to me for some reason for confirmation you are truly a babe in the woods i said to nathaniel you dont gamble do you biff joshua said he shook his head and i shrugged to nathaniel he said youre welcome to join us we share the camels our food and what little money we have here joshua nodded toward philip who had been nominated to carry the communal purse because he was good at math thanks said nathaniel and he fell in behind us and thus we became five josh i said in a harsh whisper that kid is as dumb as a stick hes not dumb biff he just has a talent for belief fine i said turning to philip dont let the kid anywhere near the money as we headed out of the square toward the mount of olives abel and crustus the two old blind guys whod helped me over maggies wall called out from the gutter id learned their names after correcting their little gender mistake oh son of david have mercy on us joshua pulled up on the reins of his camel what makes you call me that you are joshua of nazareth the young preacher who was studying under john yes i am joshua we heard the lord say that you were his son with whom he was well pleased you heard that yes about five or six weeks ago right out of the sky dammit did everyone hear but me have mercy on us joshua said one blind guy yeah mercy said the other then joshua climbed down from his camel laid his hands upon the old mens eyes and said you have faith in the lord and you have heard as evidently everyone in judea has that i am his son with whom he is well pleased then he pulled his hands from their faces and the old men looked around tell me what you see joshua said the old guys sort of looked around saying nothing so tell me what you see the blind men looked at each other something wrong joshua asked you can see cant you well yeah said abel but i thought thered be more color yeah said crustus its kind of dull i stepped up youre on the edge of the judean desert one of the most lifeless desolate hostile places on earth what did you expect i dont know crustus shrugged more yeah more said abel what color is that thats brown how about that one that would be brown as well that color over there right there brown youre sure thats not mauve nope brown and brown i said the two former blind guys shrugged and walked off mumbling to each other excellent healing said nathaniel i for one have never seen a better healing said philip but then im new joshua rode off shaking his head when we came into cana we were broke and hungry and more than ready for a feast at least most of us were joshua didnt know about the feast the wedding was being held in the courtyard of a very large house we could hear the drums and singers and smell spiced meat cooking as we approached the gates it was a large wedding and a couple of kids were waiting outside to tend to our camels they were curly haired wiry little guys about ten years old they reminded me of evil versions of josh and me at that age sounds like a wedding going on joshua said park your camel sir said the camelparking kid it is a wedding said bart i thought we were here to help maggie park your camel sir said the other kid pulling on the reins of my camel joshua looked at me where is maggie you said she was sick shes in the wedding i said pulling the reins back from the kid you said she was dying well we all are arent we i mean if you think about it i grinned you cant park that camel here sir look kid i dont have any money to tip you go away i hate handing my camel over to the camelparking kids it unnerves me im always sure that im never going to see it again or its going to come back with a tooth missing or an eye poked out so maggie isnt really dying hey guys maggie said stepping out of the gate maggie joshua said throwing his arms up in surprise problem was he was so intent on looking at her that he forgot to grab on again and off the camel he went he hit the ground facedown with a thump and a wheeze i jumped down from my camel barts dogs barked maggie ran to josh rolled him over and cradled his head in her lap while he tried to get his breath back philip and nathaniel waved to people from the wedding who were peeping through the gate to see what all the commotion was about before i had a chance to turn the two kids had leapt up onto our camels and were galloping around the corner off to nod or south dakota or some other place i didnt know the location of maggie joshua said youre not sick that depends she said if theres any chance of a laying on of hands joshua smiled and blushed i missed you me too maggie said she kissed joshua on the lips and held him there until i started to squirm and the other disciples started to clear their throats and bark get a room under their breaths maggie stood up and helped joshua to his feet come on in guys she said no dogs she said to bart and the hulking cynic shrugged and sat down in the street amid his canine disciples i was craning my neck to see if i could see where our camels had been taken theyre going to run those camels into the ground and i know they wont feed or water them who asked maggie those camelparking boys biff this is my youngest brothers wedding he couldnt even afford wine he didnt hire any camelparking boys bartholomew stood and rallied his troops ill find them he lumbered off inside we feasted on beef and mutton all manner of fruits and vegetables bean and nut pastes cheese and firstpressed olive oil with bread there was singing and dancing and if it hadnt been for a few old guys in the corner looking very cranky youd never have known that there wasnt any wine at the party when our people danced they danced in large groups lines and circles not couples there were mens dances and womens dances and very few dances where both could participate which is why people were staring at joshua and maggie as they danced they were definitely dancing together i retreated to a corner where i saw maggies sister martha watching as she nibbled at some bread with goat cheese she was twentyfive a shorter sturdier version of maggie with the same auburn hair and blue eyes but with less tendency to laugh her husband had divorced her for grievous skankage and now she lived with her older brother simon in bethany id gotten to know her when we were little and she took messages to maggie for me she offered me a bite of her bread and cheese and i took it shes going to get herself stoned martha said in a slightly bitter moderately jealous younger sister tone jakan is a member of the sanhedrin is he still a bully worse now hes a bully with power hed have her stoned just to prove that he could do it for dancing not even the pharisees if anyone saw her kiss joshua then so how are you i said changing the subject im living with my brother simon now i heard hes a leper look theres joshuas mother i have to go say hello theres no wine at this wedding mary said i know strange isnt it james stood by scowling as i hugged his mother joshua is here too yes oh good i was afraid that you two might have been arrested along with john pardon me i stepped back and looked to james for explanation he seemed the more appropriate bearer of bad news you hadnt heard herod has thrown john in prison for inciting people to revolt thats the excuse anyway its herods wife who wanted john silenced she was tired of having johns followers refer to her as the slut i patted marys shoulder as i stepped away ill tell joshua that youre here i found joshua sitting in a far corner of the courtyard playing with some children one little girl had brought her pet rabbit to the wedding and joshua was holding it in his lap petting its ears biff come feel how soft this bunny is joshua john has been arrested josh slowly handed the bunny back to the little girl and stood when im not sure shortly after we left i guess i shouldnt have left him i didnt even tell him we were leaving it was bound to happen joshua i told him to lay off herod but he wouldnt listen you couldnt have done anything im the son of god i could have done something yeah you could have gone to prison with him your mother is here go talk to her shes the one that told me as joshua embraced mary she said youve got to do something about this wine situation wheres the wine james tapped joshua on the shoulder didnt bring any wine with you from the lush vineyards of jericho i didnt like hearing sarcasm being used by james against joshua i had always thought of my invention as being used for good or at least against people i didnt like joshua gently pushed his mother away you shall have wine he said then he went off to the side of the house where drinking water was stored in large stone jars in a few minutes he returned with a pitcher of wine and cups for all of us a shout went through the party and suddenly everything seemed to step up a level pitchers and cups were filled and drained and filled again and those who had been near the wine jars started declaring a miracle had been performed that joshua of nazareth had turned water into wine i looked for him but he was nowhere to be found having been free of sin all of his life joshua wasnt very good at dealing with guilt so he had gone off by himself to try to numb the guilt he felt over johns arrest after a few hours of subterfuge and guile i was able to get maggie to sneak out the back gate with me maggie come with us you talked to joshua you saw the wine hes the one ive always known he was the one but i cant come with you im married i thought you were going to be a fisherman and i thought you were going to be a village idiot im still looking for a village look get jakan to divorce you anything he can divorce me for he can also kill me for ive seen him pass judgment on people biff ive seen him lead the mobs to the stonings im afraid of him i learned to make poisons in the east i raised my eyebrows and grinned huh im not going to poison my husband i sighed an exasperated sigh that id learned from my mother then leave him and come away with us far from jerusalem where he cant reach you hell have to divorce you to save face why should i leave biff so i can follow around a man who doesnt want me and wouldnt take me if he did i didnt know what to say i felt like knives were twisting in fresh wounds in my chest i looked at my sandals and pretended to have something caught in my throat maggie stepped up put her arms around me and laid her head against my chest im sorry she said i know i missed both of you but i missed just you too i know im not going to sleep with you i know then please stop rubbing that against me sure i said just then joshua stumbled through the gate and crashed into us we were able to catch ourselves and him before anyone fell the messiah was holding the little girls pet bunny hugging it to his cheek with the big back feet swinging free he was gloriously drunk know what josh said i love bunnies they toil not neither do they bark henceforth and from now on i decree that whenever something bad happens to me there shall be bunnies around so it shall be written go ahead biff write it down he waved to me under the bunny then turned and started back through the gate wheres the friggin wine i got a dry bunny over here see i said to maggie you dont want to miss out on that bunnies she laughed my favorite music ill get word to you she said where will you be i have no idea ill get word to you it was midnight the party had wound down and the disciples and i were sitting in the street outside of the house joshua had passed out and bartholomew had put a small dog under his head for a pillow before he had left james had made it abundantly clear that we werent welcome in nazareth well said philip i guess we cant go back to john im sorry i didnt find the camels bartholomew said people teased me about my yellow hair said nathaniel i thought you were from cana i said dont you have family we can stay with plague said nathaniel plague we all said nodding it happens youll probably be needing these came a voice out of the darkness we all looked up to see a short but powerfully built man walking out of the darkness leading our camels the camels said nathaniel my apologies said the man my brothers sons brought them home to us in capernaum im sorry its taken so long to get them back to you i stood and he handed the camels reins to me theyve been fed and watered he pointed to joshua who was snoring away on his terrier does he always drink like that only when a major prophet has been imprisoned the man nodded i heard what he did with the wine they say he also healed a lame man in cana this afternoon is that true we all nodded if you have no place to stay you can come home with me to capernaum for a day or two we owe you at least that for taking your camels we dont have any money i said then youll feel right at home said the man my name is andrew and so we became six chapter you can travel the whole world but there are always new things to learn for instance on the way to capernaum i learned that if you hang a drunk guy over a camel and slosh him around for about four hours then pretty much all the poisons will come out one end of him or the other someones going to have to wash that camel before we go into town said andrew we were traveling along the shore of the sea of galilee which wasnt a sea at all the moon was almost full and it reflected in the lake like a pool of quicksilver it fell to nathaniel to clean the camel because he was the official new guy joshua hadnt really met andrew and andrew hadnt really agreed to join us so we couldnt count him as the official new guy yet since nathaniel did such a fine job on the camel we let him clean up joshua as well once he had the messiah in the water joshua came out of his stupor long enough to slur something like the foxes have their holes and birds have their nests but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head thats so sad said nathaniel yes it is i said dunk him again he still has barf on his beard and so cleansed and slung over a camel damply joshua did by moonlight come into capernaum where he would be welcomed as if it were his home out screeched the old woman out of the house out of town out of galilee for all i care you arent staying here it was a beautiful dawn over the lake the sky painted with yellow and orange gentle waves lapped against the keels of capernaums fishing boats the village was only a stones throw away from the water and golden sunlight reflected off the waves onto the black stone walls of the houses making the light appear to dance to the calls of the gulls and songbirds the houses were built together in two big clusters sharing common walls with entries from every which way and none more than one story tall there was a small main road through the village between the two clusters of homes along the way were a few merchant booths a blacksmiths shop and on its own little square a synagogue that looked as if it could contain far more worshipers than the three hundred residents of the village but villages were thick along the shores of the lake one running right into the next and we guessed that perhaps the synagogue served a number of villages there was no central square around the well as there was in most inland villages because the people pulled their water from the lake or a spring nearby that bubbled clean chilly water into the air as high as two men andrew had deposited us at his brother peters house and we had fallen asleep in the great room among the children only a few hours before peters motherinlaw awoke to chase us out of the house joshua was holding his head with both hands as if to keep it from falling off his neck i wont have freeloaders and scalawags in my house the old woman shouted as she threw my satchel out after us ouch said joshua flinching from the noise were in capernaum josh i said a man named andrew brought us here because his nephews stole our camels you said maggie was dying joshua said would you have left john if id told you that maggie wanted to see you no he smiled dreamily it was good to see maggie then the smile turned to a scowl alive john wouldnt listen joshua you were in the desert all last month you didnt see all of the soldiers even scribes hiding in the crowd writing down what john was saying this was bound to happen then you should have warned john i warned john every day i warned john he didnt listen to reason any more than you would have we have to go back to judea johns followers will become your followers no more preparation josh joshua nodded looking at the ground in front of him its time where are the others ive sent philip and nathaniel to sepphoris to sell the camels bartholomew is sleeping in the reeds with the dogs were going to need more disciples joshua said were broke josh were going to need disciples with jobs an hour later we stood on the shore near where andrew and his brother were casting nets peter was taller and leaner than his brother and he had a head of gray hair wilder than even john the baptists while andrew pushed his dark hair back and tied it with a cord so it stayed out of his face when he was in the water they were both naked which is how men fished the lake when they were close to the shore i had mixed a headache remedy for joshua out of tree bark and i could tell it was working but perhaps not quite enough i pushed joshua toward the shore im not ready for this i feel terrible ask them andrew joshua called thank you for bringing us home with you and you too peter did my motherinlaw toss you out asked peter he cast his net and waited for it to settle then dove into the lake and gathered the net in his arms there was one tiny fish inside he reached in and pulled it out then tossed it back into the lake grow he said you know who i am said joshua ive heard said peter andrew says you turned water into wine and you cured the blind and the lame he thinks that you are going to bring the kingdom what do you think i think my little brother is smarter than i am so i believe what he says come with us were going to tell people of the kingdom we need help what can we do said andrew were only fishermen come with me and ill make you fishers of men andrew looked at his brother who was still standing in the water peter shrugged and shook his head andrew looked at me shrugged and shook his head they dont get it i said to joshua thus after joshua had some food and a nap and explained what in the hell he meant by fishers of men we became seven these guys are our partners peter said hurrying us along the shore they own the ships that andrew and i work on we cant go spread the good news unless they are in on it too we came to another small village and peter pointed out two brothers who were fitting a new oarlock into the gunwale of a fishing boat one was lean and angular with jetblack hair and a beard trimmed into wicked points james the other was older bigger softer with big shoulders and chest but small hands and thin wrists a fringe of brown hair shot with gray around a sunburned bald pate john just a suggestion peter said to joshua dont say the fisherofmen thing its going to be dark soon you wont have time for the explanation if we want to make it home in time for supper yeah i said just tell them about the miracles the kingdom a little about your holy ghost thing but stay easy on that until they agree to join up i still dont get the holy ghost thing said peter its okay well go over it tomorrow i said as we moved down the shore toward the brothers there was a rustling in some nearby bushes and three piles of rags moved into our path have mercy on us rabbi said one of the piles lepers i need to say something right here joshua taught me about the power of love and all of that stuff and i know that the divine spark in them is the same one that is in me so i should have not let the presence of lepers bother me i know that announcing them unclean under the law was as unjust as the brahmans shunning the untouchables i know that even now having watched enough television you probably wouldnt even refer to them as lepers so as to spare their feelings you probably call them partsdroppingoff challenged or something i know all that but that said no matter how many healings i saw lepers always gave me what we hebrews call the willies i never got over it what is it you want joshua asked them help ease our suffering said a femalesounding pile ill be over there looking at the water josh i said hell probably need some help peter said come to me joshua said to the lepers they oozed on over joshua put his hands on the lepers and spoke to them very quietly after a few minutes had passed while peter and i had seriously studied a frog that we noticed on the shore i heard joshua say now go and tell the priests that you are no longer unclean and should be allowed in the temple and tell them who sent you the lepers threw off their rags and praised joshua as they backed away they looked like perfectly normal people who just happened to be all wrapped up in tattered rags by the time peter and i got back to joshua james and john were already at his side i have touched those who they said were unclean joshua said to the brothers by mosaic law joshua would be unclean as well james stepped forward and grabbed joshuas forearm in the style of the romans one of those men used to be our brother come with us i said and we will make you oarlock makers of men what said joshua thats what they were doing when we came up making an oarlock now you see how stupid that sounds its not the same and thus we did become nine philip and nathaniel returned with enough money from the sale of the camels to feed the disciples and all of peters family as well so peters screeching motherinlaw who was named esther allowed us to stay providing bartholomew and the dogs slept outside capernaum became our base of operations and from there we would take one or twoday trips swinging through galilee as joshua preached and performed healings the news of the coming of the kingdom spread through galilee and after only a few months crowds began to gather to hear joshua speak we tried always to be back in capernaum on the sabbath so that joshua could teach at the synagogue it was that habit that first attracted the wrong sort of attention a roman soldier stopped joshua as he was making the short walk to the synagogue on sabbath morning no jew was permitted to make a journey of more than a thousand steps from sundown friday until sundown saturdayall at once that is one way you didnt have to add up your steps all day and just stop when you got to a thousand there would have been jews standing all over the place waiting for saturday sundown if that were the case it would have been awkward suddenly im thankful that the pharisees never thought of that the roman was no mere legionnaire but a centurion with the full crested helmet and eagle on his breastplate of a legion commander he led a tall white horse that looked as if it had been bred for combat he was old for a soldier perhaps sixty and his hair was completely white when he removed his helmet but he looked strong and the waspwaisted short sword at his waist looked dangerous i didnt recognize him until he spoke to joshua in perfect unaccented aramaic joshua of nazareth the roman said do you remember me justus joshua said from sepphoris gaius justus gallicus said the soldier and im at tiberius now and no longer an undercommander the sixth legion is mine i need your help joshua bar joseph of nazareth what can i do joshua looked around all of the disciples except bartholomew and me had managed to sneak away when the roman walked up i saw you make a dead man walk and talk ive heard of the things youve done all over galilee the healings the miracles i have a servant who is sick tortured with palsy he can barely breathe and i cant watch him suffer i dont ask that you break your sabbath by coming to tiberius but i believe you can heal him even from here justus dropped to his knee and kneeled in front of joshua something i never saw any roman do to any jew before or since this man is my friend he said joshua touched the romans temple and i watched the fear drain out of the soldiers face as i had so many others you believe it to be so be it said joshua its done stand up gaius justus gallicus the soldier smiled then stood and looked joshua in the eye i would have crucified your father to root out the killer of that soldier i know said joshua thank you justus said the centurion put on his helmet and climbed on his horse then looked at me for the first time what happened to that pretty little heartbreaker you two were always with broke our hearts i said justus laughed be careful joshua of nazareth he said he reined the horse around and rode away go with god joshua said good josh thats the way to show the romans whats going to happen to them come the kingdom shut up biff oh so you bluffed him hes going to get home and his friend will still be messed up remember what i told you at the gates of gaspars monastery biff that if someone knocked id let them in ack parables i hate parables tiberius was only an hours fast ride from capernaum so by morning word had come back from the garrison justuss servant had been healed before we had even finished our breakfast there were four pharisees outside of peters house looking for joshua you performed a healing on the sabbath the oldest of them asked he was whitebearded and wore his prayer shawl and phylacteries wrapped about his upper arms and forehead what a jamoke sure we all had phylacteries every man got them when he turned thirteen but you pretended that they were lost after a few weeks you didnt wear them you might as well wear a sign that said hi im a pious geek the one he wore on his forehead was a little leather box about the size of a fist that held parchments inscribed with prayers and lookedwellas if someone had strapped a little leather box to his head need i say more nice phylacteries i said the disciples laughed nathaniel made an excellent donkey braying noise you broke the sabbath said the pharisee im allowed said josh im the son of god oh fuck philip said way to ease them into the idea josh i said the following sabbath a man with a withered hand came to the synagogue while joshua was preaching and after the sermon while fifty pharisees who had gathered at capernaum just in case something like this happened looked on joshua told the man that his sins were forgiven then healed the withered hand like vultures to carrion they came to peters house the next morning no one but god can forgive sins said the one they had elected as their speaker really said joshua so you cant forgive someone who sins against you no one but god ill keep that in mind said joshua now unless you are here to hear the good news go away and joshua went into peters house and closed the door the pharisee shouted at the door you blaspheme joshua bar joseph you and i was standing there in front of him and i know i shouldnt have done it but i popped him not in the mouth or anything but right in the phylacteries the little leather box exploded with the impact and the strips of parchment slowly settled to the ground id hit him so fast that i think he thought it was a supernatural event a cry went up from the group behind him protestingshouting that i couldnt do such a thing that i deserved stoning scourging et cetera and my buddhist tolerance just wore a little thin so i popped him again in the nose this time he went down two of his pals caught him and another one at the front of the crowd started to reach into his sash for something i knew that they could quickly overrun me if they wanted to but i didnt think they would the cowards i grabbed the man who was pulling the knife twisted it away from him shoved the iron blade between the stones of peters house and snapped it off then handed the hilt back to him go away i said to him very softly he went away and all of his pals went with him i went inside to see how joshua and the others were getting along you know josh i said i think its time to expand the ministry you have a lot of followers here maybe we should go to the other side of the lake out of galilee for a while preach to the gentiles nathaniel asked hes right said joshua biff is right so it shall be written i said james and john only owned one ship that was large enough to hold all of us and bartholomews dogs and it was anchored at magdala two hours walk south of capernaum so we made the trip very early one morning to avoid being stopped in the villages on the way joshua had decided to take the good news to the gentiles so we were going to go across the lake to the town of gadarene in the state of decapolis they kept gentiles there as we waited on the shore at magdala a crowd of women who had come to the lake to wash clothes gathered around joshua and begged him to tell them of the kingdom i noticed a young tax collector who was sitting nearby at his table in the shade of a reed umbrella he was listening to joshua but i could also see his eyes following the behinds of the women i sidled over hes amazing isnt he i said yes amazing said the tax collector he was perhaps twenty thin with soft brown hair a light beard and light brown eyes whats your name publican matthew he said son of alphaeus no kidding thats my fathers name too look matthew i assume you can read write things like that oh yes youre not married are you no i was betrothed but before the wedding was to happen her parents let her marry a rich widower sad youre probably heartbroken thats sad you see those women theres women like that all the time around joshua and heres the best part hes celibate he doesnt want any of them hes just interested in saving mankind and bringing the kingdom of god to earth which we all are of course but the women well i think you can see that must be wonderful yeah its swell were going to decapolis why dont you come with us i couldnt ive been entrusted to collect taxes for this whole coast hes the messiah matthew the messiah think of it you and the messiah i dont know women the kingdom you heard about him turning water into wine i really have to have you ever tasted bacon matthew bacon isnt that from pigs unclean joshuas the messiah the messiah says its okay its the best thing youve ever eaten matthew women love it we eat bacon every morning with the women really ill need to finish up here matthew said you do that here id like you to mark something for me i looked over his shoulder at his ledger and pointed to a few names meet us at the ship when youre ready matthew i went back over to the shore where james and john had pulled the ship in close enough for us to wade out to joshua finished up blessing the women and sent them back to their laundry with a parable about stains gentlemen i called excuse me james john you too peter andrew you will not need to worry about your taxes this season theyve been taken care of what said peter where did you get the money i turned and waved toward matthew who was running toward the shore this good fellow is the publican matthew hes here to join us matthew ran up beside me and stood grinning like an idiot while trying to catch his breath hey he said waving weakly to the disciples welcome matthew joshua said all are welcome in the kingdom joshua shook his head turned and waded out to the ship he loves you kid i said loves you thus we did become ten joshua fell asleep on a pile of nets with peters wide straw fishing hat over his face before i settled down to be rocked to sleep myself i sent philip to the back of the boat to explain the kingdom and the holy ghost to matthew i figured that philips acumen with numbers might help out when talking to a tax collector the two sets of brothers sailed the ship which was wide of beam and small of sail and very very slow about halfway across the lake i heard peter say i dont like it it looks like a tempest i sat bolt upright and looked at the sky and indeed there were black clouds coming over the hills to the east low and fast clawing at the trees with lightning as they passed before i had a chance to sit up a wave broke over the shallow gunwale and soaked me to the core i dont like this we should go back said peter as a curtain of rain whipped across us the ships too full and the draft too shallow to weather a storm not good not good not good chanted nathaniel bartholomews dogs barked and howled at the wind james and andrew trimmed the sail and put the oars in the water peter moved to the stern to help john with the long steering oar another wave broke over the gunwale washing away one of bartholomews disciples a mangy terrier type water was midshin deep in the bottom of the boat i grabbed a bucket and began bailing and signaled philip to help but he had succumbed to the most rapid case of seasickness i had ever even heard of and was retching over the side lightning struck the mast turning everything a phosphorus white the explosion was instant and left my ears ringing one of joshuas sandals floated by me in the bottom of the boat were doomed wailed bart doomed joshua pushed the fishing hat back on his head and looked at the chaos around him o ye of little faith he said he waved his hand across the sky and the storm stopped just like that black clouds were sucked back over the hills the water settled to a gentle swell and the sun shone down bright and hot enough to raise steam off our clothes i reached over the side and snatched the swimming doggy out of the waves joshua had laid back down with the hat over his face is the new kid looking he whispered to me yeah i said he impressed his mouth is hanging open he looks sort of stricken great wake me when we get there i woke him a little before we reached gadarene because there was a huge madman waiting for us on the shore foaming at the mouth screaming throwing rocks and eating the occasional handful of dirt hold up there peter i said the sails were down again and we were rowing in i should wake the master said peter no its okay i have the stopforfoamingmadmen authority nevertheless i kicked the messiah gently josh you might want to take a look at this guy look peter said andrew pointing to the madman he has hair just like yours joshua sat up pushed back peters hat and glanced to the shore onward he said you sure rocks were starting to land in the boat oh yeah said joshua hes very large said matthew clarifying the already clear and mad said nathaniel not to be outdone in stating the obvious he is suffering said joshua onward a rock as big as my head thudded into the mast and bounced into the water ill rip your legs off and kick you in the head as you crawl around bleeding to death said the madman sure you dont want to swim in from here peter said dodging a rock nice refreshing swim after a nap said james matthew stood up in the back of the boat and cleared his throat what is one tormented man compared to the calming of a storm were you all in the same boat i was onward peter said and onward we went the big boat full of joshua and matthew and the eight faithless pieces of shit that were the rest of us joshua was out of the boat as soon as we hit the beach he walked straight up to the madman who looked as if he could crush the messiahs head in one of his hands filthy rags hung in tatters on him and his teeth were broken and bleeding from eating dirt his face contorted and bubbled as if there were great worms under the skin searching for an escape his hair was wild and stuck out in a great grayish tangle and it did sort of look like peters hair have mercy on me said the madman his voice buzzed in his throat like a chorus of locusts i slid out of the boat and the others followed me quietly up behind joshua what is your name demon joshua asked what would you like it to be said the demon you know ive always been partial to the name harvey joshua said well isnt that a coincidence said the demon my name just happens to be harvey youre just messing with me arent you said josh yeah i am said the demon busted my name is legion for there are a bunch of us in here out legion joshua commanded out of this big guy there was a herd of pigs nearby doing piggy things i dont know what they were doing im a jew what do i know from pigs except that i like bacon a great green glow came out of legions mouth whipped through the air like smoke then came down on the heard of pigs like a cloud in a second it was sucked into the pigs nostrils and they began foaming and making locust noises be gone said joshua with that the pigs all ran into the sea sucked huge lungfuls of water and after only a little kicking drowned perhaps fifty dead pigs bobbed in the swell how can i thank you said the big foaming guy who had stopped foaming but was still big tell the people of your land what has happened joshua said tell them the son of god has come to bring them the good news of the holy ghost clean up a little before you tell them i said and off he went a lumbering monster bigger even than our own bartholomew and smelling worse which i hadnt thought possible we sat down on the beach and were sharing some bread and wine when we heard the crowd approaching through the hills the good news travels quickly said matthew whose freshfaced enthusiasm was starting to irritate me a little now who killed our pigs the crowd was carrying rakes and pitchforks and scythes and they didnt look at all like they were there to receive the gospel you fuckers kill them in the boat said josh o ye of little matthews comment was cut short by bart grabbing him by the collar and dragging him down the beach to the boat the brothers had already pushed off and were up to their chests in the water they pulled themselves in and james and john helped set the oars as peter and andrew pulled us into the boat we fished barts disciples out of the waves by the scruffs of their necks and set sail just as the rocks began to rain down on us we all looked at joshua what he said if theyd been jews that pig thing would have gone over great im new at gentiles there was a messenger waiting for us when we reached magdala philip unrolled the scroll and read its an invitation to come to dinner in bethany during passover week joshua a ranking member of the sanhedrin requests your presence at dinner at his home to discuss your wonderful ministry its signed jakan bar iban ish nazareth maggies husband the creep i said good first day huh matthew chapter the angel and i watched star wars for the second time on television last night and i just had to ask youve been in gods presence right raziel of course do you think he sounds like james earl jones whos that darth vader raziel listened for a moment while darth vader threatened someone sure a little he doesnt breathe that heavy though and youve seen gods face yes is he black im not allowed to say he is isnt he if he wasnt youd just say he wasnt im not allowed to say he is he doesnt wear a hat like that said raziel ahha all im saying is no hat thats all im saying i knew it i dont want to watch this anymore raziel switched the channel god or someone who sounded like him said this is cnn we came up to jerusalem in the gate at bethsaida called the eye of the needle where you had to duck down to pass through out the golden gate through the kidron valley and over the mount of olives into bethany we had left the brothers and matthew behind because they had jobs and bartholomew because he stank his lack of cleanliness had started to draw attention lately from the local pharisees in capernaum and we didnt want to push the issue since we were walking into the lair of the enemy philip and nathaniel joined us on our journey but stayed behind on the mount of olives at a clearing called gethsemane where there was a small cave and an olive press joshua tried to convince me to stay with them but i insisted ill be fine joshua said its not my time jakan wont try anything its just dinner im not worried about your safety josh i just want to see maggie i did want to see maggie but i was worried about joshuas safety as well either way i wasnt staying behind jakan met us at the gate wearing a new white tunic belted with a blue sash he was stocky but not as fat as i expected him to be and almost exactly my height his beard was black and long but had been cut straight across about the level of his collarbone he wore the pointed linen cap worn by many of the pharisees so i couldnt tell if hed lost any of his hair the fringe that hung down was dark brown as were his eyes the most frightening and perhaps the most surprising thing about him was that there was a spark of intelligence in his eyes that hadnt been there when we were children perhaps seventeen years with maggie had rubbed off on him come in fellow nazarenes welcome to my home there are some friends inside who wanted to meet you he led us through the door into a large great room large enough in fact to fit any two of the houses we shared at capernaum the floor was paved in tile with turquoise and red mosaic spirals in the corners of the room no pictures of course there was a long romanstyle table at which five other men all dressed like jakan sat in jewish households the tables were close to the ground and diners reclined on cushions or on the floor around them i didnt see maggie anywhere but a serving girl brought in large pitchers of water and bowls for us to wash our hands in let this water stay water will you joshua jakan said smiling we cant wash in wine jakan introduced us to each of the men adding some sort of elaborate title to each of their names that i didnt catch but which indicated im sure that they were all members of the sanhedrin as well as the council of pharisees ambush they received us curtly then made their way to the water bowls to wash their hands before dinner all of them watching as joshua and i washed and offered prayer this after all was part of the test we sat the water pitchers and bowls were taken away by the serving girl who then brought pitchers of wine so said the eldest of the pharisees i hear you have been casting demons out of the afflicted in galilee yes were having a lovely passover week i said and you joshua kicked me under the table yes he said by the power of my father i have relieved the suffering of some who were plagued by demons when joshua said my father every one of them squirmed i noticed movement in one of the doorways to jakans back it was maggie making signals and signs like a madwoman but then jakan spoke attention turned to him and maggie ducked out of sight jakan leaned forward some have said that you banish these demons by the power of beelzebub and how could i do that joshua said getting a little angry how could i turn beelzebub against himself how can i battle satan with satan a house divided cant stand boy im starving i said bring on the eats with the spirit of god i cast out demons thats how you know the kingdom has come they didnt want to hear that hell i didnt want to hear that not here if joshua claimed to bring the kingdom then he was claiming to be the messiah which by their way of thinking could be blasphemy a crime punishable by death it was one thing for them to hear it secondhand it was quite another to have joshua say it to their faces but he as usual was unafraid some say john the baptist is the messiah said jakan theres nobody better than john joshua said but john doesnt baptize with the holy ghost i do they all looked at each other they had no idea what he was talking about joshua had been preaching the divine sparkthe holy ghostfor two years but it was a new way of looking at god and the kingdom it was a change these legalists had worked hard to find their place of power they werent interested in change food was put on the table and prayers offered again then we ate in silence for a while maggie was in the doorway behind jakan again gesturing with one hand walking over the other mouthing words that i was supposed to understand i had something i wanted to give her but i had to see her in private it was obvious that jakan had forbidden her to enter the room your disciples do not wash their hands before they eat said one of the pharisees a fat man with a scar over his eye bart i thought its not what goes into a man that defiles him joshua said its what comes out he broke off some of the flatbread and dipped it into a bowl of oil he means lies i said i know said the old pharisee you were thinking something disgusting dont lie the pharisees passed the no your turn no its your turn look around the room joshua chewed his bread slowly then said why wash the outside of the urn if theres decay on the inside yeah like you rotting hypocrites i added with more enthusiasm than was probably called for quit helping josh said sorry nice wine manischewitz my shouting evidently stirred them out of their malaise the old pharisee said you consort with demons joshua of nazareth this levi was seen to cause blood to come from a pharisees nose and a knife to break of its own and no one even saw him move joshua looked at me then at them then at me again you forget to tell me something he was being an emrod so i popped him emrod is the biblical term for hemorrhoid i heard maggies giggling from the other room joshua turned back to the creeps levi who is called biff has studied the art of the soldier in the east joshua said he can move swiftly but he is not a demon i stood up the invitation was for dinner not a trial this is no trial said jakan calmly we have heard of joshuas miracles and we have heard that he breaks the law we simply want to ask him by whose authority he does these things this is dinner otherwise why would you be here i was wondering that myself but joshua answered me by pushing me down in my seat and proceeding to answer their accusations for another two hours crafting parables and throwing their own piety back in their faces while joshua spoke the word of god i did sleightofhand tricks with the bread and the vegetables just to mess with them maggie came to the doorway and signaled me pointing frantically to the front door and making threatening headbashing gestures which i took to be the consequences for my not understanding her this time well ive got to go see a man about a camel if youll excuse me i stepped out the front door as soon as i closed it behind me i was hit with the spraying girlspit of a violently whispering woman youstupidsonofabitchwhatthefuckdidyouthinkiwastryingtosaytoyou she punched me in the arm hard no kiss i whispered where can i meet you after you cant here take this i handed her a small leather pouch theres a parchment inside to tell you what to do i want to see you two you will do what the note says i have to go back in you bastard punch in the arm hard i forgot what i was doing and entered the house still rubbing my bruised shoulder levi have you injured yourself no jakan but sometimes i strain a shoulder muscle just shaking this monster off the pharisees hated that one i realized that they were waiting for me to request water so i could go through the whole handwashing ritual before i sat down to the table again i stood there thinking about it rubbing my shoulder waiting how long could it possibly take to read a note it seemed like a long time with them staring at me but im sure it was only a few minutes then it came the scream maggie let go from the next room long and high and loud a virtuoso scream of terror and panic and madness i bent over and whispered into joshuas ear just follow my lead no just dont do anything nothing but the pharisees all looked like someone had dropped hot coals into their laps as the scream went on and on maggie had great sustain before jakan could get up to investigate there came my girlstill shrieking i might adda lovely green foam running out of her mouth her dress torn and hanging in shreds on her bloodstreaked body and blood running from the corners of her eyes she screamed in jakans face and rolled her eyes then leapt onto the table and growled as she kicked every piece of crockery off onto the floor where it shattered the servant girl ran through screaming demons have taken her demons have taken her then bolted out the front door maggie started screeching again then ran up and down the length of the table urinating as she went nice touch i would never have thought of that the pharisees had backed up against the wall including jakan as maggie fell on her back on the table thrashing and growling and screaming obscenities while splattering the front of their white cloaks with green foam urine and blood devils shes been possessed by devils lots of them i shouted seven maggie said between growls looks like seven i said doesnt it josh i grabbed the back of joshuas hair and sort of made him nod in agreement no one was really watching him anyway as maggie was now spouting impressive fountains of green foam both out of her mouth and from between her legs again a nice touch i wouldnt have thought of she settled into a vibrating fit rhythm with barking and obscenities for counterpoint well jakan i said politely thank you for dinner its been lovely but we have to be going i pulled joshua to his feet by his collar he was a little perplexed himself not terrified like our host but perplexed wait jakan said festering dog penis maggie snarled to no one in particular but i think everyone knew who she meant oh all right well try to help her i said joshua grab an arm i pushed him forward and maggie grabbed his wrist i went around to the other side of the table and got hold of her other arm we have to get her out of this house of defilement maggies fingernails bit into my arm as i lifted her up and she pulled herself along on joshs wrist pretending to thrash and fight i dragged her out the front door and into the courtyard make an effort joshua would you maggie whispered jakan and the pharisees bunched at the door we need to take her into the wilderness to safely cast out the devils i shouted i dragged her and joshua for that matter into the street and kicked the heavy gate closed maggie relaxed and stood up a mound of green foam cascaded off of her chest dont relax yet maggie when were farther away porkeating goat fucker thats the spirit hi maggie joshua said taking her arm and finally helping me drag i think it went really well for short notice i said you know pharisees make the best witnesses lets go to my brothers house she whispered we can send word that im incurable from there rat molester its okay maggie were out of range now i know i was talking to you whyd you take seventeen years to get me out of there youre beautiful in green did i ever tell you that ive got to think that that was unethical joshua said josh faking demonic possession is like a mustard seed how is it like a mustard seed you dont know do you doesnt seem at all like a mustard seed does it now you see how we all feel when you liken things unto a mustard seed huh at simon the lepers house joshua went to the door first by himself so maggies appearance didnt scare the humus out of her brother and sister martha answered the door shalom martha im joshua bar joseph of nazareth remember me from the wedding in cana ive brought your sister maggie let me see martha tapped her fingernail on her chin while she searched her memory in the night sky were you the one who changed the water into wine son of god was it theres no need to be that way joshua said i popped my head around joshs shoulder i gave your sister a powder that sort of foamed her up all red and green shes a bit nastylooking right now im sure that becomes her said martha with an exasperated sigh come in she led us inside i stood by the door while joshua sat on the floor by the table martha took maggie to the back of the house to help her clean up it was a large house by our country standards but not nearly as big as jakans still simon had done well for the son of a blacksmith i didnt see simon anywhere come sit at the table joshua said nope im fine by the door here whats the matter do you know whose house this is of course maggies brother simons i lowered my voice imonsay the eperlay come sit down ill watch over you nope im fine here just then simon came in from the other room carrying a pitcher of wine and a tray of cups in his ragwrapped hands white linen covered his face except for his eyes which were as clear and blue as maggies welcome joshua leviits been a long time wed known simon as boys spending as much time as we did hanging around maggies fathers shop but he had been older learning his fathers craft then and far too serious to be associating with boys in my memory he was strong and tall but now the leprosy had bent him over like an old woman simon set the cups down and poured for the three of us i remained against the wall by the door martha doesnt take well to serving simon said by way of apologizing for doing the serving himself she tells me that you turned water into wine at the wedding in cana simon joshua said i can heal your affliction if youll allow me what affliction he lay down at the table across from joshua biff come sit with us he patted a cushion next to him and i ducked in the event that fingers started flying i understand that jakan used my sister as bait for a trap for you two not much of a trap joshua said you expected that i asked i thought there would be more the whole pharisee council perhaps i wanted to answer them directly not have my words passed through a dozen spies and rumormongers i also wanted to see if there would be any sadducees there just then i realized what joshua had already figured out the sadducees the priests werent involved in jakans little surprise inquisition they had been born to their power and were not as easily threatened as the workingclass pharisees and the sadducees were the more powerful half of the sanhedrin the ones who commanded the soldiers of the temple guard without the priests the pharisees were vipers without fangs for now anyway i hope we havent brought the judgment of the pharisees down on your head simon joshua said simon waved a hand in dismissal not to worry therell be no pharisees coming here jakan is terrified of me and if he really believes that maggie is possessed and if his friends believe it well id bet hes divorced her already she can come back to galilee with us i said looking at joshua who looked at simon as if to ask permission she may do as she wishes what i wish is to get out of bethany before jakan comes to his senses maggie said coming from the other room she wore a simple woolen dress and her hair was still dripping there was still green goo on her sandals she came across the room knelt down and gave her brother a huge hug then a kiss on the eyebrow if he comes by or sends word youll tell him im still here i sensed simon was smiling under the veil you dont think hell want to come in and look around the coward maggie spat amen i said how did you stay with a creep like that all of these years after the first year he didnt want to be anywhere near me unclean dont you know i told him i was bleeding for all those years sure do you think he would embarrass himself among the members of the pharisee council by asking them about their own wives joshua said i can heal you of that affliction if youll allow me maggie what affliction you should go simon said ill send word about what jakan has done as soon as i know if he hasnt done it already i have a friend who will plant the idea that if he doesnt divorce maggie his place on the sanhedrin might be questioned simon and martha waved to us from the doorway martha looking like a compact ghost of her older sister and simon just looking like a ghost and thus did we become eleven there was a full moon and a sky full of stars thrown over us as we walked back to gethsemane from the top of the mount of olives we could see across the kidron valley to the temple black smoke streamed into the sky from the sacrificial fires which the priests tended day and night i held maggies hand as we walked through the grove of ancient olive trees and out into the clearing near the oil press where we camped philip and nathaniel had built a fire and there were two strangers sitting by it with them they all stood up as we approached philip glared at me which baffled me until i remembered that hed been with us at cana and seen joshua and maggie dancing at the wedding he thought i was trying to steal joshuas girl i let her hand go master said nathaniel tossing his yellow hair new disciples these are thaddeus and thomas the twins thaddaeus stepped up to joshua he was about my height and age and wore a tattered woolen tunic and looked especially gaunt as if he might be starving his hair was cut short like a romans but it looked as if someone had cut it with a dull piece of flint somehow he looked familiar rabbi i heard you preach when you were with john i have been with him for two years a follower of john thats where i knew him from although i didnt remember meeting him that explained the hungry look as well welcome thaddaeus joshua said these are biff and mary magdalene disciples and friends call me maggie maggie said joshua stepped over to thomas the twins who was only one guy younger perhaps twenty his beard still like soft down in places his clothes finer than any of ours and thomas dont youre standing on thomas two thomas squealed nathaniel pushed joshua aside and whispered in his ear a little too loudly he sees his twin but no one else can you said to show mercy so i havent told him that hes mad and so you shall be shown mercy nathaniel joshua said so we wont tell you that youre a ninny i added welcome thomas joshua said embracing the boy and thomas two thomas said forgive me welcome thomas two as well said joshua to a perfectly empty spot in space come to galilee and help us spread the good news hes over there said thomas pointing to a different spot equally empty and thus did we become thirteen on the trip back to capernaum maggie told us about her life about the dreams she had set aside and about a child that had died in the first year of her marriage i could see joshua was shaken when he heard of the child and i knew he was thinking that if we hadnt taken off to the east he would have been there to save it after that maggie said jakan didnt come near me there was bleeding right after the baby died and as far as he knew it never stopped hes always been afraid that someone might think that theres a curse on his house so my duties as a wife were public only its a doubleedged sword for him in order to appear dutiful i had to go to the synagogue and to the womens court in the temple but if they thought i was going there while i was bleeding i would have been driven out maybe stoned and jakan would have been shamed who knows what hell do now hell divorce you i said hell have to if he wants to save face with the pharisees and the sanhedrin strangely enough it was joshua who i had trouble consoling about maggies lost child shed lived with the loss for years cried over it allowed it to heal as much as it would but the wound was fresh for joshua he walked far behind us shunning the new disciples who pranced around him like excited puppies i could tell that he was talking to his father and it didnt seem to be going well go talk to him maggie said it wasnt his fault it was gods will thats why he feels responsible i said we hadnt explained to maggie about the holy ghost the kingdom all the changes that joshua wanted to bring to mankind and how those were at odds at times with the torah go talk to him she said i fell back in our column past philip and thaddaeus who were trying to explain to nathaniel that it was his own voice he heard when he put his fingers in his ears and spoke and not the voice of god and past thomas who was having an animated discussion with empty air i walked along beside joshua for a while before i spoke and then i tried to sound matteroffact you had to go to the east joshua you know that now i didnt have to go right then that was cowardly would it have been so bad to watch her marry jakan to see her child born yes it would have you cant save everyone have you been asleep these last twenty years have you unless you can change the past youre wasting the present on this guilt if you dont use what you learned in the east then maybe we shouldnt have gone maybe leaving israel was cowardly i felt my face go numb as if the blood had drained from it had i said that so we walked along for a while in silence not looking at each other i counted birds listened to the murmur of the disciples voices ahead watched maggies ass move under her dress as she walked not really enjoying the elegance of it well i for one feel better said joshua finally thanks for cheering me up glad to help i said we arrived in capernaum on the morning of the fifth day after leaving bethany peter and the others had been preaching the good news to the people on the shore of galilee and there was a crowd of perhaps five hundred people waiting for us the tension had passed between joshua and me and the rest of the journey had been pleasant if for no other reason than we got to hear maggie laugh and tease us my jealousy of joshua returned but somehow it wasnt bitter it was more like familiar grief for a distant loss not the swordintheheart rendingofflesh agony of a heartbreak i could actually leave the two of them alone and talk to other peoplethink of other things maggie loved joshua that was assured but she loved me as well and there was no way to divine how that might manifest by following joshua we had already divorced ourselves of the expectations of normal existence marriage home family they were not part of the life we had chosen joshua made that clear to all of his disciples yes some of them were married and some even preached with their wives at their sides but what set them apart from the multitudes who would follow joshua was that they had stepped off the path of their own lives to spread the word it was to the word that i lost maggie not to joshua as exhausted as he was as hungry joshua preached to them they had been waiting for us and he wouldnt disappoint them he climbed into one of peters boats rowed out from the shore far enough for the crowd to be able to see him and he preached to them about the kingdom for two hours when he had finished and had sent the crowd on their way two newcomers waited among the disciples they were both compact stronglooking men in their midtwenties one was cleanshaven and wore his hair cut short so that it formed a helmet of ringlets on his head the other had long hair with his beard plaited and curled in the style i had seen on some greeks although they wore no jewelry and their clothes were no more fancy than my own there was an air of wealth about them both i thought it might have been power but if it was it wasnt the selfconscious power of the pharisees if nothing else they were selfassured the one with the long hair approached joshua and kneeled before him rabbi weve heard you speak of the coming of the kingdom and we want to join you we want to help spread the word joshua looked at the man for a long time smiling to himself before he spoke he took the man by the shoulders and lifted him stand up you are welcome friends the stranger seemed baffled he looked back at his friend then at me as if i had some answer to his confusion this is simon he said nodding toward his friend my name is judas iscariot i know who you are joshua said ive been waiting for you and so we became fifteen joshua maggie and me bartholomew the cynic peter and andrew john and james the fishermen matthew the tax collector nathaniel of cana the young nitwit philip and thaddeus who had been followers of john the baptist thomas the twin who was a loony and the zealots simon the canaanite and judas iscariot fifteen went out into galilee to preach the holy ghost the coming of the kingdom and the good news that the son of god had arrived chapter joshuas ministry was three years of preaching sometimes three times a day and although there were some high and low points i could never remember the sermons word for word but heres the gist of almost every sermon i ever heard joshua give you should be nice to people even creeps and if you a believed that joshua was the son of god and b he had come to save you from sin and c acknowledged the holy spirit within you became as a little child he would sayand d didnt blaspheme the holy ghost see c then you would e live forever f someplace nice g probably heaven however if you h sinned andor i were a hypocrite andor j valued things over people and k didnt do a b c and d then you were l fucked which is the message that joshuas father had given him so many years ago and which seemed at the time succinct to the point of rudeness but made more sense after you listened to a few hundred sermons thats what he taught thats what we learned thats what we passed on to the people in the towns of galilee not everybody was good at it however and some seemed to miss the point altogether one day joshua maggie and i returned from preaching in cana to find bartholomew sitting by the synagogue at capernaum preaching the gospel to a semicircle of dogs that sat around him the dogs seemed spellbound but then bart was wearing a flank steak as a hat so im not sure it was his speaking skills that held their attention joshua snatched the steak off of bartholomews head and tossed it into the street where a dozen dogs suddenly found their faith bart bart bart josh said as he shook the big man by the shoulders dont give whats holy to dogs dont cast your pearls before swine youre wasting the word i dont have any pearls i am slave to no possessions its a metaphor bart joshua said deadpan it means dont give the word to those who arent ready to receive it you mean like when you drowned the swine in decapolis they werent ready for it joshua looked at me for help i shrugged maggie said thats exactly right bart you got it oh why didnt you say so bart said okay guys were off to preach the word in magdala he climbed to his feet and led his pack of disciples toward the lake joshua looked at maggie thats not what i meant at all yes it is she said then she took off to find johanna and susanna two women who had joined us and were learning to preach the gospel thats not what i meant joshua said to me have you ever won an argument with her he shook his head then say amen and lets go see what peters wife has cooked up the disciples were gathered around outside of peters house sitting on the logs we had arranged in a circle around a fire pit they were all looking down and seemed to be caught in some glum prayer even matthew was there when he should have been at his job collecting taxes in magdala whats wrong asked joshua john the baptist is dead said philip what joshua sat down on the log next to peter and leaned against him we just saw bartholomew i said he didnt say anything about it we just found out said andrew matthew just brought the news from tiberius it was the first time since hed joined us that id seen matthew without the light of enthusiasm in his face he might have aged ten years in the last few hours herod had him beheaded he said i thought herod was afraid of john i said it was rumored that herod had kept john alive because he actually believed him to be the messiah and was afraid of the wrath of god should the holy man perish it was at the request of his stepdaughter said matthew john was killed at the behest of a teenage slut well jeez if he wasnt dead already the irony would have killed him i said joshua stared into the dirt before him thinking or praying i couldnt tell finally he said johns followers will be like babes in the wilderness thirsty guessed nathaniel hungry guessed peter horny guessed thomas no you dumbfucks lost theyll be lost i said jeez joshua stood philip thaddeus go to judea tell johns followers that they are welcome here tell them that johns work is not lost bring them here but master judas said john has thousands of followers if they come here how will we feed them hes new i explained the next day was the sabbath and in the morning as we all headed to the synagogue an old man in fine clothes ran out of the bushes and threw himself at joshuas feet oh rabbi he wailed i am the mayor of magdala my youngest daughter has died people say that you can heal the sick and raise the dead will you help me joshua looked around a halfdozen local pharisees watched us from different points around the village joshua turned to peter take the word to the synagogue today i am going to help this man thank you rabbi the rich man gushed he hurried off and waved for us to follow where are you taking us i asked only as far as magdala he said to joshua i said thats farther than a sabbaths journey allows i know joshua said as we passed through all of the small villages along the coast on the way to magdala people came out of their houses and followed us for as long as they dared on a sabbath but i could also see the elders the pharisees watching as we went the mayors house was large for magdala and his daughter had her own sleeping room he led joshua into the bedchamber where the girl lay please save her rabbi joshua bent down and examined the girl go out of here he said to the old man out of the house when the mayor was gone joshua looked at me shes not dead what this girl is sleeping maybe theyve given her some strong wine or some sleeping powder but she is not dead so this is a trap i didnt see this one coming either joshua said they expect me to claim that i raised her from the dead healed her when shes only sleeping blasphemy and healing on the sabbath let me raise her from the dead then i mean i can do this one if shes only sleeping theyll blame me for whatever you do as well you may be their target too the local pharisees didnt devise this themselves jakan josh nodded go get the old man and gather as many witnesses as you can pharisees as well make a ruckus when i had about fifty people gathered in and around the house joshua announced this girl isnt dead shes sleeping you foolish old man joshua shook the girl and she sat up rubbing her eyes keep watch on your strong wine old man rejoice that you have not lost your daughter but grieve that you have broken the sabbath for your ignorance then joshua stormed out and i followed him when we were a ways down the street he said do you think they bought it nope i said me either joshua said in the morning a roman soldier came to peters house with messages i was still sleeping when i heard the shouting i can only speak to joshua of nazareth someone said in latin youll speak to me or youll never speak again i heard someone else say obviously someone who had no desire to live a long life i was up and running in an instant my tunic waving unbelted behind me i rounded the corner at peters house to see judas facing down a legionnaire the soldier had partially drawn his short sword judas i barked back down i put myself between them i knew i could disarm the soldier easily but not the legion that would follow him if i did who sends you soldier i have a message from gaius justus gallicus commander of the sixth legion for joshua bar joseph of nazareth he glared at judas over my shoulder but there is nothing in my orders to keep me from killing this dog while delivering it i turned to face judas whose face was on fire with anger i knew he carried a dagger in his sash although i hadnt told joshua about it justus is a friend judas no roman is the friend of a jew said judas making no effort whatever to whisper and at that point realizing that joshua hadnt reached our new zealot recruit with the message of forgiveness for all men and that he was going to get himself killed i quickly reached up under judas tunic clamped onto his scrotum squeezed once rapidly and extremely hard and after he blasted a mouthful of slobber on my chest his eyes rolled in his head and he slumped to his knees unconscious i caught him and lowered him to the ground so he didnt hit his head then i turned to the roman fainting spells i said lets go find joshua justus had sent us three messages from jerusalem jakan had indeed divorced maggie the pharisees full council had met and they were plotting to kill joshua and herod antipas had heard of joshuas miracles and was afraid that he might be the reincarnation of john the baptist justus only personal note was one word careful joshua you need to hide said maggie leave herods territory until things settle down go to decapolis preach to the gentiles herod philip has no love for his brother his soldiers wont bother you maggie had become a fiercely dedicated preacher herself it was as if she had channeled her personal passion for joshua into a passion for the word not yet said joshua not until philip and thaddeus return with johns followers i will not leave them lost i need a sermon one that can serve as if it was my last one that will sustain the lost while im gone once i deliver it to galilee ill go to philips territory i looked at maggie and she nodded as if to say do what you have to but protect him lets write it then i said like any great speech the sermon on the mount sounds as if it just happened spontaneously but actually joshua and i worked on it for over a weekjoshua dictating and me taking notes on parchment i had invented a way of sandwiching a thin piece of charcoal between two pieces of olive wood so that i could write without carrying a quill and inkwell we worked in front of peters house out in the boat even on the mountainside where he would deliver the sermon joshua wanted to devote a long section of the sermon to adultery largely i realize now motivated by my relationship with maggie even though maggie had resolved to stay celibate and preach the word i think joshua wanted to drive the point home joshua said put in if a man even looks at a woman with lust in his heart he has committed adultery really you want to go with that and this if a divorced woman remarries she commits adultery yeah seems a little harsh a little phariseeish i had some people in mind what do you have verily i say unto youi know you like to say verily when youre talking about adulteryanyway verily i say unto you that should a man put oil upon a womans naked body and make her go upon all fours and bark like a dog while knowing her if you know what i mean then he has committed adultery and surely if a woman do the same thing right back well she has jumped on the adultery donkey cart herownself and if a woman should pretend to be a powerful queen and a man a lowly slave boy and if she should call him humiliating names and make him lick upon her body then surely they have sinned like big dogsand woe unto the man if he pretends to be a powerful queen and thats enough biff but you want to be specific dont you you dont want people to walk around wondering hey is this adultery or what maybe you should roll over im not sure that being that specific is a good idea okay how bout this should a man or a woman have any goingson with their mutual naughty bits then it is more than likely they are committing adultery or at least they should consider it well maybe more specific than that come on josh this isnt an easy one like thou shalt not kill basically there you got a corpse you got a sin right yes adultery can be sticky well yeslook a seagull biff i appreciate that you feel obliged to be an advocate for your favorite sins but thats not what i need here what i need is help writing this sermon how we doing on the beatitudes pardon me the blesseds weve got blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness blessed are the poor in spirit the pure in heart the whiners the meek the wait what are we giving the meek lets see uh here blessed are the meek for to them we shall say attaboy a little weak yeah lets let the meek inherit the earth cant you give the earth to the whiners well then cut the whiners and give the earth to the meek okay earth to the meek here we go blessed are the peacemakers the mourners and thats it how many is that seven not enough we need one more how about the dumbfucks no josh not the dumbfucks youve done enough for the dumbfucks nathaniel thomas blessed are the dumbfucks for they uhi dont knowthey shall never be disappointed no im drawing the line at dumbfucks come on josh why cant we have any powerful guys on our team why do we have to have the meek and the poor the oppressed and the pissed on why cant we for once have blessed are the big powerful rich guys with swords because they dont need us okay but no blessed are the dumbfucks who then sluts no how about the wankers i can think of five or six disciples that would be really blessed no wankers ive got it blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake okay better what are you going to give them a fruit basket you cant give the meek the whole earth and these guys a fruit basket give them the kingdom of heaven the poor in spirit got that everybody gets some okay then share the kingdom of heaven i wrote it down we could give the fruit basket to the dumbfucks no dumbfucks sorry i just feel for them you feel for everyone josh its your job oh yeah i forgot we finished writing the sermon only a few hours before philip and thaddeus returned from judea leading three thousand of johns followers joshua had them gather on a hillside above capernaum then sent the disciples into the crowd to find the sick and bring them to him he performed miracles of healing all morning then coming into the afternoon he gathered us together at the spring below the mountain peter said theres at least another thousand people from galilee on the hill joshua and they are hungry how much food do we have joshua asked judas came forward with a basket five loaves and two fish that will do but youll need more baskets and about a hundred volunteers to help distribute the food nathaniel you bartholomew and thomas go into the crowd and find me fifty to a hundred people who have their own baskets bring them here by the time you get back well have the food for them judas threw down his basket we have five loaves how do you think joshua held up his hand for silence and the zealot clammed up judas today youve seen the lame walk the blind see and the deaf hear not to mention the blind hear and the deaf see i added joshua scowled at me it will take little more to feed a few of the faithful there are but five loaves shouted judas judas once there was a rich man who built great barns and granaries so he could save all of the fruits of his wealth long into his old age but on the very day his barns were finished the lord said hey we need you up here and the rich man did say oh shit im dead so what good did his stuff do him huh dont worry about what youre going to eat nathaniel bart and thomas started off to their assigned duty but maggie grabbed nathaniel and held him fast no she said no one does anything until you promise us that youll go into hiding after this sermon joshua smiled how can i hide maggie who will spread the word who will heal the sick we will maggie continued now promise go into the land of the gentiles out of herods reach just until things calm down promise or we dont move peter and andrew stepped up behind maggie to show their support john and james were nodding as she spoke so be it said joshua but now we have hungry people to feed and we fed them the loaves and the fish were multiplied jars were brought in from the surrounding villages and filled with water which was carried to the mountainside and all the while the local pharisees watched and growled and spied but they hadnt missed the healings and they didnt miss the sermon on the mount and word of it went back to jerusalem with their poison reports afterward at the spring by the shore i gathered up the last of the pieces of bread to take home with us joshua came down the shore with a basket over his head then pulled it off when he got to me when we said we wanted you to hide we meant something a little less obvious joshua great sermon by the way joshua started helping me gather up the bread that was strewn around on the ground i wanted to talk to you and i couldnt get away from the crowd without hiding under the basket im having a little trouble preaching humility youre so good at that one people line up to hear the humility sermon how can i preach that the humble will be exalted and the exalted will be humbled at the same time im being exalted by four thousand people bodhisattva josh remember what gaspar taught you about being a bodhisattva you dont have to be humble because you are denying your own ascension by bringing the good news to other people youre out of the humility flow so to speak oh yeah he smiled but now that you mention it i said it does seem a little hypocritical im not proud of that then youre okay that evening when we had all gathered again in capernaum joshua called us to the fire ring in front of peters house and we watched the last gold of the sunlight reflecting on the lake as joshua led us in a prayer of thanks then he made the call okay who wants to be an apostle i do i do said nathaniel whats an apostle thats a guy who makes drugs i said me me said nathaniel i want to make drugs ill try that said john thats an apothecary said matthew an apothecary mixes powders and makes drugs apostle means to send off is this kid a whiz or what i said pointing a thumb at matthew thats right said joshua messengers youll be sent off to spread the message that the kingdom has come isnt that what were doing now asked peter no now youre disciples but i want to appoint apostles who will take the word into the land there will be twelve for the twelve tribes of israel ill give you power to heal and power over devils youll be like me only in a different outfit youll take nothing with you except your clothes youll live only off the charity of those you preach to youll be on your own like sheep among wolves people will persecute you and spit on you and maybe beat you and if that happens well it happens shake off the dust and move on now whos with me and there was a roaring silence among the disciples how about you maggie im not much of a traveler josh makes me nauseous disciples fine with me how bout you biff im good thanks joshua stood up and just counted them off nathaniel peter andrew philip james john thaddeus judas matthew thomas bartholomew and simon youre the apostles now get out there and apostilize and they all looked at each other spread the good news the son of man is here the kingdom is coming go go go they got up and sort of milled around can we take our wives asked james yes or one of the women disciples asked matthew yes can thomas two go too yes thomas two can go their questions answered they milled around some more biff joshua said will you assign territories for everybody and send them out okeydokey i said who wants samaria no one good peter its yours give em hell caesarea come on you weenies step up thus were the twelve appointed to their sacred mission the next morning seventy of the people who wed recruited to help feed the multitude came to joshua when they heard about the appointing of the apostles why only twelve one man asked you all want to cast off what you own leave your families and risk persecution and death to spread the good news joshua asked yes they all shouted joshua looked at me as if he himself couldnt believe it it was a really good sermon i said so be it said joshua biff you and matthew assign territories send no one to his hometown that doesnt seem to work very well and so the twelve and the seventy were sent out and joshua maggie and i went into decapolis which was the territory of herods brother philip and camped and fished and basically hid out joshua preached a little but only to small groups and although he did heal the sick he asked them not to tell anyone about the miracles after three months hiding in philips territory word came by boat from across the lake that someone had intervened on joshuas behalf with the pharisees and that the death warrant which had never really been formal had been lifted we went home to capernaum and waited for the apostles to return their enthusiasm had waned some after months in the field it sucks people are mean lepers are creepy matthew came out of judea with more news of joshuas mysterious benefactor from jerusalem his name is joseph of arimathea said matthew hes a wealthy merchant and he owns ships and vineyards and olive presses he seems to have the ear of the pharisees but he is not one of them his wealth has given him some influence with the romans as well they are considering making him a citizen i hear what makes him want to help us i asked i talked to him for a long time about the kingdom and about the holy ghost and the rest of joshuas message he believes matthew smiled broadly obviously proud of his powerful convert he wants you to come to his house for dinner joshua in jerusalem are you sure its safe for joshua there asked maggie joseph has sent this letter guaranteeing joshuas safety along with all who accompany him to jerusalem matthew held out the letter maggie took the scroll and unrolled it my name is on this too and biffs joseph knew you would be coming and i told him that biff sticks to joshua like a leech excuse me i mean that you accompany the master wherever he travels matthew added quickly but why me maggie asked your brother simon who is called lazarus he is very sick dying hes asked for you joseph wanted you to know that you would have safe passage josh grabbed his satchel and started walking that moment lets go he said peter you are in charge until i return biff maggie we need to make tiberius before dark im going to see if i can borrow some camels there matthew you come too you know this joseph and thomas you come along i want to talk to you so off we went into what i was sure were the jaws of a trap along the way joshua called thomas to walk beside him maggie and i walked behind them only a few paces so we could hear their conversation thomas kept stopping to make sure that thomas two could keep up with them they all think im mad thomas said they laugh at me behind my back thomas two has told me thomas you know i can lay my hands upon you and you will be cured thomas two will no longer speak to you the others wont laugh at you thomas walked along for a while without saying anything but when he looked back at joshua i could see tears streaking his cheeks if thomas two goes away then ill be alone you wont be alone youll have me not for long you dont have long with us how do you know that thomas two told me we wont tell the others quite yet all right thomas not if you dont want me to but you wont cure me will you you wont make thomas two go away no joshua said we may both need an extra friend soon he patted thomas on the shoulder then turned to walk on ahead to catch up with matthew well dont step on him thomas shouted sorry said joshua i looked at maggie did you hear that she nodded you cant let it happen biff he doesnt seem to care about his own life but i do and you do and if you let harm come to him ill never forgive you but maggie everyone is supposed to be forgiven not you not if something happens to josh so be it so hey once joshua heals your brother you want to go do something get some pomegranate juice or a falafel or get married or something she stopped in her tracks so i stopped too are you ever paying attention to anything that goes on around you im sorry i was overcome by faith there for a moment what did you say when we got to bethany martha was waiting for us in the street in front of simons house she went right to joshua and he held out his arms to embrace her but when she got to him she pushed him away my brother is dead she said where were you i came as soon as i heard maggie went to martha and held her as they both cried the rest of us stood around feeling awkward the two old blind guys crustus and abel whom joshua had once healed came over from across the street dead dead and buried four days said crustus he turned a sort of chartreuse at the end emerald it was emerald not chartreuse said abel my friend simon truly sleeps then joshua said thomas came up and put his hand on joshuas shoulder no master hes dead thomas two thinks it may have been a hairball simon was a leopard you know i couldnt stand it he was a leper you idiot not a leopard well he is dead shouted thomas back not sleeping joshua was being figurative he knows hes dead do you guys think you could be just a little more insensitive said matthew pointing to the weeping sisters look tax collector when i want your two shekels ill ask where is he joshua asked his voice booming over the sobs and protests martha pushed out of her sisters embrace and looked at joshua he bought a tomb in kidron said martha take me there i need to wake my friend dead said thomas dead dead dead there was a sparkle of hope amid the tears in marthas eyes wake him dead as a doornail dead as moses mmmph matthew clamped his hand over thomass mouth which saved me having to render the twin unconscious with a brick you believe that simon will rise from the dead dont you asked joshua in the end when the kingdom comes and everyone is raised yes i believe do you believe i am who i say i am of course then show me where my friend lies sleeping martha moved like a sleepwalker her exhaustion and grief driven back just enough for her to lead us up the road to the mount of olives and down into the kidron valley maggie had been deeply shaken by the news of her brothers death as well so thomas and matthew helped her along while i walked with joshua four days dead josh four days divine spark or not the flesh is empty simon will walk again if he is but bone said joshua okeydokey but this has never been one of your better miracles when we got to the tomb there was a tall thin aristocratic man sitting outside eating a fig he was cleanshaven and his gray hair was cut short like a romans if he hadnt worn the twostriped tunic of a jew i would have thought him a roman citizen i thought you would come here he said he knelt before joshua rabbi im joseph of arimathea i sent word through your disciple matthew that i wanted to meet with you how may i serve stand up joseph help roll away this stone as with many of the larger tombs carved into the side of the mountain there was a large flat stone covering the doorway joshua put his arms around maggie and martha while the rest of us wrestled with the stone as soon as the seal was broken i was hit with a stench that gagged me and thomas actually lost his supper in the dirt he stinks said matthew i thought he would smell more like a cat said thomas dont make me come over there thomas i said we pushed the stone as far as it would go then we ran away gasping for fresh air joshua held his arms out as if waiting to embrace his friend come out simon lazarus come out into the light nothing but stench came out of the tomb come forth simon come out of that tomb joshua commanded and absolutely nothing happened joseph of arimathea shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot i wanted to talk to you about the dinner at my house before you got there joshua joshua held up his hand for silence simon dammit come out of there and ever so weakly there came a voice from inside the tomb no what do you mean no you have risen from the dead now come forth show these unbelievers that you have risen i believe i said convinced me said matthew a no is as good as a personal appearance as far as im concerned said joseph of arimathea im not sure any of us who had smelled the stench of rotting flesh really wanted to see the source even maggie and martha seemed a little dubious about their brothers coming out simon get your leprous ass out here joshua commanded but imim all icky weve all seen icky before said joshua now come out into the light my skin is all green like an unripe olive olive green declared crustus who had followed us into kidron i told you it wasnt chartreuse what the hell does he know hes dead said abel finally joshua lowered his arms and stormed into the tomb i cant believe that you bring a guy back from the dead and he doesnt even have the courtesy to come outwhoa holy moly joshua came backing out of the tomb stifflegged very calmly and quietly he said we need clean clothes and some water to wash with and bandages lots of bandages i can heal him but we have to sort of get all of his parts stuck back together first hold on simon joshua shouted to the tomb were getting some supplies then ill come in and heal your affliction what affliction asked simon chapter when it was all finished simon looked great better than id ever seen him look joshua had not only raised him from the dead but also healed his leprosy maggie and martha were ecstatic the new and improved simon invited us back to his house to celebrate unfortunately abel and crustus had witnessed the resurrection and the healing and despite our admonishments they started to spread the story through bethany and jerusalem joseph of arimathea accompanied us to simons house but he was hardly in a celebratory mood this dinners not exactly a trap he told joshua its more like a test ive been to one of their trials by dinner said joshua i thought you were a believer i am said joseph especially after what i saw today but thats why you have to come to my house and have dinner with the pharisees from the council show them who you are explain to them in an informal setting what it is that you are doing satan himself once asked me to prove myself said joshua what proof do i owe these hypocrites please joshua they may be hypocrites but they have great influence over the people because they condemn you the people are afraid to listen to the word i know pontius pilate i dont think anyone would harm you in my home and risk his wrath joshua sat for a moment sipping his wine then into the den of vipers i shall go dont do it joshua i said and you have to come alone said joseph you cant bring any of the apostles thats not a problem i said im only a disciple especially not him said joseph jakan bar iban will be there so i guess its another night sitting home for me too said maggie later we all watched and waved as joseph and joshua left to go back to jerusalem for the dinner at josephs house as soon as they get around the corner you follow them maggie said to me of course stay close enough to hear if he needs you absolutely come here she pulled me inside the door where the others wouldnt see and gave me one of those maggie kisses that made me walk into walls and forget my name for a few minutes it was the first in months she released me and held me at arms length then you know that if there were no joshua i wouldnt love anyone but you she said you dont have to bribe me to watch over him maggie i know thats one of the reasons i love you she said now go my years of trying to sneak up on the monks in the monastery paid me back as i shadowed joshua and joseph through jerusalem they had no idea i was following as i slipped from shadow to shadow wall to tree finally to josephs house which lay south of the city walls only a stones throw from the palace of the high priest caiaphas joseph of arimatheas house was only slightly smaller than the palace itself but i was able to find a spot on the roof of an adjacent building where i could watch the dinner through a window and still have a view of the front door joshua and joseph sat in the dining room drinking wine by themselves for a while then gradually the servants let in the other guests as they arrived in groups of twos and threes there were a dozen of them by the time dinner was served all of the pharisees that had been at the dinner at jakans house plus five more that i had never seen before but all were severe and meticulous about washing before dinner and checking each other to make sure that all was in order i couldnt hear what they were saying but i really didnt care there seemed to be no immediate threat to joshua and that was all i was worried about he could hold his own on the rhetorical battlefield then when it seemed that it would end without incident i saw the tall hat and white robe of a priest in the street and with him two temple guards carrying their long bronzetipped spears i dropped down off the roof and made my way around the opposite side of the house arriving just in time to see a servant lead the priest inside as soon as joshua came through the door at simons house martha and maggie showered him with kisses as if he had returned from the war then led him to the table and started interrogating him about the dinner first they yelled at me for having fun drinking wine and feasting saying that if i was truly a prophet i would fast and what did you tell them i asked still a little winded from the running to get to simons house ahead of joshua i said well john didnt eat anything but bugs and he never drank wine in his life and he certainly never had any fun and they didnt believe him so what kind of standards were they trying to set and please pass the tabbouleh what did they say then then they yelled at me for eating with tax collectors and harlots hey said matthew hey said martha they didnt mean you martha they meant maggie hey said maggie i told them that tax collectors and harlots would see the kingdom of god before they did then they yelled at me for healing on the sabbath not washing my hands before i eat being in league with the devil again and blaspheming by claiming to be the son of god then what then we had dessert it was some sort of cake made with dates and honey i liked it then a guy came to the door wearing priests robes uhoh said matthew yeah that was bad said joshua he went around whispering in the ears of all the pharisees then jakan asked me by what authority i raised simon from the dead and what did you say i didnt say anything not with the sadducee there but joseph told them that simon hadnt been dead he was just sleeping so what did they say to that then they asked me by what authority i woke him up and what did you say i got angry then i said by all the authority of god and the holy ghost by the authority of moses and elijah by the authority of david and solomon by the authority of thunder and lightning by the authority of the sea and the air and the fire in the earth i told them and what did they say they said that simon must have been a very sound sleeper sarcasm is wasted on those guys i said completely wasted said joshua anyway then i left and outside there were two guards from the temple the shafts of their spears had been broken and they were both unconscious there was blood on ones scalp so i healed them and when i saw they were coming around i came here they dont think you attacked the guards simon asked no the priest followed me down he saw them at the same time that i did and your healing them didnt convince him hardly so what do we do now i think we should go back to galilee joseph will send word if anything comes of the meeting of the council you know what will come of it maggie said you threaten them and now they have the priests involved you know what will happen yes i do said joshua but you dont well leave for capernaum in the morning later maggie came to me in the great room of simons house where we were all bedded down for the night she crawled under my blanket and put her lips right next to my ear as usual she smelled of lemons and cinnamon what did you do to those guards she whispered i surprised them i thought they might be there to arrest joshua you might have gotten him arrested look have you done this before because if you have some sort of plan please let me in on it personally im making this up as i go along you did good she whispered she kissed my ear thank you i reached for her and she shimmied away and im still not going to sleep with you she said the messenger must have ridden through several nights to get ahead of us but when we got back to capernaum there was already a message waiting from joseph of arimathea joshua pharisee council condemned you to death for blasphemy herod concurs no official death warrant issued but suggest you take disciples into herod philips territory until things settle down no word from the priests yet which is good enjoyed having you at dinner please drop by next time youre in town your friend joseph of arimathea joshua read the message aloud to all of us then pointed to a deserted mountaintop on the northern shore of the lake near bethsaida before we leave galilee again i am going up that mountain i will stay there until all in galilee who wish to hear the good news have come only then will i leave to go to philips territory go out now and find the faithful tell them where to find me joshua peter said there are already two or three hundred sick and lame waiting at the synagogue for you to heal them theyve been gathering for all the days youve been gone why didnt you tell me well bartholomew greeted them and took their names then we told them that youd be with them as soon as you got the chance theyre fine i lead the dogs back and forth by them occasionally so we look busy said bart joshua stormed off to the synagogue waving his hands in the air as if asking god why he had been plagued by a gang of dimwits but then i might have been reading that into his gesture the rest of us spread out into galilee to announce that joshua was going to be preaching a great sermon on a mountain north of capernaum maggie and i traveled together along with simon the canaanite and maggies friends johanna and susanna we decided to take three days and walk a circle through northern galilee that would take us through a dozen towns and bring us back to the mountain just in time to help direct the pilgrims that would be gathering the first night we camped in a sheltered valley outside a town called jamnith we ate bread and cheese by the fire and afterward simon and i shared wine while the women went off to sleep it was the first time id ever had a chance to talk to the zealot without his friend judas around i hope joshua can bring the kingdom down on their heads now simon said otherwise i may have to look for another prophet to pledge my sword to i nearly choked on my wine and handed him the wineskin as i fought for breath simon i said do you believe hes the son of god no you dont and youre still following him i am not saying hes not a great prophet but the christ the son of god i dont know youve traveled with him heard him speak seen his power over demons over people youve seen him heal people feed people and what does he ask nothing a place to sleep some food some wine and if you could do those things what would you have here simon leaned back and looked into the stars as he let his imagination unroll i would have villages full of women in my bed id have a fine palace and slaves to bathe me i would have the finest food and wine and kings would travel from far away just to look at my gold i would be glorious but joshua has only his cloak and his sandals simon seemed to snap out of his reverie and he wasnt happy about it just because i am weak does not make him the christ thats exactly what makes him the christ maybe hes just naive count on it i said i stood and handed him the wineskin you can finish it im going to sleep simon raised his eyebrows the magdalene shes a luscious woman a man could lose himself there i took a deep breath and thought about defending maggies honor or even warning simon about making advances on her but then i thought better of it the zealot needed to learn a lesson that i wasnt qualified to teach but maggie was good night simon i said in the morning i found simon sitting by the cold ashes of the fire cradling his head in his hands simon i inquired he looked up at me and i saw a huge purple goose egg on his forehead just below the bangs of his roman haircut a spot of blood seeped out of the middle his right eye was nearly swollen shut ouch i said how did you do that just then maggie came out from behind a bush he accidentally crawled into susannas bedroll last night maggie said i thought he was an attacker so naturally i brained him with a rock naturally i said im so sorry simon maggie said i could hear susanna and johanna giggling behind the bush it was an honest mistake said simon i couldnt tell whether he meant his or maggies but either way he was lying good thing youre an apostle i said youll have that healed up by noon we finished our loop of northern galilee without incident and indeed simon was nearly healed by the time we returned to the mountain above bethsaida where joshua awaited us with over five thousand followers i cant get away from them long enough to find baskets peter complained everywhere i go there are fifty people following me said judas how do they expect us to bring them food if they wont let us work i had heard similar complaints from matthew james and andrew and even thomas was whining that people were stepping all over thomas two joshua had multiplied seven loaves into enough to feed the multitude but no one could get to the food to distribute it maggie and i finally fought our way to the top of the mountain where we found joshua preaching he signaled the crowd that he was going to take a break then came over to us this is excellent he said so many of the faithful uh josh i know he said you two go to magdala get the big ship and bring it to bethsaida once we feed the faithful ill send the disciples down to you go out into the lake and wait for me we managed to pull john out of the crowd and took him with us to magdala to help sail the ship back up the coast neither maggie nor i felt confident enough to handle the big boat without one of the fishermen on board a halfday later we docked in bethsaida where the other apostles were waiting for us hes led them to the other side of the mountain peter said hell deliver a blessing then send them on their way hopefully theyll go home and he can meet us did you see any soldiers in the crowd i asked not yet but we should have been out of herods territory by now the pharisees are hanging on the edge of the crowd like they know something is going to happen we assumed that he would be swimming or rowing out in one of the small boats but when he finally came down to the shore the multitude was still following him and he just kept walking right across the surface of the water to the boat the crowd stopped at the shore and cheered even we were astounded by this new miracle and we sat in the boat with our mouths hanging open as joshua approached what he said what what what master youre walking on the water said peter i just ate joshua said you cant go into the water for an hour after you eat you could get a cramp what none of you guys have mothers its a miracle shouted peter its no big deal joshua said dismissing the miracle with the wave of a hand its easy really peter you should try it peter stood up in the boat tentatively really try it peter started to take off his tunic keep that on said joshua and your sandals too but lord this is a new tunic then keep it dry peter come to me step upon the water peter put one foot over the side and into the water trust your faith peter i yelled if you doubt you wont be able to do it then peter stepped with both feet onto the surface of the water and for a split second he stood there and we were all amazed hey im then he sank like a stone he came up sputtering we were all doubled over giggling and even joshua had sunk up to his ankles he was laughing so hard i cant believe you fell for that said joshua he ran across the water and helped us pull peter into the boat peter youre as dumb as a box of rocks but what amazing faith you have im going to build my church on this box of rocks you would have peter build your church asked philip because he tried to walk on the water would you have tried it asked joshua of course not said philip i cant swim then who has the greater faith joshua climbed into the boat and shook the water off of his sandals then tousled peters wet hair someone will have to carry on the church when im gone and im going to be gone soon in the spring well go to jerusalem for the passover and there i will be judged by the scribes and the priests and there i will be tortured and put to death but three days from the day of my death i shall rise and be with you again as joshua spoke maggie had latched onto my arm by the time he was finished speaking her nails had drawn blood from my biceps a shadow of grief seemed to pass over the faces of the disciples we looked not at each other and neither at the ground but at a place in space a few feet from our faces where i suppose one looks for a clear answer to appear out of undefined shock well that sucks someone said we landed at the town of hippos on the eastern shore of the sea of galilee directly across the lake from tiberius joshua had preached here before when we had come over to hide the first time and there were people in the town who would receive the apostles into their homes until joshua sent them out again wed brought many baskets of the broken bread from bethsaida and judas and simon helped me unload them from the ship wading in and out of the shallows where we anchored as hippos had no dock the bread stood piled like small mountains judas said much more than when we fed the five thousand a jewish army could fight long days on that kind of supply if the romans have taught us anything its that an army fights on its stomach i stopped schlepping and looked at him simon who stood next to me set his basket down on the beach then lifted the edge of his sash to show me the hilt of his dagger the kingdom will be ours only when we take it by the sword weve had no problem spilling roman blood no master but god i reached over and gently pulled simons sash back over the hilt of his dagger have you ever heard joshua talk about doing harm to anyone even an enemy no judas said he cant speak openly about taking the kingdom until hes ready to strike thats why he always speaks in parables that is a crock of rancid yak butter said a voice from the ship joshua sat up a net hung over his head like a tattered prayer shawl hed been sleeping in the bow of the ship and wed completely forgotten about him biff call everyone together here on the beach i havent made myself clear to everyone evidently i dropped my basket and ran into town to get the others in less than an hour we were all seated on the beach and joshua paced before us the kingdom is open to everyone joshua said evreeone get it everyone nodded even romans everyone stopped nodding the kingdom of god is upon us but the romans will remain in israel the kingdom of god has nothing to do with the kingdom of israel do you all understand that but the messiah is supposed to lead our people to freedom judas shouted no master but god simon added shut up said joshua i was not sent to deliver wrath we will be delivered into the kingdom by forgiveness not conquest people we have been over this what have i not made clear how we are to cast the romans out of the kingdom shouted nathaniel you should know better joshua said to nathaniel you yellowhaired freak one more time we cant cast the romans out of the kingdom because the kingdom is open to all and i think they were getting it at least the two zealots were getting it because they looked profoundly disappointed theyd waited their whole life for the messiah to come along and establish the kingdom by crushing the romans now he was telling them in his own divine words that it wasnt going to happen but then joshua started with the parables the kingdom is like a wheat field with tares you cant pull out the tares without destroying the grain blank stares doubly blank from the fishermen who didnt know squat from farming metaphors a tare is a rye grass joshua explained it weaves its roots amid the roots of wheat or barley and theres no way to pull them out without ruining the crop nobody got it okay joshua continued the children of heaven are the good people and the tares are the bad ones you get both and when youre all done the angels pick out the wicked and burn them not getting it said peter he shook his head and his gray mane whipped around his face like a confused lion trying to shake off the sight of a flying wildebeest how do you guys preach this stuff if you dont understand it okay try this the kingdom of heaven is like uh a merchant seeking pearls like before swine said bartholomew yes bart yes only no swine this time same pearls though three hours later joshua was still at it and he was starting to run out of things to liken the kingdom to his favorite the mustard seed having failed in three different tries okay the kingdom is like a monkey joshua was hoarse and his voice was breaking how a jewish monkey right is it like a monkey eating a mustard seed i stood up and went to joshua and put my arm around his shoulder josh take a break i led him down the beach toward the village he shook his head those are the dumbest sons of bitches on earth theyve become like little children as you told them to stupid little children joshua said i heard light footsteps on the sand behind us and maggie threw her arms around our necks she kissed joshua on the forehead making a loud wet smacking sound then looked as if she was going to do the same to me so i shied away you two are the ninnies here you both rail on them about their intelligence when that doesnt have anything to do with why theyre here have either one of you heard them preach i have peter can heal the sick now ive seen it ive seen james make the lame walk faith isnt an act of intelligence its an act of imagination every time you give them a new metaphor for the kingdom they see the metaphor a mustard seed a field a garden a vineyard its like pointing something out to a catthe cat looks at your finger not at what youre pointing at they dont need to understand it they only need to believe and they do they imagine the kingdom as they need it to be they dont need to grasp it its there already they can let it be imagination not intellect maggie let go of our necks then stood there grinning like a madwoman joshua looked at her then at me i shrugged i told you she was smarter than both of us i know joshua said i dont know if i can stand you both being right in the same day i need some time to think and pray go on then maggie said waving him on i stopped and watched my friend walk into the village having absolutely no idea what i was supposed to do i turned back to maggie you heard the passover prediction she nodded i take it you didnt confront him i dont know what to say we need to talk him out of it if he knows what awaits him in jerusalem why go why dont we go into phoenicia or syria he could even take the good news to greece and be perfectly safe they have people running all over the place preaching different ideaslook at bartholomew and his cynics when we were in india we saw a festival in the city of their goddess kali shes a goddess of destruction maggie it was the bloodiest thing ive ever seen thousands of animals slaughtered hundreds of men beheaded the whole world seemed slick with blood joshua and i saved some children from being flayed alive but when it was over joshua kept saying no more sacrifices no more maggie looked at me as if she expected more so it was horrible what did you expect him to say he wasnt talking to me maggie he was talking to god and i dont think he was making a request are you saying that he thinks his father wants to kill him for trying to change things so he cant avoid it because its the will of god no im saying that hes going to allow himself to be killed to show his father that things need to be changed hes not going to try to avoid it at all for three months we begged we pleaded we reasoned and we wept but we could not talk joshua out of going to jerusalem for passover joseph of arimathea had sent word that the pharisees and sadducees were still plotting against joshua that jakan had been speaking out against joshuas followers in the court of the gentiles outside the temple but the threats only seemed to strengthen joshuas resolve a couple of times maggie and i managed to tie joshua up and stash him in the bottom of a boat using knots that we had learned from the sailor brothers peter and andrew but both times joshua appeared a few minutes later holding the cords that had bound him saying things like good knots but not quite good enough were they maggie and i worried together for days before we left for jerusalem he could be wrong about the execution i said yes he could be maggie agreed do you think he is wrong about it i mean i think im going to throw up i dont see how thats going to stop him and it didnt the next day we left for jerusalem on the way we stopped to rest along the road at a town along the jordan river called beth shemesh we were sitting there feeling somber and helpless watching the column of pilgrims move along the riverbank when an old woman emerged from the column and beat her way through the reclining apostles with a walking staff out of the way i need to talk to this fellow move you oaf you need to take a bath she bonked bartholomew on the head as she passed and his doggy pals nipped at her heels look out there im an old woman i need to see this joshua of nazareth oh no mother john wailed james got up to stop her and she threatened him with the staff what can i help you with old mother joshua asked im the wife of zebedee mother of these two she pointed her staff to james and john i hear that youre going to the kingdom soon if it be so so be it said joshua well my late husband zebedee god rest his soul left these boys a perfectly good business and since theyve been following you around theyve run it into the ground she turned to her sons into the ground joshua put his hand on her arm but instead of the usual calm that i saw come over people when he touched them mrs zebedee pulled away and swung her staff at him barely missing his head dont try to bamboozle me mr smooth talker my boys have ruined their fathers business for you so i want your assurance that in return they get to sit on either side of the throne in the kingdom its only fair theyre good boys she turned to james and john if your father was alive it would kill him to see what you two have done but old mother its not up to me who will sit next to the throne who is it up to well its up to the lord my father well then go ask him she leaned on her staff and tapped a foot ill wait but you would deny a dying woman her last request youre not dying youre killing me here go check go joshua looked at us all sheepishly we all looked away cowards that we were its not as if any of us had ever learned to deal with a jewish mother either ill go up on that mountain and check joshua said pointing to the highest peak in the area well go then you want i should be late for the passover right okay then ill go check right now josh backed away slowly sort of sidled toward the mountain mount tabor i think it was mrs zebedee went after her sons like she was shooing chickens out of the garden what are you pillars of salt go with him peter laughed and she whirled around with her staff ready to brain him peter pretended to cough id better go along uh just in case they need a witness he scurried after joshua and the other two the old woman glared at me what are you looking at you think the pain of childbirth ends when they move away what do you know does a broken heart know from a different neighborhood they were gone all night a very long night in which we all got to hear about john and james father zebedee who evidently had possessed the courage of daniel the wisdom of solomon the strength of samson the devotion of abraham the good looks of david and the tackle of goliath god rest his soul funny james had always described his father as a wormy little guy with a lisp when the four came back over the hill we all leapt to our feet and ran to greet themi would have carried them back on my shoulders if it would have shut the old woman up well she said it was amazing peter said to us all ignoring the old woman we saw three thrones moses was on one elijah was on another and the third was ready for joshua and a huge voice came out of the sky saying this is my son with whom i am well pleased oh yeah he said that before i said i heard it this time joshua said smiling just the three chairs then said mrs zebedee she looked at her two sons who were cowering behind joshua no place for you two of course she started to stagger away from them a hand clutched to her heart i suppose one can be happy for the mothers of moses and elijah and this nazareth boy then they dont have to know what it is to have a spike in the heart down the riverbank she limped off toward jerusalem joshua squeezed the brothers shoulders ill fix it he ran after mrs zebedee maggie elbowed me and when i looked around at her there were tears in her eyes hes not wrong she said thats it i said well ask his mother to talk him out of it no one can resist heri mean i cant i mean shes not you butlook is that a seagull part vi passion nobodys perfect well there was this one guy but we killed him anonymous sunday joshuas mother and his brother james found us outside of the golden gate of jerusalem where we were waiting for bartholomew and john who were looking for nathaniel and philip to return with james and andrew who were off trying to find judas and thomas who had been sent into the city to look for peter and maggie who were looking for thaddeus and simon who had been sent to look for a donkey youd think theyd have found one by now mary said according to prophecy joshua was supposed to enter the city on the colt of a donkey of course no one was going to find one that was the plan even joshuas brother james had agreed to be part of the conspiracy hed gone ahead to wait inside the gate just in case one of the disciples had missed the point and actually came back with a donkey about a thousand of joshuas followers from galilee had gathered on the road to the golden gate they had lined the road with palm fronds for joshuas entrance to the city and they were cheering and singing hosannas all afternoon in anticipation of his triumphant entrance but as the afternoon wore into evening and no colt showed the crowd gradually dispersed as everybody got hungry and went into the city to find something to eat only joshua his mother and i were still waiting i was hoping you might talk some sense into him i said to mary ive seen this coming for a long time mary said she wore her usual blue dress and shawl and the usual light in her face seemed faded not by age but by grief why do you think i sent for him two years ago it was true she had sent joshuas younger brothers judah and jose to the synagogue at capernaum to bring him home claiming he was mad but joshua hadnt even gone outside to meet them i wish you two wouldnt talk about me like im not here joshua said were trying to get used to it i said if you dont like it then give up this stupid plan to sacrifice yourself what do you think weve been preparing for all of these years biff if id known it was this i wouldnt have helped youd still be stuck in a wine amphora in india he squinted to see through the gate where is everyone how hard can it be to find one simple ass i looked at joshuas mother and although there was pain in her eyes she smiled dont look at me she said no one on my side of the family would ever sacrifice a straight line like that it was too easy so i let it go theyre all at simons house in bethany josh they arent coming back tonight joshua didnt say a word he just climbed to his feet and walked off toward bethany there is nothing you can do to stop this from happening joshua screamed at the apostles who were gathered in the front room of simons house martha ran from the room crying when joshua glared at her simon looked at the floor as did the rest of us the priest and the scribes will take me and put me on trial they will spit on me and scourge me and then they will kill me i will rise from the dead on the third day and walk among you again but you cannot stop what must happen if you love me you will accept what im telling you maggie got up and ran out of the house snatching the communal purse from judas as she went the zealot started to rise to go after her but i pushed him back down on his cushion let her go we all sat there in silence trying to think of something to do something to say i dont know what everyone else was thinking but i was still trying to formulate some way for joshua to make his point without giving his life martha returned to the room with wine and cups and served each of us in turn not looking at joshua when she filled his cup joshuas mother followed her back out of the room i presumed to help her prepare supper in time maggie came back sliding through the door and going directly to joshua where she sat down at his feet she took the communal purse out of her cloak and from it she pulled a small alabaster box the sort that was used to store the precious ointments that women used to anoint the bodies of the dead at burial she tossed the empty purse to judas without a word she broke the seal on the box and poured the ointment on joshuas feet then untied her long hair and began to wipe the oil from his feet with it the rich aroma of spices and perfume filled the room in an instant judas was on his feet and across the room he snatched the box of ointment off the floor the money from this could have fed hundreds of the poor joshua looked up at the zealot and there were tears in his eyes youll always have the poor judas but im only here for a short while longer let her be but let her be joshua said he held out his hand and judas slammed the alabaster box into it then stormed out of the house i could hear him shouting out in the street but i couldnt make out what he was saying maggie poured the rest of the oil on joshuas head and drew patterns on his forehead with her finger joshua tried to take her hand but she pulled it away from him and stepped back until he dropped his hand a dead man cant love she said be still when we followed joshua to the temple the next morning maggie was nowhere to be seen monday on monday joshua led us through the golden gate into jerusalem but this time there were no palm fronds laid on the road and no one was singing hosannas well there was this one guy but he was always singing hosannas at the golden gate if you gave him a coin hed stop for a while it would be nice to be able to buy a little something for breakfast judas said if the magdalene hadnt spent all of our money joshua smells nice though nathaniel said dont you think joshua smells nice sometimes you find yourself grateful for the most unlikely things right then when i saw judas grit his teeth and the vein stand out on his forehead i said a quick prayer of thanks for nathaniels naïveté he does smell nice said bartholomew it makes one want to reassess ones values regarding the material comforts thank you bart said joshua yes theres nothing like a goodsmelling man said john dreamily suddenly we were all very uncomfortable and there was a lot of throatclearing and coughing and we all walked a few paces farther apart i havent told you about john have i then john started to make a great and pathetic show of noticing the women as they passed why that little heifer would give a man some strong sons john said in a booming and falsely masculine voice a man could surely plant some seed there he could please shut up james said to his brother maybe said philip you could have your mother come over and tell that woman to cleave unto you everyone snickered even joshua well everyone except james you see he said to his brother you see what youve started you little nancy theres a nubile wench exclaimed john unconvincingly he pointed to a woman who was being dragged toward the city gates by a group of pharisees her clothes hanging in shreds on her body which indeed appeared to be nubile so credit to john for working outside of his element block the road joshua said the pharisees came up to our human blockade and stopped let us pass rabbi the oldest of them said this woman has been caught in the act of adultery this very day and were taking her out of the city to be stoned as is the law the woman was young and her hair fell in dirty curls around her face terror had twisted her face and her eyes were rolled back in her head but an hour ago she had probably been pretty joshua crouched and began writing in the dust at his feet whats your name he asked jamal said the leader i watched joshua write the mans name then next to it a list of sins wow jamal i said a goose i didnt even know that was possible jamal dropped the adulteresss arm and stepped back joshua looked up at the other man who was holding the woman and your name uh steve said that man his name is not steve said another man in the crowd its jacob joshua wrote jacob in the dust no said jacob he let go of the woman pushing her toward us then joshua stood up and took the stone from the man nearest him who surrendered it easily his attention was focused on the list of sins written in the dirt now let us stone this harlot joshua said whoever of you is without sin cast the first stone and he held out the stone to them they gradually backed away in a moment they had all gone back the way they had come and the adulteress fell to joshuas feet and hugged his ankles thank you rabbi thank you so much thats okay said joshua he lifted her to her feet now go and sin no more you really smell good you know that she said yeah thanks now go she started off i should make sure she gets home okay i said i started off after her but joshua caught the back of my tunic and pulled me back you missed the sin no more part of my instructions look ive already committed adultery with her in my heart so you know why not enjoy it no youre the one who set the standards by those rules even john committed adultery with her in his heart and he doesnt even like women do too said john to the temple joshua said pressing on waste of a perfectly good adulteress if you ask me in the outer court of the temple where the women and the gentiles were allowed to go joshua called us all together and began to preach the kingdom each time he would get started a vendor would come by barking get your doves get your sacrificial doves pure as the driven snow everybody needs one then joshua would begin again and the next vendor would come by unleavened bread get your unleavened bread only one shekel piping hot matzo just like moses ate on the way out of egypt only fresher and a little girl who was lame was brought to joshua and he started to heal her and ask about her faith when your denariis changed to shekels while you wait no amount too large or small drachmas to talents talents to shekelsall your money changed while you wait do you believe that the lord loves you joshua asked the little girl bitter herbs get your bitter herbs cried a vendor dammit all joshua screamed in frustration youre healed child now get out of here he waved off the little girl who got up and walked for the first time in her life then he slapped a dove vendor ripped the top off his cage of birds and released a cloud of doves into the sky this is a house of prayer not a den of thieves oh no not the moneychangers peter whispered to me joshua grabbed a long low table where men were changing a dozen currencies into shekels the only coin allowed for commerce inside the temple complex and he flipped it over oh thats it hes fucked philip said and he was the priests took a big percentage from the moneychangers he might have slid by before but now hed interfered with their income out you vipers out joshua had taken a coil of rope from one of the vendors and was using it as a scourge to drive the vendors and the moneychangers out of the temple gates nathaniel and thomas had joined in joshuas tirade kicking at the merchants as they scampered away but the rest of us sat staring or ministered to those who had come to hear joshua speak we should stop this i said to peter you think you could stop this peter nodded to the corner of the courtyard where at least twenty priests had come out from the inner temple to watch the fracas hes going to bring down the wrath of the priests on all of us judas said he was looking at the temple guards who had stopped pacing the walls and were watching the goingson below in the courtyard to judas credit he simon and a few of the others had managed to calm the small crowd of the faithful who had gathered to be blessed and healed before joshuas tantrum beyond the walls of the temple we could see the roman soldiers staring down from the battlements of herod the greats old palace which the governor commandeered during feast weeks when he brought the legions to jerusalem the romans didnt enter the temple unless they sensed insurrection but if they entered jewish blood would be spilled rivers of it they wont come in peter said a tiny note of doubt in his voice they can see that this is a jewish matter they dont care if we kill each other just watch judas and simon i said if one of them starts with that nomasterbutgod thing the romans will come down like an executioners blade finally joshua was out of breath soaked in sweat and barely able to swing the coil of rope he was carrying but the temple was clear of merchants a large crowd had started to follow him shouting at the vendors as joshua drove them out of the temple the crowd probably eight hundred to a thousand people was the only thing that kept the priests from calling the guards down on joshua right then josh tossed the rope aside and led the crowd back to where we had been watching in horror thieves he said to us breathlessly as he passed then he went to a little girl with a withered arm who had been waiting beside judas pretty scary huh joshua said to her she nodded joshua put his hands over her withered arm are those guys in the tall hats coming over here she nodded again here can you make this sign with your finger he showed her how to stick out her middle finger no not with that hand with this one joshua took his hand away from her withered arm and she wiggled her fingers the muscle and tendons had filled out until it looked identical to her other arm now joshua said make that sign thats good now show it to those guys behind me with the tall hats thats a good girl by whose authority do you perform these healings said one of the priests obviously the highestranking of the group no master simon began to shout but he was cut off by a vicious blow to the solar plexus from peter who then pushed the zealot to the ground and sat on him while furiously whispering in his ear andrew had come up behind judas and seemed to be delivering a similar lecture without benefit of the body blow josh took a little boy from his mothers arms and held him the boys legs waved in the air as if they had no bones at all without looking away from the boy joshua said by what authority did john baptize the priests looked around among themselves the crowd moved in closer we were in judea johns territory the priests knew better than to challenge johns authority under god in front of a crowd this size but they certainly werent going to confirm it for joshuas sake either we cant say at this time said the priest then i cant say either said joshua he stood the little boy on his feet and held him steady as the boys legs took his full weight probably for the first time ever the boy wobbled like a newborn colt and joshua caught him and laughed he took the boys shoulders and helped him walk back to his mother then he turned on the priests and looked at them for the first time you would test me test me ask me what you will you vipers but i will heal these people and they shall know the word of god in spite of you philip had moved up behind me during this speech and he whispered cant you knock him out or something with your methods from the east we have to get him out of here before he says any more i think were too late john i said just dont let the crowd disperse go out into the city and bring more the crowd is his only protection now and find joseph of arimathea too he might be able to help if this gets out of hand this isnt out of hand you know what i mean the inquisition went on for two hours with the priests concocting every verbal trap they could think of and joshua wiggling out sometimes and blundering through at others i looked for some way to get joshua out of the temple without him being arrested but the more i looked the more i noticed that the guards had moved down off the walls and were hovering around the gates to the courtyard meanwhile the chief priest droned on a man dies and leaves no sons but his wife marries his brother who has three sons by his first wifeand on the three of them leave jericho and head south going three point three furlongs per hour but they are leading two donkeys which can carry twoand on so the sabbath ends and they are able to resume adding on the thousand steps allowed under the lawand the wind is blowing southwest at two furlongs per hourand on how much water will be required for the journey give your answer in firkins five joshua said as soon as they stopped speaking and all were amazed the crowd roared a woman shouted surely he is the messiah the son of god has come said another you guys arent helping i shouted back at them you didnt show your work you didnt show your work chanted the youngest of the priests judas and matthew had been scratching out the problem on the paving stones of the courtyard as the priest recited but they had long since lost track they looked up and shook their heads five joshua repeated the priests looked around among themselves thats right but that doesnt give you authority to heal in the temple in three days there will be no temple for ill destroy it and you nest of vipers with it and three days after that a new temple shall be built in honor of my father and then i grabbed him around the chest and started dragging him toward the gate the other apostles followed the plan and moved around us in a wedge beyond that the crowd pressed in hundreds moved along with us wait im not done joshua yelled yes you are surely the true king of israel has come to bring forth the kingdom one woman shouted peter smacked her on the back of the head stop helping by the sheer mass of the crowd we were able to get joshua out of the temple and through the streets to joseph of arimatheas house joseph let us in and led us to the upper room which had a high arched stone ceiling rich carpets on the floors and walls piles of cushions and a long low table for dining youre safe here but i dont know for how long theyve already called a meeting of the sanhedrin but we just left the temple i said how you should have let them take me joshua said the table will be set for the passover feast of the essenes joseph said stay here for supper celebrate the passover early why john asked why celebrate with the essenes joseph looked away from joshua when he answered because at the essenes feast they dont kill a lamb tuesday we all slept that night in the upper room of josephs house in the morning joshua went downstairs he was gone for a bit then came back up the stairs they wont let me leave he said they the apostles my own apostles wont let me leave he went back to the stairway youre interfering with the will of god he shouted down he turned back to me did you tell them not to let me leave me yep you cant do that i sent nathaniel to simons to fetch maggie he returned alone maggie wouldnt talk to him but martha did temple soldiers had been there josh so what do you mean so they were there to arrest you let them joshua you dont have to sacrifice yourself to prove this point ive been thinking about it all night you can negotiate with the lord abraham did it remember over the destruction of sodom and gomorrah he starts out getting the lord to agree to spare the cities if he can find fifty righteous men but by the end he talks god down to ten you can try something like that thats not completely the point biff here he came over to me but i found i couldnt look him in the eye so i went to one of the large arched windows that looked down on the street im afraid of thisof whats going to happen i can think of a dozen things id rather do this week than be sacrificed but i know that it has to happen when i told the priests that i would tear the temple down in three days i meant that all the corruption all the pretense all the ritual of the temple that keeps men from knowing god would be destroyed and on the third day when i come back everything will be new and the kingdom of god will be everywhere im coming back biff yeah i know you said that well believe in me youre not good at resurrections josh remember the old woman in japhia the soldier in sepphoris what did he last three minutes but look at maggies brother simon hes been back from the dead for months now yeah and he smells funny he does not no really when you get close to him he smells spoiled how would you know you wont get close to him because he used to be a leper thaddeus mentioned it the other day he said biff i believe this simon lazarus fellow has spoiled really then lets go ask thaddeus he might not remember joshua went down the steps to a lowceilinged room with a mosaic floor and small windows cut high in the walls joshuas mother and brother james had joined the apostles they all sat there against the walls their faces turned to joshua like flowers to the sun waiting for him to say something that would give them hope im going to wash your feet he said to joseph of arimathea he said i need a basin of water and a sponge the tall aristocrat bowed and went off to find a servant what a pleasant surprise mary said james the brother rolled his eyes and sighed heavily im going out i said i looked at peter as if to say dont let him out of your sight he understood perfectly and nodded come back for the seder joshua said i have some things i have to teach you in the little time i have left there was no one home at simons house i knocked on the door for a long time then finally let myself in there was no evidence of a morning meal but the mikveh had been used so i guessed that they had each bathed and then gone to the temple i walked the streets of jerusalem trying to think of some solution but everything i had learned seemed useless as evening fell i made my way back to josephs house taking the long route so i didnt have to pass the palace of the high priest joshua was waiting inside sitting on the steps to the upper room when i came in peter and andrew sat on either side of him obviously there to ensure that he didnt accidentally skip down to the high priest and turn himself in for blasphemy where have you been joshua said i need to wash your feet do you have any idea how hard it is to find a ham in jerusalem during passover week i said i thought it would be nice you know some ham on matzo with a little bitter herb he washed us all peter said of course we had to hold bart down but even hes clean and as i washed them they will go out and wash others by showing them forgiveness oh i get it i said its a parable cute lets go eat we all lay around the big table with joshua at the head joshuas mother had prepared a traditional passover supper with the exception of the lamb to begin the seder nathaniel who was the youngest had to ask a question why is this night different from every other night of the year barts feet are clean said thomas joseph of arimathea is picking up the tab said philip nathaniel laughed and shook his head no its because other nights we eat bread and matzo but tonight we only eat matzo jeez he grinned probably feeling smart for the first time in his life and why do we only eat the matzo on this night asked nathaniel skip ahead nate i said were all jews here summarize unleavened bread because there was no time for it to rise with pharaohs soldiers on our tail bitter herbs for the bitterness of slavery god delivered us into the promised land it was swell lets eat amen said everyone that was pathetic said peter yeah was it i said angrily well we sit here with the son of god waiting for someone to come and take him away and kill him and none of us is going to do a damn thing about it including god so forgive me if im not peeing all over myself about having been delivered out of the hands of the egyptians about a million years ago youre forgiven said joshua then he stood up what i am is in you all the divine spark the holy ghost it unites you all it is the god that is in you all do you understand that of course god is part of you james the brother said hes your father no in all of you watch take this bread he took a matzo and broke it into pieces he gave a piece to everyone in the room and took a piece himself then he ate it now the bread is part of me the bread is me now all of you eat it everybody looked at him eat it he screamed so we ate it now it is part of you i am part of you you all share the same part of god lets try again hand me that wine and so it went like that for a couple of hours and i think that by the time the wine was gone the apostles actually grasped what joshua was saying to them then the begging started as each of us pleaded for joshua to give up the notion that he had to die to save the rest of us before this is finished he said you will all have to deny me no we wont said peter you will deny me three times peter i not only expect this i command it if they take you when they take me then there is no one to take the good news to the people now judas my friend come here judas went to joshua who whispered in his ear then sent him back to his place at the table one of you will betray me this very night said joshua wont you judas what judas looked around at us but when he saw no one coming to his defense he bolted down the steps peter started after him but joshua caught the fisherman by the hair and yanked him back off of his feet let him go but the high priests palace isnt a furlong away said joseph of arimathea if he goes there directly joshua held his hand up for silence biff go directly to simons house and wait alone you can sneak by the palace without being seen tell maggie and the others to wait for us the rest of us will go through the city and through the ben hinnon valley so we dont have to pass the priests palace well meet you in bethany i looked at peter and andrew you wont let him turn himself in of course not i was off into the night wondering even as i ran whether joshua had changed his mind and was going to escape from bethany into the judean desert i should have known right then that id been had you think you can trust a guy then he turns around and lies to you simon answered the door and let me in he held his finger to his lips signalling me to be quiet maggie and martha are in the back theyre angry with you all of you now theyll be angry with me for letting you in sorry i said he shrugged what can they do its my house i went directly through the front room into a second room that opened off to bedchambers the mikveh and the courtyard where food was prepared i heard voices coming from one of the bedchambers when i walked in maggie looked up from braiding marthas hair so youve come to tell me that its done she said tears welled up in her eyes and i felt as if i would break down with her if she started sobbing now no i said he and the others are on their way here through ben hinnon so it will be a few hours but i have a plan i pulled the yingyang amulet that joy had given me out of my tunic and waved it before them your plan is to bribe joshua with ugly jewelry asked martha i pointed to the tiny stoppers on either side of the amulet no my plan is to poison him i explained how the poison worked to mary and martha and then we waited counting the time in our imaginations watching in our minds eyes as the apostles made their way through jerusalem out the essene gate into the steep valley of ben hinnon where thousands of tombs had been carved into the rock and where once a river had run but now was only sage and cypress and thistles clinging to the crevices in the limestone after several hours we went outside to wait in the street then when the moon started down and the night made way into early morning we saw a single figure coming from the west not the south as we had expected as he got closer i could tell from heavy shoulders and the moon shining on his bald pate that it was john they took him he said at gethsemane annas and caiphais came themselves with temple guards and they took him maggie ran into my arms and buried her face in my chest i reached out and pulled martha close as well what was he doing at gethsemane i said you were supposed to be coming here through ben hinnon he only told you that that bastard lied to me so they arrested everyone no the others are hiding not far from here peter tried to fight the guards but joshua stopped him joshua negotiated with the priests to let us go joseph came too he helped talk them into letting the rest of us go joseph joseph betrayed him i dont know said john judas was the one that led them to gethsemane he pointed joshua out to the guards joseph came later when they were about to arrest the rest of us where did they take him to the palace of the high priest thats all i know biff i promise he sat down hard in the middle of the street and began to weep martha went to him and cradled his head to her breast maggie looked up at me he knew you would fight thats why he sent you here the plan doesnt change i said we just have to get him back so we can poison him john looked up from marthas embrace did you change sides when i wasnt here wednesday at first light maggie and i were pounding on josephs door a servant let us in when joseph came out from his bedchamber i had to hold maggie back to keep her from attacking him you betrayed him i did not said joseph john said you were with the priests i said i was i followed them up to keep them from killing joshua for trying to escape or in selfdefense right there at gethsemane what do you mean in selfdefense they want him dead maggie joseph said they want him dead but they dont have the authority to execute him dont you understand that if i hadnt been there they could have murdered him and said that hed attacked them first the romans are the only ones who have the authority to have someone killed herod had john the baptist killed i said there were no romans involved in that jakan and his thugs stone people all of the time maggie said without roman approval think you two this is passover week the city is crawling with romans watching for rebellious jews the entire sixth legion is here plus all of pilates personal guard from caesarea normally thered only be a handful the high priests the sanhedrin the pharisee council even herod will think twice before they do anything outside the letter of roman law dont panic there hasnt even been a trial in the sanhedrin yet when will there be a trial this afternoon probably they have to bring everyone in the prosecution is gathering witnesses against joshua what about witnesses for him i asked thats not how it works said joseph ill speak for him and so will my friend nicodemus but other than that joshua will have to defend himself swell maggie said who is prosecuting him i thought youd know joseph said cringing slightly the one who started the sanhedrin plots against joshua the other two times jakan bar iban maggie whirled around and glared at me you should have killed him me you had seventeen years to push the guy down the steps or something theres still time she said that wont help joshua now said joseph just hope that the romans wont hear his case you sound as if hes already convicted i said ill do my best joseph didnt sound very confident get us in to see him and let them arrest the two of you i dont think so you stay here you can have the upper rooms to yourselves ill come back or send word as soon as anything happens joseph hugged maggie and kissed her on the top of the head then left the room to get dressed do you trust him maggie said he warned joshua before when they wanted to kill him i dont trust him maggie and i waited all day in the upper room jumping to our feet every time we heard footsteps going by in the street until we were exhausted and shaking from worry i asked one of josephs servant girls to go down to the palace of the high priest to see what was going on she returned a short time later to report that the trial was still going on maggie and i made a nest of the cushions under the wide arched window in the front so we could hear the slightest noise coming from the street but as night started to fall the footsteps became fewer and farther between the distant singing from the temple faded and we settled into each others arms a single lump of low agonizing grief sometime after dark we made love together for the first time since the night before joshua and i left for the orient all those years had passed and yet it seemed familiar that first time so long ago making love was a desperate way to share the grief we felt because we were each about to lose someone we loved this time we were losing the same person this time we slept afterward joseph of arimathea didnt come home thursday it was simon and andrew who stormed up the steps to wake us thursday morning i threw my tunic over maggie and jumped to my feet in just a loincloth as soon as i saw simon i felt the heat rise in my face you treacherous bastard i was too angry to hit him i just stood there screaming at him you coward it wasnt him screamed andrew in my ear it wasnt me said simon i tried to fight the guards when they came to get joshua peter and i both did judas was your friend you and your zealot bullshit he was your friend too andrew pushed me away enough it wasnt simon i saw him face two guards with spears leave him be we dont have time for your tantrum biff joshua is being flogged at the high priests palace wheres joseph maggie said shed dressed while i had been railing at simon hes gone on to the praetorium that pilate set up at the antonia palace by the temple what the hells he doing there if joshua is being beaten at the palace in this end of the city thats where theyll take joshua next he was convicted of blasphemy biff they want a death sentence pontius pilate is the ruling authority in judea joseph knows him hes going to ask for joshuas release what do we do what do we do i was starting to get hysterical since i could remember my friendship with joshua had been my anchor my reason for being my life now it he was running toward destruction like a stormdriven ship to a reef and i couldnt think of a thing to do but panic what do we do what do we do i panted the breath refusing to fill my lungs maggie grabbed me by the shoulders and shook me you have a plan remember she tugged on the amulet around my neck right right i said taking a deep breath right the plan i grabbed my tunic and slipped it over my head maggie helped me wrap the sash im sorry simon i said he forgave me with the wave of a hand what do we do if theyre taking joshua to the praetorium thats where we go if pilate releases him then well need to get him out of there theres no telling what josh will do to get them to kill him we were waiting along with a huge crowd outside the antonia palace when the temple guards brought joshua to the front gates the high priest caiaphas wearing his blue robes and with a jewelencrusted chest piece led the procession his father annas who had been the high priest previously followed right behind a column of guards surrounded joshua in the middle of the procession we could just see him amid the guards and i could tell that someone had put a fresh tunic on him but there were stripes of blood soaking through the back he looked as if he was in a trance there was a great deal of posturing and shouting between the temple guards and from somewhere in the procession jakan came forward and started arguing with the soldiers as well it was obvious that the romans were not going to let the temple guards enter the praetorium so the transfer of the prisoner was going to take place there at the gate or not at all i was measuring whether i could sneak through the crowd snap jakans neck and sneak back out without jeopardizing our plan when i felt a hand on my shoulder i looked around to see joseph of arimathea at least it wasnt a roman scourge they lashed him with he took thirtynine lashes but it was just leather not the leadtipped whip that the romans use that would have killed him where were you what took so long the prosecution took forever jakan went on half the night taking testimony from witnesses who had obviously never even heard of joshua let alone seen any crime what about the defense asked maggie well i put forth a defense of good deeds but it was so overwhelmed by the accusations that it was lost in the noise joshua didnt say a word in his own defense they asked him if he was the son of god and he said yes that confirmed the blasphemy charge its all they needed really what happens now did you talk to pilate i did and joseph rubbed the bridge of his nose as if fighting a headache he said hed see what he could do we watched as the roman soldiers took joshua inside and the priests followed the pharisees commoners in the eyes of the romans were left outside a legionnaire almost caught jakans face in the gate when he slammed it i caught movement out of the corner of my eye and i looked up to a high wide balcony that was visible above the palace walls it had obviously been designed by herod the greats architects as a platform from which the king could address the masses in the temple without compromising his safety a tall roman in a lush red robe was standing on the balcony looking down on the crowd and not looking particularly happy with their presence is that pilate i asked joseph pointing to the roman joseph nodded hell go downstairs to hold joshuas trial but i wasnt interested at that point in where pilate was going what interested me was the centurion who stood behind him wearing the fullcrested helmet and breastplate of a legion commander not a half hour later the gate was opened and a squad of roman soldiers brought joshua out of the palace in bonds a lowerrank centurion pulled joshua along by a rope around his wrists the priests followed along behind and were mobbed with questions by the pharisees who had been waiting outside go find out whats going on i said to joseph we waded into the middle of the procession that followed most were screaming at joshua and trying to spit on him i spotted a few people in the crowd that i knew to be joshuas followers but they were going along silently their eyes darting around as if any second they might be the next one arrested simon andrew and i followed behind at some distance while maggie fought the crowd to get close to joshua i saw her throw herself at her exhusband jakan who was trailing the priests but she was stopped in midleap by joseph of arimathea who caught her by the hair and pulled her back someone else was helping restrain her but he wore a shawl over his head so i couldnt tell who it was probably peter joseph dragged maggie back to us and handed her over to me and simon shell get herself killed maggie looked up at me a wildness in her eyes that i couldnt read either anger or madness i wrapped my arms around her and held her so her arms were pinned to her sides as we walked along the man with the hood walked along beside me his hand on maggies shoulder steadying her when he looked at me i could see it was peter the wiry fisherman seemed to have aged twenty years since id seen him tuesday night theyre taking him to antipas peter said as soon as pilate heard joshua was from galilee he said it wasnt his jurisdiction and sent him to herod maggie i said into her ear please stop being a madwoman my plan just went to hell and i could use some critical thinking once again we waited outside of one of the palaces built by herod the great but this time because it was a jewish king in residence the pharisees were let in and joseph of arimathea went in with them a few minutes later he was back outside again hes trying to get joshua to perform a miracle joseph said hell let him go if joshua performs a miracle for him and if joshua wont do it he wont said maggie if he wont do it joseph said were back where we started it will be up to pilate to order the sanhedrins death sentence carried out or to release joshua maggie come with me i said tugging at her dress as i backed away why where the plans back on i ran back to the praetorium with maggie in tow i pulled up by a pillar across from the antonia palace maggie can peter really heal really yes i told you wounds broken bones wounds yes i dont know about bones i hope so i said i left her there while i went to the highestranking centurion stationed outside the gates i need to see your commander i said go away jew im a friend tell him its levi from nazareth ill tell him nothing so i stepped up and took the centurions sword out of its scabbard put the point under his chin for a split second then replaced it in its scabbard he reached for the sword and suddenly it was in my hand and under his chin again before he could call out the sword was back in its scabbard there i said you owe me your life twice by the time you call to have me arrested ill have your sword again and youll not only be embarrassed but your head will be all wobbly from your throat being cut or you can take me to see my friend gaius justus gallicus commander of the sixth legion then i took a deep breath and waited the centurions eyes darted to the soldiers closest to him then back to me think centurion i said if you arrest me where will i end up anyway the logic of it seemed to strike him through his frustration come with me he said i signaled to maggie to wait and followed the soldier into pilates fortress justus seemed uncomfortable in the lush quarters they had assigned him at the palace hed had shields and spears placed around the room in different places as if he needed to remind anyone who entered that a soldier lived here i stood in the doorway while he paced looking up at me occasionally as if he wanted to kill me he wiped the sweat from his closely cropped gray hair and whipped it so it drew a stripe across the stone floor i cant stop the sentence no matter what i want i just dont want him hurt i said if pilate crucifies him hell be hurt biff thats sort of the point damaged i mean no broken bones no cut sinew have them tie his arms to the cross they have to use nails justus said his mouth shaping into a cruel frown nails are iron theyre inventoried each one is accounted for you romans are masters of supply what do you want okay tie him then only nail through the web of his fingers and toes and put a board on the cross so he can support his weight with his feet thats no kindness youre doing him he could linger a week that way no he wont i said im going to give him poison and i want his body as soon as hes dead at the word poison justus had stopped pacing and looked up at me with open resentment its not up to me to release the body but if you want to make sure the body is unharmed ill have to keep soldiers there until the end sometimes your people like to help the crucified die more quickly by throwing stones i dont know why they bother yes you do justus you of all people do you can spit that roman bitterness toward mercy all you want but you know you were the one who sent for joshua when your friend was suffering you humbled yourself and asked for mercy thats all im doing now the resentment drained from his face and was replaced by amazement youre going to bring him back arent you i just want to bury my friends body intact youre going to bring him back from the dead like the soldier at sepphoris the one the sicarii killed thats why you need his body undamaged something like that i nodded looking at the floor to avoid the old soldiers eyes justus nodded obviously shaken pilate has to authorize the body to be taken down crucifixion is supposed to stand as an example to others i have a friend who can get the body released joshua could still be set free you know he wont be i said he doesnt want to be justus turned from me then ill give the orders kill him quickly then take the body and get it out of my jurisdiction even quicker thank you justus dont embarrass any more of my officers or your friend will be asking for two bodies when i came out of the fortress maggie ran into my arms its horrible they put a crown of thorns on his head and the crowd spit on him the soldiers beat him the crowd milled around us where is he now the crowd roared and people began pointing up to the balcony pilate stood there next to joshua who was being held by two soldiers joshua stared straight ahead still looking as if he were in a trance blood was running into his eyes pilate raised his arms and the crowd went quiet i have no complaint with this man yet your priests say that he has committed blasphemy this is no crime under roman law said pilate what would you have me do with him crucify him screamed someone next to me i looked over to see jakan waving a fist the other pharisees began chanting crucify him crucify him and soon the whole crowd seemed to join in among the crowd i saw the few of joshuas followers that were left begin to slink away before the anger was turned on them pilate made a gesture as if he was washing his hands and walked inside friday eleven apostles maggie joshuas mother and his brother james gathered at the upper room of joseph of arimatheas house the merchant had been to see pilate and the governor agreed to release joshuas body in honor of the passover joseph explained the romans arent stupid they know our women prepare the dead so we cant send the apostles to get him the soldiers will give the body to maggie and mary james since youre his brother theyll allow you to come along to help carry him the rest of you should keep your faces covered the pharisees will be looking for joshuas followers the priests have already spent too much time on this during a feast week so theyll all be at the temple ive bought a tomb near the hill where theyll crucify him peter you will wait there what if i cant heal him peter said ive never even tried to raise the dead he wont be dead i said he just wont be able to move i couldnt find the ingredients i needed to make a potion to kill the pain so hell look dead but hell feel everything i know what its like i was in that state for weeks once peter youll have to heal the wounds from the lash and the nails but they shouldnt be mortal ill give him the antidote as soon as hes out of sight of the romans maggie as soon as they give him to you close his eyes if theyre open or theyll dry out i cant watch it maggie said i cant watch them nail him to that tree you dont have to wait at the tomb ill send someone to get you when its time can this work andrew said can you bring him back biff im not bringing him back from anything he wont be dead hell just be hurt wed better go said joseph looking out the window at the sky theyll bring him out at noon a crowd had gathered outside of the praetorium but most were merely curious only a few of the pharisees among them jakan had actually come out to see joshua executed i stayed back almost a halfblock away watching the other disciples were spread out wearing shawls or turbans that covered their faces peter had sent bartholomew to sit with maggie and mary at the tomb no shawl could disguise his bulk or his stench three heavy crossbeams leaned against the wall outside the palace gates waiting for their victims at noon joshua was brought out along with two thieves who had also been sentenced to death and the beams were placed upon their shoulders joshua was bleeding from a dozen places on his head and face and although he still wore the purple robe that herod had placed on him i could see that blood from the flogging had run down and left streaks on his legs he still looked like he was in some sort of trance but there was no question that he was feeling the pain of his wounds the crowd closed in on him shouting insults and spitting on him but i noticed that when he stumbled someone always lifted him to his feet his followers were still scattered among the crowd they were just afraid to show themselves from time to time i looked around the periphery of the mob and caught the eye of one of the apostles always there was a tear there and always a mix of anguish and anger it took everything i had not to rush in among the soldiers take one of their swords and start hacking afraid of my own temper i fell back from the crowd until i came alongside of simon i cant do it either i said i cant watch them put him on the cross you have to the zealot said no you be there simon let him see your face let him know youre there ill come up once the cross is set i had never been able to look at someone who was being crucified even when i didnt know them i knew i wouldnt be able to stomach watching them do it to my best friend id lose control attack someone and then wed both be lost simon was a soldier a secret soldier but a soldier still he could do it the horrible scene at the temple of kali ran through my head simon tell him i said mindful breath tell him that there is no cold what cold hell know what it means if he remembers hell be able to shut out the pain he learned to do that in the east ill tell him i wouldnt be able to tell him myself not without giving myself away i watched from the walls of the city as they led joshua to the road that ran by the hill called golgotha a thousand yards outside the gennath gate i turned away but even from a thousand yards i could hear him screaming as they drove the nails justus had assigned four soldiers to watch joshua die after a half hour they were alone except for perhaps a dozen onlookers and the families of the two thieves who were praying and singing dirges at the feet of the condemned jakan and the other pharisees had only stayed to see joshua hoisted upright and the cross set then they went off to feast with their families a game i said tossing a pair of dice in the air as i approached the soldiers just a simple game i had borrowed a tunic and an expensive sash from joseph of arimathea hed also given me his purse which i held up and jingled in front of the soldiers a game legionnaire one of the romans laughed and where would we get money to gamble with well play for those clothes behind you that purple robe at the foot of the cross the roman lifted the robe with a spear point then looked up at joshua whose eyes went wide when he saw me sure it looks like well be here a while lets have a game first i had to lose enough money to give the romans something to gamble with then i had to win it back slowly enough to keep me there long enough to accomplish my mission i silently thanked joy for teaching me how to cheat at dice i handed the dice to the soldier nearest me who was perhaps fifty years old built short and powerfully but covered with scar tissue and gnarled limbs evidence of broken bones mishealed he looked too old to be soldiering this far from rome and too beaten down to make the journey home the other soldiers were younger in their twenties i guessed all with dark olive skin and dark eyes all lean fit and hungrylooking two of the younger soldiers carried the standard roman infantry spear a wooden shaft with a narrow iron spike as long as a mans forearm tipped with a compact threebladed point designed to be driven through armor the other two carried the waspwaisted iberian short sword that id seen on justus belt so many times he must have had them imported for his legion to fit his own preference most romans used a straightbladed short sword i handed the dice to the old soldier and dumped some coins out in the dirt as the roman threw the dice against the bottom of joshuas cross i scanned the hills and saw the apostles watching from behind trees and over rocks i gave a signal and it passed from one to the other and finally to a woman who waited back on one of the city walls oh my the gods have turned against me today i said rolling a losing combination i thought you jews only had one god i was talking about your gods legionnaire im losing the soldiers laughed and i heard a moan from above us i cringed and felt as if my ribs would cave in on themselves from the pain in my heart i ventured a glance at joshua and he was looking right at me you dont have to do this he said in sanskrit what nonsense is the jew talking now asked the old soldier i couldnt say soldier he must be delirious i saw two women approaching the foot of the cross on joshuas left carrying a large bowl a jar of water and a long stick hey there get away from them just here to give a drink of water to the condemned sir no harm meant the woman took a sponge from the bowl and squeezed it out it was susanna maggies friend from galilee along with johanna theyd come down for the passover to cheer joshua into the city now wed conscripted them to help poison him the soldiers watched as the women dipped the sponge then attached it to the end of the stick and held it for the thief to drink from i had to look away faith biff joshua said again in sanskrit there you shut up and die barked one of the younger romans i twitched and squinted at the dice in lieu of crushing the soldiers windpipe give me a seven baby needs new sandals said another young roman i couldnt look at joshua and i couldnt look to see what the women were doing the plan was that they would go to the two thieves first so as not to raise suspicion but now i was regretting the decision to delay finally susanna brought the bowl to where we were gambling and set it down while johanna poured some water over the sponge got any wine there for a thirsty soldier said one of the young soldiers he smacked johanna on the bottom or some other relief the old soldier caught the young soldiers arm and pushed him away youll be up on that stick with this wretch marcus these jews take touching their women seriously justus wont tolerate it susanna pulled her shawl around her face she was pretty lean with small facial features except for her wide brown eyes she was too old not to be married but i suspected that she had left a husband to follow joshua it was the same story with johanna except that her husband had followed along for a while then divorced her when she wouldnt come home with him she was more sturdily built and she rolled like a wagon when she walked she took the sponge and held it out to me drink sir here the timing was critical anyone want a sip of water i asked before taking the sponge i was palming the yingyang amulet as i said it drink after a jewish dog not likely said the old soldier im getting the impression that my jewish money might sully your roman purse i said maybe i should go no your moneys good enough said a young soldier punching my shoulder in good spirits i was tempted to relieve him of his teeth i took the sponge and feigned taking a drink when i raised the sponge to squeeze the water into my mouth i dumped the poison over it instantly i handed it back to johanna so as not to poison myself without dipping it back in the water she affixed the sponge to the stick and raised it up to joshuas face his head rolled and his tongue rolled out of the side of his mouth against the moisture drink johanna said but joshua didnt seem to hear her she pushed the sponge harder against his mouth and it dripped on one of the romans drink move away from there marcus said the old soldier when he goes hell lose his fluids all over you you dont want to sit too close the old roman laughed raucously drink it joshua said susanna finally joshua opened his eyes and pushed his face into the sponge i held my breath as i heard him sucking the moisture out of it enough said the young soldier he knocked the stick out of susannas hands the sponge went flying off into the dirt hell be dead soon not soon enough though with that block to stand on said the old soldier then time began to pass more slowly than i could ever remember when joy had poisoned me it had taken only seconds before i was paralyzed then when id used the poison on the man in india hed dropped almost immediately i tried to pretend to pay attention to the game but i was looking for some sign that the poison was working the women moved away and watched from a distance but i heard one of them gasp and when i looked up joshuas head had lolled over drool ran out of his open mouth how do you know when hes dead i asked like this the young soldier named marcus prodded joshua in the thigh with his spear joshua moaned and opened his eyes and i felt my stomach sink i could hear sobbing from johanna and susanna i threw the dice and waited an hour passed and still joshua moaned i could hear him praying softly from time to time over the laughter of the soldiers another hour i had begun to shake every sound from the cross was like a hot iron driven in my spine i couldnt bring myself to look up at him the disciples moved closer less concerned now about staying hidden but the romans were too intent on their game to notice unfortunately i was not intent enough thats it for you said the old soldier unless you want to gamble for your own cloak now your purse is empty is this bastard ever going to die said one of the young soldiers he just needs help said the young soldier named marcus who had stood and was leaning on his spear before i could even get to my feet he thrust the spear upward into joshuas side the point went up under his ribs and his heart blood pulsed down the iron in three great gushes then ran out in a trickle marcus yanked the spear out the entire hillside echoed with screaming some of it my own i stood transfixed shaking watching the blood run out of joshuas side hands latched onto my arms and i was dragged back away from the cross the romans started to pick up their things to head back to the praetorium loony said the old soldier looking at me joshua looked at me one last time then closed his eyes and died come away biff a womans voice said in my ear come away they turned me around and started marching me toward the city i could feel a chill running over me as the wind came up and the sky started to darken under a sudden storm there was still screaming going on and on and when johanna clamped her hand over my mouth i realized it was me who had been screaming i blinked tears out of my eyes again and again trying to at least see where they were leading me but as soon as my sight would clear another sob would rock my body and the water would rise again they were leading me to the gennath gate that much i could tell and there was a dark figure standing on the wall above the gate watching us i blinked and caught a single second of clarity as i saw who it was judas i screamed until my voice shattered i shook off the women and ran through the gate swung myself up on top of one of the huge doors and leapt to the wall judas ran south along the wall looking from side to side for a place to jump off there was no thought to what i was doing nothing but grief gone to anger love gone to hatred i followed judas across the roofs of jerusalem tossing aside anyone who got in my way shattering pottery crashing down rooftop chicken cages pulling down lines of hanging clothes when he came to a roof that led no further judas jumped two stories to the ground and came up limping as he ran down the street toward the essene gate at ben hinnon i came off the roof full stride and landed without losing a step although i heard something tear in my ankle i couldnt feel it there was a line of people trying to get into the city at the essene gate probably seeking shelter from the impending storm lightning crackled across the sky and raindrops as big as frogs began to plop onto the streets leaving craters in the dust and painting the city with a thin coat of mud judas fought through the crowd as if he were swimming in pitch pulling people past him on either side moving a step forward only to be carried back a step i saw a ladder leaning against the city wall and ran up it there were roman soldiers stationed here on the wall and i brushed by them ducking spears and swords as i made my way to the gate then over it then to the wall on the other side i could see judas below me hed broken out of the crowd and was making his way along a ridge that ran parallel to the wall it was too far to jump so i followed him from above until i came to the corner of the battlement where the wall sloped down to accommodate the thickness required to hold the corner i slid down the wet limestone on my feet and hands and hit the ground ten paces behind the zealot he didnt know i was there the rain came down now in sheets and the thunder was so frequent and loud that i could hear nothing myself but the roaring anger in my head judas came to a cypress tree that jutted over a high cliff with hundreds of tombs gouged into it the path passed between a wall of tombs and the cypress tree past the tree was a fiftyyard drop judas pulled a purse from his belt pulled a small stone out of the opening to one of the tombs then shoved the purse inside i caught him by the back of the neck and he shrieked go ahead put the stone back i said he tried to wheel on me and hit me with the stone i took it from him and fitted it back into the tomb then kicked his feet out from under him and dragged him to the edge of the cliff i clamped onto his windpipe and holding the cypress tree with my free hand i leaned him out over the cliff dont struggle i shouted youll only free yourself to the fall i couldnt let him live judas said you cant have someone like him alive i pulled the zealot back up on the cliff and whipped the sash from around his tunic he knew he had to die judas said how do you think i knew hed be at gethsemane not at simons he told me you didnt have to give him up i screamed i wrapped the sash around his neck then pulled it tight over the crook of a cypress branch dont dont do this i had to do it someone did he would have just reminded us of what well never be yep i said i shoved him backward over the cliff and caught the end of the sash as it tightened around the branch the sash twanged when it took his weight and his neck snapped with the sound of a knuckle cracking i let go of the sash and judas body fell into the darkness the boom of thunder concealed the sound of impact the anger ran out of me then leaving me feeling as if my very bones were losing their structure i looked forward straight over the ben hinnon valley into a sheet of lightningbleached rain im sorry i said and i stepped off the cliff i felt a bolt of pain and then nothing thats all i remember epilogue the angel took the book from him then went out the door and across the hall where he knocked on the door hes finished the angel said to someone in the room what youre leaving i can just go asked levi who was called biff the door across the hall opened and there stood another angel this one seeming to have more a female aspect than raziel she too held a book she stepped into the hall to reveal a woman standing behind her wearing jeans and a green cotton blouse her hair was long and straight dark with reddish highlights and her eyes were crystal blue and seemed to glow in contrast to her dark skin maggie said levi hi biff maggie finished her gospel weeks ago said raziel really the magdalene smiled well i didnt have as much to write as you did i didnt see you guys for sixteen years oh right it is the will of the son that you two go out together into this new world said the female angel levi went across the hall and took her in his arms they kissed for a long time until the angels began to clear their throats and murmur get a room under their breaths they held each other at arms length levi said maggie is this going to be like it always was you know youre with me and you love me and everything but its only because you cant have josh of course thats so pathetic you dont want to be together no i want to its just pathetic i have money she said they gave me money thats good go said raziel losing his patience go go go go away he pointed down the hallway they started walking down the hallway arm in arm tentatively looking back at the angels every few steps until at last they looked back and the angels were gone you should have stuck around the magdalene said i couldnt it hurt too much he came back i know i read about it he was sad because of what you had done yeah so was i the others were angry with you they said that you had the greatest reason to believe that why they edited me out of their gospels good guess she said they stepped into the elevator and the magdalene pushed the button for the lobby by the way it was hallowed she said what was hallowed the h his middle name it was hallowed its a family name remember our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name damn i would have guessed harvey biff said afterword teaching yoga to an elephant and there are also many other things which jesus did the which if they should be written every one i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written amen john can you really teach yoga to an elephant well no you cant but were talking about jesus here nobody knows what he could do the book youve just read is a story i made it up it is not designed to change anyones beliefs or worldview unless after reading it youve decided to be kinder to your fellow humans which is okay or you decide you really would like to try to teach yoga to an elephant in which case please get videotape i researched lamb i really did but there is no doubt i could have spent decades researching and still managed to be inaccurate its a talent what can i say while ive made some attempt to paint an accurate picture of the world in which christ lived i changed things for my own convenience and sometimes obviously there was no way of knowing what conditions really existed in the years through the available written history about the peasant class society and the practice of judaism in the first century in galilee degenerates quickly into theory the role of the pharisees in peasant society the hellenistic influence the influence of an international city like joppa nearby who knows how these things would have affected christ as a boy some historians postulate that yeshua of nazareth would have been little more than an ignorant hillbilly while others say that because of the proximity of sepphoris and joppa he could have been exposed to greek and roman culture from an early age i chose the latter because it makes for a more interesting story the historical life of jesus beyond a couple of references by josephus the jewish historian of the first century and the odd mention by roman historians is again mostly speculation what we can know today of the life of jesus of nazareth is included in the four slim gospels found in the new testament matthew mark luke and john for those readers who know the gospels bear with me you know that matthew and luke are the only two to mention christs birth while mark and john cover only the ministry part of jesus life the wise men are mentioned only in one short passage in matthew and the shepherds are mentioned only in luke the slaughter of the innocents and the fleeing into egypt are mentioned only in matthew in short jesus infancy is a jumble but the chronicle of his childhood is worse of the time from jesus birth to when he began his ministry in his thirties the bible gives us only one scene luke tells us of jesus teaching in the temple in jerusalem at age twelve other than that we have a thirtyyear hole in the life of the most influential human being to ever walk the face of the earth with lamb in my own goofy way i attempted to fill that hole in history but again i am not trying to present history as it might really have been im simply telling stories some of the historical elements of lamb are uncomfortable to work the modern mind around the precocious sexuality comes to mind that maggie would have been betrothed by twelve and married by thirteen is almost certain from what we know of jewish society in the first century as are the facts that a jewish boy of the time would have been learning his trade by age ten would be betrothed at thirteen and would be married by fourteen trying to create empathy for the adult roles of those whom we today would consider children was of no small concern to me when i was writing that section of the book but it may be the one section where the sexuality of the characters is not historically out of place the average peasant in galilee would have been lucky to live to the age of forty so perhaps the children by necessity reached sexual maturity earlier than they would under less harsh conditions although there are im sure many historical inaccuracies and improbabilities in this book the most blatant that i have knowingly indulged is in the section where biff and joshua visit gaspar in the mountains of china while gautama buddha did indeed live and teach some five hundred years before the birth of christ and while his teachings were widespread in india by the time our heroes could have made it to the east buddhism didnt make it into china for almost five hundred years after christs death the martial arts would not be developed by buddhist monks until after that but to remain historically accurate i would have had to leave out an important question that i felt needed to be addressed which is what if jesus had known kung fu the life of gaspar as described in lamb the nine years in the cave etc is drawn from the legends of the life of the buddhist patriarch bodhidharma the man who is said to have taken buddhism to china around ad bodhidharma or daruma is credited with the school of buddhism that we know today as zen buddhist legend does not mention bodhidharma encountering a yeti but they do have him cutting his eyelids off to avoid falling asleep and having them sprout into tea plants which later monks would brew to keep awake during meditation which i left out so i traded that story in on an abominable snowman and biffs theory of natural selection seemed fair bodhidharma is also said to have invented and taught kung fu to the famous shao lin monks to condition them for the rigorous regimen of meditation he prescribed most of the details of the festival of kali including the sacrifices and mutilations come from joseph campbells oriental mythology from his masks of god series campbell cites eyewitness accounts of the bloody ritual from nineteenthcentury british soldiers and states that even today over eight hundred goats are beheaded for the festival of kali in calcutta anyone who had trouble with this passage please write to campbell in his current incarnation the cited verses from the upanishads and bhagavad gita are actual translations of those revered writings the verses from the kama sutra are completely from my imagination but youll find weirder stuff in the actual book theologically i made certain assumptions about who jesus was mainly that he was who the gospels say he was while i used the gospels heavily for reference and there are a couple of references to the acts of the apostles specifically the giving of the gift of tongues without which biff could not have told the story in modern american idiom i tried not to draw on the rest of the new testament specifically the letters of paul peter james and john as well as revelations all written years after the crucifixion as were the gospels these missives eventually went on to define christianity but no matter what you may think of them you have to agree that jesus would not have been aware of them or the events in them or certainly the consequences of their teaching so they had no place in this story joshua and biff as jewish boys would however have been familiar with the books of the old testament the first five of which made up the base of their faith the torah and the rest which were referred to by people of the time as prophets and writings so i referred to these when i felt it was appropriate as i understand it however the talmud and most of the midrash illustrative stories explaining the law of god had not yet been formulated and agreed upon so they were not used as a reference for lamb from the gnostic gospels a set of manuscripts found at nag hammadi egypt in but which actually may have been written earlier than the canonized gospels ive drawn only slightly on the gospel of thomas a book of christs sayings because it fit well with the buddhist point of view many of the sayings in the gospel of thomas are also found in mark the other gnostic gospels were either too fragmentary or frankly just plain creepy the infancy gospel of thomas describes jesus at age six using his supernatural powers to murder a group of children because they tease him sort of carrie goes to nazareth even i had to pass lamb is peppered throughout with biblical references both real and madeup ie biff quotes liberally from nonexistent books of the bible such as dalmatians excretions and amphibians my editor and i discussed the merit of footnoting these references and decided that footnotes would detract from the flow of the story the problem arises however that if the reader knows the bible well enough to recognize the real references theres a good chance that he or she has decided not to read this book our final decisionwell my final decision my editor wasnt really consulted on this because he might have said nowas to advise those who are not familiar with the bible to find someone who is sit them down read them the passages in question then say that one real how bout that one if you dont know someone who is familiar with the bible just wait someone will come to your door eventually keep extra copies of lamb on hand so they can take one with them another problem with telling a story that has been told so many times is that people are looking for elements with which they are familiar although ive glossed over many events that are chronicled in the gospels there are numerous elements which many people think are there which simply are not one is that mary magdalene was a prostitute shes always portrayed that way in movies but it doesnt ever say that she is in the bible she is mentioned by name eleven times in the synoptic gospels matthew luke mark most references to her talk about her preparation for the burial of jesus and then being the first witness of his resurrection it also says that jesus cured her of evil spirits no whore references period there are marys without surnames all over the gospels and some of them i suspect may refer to the magdalene specifically the mary who soon before his death anoints jesus feet with expensive ointment and wipes them with her hair certainly one of the most tender moments in the gospels and the primary basis for my rendering of maggies character we know from letters that many of the leaders of the early church were women but in firstcentury israel a woman who struck out on her own without a husband was not only considered uppity but was very likely referred to as a harlot as was a woman who was divorced that could be where the myth originated another gospel misassumption is that the three wise men were kings or in fact that there were even three of them we make that assumption because there are three gifts given to the christ child their names are never mentioned the names balthasar gaspar and melchior come to us from christian tradition written hundreds of years after the time of christ we assume that joseph of nazareth jesus stepfather dies before the crucifixion yet it is never stated in the gospels he just may not have been involved we make assumptions based on what we have been fed over the years at christmas pageants and passion plays but often although inspired by faith that material is little more than what you have just read the product of someones imagination the gospels do not agree on the order of the events that happen during the ministry from jesus baptism by john to the crucifixion so i arranged events from all the gospels in what seemed a logical chronological order while adding those elements that allow biffs participation in the story there are of course elements of the gospels which i left out in the interest of brevity but you can always find them in the gospels if you want my sending joshua and biff to the east was motivated purely by story not by basis in the gospel or historical evidence while there are indeed astounding similarities between the teachings of jesus and those of buddha not to mention those of laotzu confucius and the hindu religion all which seem to have included some version of the golden rule its more likely that these stem from what i believe to be logical and moral conclusions that any person in search of what is right would come to eg that the preferable way to treat one another is with love and kindness that pursuit of material gain is ultimately empty when measured against eternity and that somehow as human beings we are all connected spiritually while historians and theologians dont completely rule out the possibility that christ may have traveled to the east they seem to agree that he could have formulated the teachings we find in the gospels with no more influence than the rabbinical teachings in galilee and judea but what fun would that have been finally this story was set in a dire time a deadly serious time and the world of the firstcentury jew under the rule of the romans would not have been one that easily inspired mirth its more than a small anachronism that i portray joshua having and making fun yet somehow i like to think that while he carried out his sacred mission jesus of nazareth might have enjoyed a sense of irony and the company of a wisecracking buddy this story is not and never was meant to challenge anyones faith however if ones faith can be shaken by stories in a humorous novel one may have a bit more praying to
