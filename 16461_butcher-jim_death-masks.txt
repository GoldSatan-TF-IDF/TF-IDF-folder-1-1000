jim butcher death masks dresden files chapter one some things just arent meant to go together things like oil and water orange juice and toothpaste wizards and television spotlights glared into my eyes the heat of them threatened to make me sweat streaks through the pancake makeup some harried stagehand had slapped on me a few minutes before lights on top of cameras started winking on the talkshow theme song began to play and the studio audience began to chant lahree lahree lahree larry fowler a short man in an immaculate suit appeared from the doors at the rear of the studio and began walking to the stage flashing his porcelain smile and shaking the hands of a dozen people seated at the ends of their rows as he passed them the audience whistled and cheered as he did the noise made me flinch in my seat up on the stage and i felt a trickle of sweat slide down over my ribs beneath my white dress shirt and my jacket i briefly considered running away screaming it isnt like i have stage fright or anything see because i dont it was just really hot up there i licked my lips and checked all the fire exits just to be safe no telling when you might need to make a speedy exit the lights and noise made it a little difficult to keep up my concentration and i felt the spell id woven around me wobble i closed my eyes for a second until i had stabilized it again in the chair beside me sat a dumpy balding man in his late forties dressed in a suit that looked a lot better than mine mortimer lindquist waited calmly a polite smile on his face but muttered out of the corner of his mouth you okay ive been in house fires i liked better than this you asked for this meeting not me mortimer said he frowned as fowler lingered over shaking a young womans hand showboat think this will take long i asked morty he glanced beside him at an empty chair and at another beside me two mystery guests i guess this one could go for a while they shoot extra material and edit it down to the best parts i sighed id been on the larry fowler show just after id gone into business as an investigator and it had been a mistake id had to fight my way uphill against the tide of infamy id received from association with the show what did you find out i asked mort flicked a nervous glance at me and said not much come on mort he opened his mouth to answer then glanced up as larry fowler trotted up the stairs and onto the stage not now wait for a commercial break larry fowler pranced up to us and pumped my hand then morts with equally exaggerated enthusiasm welcome to the show he said into a handheld microphone then turned to face the nearest camera our topic for today is witchcraft and wizardryphony or fabulous with us in order to share their views are local medium and psychic counselor mortimer lindquist the crowd applauded politely and beside him harry dresden chicagos only professional wizard there was a round of snickering laughter to go with the applause this time i couldnt say i was shocked people dont believe in the supernatural these days supernatural things are scary its much more comfortable to rest secure in the knowledge that no one can reach out with magic and quietly kill you that vampires exist only in movies and that demons are mere psychological dysfunctions completely inaccurate but much more comfortable despite the relative levels of denial my face heated up i hate it when people laugh at me an old quiet hurt mixed in with my nervousness and i struggled to maintain the suppression spell yeah i said spell see i really am a wizard i do magic ive run into vampires and demons and a lot of things in between and ive got the scars to show for it the problem was that technology doesnt seem to enjoy coexisting with magic when im around computers crash lightbulbs burn out and car alarms start screaming in warbling drunken voices for no good reason id worked out a spell to suppress the magic i carried with me at least temporarily so that i might at least have a chance to keep from blowing out the studio lights and cameras or setting off the fire alarms it was delicate stuff by its very nature and extremely difficult for me to hold in place so far so good but i saw the nearest cameraman wince and jerk his headset away from his ear whining feedback sounded tinnily from the headset i closed my eyes and reined in my discomfort and embarrassment focusing on the spell the feedback died away well then larry said after half a minute of happy talk morty youve been a guest on the show several times now would you care to tell us a little bit about what you do mortimer widened his eyes and whispered i see dead people the audience laughed but seriously mostly i conduct seances larry mortimer said i do what i can to help those who have lost a loved one or who need to contact them in the beyond in order to resolve issues left undone back here on earth i also offer a predictions service in order to help clients make decisions on upcoming issues and to try to warn them against possible danger really larry said could you give us a demonstration mortimer closed his eyes and rested the fingertips of his right hand on the spot between his eyes then in a hollow voice he said the spirits tell me that two more guests will soon arrive the audience laughed and mortimer nodded at them with an easy grin he knew how to play a crowd larry gave mortimer a tolerant smile and why are you here today larry i just want to try to raise public awareness about the realm of the psychic and paranormal nearly eighty percent of a recent survey of american adults stated that they believed in the existence of the spirits of the dead in ghosts i just want to help people understand that they do exist and that there are other people out there who have had strange and inexplicable encounters with them thank you morty and harrymay i call you harry sure its your nickel i responded larrys smile got a shade brittle can you tell us a little bit about what you do im a wizard i said i find lost articles investigate paranormal occurrences and train people who find themselves struggling with a sudden development of their own abilities isnt it true that you also consult for the special investigations department at chicago pd occasionally i said i wanted to avoid talking about si if i could the last thing cpd would want was to be advertised on the larry fowler show many police departments across the country employ such consultants when all other leads have failed and why are you here today because im broke and your producer is paying double my standard fee the crowd laughed again more warmly larry fowlers eyes flashed with an impatient look behind his glasses and his smile turned into a gnashing of teeth no really harry why for the same reasons as mortuh as morty here i answered which was true id come here to meet mort and get some information from him hed come here to meet me because he refused to be seen near me on the street i guess you could say i dont have the safest reputation in the world and you claim to be able to do magic larry said yeah could you show us larry prompted i could larry but i dont think its practical larry nodded and gave the audience a wise look and why is that because it would probably wreck your studio equipment of course larry said he winked at the audience well we wouldnt want that would we there was more laughter and a few catcalls from the crowd passages from carrie and firestarter sprang to mind but i restrained myself and maintained the suppression spell master of selfdiscipline thats me but i gave the fire door beside the stage another longing look larry carried on the talk part of the talk show discussing crystals and esp and tarot cards mort did most of the talking i chimed in with monosyllables from time to time after several minutes of this larry said well be right back after these announcements stagehands help up signs that read applause and cameras panned and zoomed over the audience as they whistled and hooted larry gave me an annoyed look and strode offstage in the wings he started tearing into a makeup girl about his hair i leaned over to mort and said okay what did you find out the dumpy ectomancer shook his head nothing concrete im still getting back into the swing of things in contacting the dead even so youve got more contacts in this area than i do i said my sources dont keep close track of who has or hasnt died lately so ill take whatever i can get is she at least alive he nodded shes alive that much i know shes in peru peru it came as a vast relief to hear that she wasnt dead but what the hell was susan doing in peru thats red court territory some mort agreed though most of them are in brazil and the yucatan i tried to find out exactly where she was but i was blocked by who mort shrugged no way for me to tell im sorry i shook my head no its okay thanks mort i settled back in my seat mulling over the news susan rodriguez was a reporter for a regional yellow paper called the midwestern arcane shed grown interested in me just after i opened up my practice hounding me relentlessly to find out more about all the things that go bump in the night wed gotten involved and on our first date she wound up lying naked on the ground in a thunderstorm while lightning cooked a toadlike demon to gooey bits after that she parlayed a couple of encounters with things from my cases into a widespread syndicated column a couple of years later she wound up following me into a nest of vampires holding a big todo despite all my warnings to the contrary a noble of the red court of vampires had grabbed her and begun the transformation from mortal to vampire on her it was payback for something id done the vampire noble in question thought that her standing in the red court made her untouchable that i wouldnt want to start trouble with the entire court she told me that if i fought to take susan back i would be starting a worldwide war between the white council of wizards and the vampires red court which i did the vampires hadnt forgiven me for taking susan back from them probably because a bunch of them including one of their nobility had been incinerated in the process thats why mort didnt want to be seen with me he wasnt involved in the war and he intended to keep it that way in any case susan hadnt gone all the way through her transformation but the vamps had given her their blood thirst and if she ever gave in to it shed become one of the red court i asked her to marry me promising her that id find a way to restore her humanity she turned me down and left town trying to sort things out on her own i guess i still kept trying to find a way to remove her affliction but id received only a card and a postcard or three from her since shed left two weeks ago her editor had called to say that the columns she usually sent in for the arcane were late and asked if i knew how to get in touch with her i hadnt but i started looking i got zip and went to mort lindquist to see if his contacts in the spirit world would pay off better than mine i hadnt gotten much but at least she was alive muscles in my back unclenched a little i looked up to see larry come back onstage to his theme music speakers squealed and squelched when he started to talk and i realized id let my control slip again the suppression spell was a hell of a lot harder than i thought it would be and getting harder by the minute i tried to focus and the speakers quieted to the occasional fitful pop welcome back to the show larry told a camera today we are speaking with practitioners of the paranormal who are here to share their views with the studio audience and our viewers at home in order to explore these issues further i have asked a couple of experts with opposing viewpoints to join us today and here they are the audience applauded as a pair of men emerged from either side of the stage the first man sat down in the chair by morty he was a little over average height and thin his skin burned into tanned leather by the sun he might have been anywhere between forty and sixty his hair was greying and neatly cut and he wore a black suit with a white clerical collar sharing space with a rosary and crucifix at his throat he smiled and nodded to mort and me and shook hands with larry larry said allow me to introduce father vincent who has come all the way from the vatican to be with us today he is a leading scholar and researcher within the catholic church on the subject of witchcraft and magic both historically and from a psychological perspective father welcome to the show vincents voice was a little rough but he spoke english with the kind of cultured accent that seemed to indicate an expensive education thank you larry im very pleased to be here i looked from father vincent to the second man who had settled in the chair beside me just as larry said and from the university of brazil at rio de janeiro please welcome dr paolo ortega worldrenowned researcher and debunker of the supernatural larry started saying something else but i didnt hear him i just stared at the man beside me as recognition dawned he was of average height and slightly heavy build with broad shoulders and a deep chest he was darkcomplected his black hair neatly brushed his greyandsilver suit stylish and tasteful and he was a duke of the red courtan ancient and deadly vampire smiling at me from less than an arms length away my heart rate went from sixty to a hundred and fifty million fear sending silver lightning racing down my limbs emotions have power they fuel a lot of my magic the fear hit me and the pressure on the suppression spell redoubled there was a flash of light and a puff of smoke from the nearest camera and the operator staggered back from it tearing off his headphones with one of the curses they have to edit out of daytime tv smoke began to rise steadily from the camera along with the smell of burning rubber and the studio monitors shrieked with feedback well ortega said under his breath nice to see you again mister dresden i swallowed and fumbled at my pocket where i had a couple of wizard gadgets i used for selfdefense ortega put his hand on my arm it didnt look as if he was exerting himself but his fingers closed on my wrist like manacles hard enough to send flashes of pain up through my elbow and shoulder i looked around but everyone was staring at the malfunctioning camera relax ortega said his accent thick and vaguely latinate im not going to kill you on television wizard im here to talk to you get off me i said my voice was thin shaky goddamned stage fright he released me and i jerked my arm away the crew rolled the smoking camera back and a director type with a set of headphones made a rolling motion with the fingers of one hand larry nodded to him and turned to ortega sorry about that well edit that part out later its no trouble ortega assured him jerry paused for a moment and then said dr ortega welcome to the show you have a reputation as one of the premier analysts of paranormal phenomena in the world you have proven that a wide variety of socalled supernatural occurrences were actually clever hoaxes can you tell us a little about that certainly i have investigated these events for a number of years and i have yet to find one that cannot be adequately explained alleged alien crop circles proved to be nothing more than a favorite pastime of a small group of british farmers for example other odd events are certainly unusual but by no means supernatural even here in chicago you had a rain of toads in one of your local parks witnessed by dozens if not hundreds of people and it turned out later that a freak windstorm had scooped them up from elsewhere and deposited them here larry nodded his expression serious then you dont believe in these events ortega gave larry a patronizing smile i would love to believe that such things are true larry there is little enough magic in the world but i am afraid that even though we each have a part of us that wishes to believe in wondrous beings and fantastic powers the fact of the matter is that it is simple primitive superstition then in your opinion practitioners of the supernatural frauds ortega said with certainty with no offense meant to your guests of course all of these socalled mediums presuming they arent selfdeluded are simply skilled actors who have acquired a fundamental grasp of human psychology and know how to exploit it they are easily able to deceive the gullible into believing that they can contact the dead or read thoughts or that they are in fact supernatural beings why with a few minutes effort and the right setting i am certain that i could convince anyone in this room that i was a vampire myself people laughed again i scowled at ortega frustration growing once more putting more pressure on the suppression spell the air around me started to feel warmer a second cameraman yelped and jerked off his squealing earphones while his camera started spinning about slowly on its stand winding power cables around the steel frame it rested on the on air lights went out larry stepped to the edge of the stage yelling at the poor cameraman the apologeticlooking director appeared from the wings and larry turned his attention to him the man bore the scolding with a kind of oxenlike patience and then examined the camera he muttered something into his headset and he and the shaken cameraman began to wheel the dead camera away larry folded his arms impatiently then turned to the guests and said im sorry give us a couple of minutes to get a spare camera in it wont take long no problem larry ortega assured him we can just chat for a moment larry peered at me are you all right mister dresden he asked you look a little pale could you use a drink or something i know i could ortega said his eyes on me ill have someone bring them out larry said and strode offstage toward his hairstylist mort had engaged father vincent in quiet conversation his back very firmly turned toward me i turned back to ortega warily my back stiff and fought down the anger and fear usually being scared out of my mind is kind of useful magic comes from emotions and terror is handy fuel but this wasnt the place to start calling up gales of wind or flashes of fire there were too many people around and it would be too easy to get someone hurt even killed besides which ortega was right this wasnt the place to fight if he was here he wanted to talk otherwise he would have simply jumped me in the parking garage okay i said finally what do you want to say he leaned a little closer so that he wouldnt have to raise his voice i cringed inwardly but i didnt flinch away ive come to chicago to kill you mister dresden but i have a proposal for you that i want you to hear first you really need to work on your opening technique i said i read a book about negotiations i could loan it to you he gave me a humorless smile the war dresden the war between your people and mine is too costly for both of us wars a pretty stupid option to take generally speaking i said i never wanted it but you began it ortega said you began it over a point of principle i began it over a human life and how many more would you save by ending it now ortega asked not merely wizards suffer from this our attention to the war leaves us less able to control the wilder elements of our own court we frown upon reckless killings but wounded or leaderless members of our courts often kill when they do not truly need to ending the war now would save hundreds perhaps thousands of lives so would killing every vampire on the planet whats your point ortega smiled showing teeth just regular teeth no long canines or anything the vampires of the red court look humanright up until they turn into something out of a nightmare the point dresden is that the war is unprofitable undesirable you are the symbolic cause of it to my people and the point of contention between us and your own white council once you are slain the council will accept peace overtures as will the court so youre asking me to lay down and die thats not much of an offer you really need to read that book im making you an offer face me in single combat dresden i didnt quite laugh at him why the hell should i do that his eyes were expressionless because if you do it would mean that the warriors i have brought to town with me will not be forced to target your friends and allies that the mortal assassins we have retained will not need to receive their final confirmations to kill a number of clients who have hired you in the past five years im sure i need not mention names fear and anger had been about to settle down but they came surging back again theres no reason for that i said if your war is with me keep it with me gladly ortega said i do not approve of such tactics face me under the dueling laws in the accords and after i kill you what i said i didnt know if i could kill him but there was no reason to let him think i wasnt confident about it the next hotshot red duke does the same thing defeat me and the court has agreed that this city will become neutral territory that those living in it including yourself and your friends and associates will be free of the threat of attack so long as they are in it i stared hard at him for a moment chicagoblanca eh he quirked a puzzled eyebrow at me never mind after your time i looked away from him and licked sweat from my upper lip a stagehand came by with a couple of bottled waters and passed them to ortega and to me i took a drink the pressure of the spell made flickering colored dots float across my vision youre stupid to fight me i said even if you kill me my death curse would fall on you he shrugged i am not as important as the whole of the court i will take that risk hells bells dedicated honorable courageous selfsacrificial loonies are absolutely the worst people in the world to go up against i tried one last dodge hoping it might pay off id have to have it in writing the council gets a copy too i want this all recognized official under the accords that done you will agree to the duel i took a deep breath the last thing i wanted to do was square off against another supernatural nasty vampires scared me they were strong and way too fast and had an enormous yuck factor their saliva was an addictive narcotic and id been exposed to it enough to make me twitch once in a while wondering what it would be like to get another hit i barely went outside after dark these days specifically because i didnt want to encounter any more vampires a duel would mean a fair fight and i hate fair fights in the words of a murderous faerie queen theyre too easy to lose of course if i didnt agree to ortegas offer id be fighting him anyway probably at a time and place of his choosingand i had the feeling that ortega wasnt going to show the arrogance and overconfidence id seen in other vampires something about him said that so long as i wasnt breathing he wouldnt care much how it happened not only that but i believed that he would start in on the people i cared about if he couldnt have me i mean come on it was cliche villainy at its worst and an undeniably effective lever id like to say that i carefully weighed all the factors reasoned my way to a levelheaded conclusion and made a rational decision to take a calculated risk but i didnt the truth is i thought of ortega and company doing harm to some of the people i cared about and suddenly felt angry enough to start in on him right there i faced him eyes narrowed and didnt bother to hold the anger in check the suppression spell began to crack and i didnt bother to keep it going the spell shattered and the buildup of wild energy rushed silently and invisibly over the studio there was a cough of static from the speakers on the stage before they died with loud pops the floodlights overhead suddenly burst with flashes of brilliance and clouds of sparks that fell down over everyone on the stage one of the two surviving cameras exploded into fire bluish flames rising up from out of the casing and heavy power outlets along the walls started spitting orange and green sparks larry fowler yelped and leapt up into the air batting at his belt before pitching a smoldering cell phone to the floor the lights died and people started screaming in startled panic ortega lit only by the falling sparks looked grim and somehow eager shadows dancing over his features his eyes huge and dark fine i said get it to me in writing and youve got a deal the emergency lights came up fire alarms started whooping and people started stumbling toward exits ortega smiled all teeth and glided off the stage vanishing into the wings i stood up shaking a little a piece of something had apparently fallen and hit morts head there was a small gash on his scalp already brimming with blood and he wobbled precariously when he tried to stand i helped him up and so did father vincent on the other side of him we lugged the little ectomancer toward the fire doors we got mort down some stairs and outside the building chicago pd was on the scene already blue and white lights flashing fire crews and an ambulance or three were just then rolling up on the street we settled mort down among a row of people with minor injuries and stood back we were both panting a little as the emergency medtechs started triage on the wounded actually mister dresden father vincent said i must confess something to you heh i said dont think i missed the irony on that one padre vincents leathery mouth creased into a strained smile i did not really come to chicago merely to appear on the show no i said no i really came here to to talk to me i interjected he lifted his eyebrows how did you know i sighed and got my car keys out of my pocket its just been that kind of day chapter two i started walking for my car and beckoned father vincent to follow he did and i walked fast enough to make him work to keep up with me you must understand he said that i must insist upon strict confidentiality if i am to divulge details of my problem to you i frowned at him and said you think im a crackpot at best or a charlatan at worst so why would you want me to take your case not that i would turn him down i wanted to take his case well more accurately i wanted to take his money i wasnt in the bad fiscal shape of the year before but that meant only that i had to fend the creditors off with a baseball bat rather than a cattle prod i am told you are the best investigator in the city for it father vincent said i arched an eyebrow at him youve got something supernatural going on he rolled his eyes no naturally not i am not naive mister dresden but i am told that you know more about the occult community than any private investigator in the city oh i said that i thought about it for a minute and figured it was probably true the occult community he had in mind was the usual new age crystalgazing tarotturning palmreading crowd you see in any large city most of them were harmless and many had at least a little ability at magic add in a dash of fengshui artists season liberally with wiccans of a variety of flavors and sincerities blend in a few modestly gifted practitioners who liked mixing religion with their magic some followers of voodoo a few santerians and a sprinkling of satanists all garnished with a crowd of young people who liked to wear a lot of black and you get what most folks think of as the occult community of course hiding in there you found the occasional sorcerer necromancer monster or demon the real players the nasty ones regarded that crowd the same way a tenyearold would a gingerbread amusement park my mental earlywarning system set off an imaginary klaxon who referred you to me padre oh a local priest vincent said he took a small notebook from his pocket opened it and read father forthill of saint mary of the angels i blinked father forthill didnt see eyetoeye with me on the whole religion thing but he was a decent guy a little stuffy maybe but i liked himand i owed him for favors past you should have said that in the first place youll take the case father vincent asked as we headed into the parking garage i want to hear the details first but if forthill thinks i can help i will i added hastily my standard fees apply naturally father vincent said he toyed with the crucifix at his throat may i assume that you will spare me the magician rigmarole wizard i said theres a difference magicians do stage magic wizards do real magic he sighed i dont need an entertainer mister dresden just an investigator and i dont need you to believe me padre just to pay me well get along fine he gave me an uncertain look and said ah we reached my car a battered old volkswagen bug named the blue beetle it has what some people would call character and what i would call lots of mismatched replacement parts the original car may have been blue but now it had pieces of green white and red vws grafted onto it in place of the originals as they got damaged in one way or another the hood had to be held down with a piece of hanger wire to keep it from flipping up when the car jounced and the front bumper was still smashed out of shape from last summers attempt at vehicular monsterslaughter maybe if vincents job paid well id be able to get it fixed father vincent blinked at the beetle and asked what happened i hit trees you drove your car into a tree no trees plural and then a dumpster i glanced at him selfconsciously and added they were little trees his uncertain look deepened to actual worry ah i unlocked my door not that i was worried about anyone stealing my car i once had a car thief offer to get me something better for a sweetheart rate i guess you want to give me the details somewhere a little more private father vincent nodded yes of course if you could take me to my hotel i have some photographs and i heard the scuff of shoes on concrete in time for me to catch the gunman in my peripheral vision as he rose from between a pair of parked cars one row over dim lights gleamed on the gun and i threw myself across the hood of the beetle away from him i crashed into father vincent who let out a squeak of startled surprise and the pair of us tumbled to the ground as the man started shooting the gun didnt split the air with thunder when it fired typically guns do that theyre a hell of a lot louder than anything most folks run into on a daytoday basis this gun didnt roar or bark or even bang it made a kind of loud noise maybe as loud as someone slamming an unabridged dictionary down on a table the gunman was using a silencer one shot hit my car and caromed off the curve of the hood another went by my head as i struggled with father vincent and a third shattered the safety glass of a ritzy sports car parked beside me whats happening father vincent stammered shut up i snarled the gunman was moving his feet scuffing on the concrete as he skirted around my car i reached around the beetles headlight and fumbled at the wire holding the hood down while the man came closer it gave way and the hood wobbled up as i reached into the storage compartment i looked up in time to see a man medium height and build mid thirties dark pants and jacket lift a smallcaliber pistol its end heavy with a manufactured silencer he fired but he hadnt taken time to aim at me he wasnt twenty feet away but he missed i drew the shotgun out of the cars trunk and flicked off the safety as i chambered a round the gunmans eyes widened and he turned to run he shot at me again on the way shattering one of the beetles headlights and he kept shooting toward me as he skittered back the way he came i jerked back behind the car and kept my head down trying to count his shots he got to eleven or twelve and the gun went silent i stood up the shotgun already at my shoulder and sighted down the barrel the gunman ducked behind a concrete column and kept running dammit i hissed get in the car but father vincent stammered get in the car i shouted i got up twisted the hanger wire on the hood back into place and got in vincent got in the passenger side and i shoved the shotgun at him hold this he fumbled with it his eyes wide as i brought the beetle to life with a roar well not really a roar a volkswagen bug doesnt roar but it sort of growled and i mashed it into gear before the priest had managed to completely shut the door i headed for the parking garages exit whipping around the ramps and turns what are you doing father vincent demanded hes an outfit hitter i spat theyll have the exit covered we screeched around the final corner and toward the parking garages exit i heard someone yelling in a breathless voice and a couple of large and unfriendlylooking men in a car parked across the street were just getting out one of them held a shotgun and the other had a heavyduty semiautomatic maybe a desert eagle i didnt recognize the thug with the shotgun but thug number three was an enormous man with reddish hair no neck and a cheap suitcujo hendricks right hand enforcer to the crime lord of chicago gentleman johnny marcone i had to bounce the beetle up onto the sidewalk at the parkinggarage exit to get around the security bar and i mowed down some landscaped bushes on the way i jounced over the curb and into the street hauling the wheel to the right and mashed the accelerator to the floor i glanced back and saw the original gunman standing at a fireexit door pointing the silenced pistol at us he snapped off several more shots though i only heard the last few as the silencer started to give out he didnt have a prayer of a clean shot but he got lucky and my back window shattered inward i gulped and took the first corner against the light nearly colliding with a uhaul moving truck and kept accelerating away a couple of blocks later my heart slowed down enough that i could think i slowed the car down to something approaching the speed limit thanked my lucky stars the suppression spell had fallen apart in the studio and not in the car and rolled down my window i stuck my head out for a second to see if hendricks and his goons were following us but i didnt see anyone coming along behind us and took it on faith i pulled my head in and found the barrel of the shotgun pointed at my chin while father vincent his face pale muttered to himself under his breath in italian hey i said and pushed the guns barrel away careful with that thing you wanna kill me i reached down and flicked the safety on put it down a patrolman sees that and were in trouble father vincent gulped and tried to lower the gun below the level of the dash this weapon is illegal illegal is such a strong word i muttered oh my father vincent said with a gulp those men he said they tried to kill you thats what hitters for the outfit do i agreed how do you know who they are first guy had a silenced weapon a good silencer metal and glass not a cheapo plastic bottle i checked out the window again he was using a smallcaliber weapon too and he was trying to get real close before he started shooting why does that matter it looked clear my hands trembled and felt a little weak because it means he was using light ammunition subsonic if the bullet breaks the sound barrier it sort of defeats the point of a silenced weapon when he saw i was armed he ran covered himself doing it and went for help hes a pro oh my father vincent said again he looked a little pale plus i recognized one of the men waiting at the exit someone was at the exit father vincent said yeah some of marcones rentathugs i glanced back at the shattered window and sighed dammit so where are we going father vincent gave me directions in a numb voice and i concentrated on driving trying to ignore the quivering in my stomach and the continued trembling of my hands getting shot at is not something i handle very well hendricks why the hell was marcone sending goons after me marcone was the lord of the mean streets of second city but generally he didnt like to use that kind of violence he thought it was bad for business i had believed marcone and i had an understandingor at least an agreement to stay out of each others way so why would he make a move like this maybe i had already stepped over a line somewhere that i didnt know existed i glanced at the shaken father vincent he hadnt told me yet what he wanted but whatever it was it was important enough to covertly drag one of the vaticans staff all the way to chicago maybe it was important enough to kill a nosy wizard over too hoo boy it was turning into one hell of a day chapter three father vincent directed me to a motel a little ways north of ohare it was a national chain cheap but clean with rows of doors facing the parking lot i drove around to the back of the motel away from the street frowning it didnt look like the kind of place someone like vincent would stay in the priest left my car almost before id set the parking break hurried to the nearest door and ducked inside as quickly as he could open the lock i followed him vincent shut the door behind us locked it and then fiddled with the blinds until they closed he nodded at the rooms little table and said please sit down i did and stretched out my legs father vincent pulled open a drawer on the plain dresser and drew out a file folder held closed with a wide rubber band he sat down across from me took off the rubber band and said the church is interested in recovering some stolen property i shrugged and said sounds like a job for the police an investigation is under way and i am giving your police department my full cooperation but how to phrase this politely he frowned history is an able teacher you dont trust the police i said gotcha he grimaced it is only that there have been a number of associations between chicago police and various underworld figures in the past thats mostly movies now padre you may not have heard but the whole al capone thing has been over for a while perhaps he said perhaps not i simply seek to do everything within my power to recover the stolen article that includes involving an independent and discreet investigator aha so he didnt trust the police and wanted me to work for him on the sly thats why we were meeting at a cheap motel rather than wherever he was really staying what do you want me to find for you a relic he said a what an artifact mister dresden an antique possessed by the church for several centuries oh that i said yes the article is fragile and of great age and we believe that it is not being adequately preserved it is imperative that we recover it as quickly as possible what happened to it it was stolen three days ago from the cathedral of saint john the baptist in northern italy long ways off we believe that the artifact was brought here to chicago to be sold why he took an eightbyten glossy black and white from the folder and passed it to me it featured a fairly messy corpse lying on cobblestones blood had run into the spaces between the stones as well as pooling a little on the ground around the body i think it had been a man but it was hard to tell for certain whoever it was had been slashed to almost literal ribbons across the face and necksharp neat straight cuts professional knife work yuck this man is gaston larouche he is the ringleader of a group of organized thieves who call themselves the churchmice they specialize in robbing sanctuaries and cathedrals he was found dead the morning after the robbery near a small airfield his briefcase contained several falsified pieces of american identification and plane tickets that would carry him here but no whatsit ah exactly father vincent removed another pair of photos these were also blackandwhite but they looked rougher as if they had been magnified several times both were of women of average height and build dark hair dark sunglasses surveillance photos i asked he nodded interpol anna valmont and francisca garcia we believe they helped larouche with the theft then murdered him and left the country interpol received a tip that valmont had been seen at the airport here do you know who the buyer is vincent shook his head no but this is the case i want you to find the remaining churchmice and recover the artifact i frowned looking at the photos yeah thats what they want you to do too vincent blinked at me what do you mean i shook my head impatiently someone look at this photo larouche wasnt murdered there vincent frowned why would you say that not enough blood ive seen men who were torn up and bled out theres a hell of a lot more blood i paused and then said pardon my french father vincent crossed himself why would his body be found there i shrugged a professional did him look at the cuts theyre methodical he was probably unconscious or drugged because you cant hold a man still very easily when youre taking a knife to his face father vincent pressed one hand to his stomach oh so youve got a corpse found out in the middle of a street somewhere basically wearing a sign around his neck that says the goods are in chicago either someone was incredibly stupid or someone was trying to lead you here its a professional killing someone meant his corpse to be a clue but who would do such a thing i shrugged probably a good thing to find out do you have any better pictures of these two women he shook his head no and theyve never been arrested no criminal record theyre good at what they do then i took the photos there were little dossiers paperclipped to the back of the pictures listing known aliases locations but nothing terribly useful this one isnt going to be quick worthwhile goals rarely are what do you need from me mister dresden a retainer i said a thousand will do and i need a description of this artifact the more detailed the better father vincent gave me a matteroffact nod and drew a plain steel money clip from his pocket he counted off ten portraits of ben franklin and passed them to me the artifact is an oblong length of linen cloth fourteen feet three inches long by three feet seven inches wide made of a handwoven threetoone herringbone twill there are a number of patches and stains on the cloth and i held up my hand frowning wait a minute where did you say this thing was stolen from the cathedral of saint john the baptist father vincent said in northern italy i said he nodded in turin to be exact i said he nodded again his expression reserved someone stole the freaking shroud of turin i demanded yes i settled back into the chair looking down at the photos again this changed things this changed things a lot the shroud supposedly the burial cloth used by joseph of aramithea to wrap the body of christ after the crucifixion capital cs the cloth supposedly wrapped around christ when he was resurrected with his image his blood imprinted upon it wow i said what do you know about the shroud mister dresden not much christs burial cloth they did a bunch of tests in the seventies and no one was able to conclusively disprove it it almost got burned a few years back when the cathedral caught fire there are stories that it has healing powers or that a couple of angels still attend it a bunch of others i cant remember right now father vincent rested his hands on the table and leaned toward me mister dresden the shroud is perhaps the single most vital artifact of the church it is a powerful symbol of the faith and one in which many people believe it is also politically significant it is absolutely vital to rome that it be restored to the churchs custody as expediently as possible i stared at him for a second and tried to pick out my words carefully are you going to be insulted if i suggest that its very possible that the shroud is uh significant magically speaking vincent pressed his lips together i have no illusions about it mister dresden it is a piece of cloth not a magic carpet its value derives solely from its historical and symbolic significance uh huh i said hells bells thats where plenty of magical power came from the shroud was old and regarded as special and people believed in it that could be enough to give it a kind of power all by itself some people might believe otherwise i said of course he agreed that is why your knowledge of the local occult may prove invaluable i nodded thinking this could be something completely mundane someone could have stolen a moldy old piece of cloth to sell it to a crackpot who believed it was a magic bedsheet it could be that the shroud was nothing more than a symbol an antique a historical poptartnifty but ultimately not very significant of course there was also the possibility that the shroud was genuine that it actually had been in contact with the son of god when he had been brought back from the dead i pushed that thought aside regardless of why or how if the shroud was something special magically speaking then it could mean a whole newand nastierball game of all the various weird dark or wicked powers who might abscond with the shroud i couldnt think of any who would do anything cheerful with it all sorts of supernatural interests might be at play even discounting that possibility mortal pursuit of the shroud seemed to be deadly enough john marcone might already be involved as well as the chicago policeprobably interpol and the fbi too even sans supernatural powers when it came to finding people the cops were damned good at what they did odds were good that theyd locate the thieves and haul in the shroud within a few days i looked from the photos to the cash and thought about how many of my bills i could pay off with a nice fat fee courtesy of father vincent if i got lucky maybe i wouldnt have to put myself in harms way to do it sure i believed that i put the money in my pocket then i picked up the photos too how can i get in touch with you father vincent wrote a phone number on the motels stationary and passed it to me here its my answering service while im in town all right i cant promise you anything concrete but ill see what i can do father vincent stood up and said thank you mister dresden father forthill spoke most highly of you you know hes a sport i agreed rising if you will excuse me i have appointments to keep ill bet heres my card if you need to get in touch i gave him a business card shook hands and left at the beetle i stopped to open the trunk and put the shotgun back in it after taking the shell from the chamber and making sure the safety was on then i pulled out a length of wood a little longer than my forearm carved over with runes and sigils that helped me focus my magic a lot more precisely i tossed my suit jacket in over the gun and dug out a silver bracelet dangling a dozen tiny medievalstyle shields from my pocket i fastened that to my left arm slipped a silver ring onto my right hand then took my blasting rod and set it beside me on the car seat as i got in between the new case the outfit hitter and duke ortegas challenge i wanted to make damn sure that i wasnt going to get caught with my eldritch britches down again i took the beetle home to my apartment i rent the basement apartment of a huge creaking old boardinghouse by the time i got back it was after midnight and the latefebruary air was speckled with occasional flakes of wet snow that wouldnt last once they hit the ground the adrenaline rush of the larry fowler show and then the hiredgoon attack had faded and left me aching tired and worried i got out of the car determined to head for bed then get up early and start to work on vincents case a sudden sensation of cold rippling energy and a pair of muffled thumps from the stairs leading down to my apartment changed my mind i drew out my blasting rod and readied the shield bracelet on my left wrist but before i could step over to the stairs a pair of figures flew up them and landed heavily on the halffrozen ground beside the gravel parking lot they struggled rolling until one of the shadowy figures got a leg underneath the form on top of it and pushed the second figure flew twenty feet through the air landed on the gravel with a thump and a cough of expelled air then got up and sprinted away shield readied i stepped forward before the remaining intruder could rise i forced an effort of will through the blasting rod setting the runes along its length alight with scarlet fire coalesced at the tip of the rod bright as a road flare but i held the strike as i stepped forward shoving the tip of the blasting rod down at the intruder make a move and ill fry you red light fell over a woman she was dressed in jeans a black leather jacket a white tshirt and gloves she had her long midnight hair tied back in a tail dark oblique eyes smoldered up at me from beneath long lashes her beautiful face held an expression of wary amusement my heart thudded in sudden pain and excitement well susan said looking from the sizzling blasting rod up to my face ive heard of running into an old flame but this is ridiculous chapter four susan my brain locked up for a good ten seconds as i stared down at my former lover i could smell the scent of her hair the subtle perfume she wore mixing with the newleather scent of her jacket and another new smellnew soap maybe her dark eyes regarded me uncertain and nervous she had a small cut on the side of her mouth beading with drops of blood that looked black in the red light of the blasting rods fire harry susan said her voice quiet and steady harry youre scaring me i shook myself out of my surprise and lowered the blasting rod stepping over to her stars and stones susan are you all right i offered her my hand and she took it rising easily to her feet her fingers were feverishly warm and wisps of winter steam curled from her skin bruises she said ill be fine who was that susan glanced the way her attacker had run and shook her head red court i couldnt see his face i blinked at her you ran off a vampire by yourself she flashed me a smile that mixed weariness with a sense of pleasure she still hadnt taken her hand from mine ive been working out i looked around a bit more and tried to reach out with my senses to detect any trace of the unsettling energy that hovered around the reds nothing gone now i reported but we shouldnt hang around out here inside then i started to agree and then paused a horrible suspicion hit me i let go of her hand and took a step back a line appeared between her eyebrows harry its been a rough year i said i want to talk but im not inviting you in susans expression flickered with comprehension and pain she folded her arms over her stomach and nodded no i understand and youre right to be careful i took another step back and started walking toward my reinforcedsteel door she walked a few feet away and at my side where i could see her i went down the stairs and unlocked the door then i pushed out an effort of will to temporarily disable the protective spells laid over my house that amounted to the magical equivalent of a land mine and burglar alarm all in one i went in glanced at the candleholder on the wall by the door and muttered flickum bicus i felt a tiny surge of energy flowing out of me and the candle danced to life lighting my apartment in dim soft orange my place is basically a cave with two chambers the larger one was my living area bookshelves lined most of the walls and where they didnt i had hung a couple of tapestries and an original star wars movie poster id scattered rugs all over my floor i had laid down everything from handmade navajo rugs to a black area rug with elviss face fully two feet across dominating the piece like the beetle i figured some people would call my ragtag assembly of floor coverings eclectic i just thought of them as something to walk on besides freezingcold stone floor my furniture is much the same i got most of it secondhand none of it matches but its all comfortable to sprawl on and my lights are dim enough to let me ignore it a small alcove held a sink an icebox and a pantry for food a fireplace rested against one wall the wood all burned down to black and grey but i knew it would still be glowing under the ash a door led to my tiny bedroom and the apartments threequarters bath the whole place may have been ragged but it was very tidy and clean i turned to face susan and didnt put down my blasting rod supernatural creatures cannot lightly step across the threshold of a home unless one of the rightful residents invites them in plenty of nasties can put on a false face and it wasnt inconceivable that one of them had decided to try to get close to me by pretending to be susan a supernatural being would have a hell of a time getting over a threshold without being invited in if that was some kind of shapeshifter rather than susan or god help me if susan had gone all the way over to the vampires she wouldnt be able to enter if it was the real susan shed be fine or at least the threshold wouldnt hurt her getting paranoid suspicion from her exboyfriend might do its own kind of damage on the other hand there was a war on and susan probably wouldnt be happy to hear id gotten myself killed better safe than exsanguinated susan didnt pause at the door she stepped inside turned around to close and lock it and asked good enough it was relief coupled with a sudden explosion of naked emotion roared through me it was like waking up after days of anguish to find that the pain was gone where there had been only hurt there was suddenly nothing and other feelings rushed in to fill the sudden void excitement for one that quivering teenage nervousness that accompanies expectation a surge of warm emotion joy and happiness rolled together with a chittering glee and in the shadows of those a few things darker but no less vibrant sheer sensual pleasure in the scent of her in looking at her face her dark hair again i needed to feel her skin under my hands to feel her pressed to me it was more than mere needit was hunger now that she was standing there in front of me i needed her all of her as much as i needed food or water or air and possibly more i wanted to tell her to let her know what it meant to me that she was there but id never been very good at expressing myself verbally by the time susan turned around again i was already pressed up against her she let out a quiet gasp of surprise but i leaned gently into her pressing her shoulders to the door i lowered my mouth to hers and her lips were soft sweet feverhot she went rigid for a second then let out a low sound and wound her arms around my neck and shoulders kissing me back i could feel her the slender toowarm strength and softness of her body my hunger deepened and so did the kiss my tongue touching hers lightly teasing she responded as ardently as i did her lips almost desperate low whimpers vibrating through her mouth and into mine i started to feel a little dizzy and disoriented and though some part of me warned against it i only pressed harder against her i slid one hand over her hip beneath the jacket and slipped up under the tshirt she wore to curl around the naked sweetness of her waist i pulled her hard against me and she responded her breath hot and quick lifting one leg to press against mine winding around my calf a little pulling me nearer i lowered my mouth to her throat tongue tasting her skin and she arched against me baring more of her skin i drew a line of kisses up to her ear gently biting sending quivering shock waves through her as she shook against me her throat letting out quiet sounds of deepening need i found her eager lips again and her fingers tightened in my hair drawing me hard against her my dizziness grew some kind of coherent thought did a quick flyby of my forebrain i struggled to take notice of it but the kiss made it impossible lust and need murdered my reason a sudden shrieking hiss startled me and i jerked back from susan looking wildly around mister my bobtailed battlescarred tomcat had leapt up onto the stones before the fireplace his luminous green eyes wide and fixed on susan mister weighs about thirty pounds and thirty pounds of cat can make an absolutely impossible amount of noise susan shuddered and pressed her palm against my chest turning her face away from me she pushed something gentle rather than insistent my lips burned to touch hers again but i closed my eyes and took slow shuddering breaths then i backed away from her i had meant to go stir up the firenot that fire the literal onebut the room tilted wildly and it was all i could do to stumble into an easy chair mister leapt up into my lap more daintily than he had any right to be able to do and rubbed his face against my chest rumbling out a purr i fumbled up one hand to pet him and after a couple of minutes the room stopped spinning what the hell just happened i muttered susan emerged from the shadows and crossed the candlelit room to take up the fireplace poker she stirred through the ashes until she found some glowing orangered and then began adding wood to the fire from the old iron hod beside the fireplace i could feel you she said after a minute i could feel you going under it she shivered it felt nice boy did it and i bet it would feel even nicer if all those clothes hadnt been in the way aloud all i said was under she looked over her shoulder at me her expression hard to read the venom she said quietly they call it their kiss i guess i cant blame them it sounds a lot more romantic than narcotic drool some parts of me lobbied for a cessation of meaningless chat and an immediate resumption of any line of thought that would lead to discarded clothing upon the floor i ignored them i remember when when we kissed before you left i thought id imagined it susan shook her head and sat down on the stones before the fireplace her back straight her hands folded sedately in her lap the fire began to grow catching onto the new wood and though the light of it curled around her with golden fingers it left her face veiled in shadow no what bianca did to me has changed me already in some ways physically im stronger now my senses are sharper and theres she faltered the kiss i mumbled my lips didnt find the word to their liking they liked the real thing a lot better i ignored them too yes she said not like one of them can do less but still there i mopped at my face with my hand you know what i need either a naked writhing eager susan or else a liquidnitrogen shower a beer you want one pass she said i dont think lowering my inhibitions would be healthy right now i nodded got up and went to my icebox its an actual icebox the kind that runs on honesttogoodness ice rather than freon i got out a dark brown bottle of macs homebrewed ale and opened it taking a long drink mac would be horrified that i drank his beer cold since he prided himself on an oldworld brew but i always kept a couple in there for when i wanted it cold what can i say im an unlettered barbaric american wizard i drank off maybe half of it and put the cold bottle against my forehead afterward well i said i guess you didnt come over to uh tear your clothes off and use you shamelessly susan suggested her voice sounded calm again but i could sense the underlying tone of her own hunger i wasnt sure whether i should be unsettled by it or encouraged no harry it isnt that isnt something i can afford to do with you no matter how much either of us wants it why not i asked i knew why not already but the words jumped from my brain to my mouth before i could stop them i peered suspiciously at the beer i dont want to lose control susan said not ever not with anyone but especially not with you there was a silence in which only the fire made any noise harry it would kill me to hurt you more to the point i thought it would probably kill me too think about her instead of yourself harry get a grip its just a kiss let it go i drank the rest of my beer which wasnt anywhere near as nice as other things id done with my mouth that night i checked the fridge and asked susan coke she nodded looking around her gaze hesitated on the fireplace mantel where i kept the card and three postcards id received from her along with the little grey jewelry box that held the dinky little ring shed turned down is someone else living here now no i got out a couple of cans and took one over to her she took it from me without touching my fingers why do you ask the place looks so nice she said and your clothes smell like fabric softener youve never used fabric softener in your life oh that you cant tell people about it when faeries are doing your housework or they get ticked off and leave i sort of have a cleaning service i hear youve been too busy to clean up susan said just making a living susan smiled i heard you saved the world from some kind of doom is it true i fiddled with my drink sort of susan laughed how do you sort of save the world i only saved it in a greenpeace kind of way if id blown it there might have been a historically bad storm but i dont think anyone would have noticed the real damage for thirty or forty yearsclimate change takes time sounds scary susan said i shrugged mostly i was just trying to save my own ass the world was a twofer maybe im getting cynical i suspect the only thing i accomplished was to keep the faeries from screwing up the place so that we could screw it up ourselves i sat down on the chair again and we opened the cokes and drank in silence for a bit my heart eventually stopped pounding quite so loudly i miss you i said finally so does your editor she called me a couple of weeks ago said your articles had quit coming in susan nodded thats one reason im here i owe her more than a letter or a phone call youre quitting i asked she nodded you find something else sort of she said she brushed her hair back from her face with one hand i cant tell you everything right now i frowned for as long as id known her susan had been driven by a passion for discovering the truth and sharing it with other people her work at the arcane had arisen from her stubborn refusal to deny things she saw as the truth even if they had seemed insane she was one of the rare people who stopped and thought about things even weird and supernatural things instead of dismissing them out of hand thats how shed begun work at the arcane that was how she had originally met me are you all right i asked are you in trouble relatively speaking no she said but you are thats why im here harry what do you mean i came to warn you the red court sent paolo ortega to call me out i know she sighed but you dont know what youre getting into harry ortega is one of the most dangerous nobles of their court hes a warlord hes killed half a dozen of the white councils wardens in south america since the war started and hes the one who planned and executed the attack on archangel last year i sat straight up at that the blood draining from my face how do you know about that im an investigative reporter harry i investigated i toyed with the coke can frowning down at it all the same he came here asking for a duel a fair fight if hes serious ill take him on theres more that you need to know susan said like what ortegas opinion on the war is not the popular one within the red court a few of the upper crust of the vampires support his way of thinking but most of them like the idea of a lot of constant bloodshed they also like the idea of a war to wipe out the white council they figure that if they get rid of the wizards once and for all they wont have to worry about keeping a low profile in the future whats that got to do with anything think about it susan said harry the white council is fighting this war reluctantly if they had a decent excuse theyd end it thats ortegas whole plan he fights you kills you and then the white council sues for peace theyll pay some kind of concession that doesnt involve the death of one of their members and that will be that war over i blinked how did you find out hello earth to harry i told you i investigated i frowned until the lines between my eyebrows ached right right well as plans go i guess it sounds good i said except for that middle part where i die she gave me a small smile much of the rest of the red court would rather you kept on breathing as long as youre alive they have a reason to keep the war going swell i said theyll try to interfere with any duel i just thought you should know i nodded thanks i said ill just then someone knocked firmly at my door susan stiffened and rose poker in hand i got up a lot more slowly opened a drawer in the night table beside the chair and drew out the gun i kept at home a great big old dirty harry callahan number that weighed about seventyfive thousand pounds i also took out a length of silk rope about a yard long and draped it over my neck so that i could get it off in a hurry if need be i took the gun in both hands pointed it at the floor drew back the hammer and asked the door who is it there was a moments silence and then a calm male voice asked is susan rodriguez there i glanced at susan she straightened more her eyes flashing with anger but she put the poker back in its stand beside the fireplace then she motioned to me and said put it away i know him i uncocked the revolver but i didnt put it away as susan crossed to the door and opened it the most blandlooking human being i had ever seen stood on the other side he was maybe five nine maybe one seventyfive he had hair of medium brown and eyes of the same ambiguous shade he wore jeans a mediumweight brown jacket and worn tennis shoes his face was unmemorable neither appealing nor ugly he didnt look particularly strong or craven or smart or particularly anything else what are you doing here he asked susan without preamble his voice was like the rest of himabout as exciting as a w susan said i told you i was going to talk to him you could have used the phone the man pointed out theres no point to this hi i said in a loud voice and stepped up to my door i towered over blandman and i had a great big gun in my hand even if i did keep it pointed down at the floor im harry dresden he looked me up and down and then looked at susan susan sighed harry this is martin hi martin i said i switched my sidearm to my other hand and thrust mine at him nice to meet you martin regarded my hand and then said i dont shake hands that was evidently all the verbal interaction i merited because he looked back at susan and said we have to be up early we we i looked at susan who flushed with embarrassment she glared at martin and then said to me i need to go harry i wish i could have stayed longer wait i said i wish i could she said ill try to call you before we go there was that we again go susan im sorry she stood up on tiptoe and kissed my cheek her toowarm lips soft then she left brushing past martin just hard enough to jostle him into taking a little step to keep his balance martin nodded to me and walked out too after a minute i followed them long enough to see them getting into a cab on the street outside we hells bells i muttered and stalked back inside my house i slammed the door behind me lit a candle stomped into my little bathroom and turned on the shower the water was only a couple degrees short of becoming sleet but i stripped and got in anyway simmering with several varieties of frustration we we we we which implied she and someone else together someone who was not me was she susan with the pedantic avenger there that didnt track i mean hells bells the guy was just so dull boring blasй and maybe stable face it harry interesting you might be exciting you might be stable you aint i pushed my head under the freezing water and left it there susan hadnt said they were together neither had he i mean that wouldnt be why she had broken off the kiss she had a really good reason to do that after all but then again it wasnt like we were together shed been gone for better than a year a lot can change in a year her mouth hadnt or her hands or the curve of her body or the smoldering sensuality of her eyes or the soft sounds she made as she arched against me her body begging me to i looked down at myself sighed and turned the water to its coldest setting i came out of the shower shriveled and turning blue dried off and got into bed i had just managed to get the covers warm so that i could stop shivering when my phone rang i swore sulfurously got out of bed into the freezing air snatched up the phone and growled what then on the off chance it was susan i forced some calm into my voice and said i mean hello sorry to wake you harry said karrin murphy the head of chicago pds special investigations division si routinely handled any crime that fell between the cracks of the other departments as well as being handed the really smelly cases no one else wanted as a result they wound up looking into all kinds of things that werent easily explained their job was to make sure that things were taken care of and that everything typed up neatly into the final report murphy called me in as a consultant from time to time when she had something weird that she didnt know how to handle wed been working together for a while and murphy had gotten to where she and si could handle your average everyday supernatural riffraff but from time to time she ran into something that stumped her my phone number is on her quick dial murph i said whats up unofficial business she said id like your take on something unofficial means not paid i guess i said you up for any pro bono work she paused and then said this could be important to me what the hell my night had pretty much been shot anyway where do you want me cook county morgue murphy said i want to show you a corpse chapter five they dont make morgues with windows in fact if the geography allows for it they hardly ever make morgues above the ground i guess its partly because it must be easier to refrigerate a bunch of coffinsized chambers in a room insulated by the earth but that cant be all there is to it under the earth means a lot more than relative altitude its where dead things fit graves are under the earth so are hell gehenna hades and a dozen other reported afterlives maybe it says something about people maybe for us under the earth is a subtle and profound statement maybe ground level provides us with a kind of symbolic boundary marker an artificial construct that helps us remember that we are alive maybe it helps us push deaths shadow back from our lives i live in a basement apartment and like it what does that say about me probably that i overanalyze things you look pensive murphy said we walked down an empty hospital corridor toward the cook county morgue wed had to go the long way around so that i could avoid any areas with important medical equipment my leather duster whispered around my legs as i walked my blasting rod thumped against my leg rhythmically where id tied it to the inside of the duster id traded in my slacks for blue jeans and my dress shoes for hiking boots murphy didnt look like a monsterhunting valkyrie murphy looked like someones kid sister she was five nothing a hundred and nothing and was built like an athlete all springy muscle her blond hair hung down over her blue eyes and was cut close in back she wore nicer clothes than usuala maroon blouse with a grey pantsuitand she had on more makeup than was her habit she looked every inch the professional businesswoman that said murphy was a monsterhunting valkyrie she was the only person id ever heard of who had killed one with a chainsaw i said you look pensive harry she repeated a little louder i shook my head and told murphy i dont like hospitals she nodded morgues spook me morgues and dogs dogs i asked not like beagles or cocker spaniels or anything just big dogs i nodded i like dogs they give mister something to snack on murphy gave me a smile ive seen you spooked it doesnt make you look like that what do i look like i asked murphy pursed her lips as though considering her words you look worried and frustrated and guilty you know romance things i gave her a wry glance and then nodded susans in town murphy whistled wow shes okay yeah as much as she can be then why do you look like you just swallowed something that was still wriggling i shrugged shes in town to quit her job and she was with someone a guy murphy asked yeah she frowned with him or with him i shook my head just with him i think i dont know shes quitting her job guess so were going to talk i think she said so said shed get in touch and wed talk murphys eyes narrowed and she said ah one of those eh i said and eyed her she lifted her hands palms out none of my business hells bells murph she sighed and didnt look up at me and didnt speak for a few steps finally she said you dont set up a guy for a good talk harry i stared at her profile and then scowled down at my feet for a while no one said anything we got to the morgue murphy pushed a button on the wall and said its murphy at a speaker next to the door a second later the door buzzed and clicked i swung open the door and held it for murphy she gave me an even look before she went through murphy does not respond well to chivalry the morgue was like others id seen cold clean and brightly lit with fluorescent lights metal refrigerator doors lined one wall an occupied autopsy table sat in the middle of the room and a white sheet covered its subject a rolling medical cart sat next to the autopsy table another by a cheap officefurniture desk polka music heavy on accordion and clarinet oompahed cheerfully through the room from a little stereo on the desk at the desk sat a small man with a wild shock of black hair he was dressed in medical scrubs and green bunny slippers complete with floppy ears he had a pen clenched in one hand and scribbled furiously at a stack of forms when we came in he held up a hand toward us and finished his scribbling with a flourish before hopping up with a broad smile karrin he said wow youre looking nice tonight whats the occasion municipal brass are tromping around murphy said so were all supposed to wear our sunday clothes and smile a lot bastards the little guy said cheerfully he shot me a glance you arent supposed to be spending money on psychic consultants either i bet you must be harry dresden thats what it says on my underwear i agreed he grinned great coat love it harry murphy said this is waldo butters assistant medical examiner butters shook my hand then turned to walk to the autopsy table he snapped on some rubber gloves and a surgical mask pleased to meet you mister dresden he said over his shoulder seems like every time youre working with si my job gets really interesting murphy chucked me on the arm with one fist and followed butters i followed her masks on that tray to your left stay a couple of feet back from the table and for gods sake dont throw up on my floor we put on masks and butters threw back the sheet id seen corpses before hells bells id created some id seen what was left of people who had been burned alive savaged to death by animals and who had died when their hearts exploded out of their chests courtesy of black magic but i hadnt ever seen anything quite like this i shoved the thought to the back of my head and tried to focus purely upon taking in details it wouldnt do to think too much looking at this thinking too much would lead me to messing up butterss floor the victim had been a man maybe a little over six feet tall thin build his chest looked like twenty pounds of raw hamburger fine grid marks stretched vertically from his collarbones to his belly and horizontally across the width of his body the cuts were spaced maybe a sixteenth of an inch apart and the grid pattern slashed into the flesh looked nearly flawless the cuts were deep ones and i had the unsettling impression that i could have brushed my hand across the surface of that ruined body and sent chunks of flesh pattering to the floor the yincision of the autopsy had been closed at least its lines marred the precision of the grid of incisions the next thing i noticed were the corpses arms or rather the missing bits of them his left arm had been hacked off two or three inches above the wrist the flesh around it gaped and a shard of blackcrusted bone poked out from it his right arm had been severed just beneath the elbow with similar hideous results my belly twitched and i felt myself taking one of those prevomit breaths i closed my eyes for a second and forced the impending reaction down dont think harry look see what there is to see that isnt a man anymore its just a shell throwing up wont bring him back i opened my eyes again tore my gaze from his mutilated chest and hands and forced myself to study the corpses features i couldnt his head had been hacked off too i stared at the ragged stump of his neck the head just wasnt there even though thats where heads go ditto his hands a man should have a head should have hands they shouldnt simply be gone the impression it left on me was unsettlingsimply and profoundly wrong inside me some little voice started screaming and running away i stared down at the corpse my stomach threatening insurrection again i stared at his missing head but aloud all i said was gee wonder what killed him what didnt kill him butters said i can tell you this much it wasnt blood loss i frowned at butters what do you mean butters lifted one of the corpses arms and pointed down at dark mottling in the dead grey flesh just where the corpses back met the table see that he asked lividity if this guy had bled out from his wrists or his neck either one i dont think thered be enough blood left in the body to show this much his heart would have just kept on pumping it out of his body until he died i grunted if not one of the wounds then what was it my guess butters said plague i blinked and looked at him plague he said again or more accurately plagues his insides looked like models for a textbook on infection not all the tests have come back yet but so far every one ive done has returned positive everything from bubonic plague to strep throat and there are symptoms ive found in him that dont match any disease ive ever heard of youre telling me he died of disease i asked diseases plural and get this i think one of them was smallpox i thought smallpox was extinct murphy said pretty much they have some in vaults probably some in some bioweapon research facilities but thats it i stared at butters for a second and were standing here next to his plagueridden body why relax butters said the really nasty stuff wasnt airborne i disinfected the corpse pretty well wear your mask and dont touch it you should be fine what about the smallpox i said butterss voice turned wry youre vaccinated this is dangerous though isnt it having the body out like this yeah butters said his voice frank but county is full and the only thing thats going to happen if i report an occurrence of freerange smallpox is another evaluation murphy shot me a warning look and stepped a very little bit between me and butters you got a time of death butters shrugged maybe fortyeight hours ago tops all of those diseases seemed to sprout up at exactly the same time i make cause of death as either shock or a massive failure and necrosis of several major organs plus tissue damage from an outrageously high fever its anyones guess as to which one gets the blue ribbon lungs kidneys heart liver spleen we get the point murphy said let me finish its like every disease the guy had ever had contact with all got together and planned when to hit him it just isnt possible he probably had more germs in him than blood cells i frowned and then someone ginsued him after he died butters nodded partly though the cuts on his chest werent postmortem they had filled with blood tortured before he died maybe ugh i said why murphy regarded the corpse without any emotion showing in her cool blue eyes whoever cut him up must have taken the arms and hands to make it hard to identify him after he died thats the only logical reason i can think of same here said butters i frowned down at the table why prevent identification of the corpse if it had died of disease butters began to lower the arm slowly and i saw something as he did wait hold it he looked up at me i pressed closer to the table and had butters lift the arm again i had almost missed it against the rotted tone of the dead mans flesha tattoo maybe an inch square located on the inside of the corpses biceps it wasnt fancy faded green ink in the shape of a symbolic open eye not too different from the cbs network logo see there i asked murphy and butters peered at the tattoo do you recognize it harry murphy asked i shook my head almost looks old egyptian but with fewer lines hey butters do you have a piece of paper better butters said he got an old instant camera off the bottom tray of one of the medical carts and snapped several shots of the tattoo he passed one of them over to murphy who waved it around a little while the image developed i got another okay i said thinking out loud guy dies of a zillion diseases he somehow contracted all at once how long do you think it took butters shrugged no idea i mean the odds against him getting all of those at once like that are beyond astronomical days i asked if i had to guess butters said id say more like hours maybe less okay i said and during those hours someone uses a knife on him and turns his chest into tuna cubes then when theyre done they take his hands and his head and dump the body where was it found under an overpass on the expressway murphy said like this naked i shook my head si got handed this one murphys face flickered with annoyance yeah homicide dumped it on us to take some highprofile case all the municipal folk are hot about i took a step back from the corpse frowning putting things together i figured odds were pretty good that there werent all that many people running around the world torturing victims by carving their skin into graph paper before murdering them at least i hoped there werent all that many murphy peered at me her expression serious what harry do you know something i glanced from murphy to butters and then back again butters raised both his hands and headed for the doors stripping his gloves and dumping them in a container splattered with red biohazard signs you guys stay here and mulder it out i have to go down the hall anyway back in five minutes i watched him go and said after the door swung shut bunny slippers and polka music dont knock it murphy said hes good at his job maybe too good whats that mean she walked away from the autopsy table and i followed her murphy said butters was the one who handled the bodies after the fire at the velvet room the one id started oh mmm hmm his original report stated that some of the remains recovered from the scene were humanoid but definitely not human yeah i said red vampires murphy nodded but you cant just stick that in a report without people getting their panties in a bunch butters wound up doing a threemonth stint at a mental hospital for observation when he came out they tried to fire him but his lawyer convinced them that they couldnt so instead he lost all his seniority and got stuck on the night shift but he knows theres weirdness out there he calls me when he gets some of it seems nice enough except for the polka murphy smiled again and said what do you know nothing i can tell you i said i agreed to keep the information confidential murphy peered up at me for a moment once upon a time that comment might have sent her into a fit of stubborn confrontation but i guess tunes had changed all right she said are you holding back anything that might get someone hurt i shook my head its too early to tell murphy nodded her lips pressed together she appeared to weigh things for a moment before saying you know what youre doing thanks she shrugged i expect you to tell me if it turns into something i should know okay i said staring at her profile murphy had done something i knew she didnt do very often shed extended her trust id expected her to threaten and demand i could have handled that this was almost worse guilt gnawed on my insides id agreed not to divulge anything but i hated doing that to murphy shed gone out on a limb for me too many times but what if i didnt tell her anything what if i just pointed her toward information shed find sooner or later in any case look murph i specifically agreed to confidentiality for this client but if i were going to talk to you id tell you to check out the murder of a frenchman named larouche with interpol murphy blinked and then looked up at me interpol i nodded if i were going to talk right she said if youd said anything you tightlipped bastard one corner of my mouth tugged up into a grin meanwhile ill see if i cant find out anything about that tattoo she nodded you figure were dealing with another sorcerer type i shrugged maybe but if you give someone a disease with magic its usually so that you make it look like they havent been murdered natural causes this kind of mishmash i dont know maybe its something a demon would do a real demon like exorcist demon i shook my head those are the fallen the former angels not the same thing why not demons are just intelligent beings from somewhere in the nevernever mostly they dont care about the mortal world if they notice it at all the ones who do are usually the hungry types or the mean types that someone calls up to do thug work like that thing leonid kravos had called up murphy shivered i remember and the fallen theyre very interested in our world but they arent free to act like demons are why not i shrugged depends on who you talk to ive heard everything from advanced magical resonance theory to because god said so one of the fallen couldnt do this unless it had permission to right and how many people would give permission to be infected and then tortured to death murphy said yeah exactly she shook her head going to be a busy week half a dozen professional hitters for the outfit are in town the county morgue is doing double business city hall is telling us to bend over backward for some bigwig from europe or somewhere and now some kind of plague monster is leaving unidentifiable mutilated corpses on the side of the road thats why they pay you the big bucks murph murphy snorted butters came back in and i made my goodbyes my eyes were getting heavy and i had aches in places where i hadnt known i had places sleep sounded like a great idea and with so many things going on the smart option was to get lots of rest in order to be as capably paranoid as possible i walked the long route back out of the hospital but found a hall blocked by a patient on some kind of lifesupport machinery being moved on a gurney from one room to another i wound up heading out through the empty cafeteria into an alley not far from the emergency room exit a cold chill started at the base of my spine and slithered up over my neck i stopped and looked around me reaching for my blasting rod i extended my magical senses as best i could tasting the air to see what had given me the shivers i found nothing and the eerie sensation eased away i started down the alley toward a parking garage half a block from the hospital and tried to look in every direction at once as i went i passed a little old homeless man hobbling along heavily on a thick wooden cane a while farther on i passed a tall young black man dressed in an old overcoat and tattered and toosmall suit clutching an open bottle of vodka in one heavyknuckled hand he glowered at me and i moved on past him chicago nightlife i kept on moving toward my car and heard footsteps growing closer behind me i told myself not to be too jumpy maybe it was just some other frightened endangered paranoid sleepdeprived consultant who had been called to the morgue in the middle of the night okay maybe not the steady tread of the footsteps behind me shifted becoming louder and unsteady i spun to face the person following me raising the blasting rod in my right hand as i did i turned around in time to see a bear a freaking grizzly bear fall to all four feet and charge i had already begun preparing a magical strike with the rod and the tip burst into incandescent light shadows fell harshly back from the scarlet fire of the rod and i saw the details of the thing coming at me it wasnt a bear not unless a bear can have six legs and a pair of curling rams horns wrapping around the sides of its head not unless bears can somehow get an extra pair of eyes right over the first set one pair glowing with faint orange light and one with green not unless bears have started getting luminous tattoos of swirling runes on their foreheads and started sprouting twin rows of serrated slimecoated teeth it came charging toward me several hundred pounds of angrylooking monster and i did the only thing any reasonable wizard could have done i turned around and ran like hell chapter six id learned something in several years of professional wizarding never walk into a fight when the bad guys are the ones who set it up wizards can call down lightning from the heavens rip apart the earth beneath their enemys feet blow them into a neighboring time zone with gale winds and a million other things even less pleasantbut not if we dont plan things out in advance and were not all that much tougher than regular folks i mean if some nasty creature tears my head off my shoulders ill die i might be able to lay out some serious magical pounding when i need to but id made the mistake of tangling with a few things that had prepared to go up against me and it hadnt been pretty this bearthing whatever the hell it was had followed me hence it had probably picked its time and place i could have stood and blasted away at it but in the close quarters of the alley if it was able to shrug off my blasts it would tear me apart before i could try plan b so i ran one other thing id learned wheezy wizards arent all that good at running thats why id been practicing i took off at a dead sprint and fairly flew down the alley my duster flapping behind me the bear thing snarled as it came after me and i could hear it slowly gaining ground the mouth of the alley loomed into sight and i ran as hard as i could for it once i was in the open with room to dodge and put obstacles between me and the creature i might be able to take a shot at it the creature evidently realized that because it let out a vicious spitting growl and then leapt i heard it gather itself for the leap and turned my head enough to see it out of the corner of my eye it flew at my back i threw myself down sliding and rolling over the asphalt the creature soared over me to land at the mouth of the alley a good twenty feet ahead i skidded to a stop and went running back down the alley a growing sense of fear and desperation giving my feet a set of chickenyellow wings i ran for maybe ten seconds gritting my teeth as the creature took up the pursuit again i couldnt keep up a full sprint forever unless i thought of something else i was going to have to turn and take my chances i all but flattened the tall young black man id seen earlier when i leapt over a moldering pile of cardboard boxes he let out a startled noise and i answered it with a low curse come on i said grabbing his arm move move move he looked past me and his eyes widened i looked back and saw the four glowing eyes of the bearcreature coming at us i hauled him into motion and he picked up speed and started running with me we ran for a few seconds more before the little old derelict id seen earlier came limping along on his cane he looked up and the dim light from the distant street glinted on a pair of spectacles augh i shouted i shoved my running partner past me toward the old man and snarled get him out of here both of you run i whirled to face the bearcreature and swept my blasting rod to point right at it i ran some force of will down into the energy channels in the rod and with a snarled fuego sent a lance of raw fire whipping through the air the blast slammed into the bearcreatures chest and it hunched its shoulders turning its head to one side its forward charge faltered and it slid to a stop crashing against a weathered old metal trash can what do you know i muttered it worked i stepped forward and unleashed another blast at the creature hoping to either melt it to bits or drive it away the bearthing snarled and turned a hateful murderous gaze at me with its four eyes the soulgaze began almost instantly when a wizard looks into someones eyes he sees more than just what color they are eyes are windows to the soul when i make eye contact for too long or too intently i get to peek in through the windows you cant hide what you are from a wizards soulgaze and he cant hide from you you both see each other for what you are within and its with a clarity so intense that it burns itself into your head looking on someones soul is something you never forget no matter how badly you might want to i felt a whirling gyrating sensation and fell forward into the bearthings eyes the glowing sigil on its forehead became a blaze of silver light the size of a stadium scoreboard set against a roundish cliffside of dark green and black marble i expected to see something hideous but i guess you cant judge a monster by the slime on its scales what i saw instead was a man of lean middle years dressed in rags his hair was long and straight wispy grey that fell down to his chest he stood in a posture of agony his wiry body stretched out in an arch with his hands held up and apart his legs stretched out i followed the lines of his arms back and up and saw why he stood that way hed been crucified the mans back rested against the cliff the great glowing sigil stretching out above him his arms were pulled back at an agonizing angle and were sunk to the elbow in the greenblack marble of the cliff his knees were bent his feet sunk into the stone as well he hung there the pressure of all his weight on his shoulders and legs it must have been agonizing the crucified man laughed at me his eyes glowing a shade of sickly green and screamed as if it will help you nothing youre nothing pain laced his voice making it shrill agony contorted the lines of his body veins standing out sharply against straining muscle stars and stones i whispered creatures like this bearthing did not have souls to gaze upon that meant that regardless of appearances to the contrary this thing was a mortal itno hewas a human being what the hell is this the man screamed again this time all rage and anguish void of words i lifted a hand and stepped forward my first instinct to help him before i got close the ground began to shake the cliff face rumbled and slits of seething orange light appeared and then widened until i faced the second set of eyes eyes the size of subway tunnels opening on the great marble cliff i stumbled several steps back and that cliff face proved to be exactly thata face cold and beautiful and harsh around that fiery gaze the quaking in the earth increased and a voice louder than a metallica concert spoke the raw sense of the words the vicious anger and hate behind them hitting me far more heavily than mere volume get out the sheer force of presence behind that voice seized me and threw me violently back away from the tortured man at the cliffside and out of the soulgaze the mental connection snapped like dry spaghetti and the same force that had thrown my mind away from the soulgaze sent my physical body flying back through the air i hit an old cardboard box filled with empty bottles and heard glass shattering beneath me the heavy leather duster held and no broken shards buried themselves in my back for a second or two i just lay on my back stunned my thoughts were a hectic whirlpool i couldnt calm or control i stared up at the citys light pollution against the low clouds until some tiny voice in me started screaming that i was in danger i shoved myself to my knees just as the bearcreature smacked a trash can aside with one of its paws and started toward me my head was still ringing with the aftereffects of the soulgaze and the psychic assault that had broken the connection i lifted my blasting rod summoned up every bit of will i could scrape together out of the confusion and spat a word that sent another lance of flame toward the bearcreature this time the blast didnt even slow it down the set of orange eyes flared with a sudden luminance and my fire splashed against an unseen barrier dispersing around the creature in sheets of scarlet it let out a screaming roar and lumbered toward me i tried to get up stumbled and fell at the feet of the little old homeless guy who leaned on his cane and stared at the creature i had a dim impression of his featuresasian a short white beard around his chin heavy white eyebrows and corrective glasses that made his eyes look the size of an owls run dammit i shouted at him i tried to lead by example but my balance was still whirling and i couldnt get off the ground the old man did not turn to run he took off his glasses and pushed them at me hold please then he took a deliberate step forward with his cane placing himself between me and the bearcreature the creature hurled itself at him with a bellow rearing up on its hindmost legs it plunged down at the whitehaired man jaws gaping and i couldnt do anything but watch it happen the little man took two steps to one side pirouetting like a dancer the end of his wooden cane lashed out and struck the creatures jaws with a crunching impact bits of broken yellow teeth flew from the creatures mouth the little man continued his turn and evaded its claws by maybe an inch he wound up behind the creature and it turned to follow him huge jaws snapping in rage the man darted back staying just ahead of the things jaws and in a blur of sudden light on metal he drew from his cane a long blade the classic singleedged chiselpointed katana the steel flashed at the creatures eyes but it ducked low enough that the scything blade only whipped the top couple of inches from one of its ears the creature screamed entirely out of proportion with the injury a yowl that almost sounded human it lurched back shaking its head a fine spray of blood sprinkling from its wounded ear at this point i noticed three things one the creature was paying me no attention whatsoever yippee ki yay my head still spun wildly and if it had come for me i didnt think i could have done anything about it two the old mans sword was not reflecting light it was emitting it the waterpatterned steel of the blade glowed with a steady silver flame that slowly grew brighter three i could feel the humming power of the sword even from several yards away it throbbed with a steady deep strength as quiet and unshakable as the earth itself in my entire life id seen only one sword imbued with that much power but i knew that there were a couple more oi shouted the little old man his english heavily accented ursiel let him go you have no power here the bear creatureursiel i presumedfocused its foureyed gaze on the little man and did something unsettling it spoke its voice came out quiet smooth melodious words somehow slithering out through the bears jaws and throat shiro look at yourself little fool you are an old man you were at the peak of your strength when last we met you cannot defeat me now shiro narrowed his eyes his sword gripped in one hand the length of wooden sheath held in the other did you come here to talk ursiels head tilted to one side and then the smooth voice murmured no indeed i did not it whirled whipping its head toward me and lunged as it did there was a rustle of cloth and then an old overcoat spun through the air spreading like a fishermans net it fell over ursiels face and the demon drew up short with a frustrated howl it reached up and tore the coat from its head while it did the tall young black man stepped between ursiel and me as i watched he drew a long heavy saber from the scabbard at his hip the sword hummed with the same power as shiros though in a slight variation a different note within the same chord silver light flared from the blades steel and behind the demon shiros blade answered it with more of its own radiance the young man looked back at me and i caught a glimpse of dark intense eyes before he faced the demon and said in a rumbling basso words flavored with a thick russian accent ursiel let him go you have no power here ursiel hissed the orange eyes blazing brighter by the moment sanya traitor do you really think any of us fears even one of the three in your pathetic hands so be it i will take you all sanya spread his empty hand to one side of his body in mocking invitation and said nothing ursiel roared and flew at sanya the big man extended the saber and the weapon took ursiel high on one shoulder plunging through muscle and sinew sanya braced himself as the demons body hit him and though the impact drove his feet back across six inches of concrete he held it up and away from me shiro let out a ringing cry i wouldnt have believed a little old man could make and ursiel screamed thrashing and flailing sanya shouted something in what sounded like russian and drove forward with both hands on the hilt of the impaling saber overbearing ursiel and sending the demon sprawling onto his back sanya followed staying close and i saw him throw his weight onto the demon as he twisted the hilt of the saber thrust through it hed been too aggressive ursiels paw hit him squarely upon one shoulder and i heard the snap of breaking bone the blow threw the young man away from the demon and he rolled across the ground and into a wall an explosive breath of pain forced from him as he hit ursiel recovered its feet tore the saber from its shoulder with a jerk of its jaws and went after sanya but the whitehaired old man menaced its flank forcing it away from the wounded man and incidentally from me for a few seconds the old man and the demon circled each other then the demon lashed out at shiro a flurry of slashes with its claws the old man ducked them retreating his sword flickering and cutting twice he left cuts on the demons paws but though it screamed in rage it only seemed to grow less intimidated more angry the old mans breathing grew visibly labored age ursiels voice purred amidst its attack death comes old man its hand is on your heart now and your life has been spent in vain let him go spat the old man between breaths ursiel laughed again and the green pair of eyes glowed brighter another voice this one not at all beautiful the words twisted and snarling said stupid preacher time to die like the egyptian did shiros expression changed from stolid controlled ferocity to something much sadder much more resolved he faced the demon for a moment panting and then nodded so be it the demon drove forward and the old man gave ground slowly forced into a corner of the alley he seemed to be doing pretty well until one close swipe of the demons claws caught the glowing silver blade near its hilt and sent it spinning away the old man gasped and pressed back against the corner panting holding his right hand against the left side of his chest so it ends knight purred the smooth demonvoice of ursiel hai the old man agreed quietly he looked up above him at a fire escape platform ten feet off the ground a shadowed figure dropped over the rail of the platform steel rasping as it did there was a low thrum of power a flash of silver and the hiss of a blade cutting the air the shadowy figure landed in a crouch beside the creature the demon ursiel jerked once body stiffening there was a thump then its body toppled slowly over to one side leaving its monstrous head lying on the alley floor the light died from its four eyes the third knight rose away from the demons corpse tall and broadshouldered his closecut hair dark and feathered with silver michael carpenter snapped the blade of his broad sword amoracchius to one side clearing droplets of blood from it he put it back into its sheath staring down at the fallen demon and shook his head shiro straightened his breathing quick but controlled and went to michaels side he gripped the larger mans shoulder and said it had to be done michael nodded the smaller knight recovered the second sword cleared the blade and returned it to its wooden sheath not far from me the third knight the young russian pushed himself up from the ground one of his arms dangled uselessly but he offered the other to me i took his hand and rose on wobbly legs you are well he asked his voice quiet peachy i responded wobbling he arched an eyebrow at me then shrugged and went to recover his blade from the alley floor the aftereffects of the soulgaze had finally begun to fade and the simple shock and confusion began to give way to a redundant terror i hadnt been careful enough one of the bad guys had caught me off guard and without intervention i would have been killed to death it wouldnt have been anything quick and painless either without michael and his two companions the demon ursiel would have torn me limb from literal limb and i wouldnt have been able to do a damned thing about it i had never encountered a psychic presence of such raw magnitude as upon the great stone cliff face not up close and personal like that anyway the first shot id taken at him had surprised and annoyed him but he had been ready for the second blast and swatted aside my magical fire like an insect whatever ursiel had been he had been operating on a completely different order of magnitude than a mere punk of a mortal wizard like me my psychic defenses arent bad but they had been crushed like a beer can under a bulldozer that more than anything scared the snot out of me i had tried my psychic strength against more than a few bad guys and i had never felt so badly outclassed oh i knew there were things out there stronger than me sure but none of them had ever jumped me in a dark alley i shook and found a wall to lean on until my head cleared a little and then walked stiffly over to michael bits of broken glass fell from folds in my duster michael glanced up as i came over to him harry he said it isnt that im not glad to see you i said but you couldnt have jumped down and beheaded the monster about two minutes sooner michael was usually pretty good about taking a joke this time he didnt even smile no im sorry i frowned at him how did you find me how did you know good advice which could have been anything from spotting my car nearby to being told by an angelic chorus the knights of the cross always seemed to turn up in bad places when they were badly needed sometimes coincidence seemed to go to incredible lengths to see to it that they were in the right place at the right time i didnt think i wanted to know i nodded at the demons fallen body and said what the hell was that thing he wasnt a thing harry michael said he continued staring down at the remains of the demon and just about then they started shimmering it only took a few seconds for the demon to dissolve into the form of the man id seen in the soulgazethin greyhaired dressed in rags except that in the soulgaze his head hadnt been lying three feet away like that i didnt think a severed head should have held an expression but it did one of absolute terror his mouth locked open in a silent scream the sigil id seen on the cliff face stood out on his forehead like a fresh scab dark and ugly there was a glitter of orangered light the sigil vanished and something clinked on the asphalt a silver coin a little smaller than a quarter rolled away from the mans head bounced against my foot and then settled onto the ground a second later the body let out a hissing sighing sound and began to run with streaks of greenblack goo the body just deflated in on itself noxious fumes and a spreading puddle of disgusting slime the only things remaining thats it i said staring down and trying to keep myself from visibly trembling the weirdness has just gone off the end of my meter im going home and going to bed i bent to recover the coin before the slime engulfed it the old man snapped his cane at my wrist growling no it stung i jerked my hand back shaking my fingers and scowled at him stars and stones michael who is this guy michael drew a square of white cloth from his pocket and unfolded it shiro yoshimo he was my teacher when i became a knight of the cross the old man grunted at me i nodded at the wounded man and asked how about him the tall black man glanced up at me as the old knight began examining his arm he looked me up and down without any sign of approval glowered and said sanya the newest of our order michael added he shook out the cloth revealing two pairs of crosses embroidered in silver thread upon it michael knelt down and picked up the coin through the cloth turned it over then folded the cloth completely around the silver i frowned down at the coin as he did one side bore some ancient portrait maybe of a mans profile the opposite side had some other design that was hidden under a stain in the shape of a runethe one id seen on the demon ursiels forehead whats that i asked shiro was protecting you michael said rather than answering the question michael looked over at shiro who stood with the towering sanya and asked how is he broken arm the old man reported we should get off the street agreed rumbled sanya the older knight fashioned a makeshift sling from the shredded overcoat and the tall young man slipped his arm into it without a sound of complaint youd better come with us harry michael said father forthill can get you a cot whoa whoa i said you never answered my question what was that michael frowned at me and said its a long story and theres little time i folded my arms make time im not going anywhere until i know what the hell is going on here the little old knight snorted and said hell that is what is going on he opened his hand to me and said please give them back i stared at him for a second until i remembered his spectacles i handed them to him and he put them on making his eyes goggle out hugely again wait a minute i said to michael this thing was one of the fallen michael nodded and a chill went through me thats impossible i said the fallen cant do things like that i gestured at the puddle of slime they arent allowed some are michael said his voice quiet please believe me you are in great danger i know what youve been hired to find and so do they shiro stalked down to the end of the alley and swept his gaze around oi michael we must go if he will not come he will not come sanya said he glared at me then followed shiro michael i began listen to me michael said he held up the folded white cloth there are more where this one came from harry twentynine of them and we think theyre after you chapter seven i followed michaels white pickup truck in the blue beetle to saint mary of the angels cathedral its a big big church a city landmark if theres anything you like in the way of gothic architecture you can find it somewhere on saint marys we parked near the back of the cathedral and went to the delivery entrance a plain oak door framed by lovingly tended rose vines michael knocked at the door and i heard the sound of multiple bolts being undone before the door opened father anthony forthill opened the door he was in his late fifties balding and carried a comfortable weight of years he wore black slacks and a black shirt the stark white square of his clerical collar sharply delineated he was taller than shiro but a lot shorter than everyone else there and beneath his glasses his eyes looked strained success he asked michael in part michael responded he held up the folded cloth and said put this in the cask please and well need to splint an arm forthill winced and accepted the folded cloth with the kind of ginger reverence paid only to explosives and samples of lethal viruses right away good evening mister dresden come in all of you father i answered you look like my day so far forthill tried to smile at me then padded away down a long hallway michael led us deeper into the church up a flight of stairs to a storage room whose boxes had been stacked to the ceiling to make room for a number of folding cots blocking the view of any windows a mismatched pair of old lamps lit the room in soft gold ill get food something to drink michael said quietly he headed back out of the room and i need to call charity sanya youd better sit down until we can see to your arm ill be fine sanya said i will help with food shiro snorted and said sit boy he headed for the door catching up to michael and said call your wife i will do the rest the two left together their voices lowering to bare murmurs as they entered the hall sanya glowered at the door for a moment and then settled down on one of the bunks he looked around at the room for a moment and then said you use the forces of magic i take it i folded my arms and leaned against the wall what gave it away he bared his teeth white against his dark skin how long have you been a wiccan a what a pagan a witch im not a witch i said glancing out the door im a wizard sanya frowned what is the difference wizard has a z he looked at me blankly no one appreciates me i muttered wicca is a religion its a little more fluid than most but its still a religion and and im not really big on religion i do magic sure but its like being a mechanic or an engineer there are forces that behave a certain way if you know what youre doing you can get them to work for you and you dont really need a god or a goddess or a whatever to get involved sanyas expression became surprised you are not a religious man then i wouldnt burden any decent system of faith by participating in it the tall russian regarded me for a moment and then nodded slowly i feel the same way i felt my eyebrow arch spocklike thats a joke right he shook his head it is not i have been an atheist since childhood youve got to be kidding me youre a knight of the cross da he said so if youre not religious you risk your life to help other people because because it must be done he answered without hesitation for the good of the people some must place themselves in harms way some must pledge their courage and their lives to protect the community just a minute i said you became a knight of the cross because you were a communist sanyas face twisted with revulsion certainly not trotsky very different i stopped myself from bursting out in laughter but it was a near thing how did you get your sword he moved his good hand to rest on the hilt of the blade where it lay beside him on the cot esperacchius michael gave it to me since when has michael gone running off to russia not that michael sanya said he pointed a finger up that michael i stared at him for a minute and then said so you get handed a holy sword by an archangel told to go fight the forces of evil and you somehow remain an atheist is that what youre saying sanyas scowl returned doesnt that strike you as monumentally stupid his glare darkened for maybe a minute before he took a deep breath and nodded perhaps some could argue that i am agnostic agnostic one who does not commit himself to the certain belief in a divine power he said i know what it means i said what shocks me is that you think it applies to you youve met more than one divine power hell one of them broke your arm not half an hour ago many things can break an arm you yourself said that you do not need a god or goddess to define your beliefs about the supernatural yeah but im not agnostic just nonpartisan theological switzerland thats me sanya said semantics i do not understand your point i took a deep breath still holding back the threat of giggles and said sanya my point is that you have got to be more than a little thick to stand where you are having seen what youve seen and claim that you arent sure whether or not theres a god he lifted his chin and said not necessarily it is possible that i am mad and all of this is a hallucination thats when i started laughing i just couldnt help it i was too tired and too stressed to do anything else i laughed and enjoyed it thoroughly while sanya sat on his cot and scowled at me careful not to move his wounded arm shiro appeared at the door bearing a platter of sandwiches and deli vegetables he blinked through his owlish glasses at sanya and then at me he said something to sanya in what i took to be russian the younger knight transferred his scowl to shiro but nodded his head in a gesture deep enough to be part bow before he rose claimed two sandwiches in one large hand and walked out shiro waited until sanya was gone before he set the platter down on a card table my stomach went berserk at the sight of the sandwiches heavy exertion coupled with insane fear does that to me shiro gestured at the plate and pulled up a couple of folding chairs i sat down nabbed a sandwich of my own and started eating turkey and cheese heaven the old knight took a sandwich of his own and ate with what appeared to be a similar appetite we munched for a while in contented silence before he said sanya told you about his beliefs i felt the corners of my mouth start to twinge as another smile threatened yeah shiro let out a pleased snort sanya is a good man i just dont get why hed be recruited as a knight of the cross shiro looked at me over the glasses chewing after a while he said man sees faces sees skin flags membership lists files he took another large bite ate it and said god sees hearts if you say so i said he didnt answer right about the time i finished my sandwich shiro said you are looking for the shroud thats confidential i said if you say so he said using my own inflection on the words the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes deepened why why what why are you looking for it he asked chewing if i am and im not saying that i amim doing it because ive been hired to look for it your job he said yeah you do it for money he said yeah hmph he said and pushed his glasses up with his pinky do you love money then mister dresden i picked up a napkin from one side of the platter and wiped my mouth i used to think i loved it but now i realize that its just dependency shiro let out an explosive bark of laughter and rose chortling sandwich okay super michael came in a few minutes later his face troubled there wasnt a clock in the room but it had to have been well after midnight i supposed if i had called charity carpenter that late id be troubled after the conversation too she was ferocious where her husbands safety was concernedespecially when she heard that i was around okay admittedly michael had gotten pretty thoroughly battered whenever he came along on a case with me but all the same i didnt think it was fair of her it wasnt like i did it on purpose charity wasnt happy i asked michael shook his head shes worried is there a sandwich left there were a couple michael took one and i took a second one just to keep him company while we ate shiro got out his sword and a cleaning kit and started wiping down the blade with a soft cloth and some kind of oil harry michael said finally i have to ask you for something its very difficult and its something that under normal circumstances i wouldnt even consider doing name it i said between chews at the time i meant it literally michael had risked his life for me more than once his family had been endangered the last time around and i knew him well enough to know that he wouldnt ask something unreasonable just name it i owe you michael nodded then looked at me steadily and said get out of this business harry get out of town for a few days or stay home but get out of it please i blinked at him you mean you dont want my help i want your safety michael said you are in great danger youre kidding me i said michael i know how to handle myself you should know that by now handle yourself michael said like you did tonight harry if we hadnt been there what i snapped id have been dead it isnt like it isnt going to happen sooner or later there are enough bad guys after me that one of them is eventually going to get lucky so what else is new you dont understand michael said i understand all right i said one more wacky bhorrormovie reject tried to kill me its happened before itll probably happen again shiro said without looking up from his sword ursiel did not come to kill you mister dresden i considered that in another pregnant silence the lamps buzzed a little shiros cleaning cloth whispered over the steel of his sword i watched michaels face and asked why was he there then id have put down money that it was a demon but it was just a shapechange there was a mortal inside it who was he michaels gaze never wavered his name was rasmussen ursiel took him in eighteen fortynine on his way to california i saw him michael i looked in his eyes michael winced i didnt know that he was a prisoner in his own soul michael something was holding him something big ursiel i guess hes one of the fallen isnt he michael nodded how the hell does that happen i thought the fallen arent allowed to take away free will they arent michael said but they are allowed to tempt and the denarians have more to offer than most denarians i asked the order of the blackened denarius michael said they see an opportunity in this matter a chance to do great harm silver coins i took a deep breath like the one you wrapped up in blessed cloth thirty pieces of silver eh he nodded whoever touches the coins is tainted by the fallen within tempted given power the fallen leads the mortal deeper and deeper into its influence never forcing them just offering until eventually they have surrendered enough of themselves and the thing gets control of them i finished michael nodded like rasmussen we try to help them sometimes the person realizes what is happening wants to escape their influence when we face them we try to wear the demon down give the person taken the chance to escape thats why you kept talking to it until its voice changed but rasmussen didnt want to be free did he michael shook his head believe it or not michael ive been tempted once or twice i can handle it no michael said you cant against the denarians few mortals can the fallen know our weaknesses our flaws how to undermine even warned and aware of them they have destroyed men and women for thousands of years i said ill be fine i growled shiro grunted pride before fall i gave him a sour glance michael leaned forward and said harry please i know that your life has not been an easy one youre a good man but you are as vulnerable as anyone these enemies dont want you dead he looked down at his hands they want you which scared me really scared me maybe because it seemed to disturb michael so much and very little disturbs him maybe because i had seen rasmussen and would always be able to see him there trapped wildly laughing or maybe it was because part of me wondered if it would be so impossible to find a way to use the power the coin obviously offered if it had made some random schmuck on the way to pan for gold into a killing machine that it took all three knights of the cross to handle what could someone like me do with it beat the living snot out of duke paolo ortega thats for sure i blinked refocusing my eyes michael watched me his expression pained and i knew that hed guessed at my thoughts i closed my eyes shame making my stomach uneasy youre in danger harry michael said leave the case alone if i was in so much danger i responded why did father vincent come and hire me forthill asked him not to michael said father vincent disagrees with forthill on how supernatural matters are to be handled i stood up and said michael im tired im really damned tired harry michael chided me darned i mumbled darned tired darn me unto heck i headed for the door and said im heading home to get some sleep ill think about it michael stood up and shiro with him both of them facing me harry michael said you are my friend youve saved my life ive named a child for you but stay out of this business for my sake if not for your own and if i dont i asked then ill have protect you from yourself in the name of god harry please dont push this i turned and left without saying goodbye in this corner one missing shroud one impossibly and thoroughly dead corpse one dedicated and deadly vampire warlord three holy knights twentynine fallen angels and a partridge in a pear tree and in the opposite corner one tired bruised underpaid professional wizard threatened by his allies and about to get dumped by his wouldbe girlfriend for john q humdrum oh yeah definitely bedtime chapter eight i fumed and brooded all the way back to my apartment the beetles engine sputtering nervously the whole time mister was sitting at the top of the steps and let out a plaintive meow as i shut and locked up my car though i kept my blasting rod and shield bracelet ready in case any vanilla goons were waiting around with more silenced guns i was fairly confident no preternasties were hanging around in ambush mister tended to make lots of noise and then leave whenever supernatural danger was around which just goes to show that my cat has considerably more sense than me mister slammed his shoulder against my legs and didnt quite manage to trip me into falling down the stairs i didnt waste any time getting inside and locked up behind me i lit a candle got out some cat food and fresh water for misters bowls and spent a couple minutes pacing back and forth i glanced at my bed and wrote it off as a useless idea i was too worked up to sleep even tired as i was i was already chin deep in alligators and sinking fast right then harry i mumbled might as well do some work i grabbed a heavy warm robe off its hook shoved aside one of my rugs and opened the trapdoor leading down to the subbasement a folding ladderstaircase led down to the damp stone chamber beneath where i kept my lab and i padded down it my robes hem dragging against the wooden steps i started lighting candles my lab barring a brief bout of insanity generally reflects the state of my own mindcluttered messy unorganized but basically functional the room isnt large three worktables line three of the walls in a u shape and a fourth table runs down the center of the u leaving a narrow walkway around it wire utility shelves line the walls above the tables piled on the shelves and tables are a vast array of magical ingredients plus that sort of miscellaneous domestic clutter that in households of more substance always winds up in a big drawer in the kitchen books notebooks journals and papers line the shelves together with containers and boxes and pouches full of all sorts of herbs roots and magical ingredients from a bottle of snake hisses to a vial of milkthistle extract at the far end of the room there was a patch of floor kept completely clear of all clutter a copper ring set into the stone of the floor my summoning circle resided there experience had shown me that you never can tell when you might need a ritual circle to defend yourself from magical attack or for its other most obvious usekeeping a denizen of the nevernever a temporary prisoner one of the shelves had less on it than the others at either end rested a candleholder long since overrun with many colors of melted wax until they were nothing but mounds like a honeybee vesuvius books mostly paperback romances and various small and feminine articles took up the rest of the shelf but for where a bleached human skull sat in the middle i picked up a pencil and rapped it against the shelf bob bob wake up work to be done twin points of orange and gold light kindled in the shadows of the skulls eye sockets and grew brighter as i went about the room lighting half a dozen candles and a kerosene lamp the skull rattled a little and then said its only a few hours from dawn and youre just starting up what gives i started getting out beakers and vials and a small alcohol burner more trouble i said its been one hell of a day i told bob the skull about the television studio the vampires challenge the hit man the missing shroud and the plaguefilled corpse wow you dont do things halfway do you harry advise now critique later im going to look into things and whip up a potion or two and youre going to help right bob said where do you want to start with ortega where is my copy of the accords cardboard box bob said third shelf on the bottom row behind the pickling jars i found the box and pawed through it until i had found a vellum scroll tied shut with a white ribbon i opened it and peered down at the handwritten calligraphy it started off with the word insomuch and the syntax got more opaque from there i cant make heads or tails of this i said wheres the section about duels fifth paragraph from the end you want the cliffs notes version i rolled the scroll shut again hit me its based on code duello bob said well technically its based on much older rules that eventually inspired the code duello but thats just chickens and eggs ortega is the challenger and youre the challenged i know that i get to pick the weapons and the ground right wrong bob said you pick the weapons but he gets to choose the time and location damn i muttered i was going to take high noon out in a park somewhere but i guess i can just say that well duel with magic if its one of the available choices it almost always is who decides the vampires and the council will pick from a list of neutral emissaries the emissary decides i nodded so if i dont have it as an option im screwed right i mean magic wizard kind of my bag bob said yeah but be careful its got to be a weapon that he can use if you pick one he cant he can refuse it and force you to take your second choice meaning what meaning that regardless of what happens if he doesnt want to fight you in magic he wont have to ortega didnt get to be a warlord without thinking things through harry odds are that he has a good idea what you can do and has planned accordingly what do you know about him not much presumably hes tough bobs eyelights stared at me for a minute well napoleon im sure hell never overcome that kind of tactical genius i flicked my pencil at the skull in annoyance it bounced off a nose hole get to the point the point is that youd be better off taking something you can predict im better off not fighting to begin with i said do i need to get a second you both do bob said the seconds will work out the terms of the duel his should be getting in touch with yours at some point uh i dont have one bobs skull turned a bit on its shelf and banged its forehead gently into the brick wall a few times then get one dolt obviously i got another pencil and a pad of yellow lined paper and wrote to do across the top and ask michael about duel underneath it okay and i want you to find out whatever you can about ortega before dawn check bob said i have your permission to come out not yet theres more bobs eyelights rolled of course theres more my job sucks i got out a jug of distilled water and a can of coke i opened the can took a sip and said that corpse murphy showed me plague curse probably bob agreed but if it was really that many diseases it was a big one how big bigger than that spell the shadowman was using to tear hearts out a few years ago i whistled and he was running it off of thunderstorms and ceremonial rites too what would it take to power a curse that strong curses arent really my thing bob hedged but a lot like maybe tapping into a sorcerous ley line or a human sacrifice i sipped more coke and shook my head someone is playing some serious hardball then bob mused maybe the wardens used it to get nasty on a red court agent they wouldnt i said they wouldnt use magic like that even if technically it was the diseases that killed the guy its too damn close to breaking the first law who else would have that kind of power bob asked me i turned to a fresh page and sketched out a rough version of the tattoo on the corpse i held it up to show it to bob someone who didnt like this maybe eye of thoth bob supplied that the tattoo on the corpse yeah was this guy in someones secret club maybe the eye is a pretty popular occult symbol though so you cant rule out the possibility that he was an independent okay i said so who uses it plenty of groups brotherhoods connected to the white council historic societies a couple of fringe groups of occult scholars personality cults television psychics comic book heroes i get the point i said i turned to a fresh page and from razorsharp memory sketched out the symbol id seen on the demon ursiels forehead do you recognize this bobs eyelights widened are you insane harry tear that paper up burn it i frowned bob wait a minute do it now the skulls voice was frightened and i get nervous when bob gets frightened not much can scare bob out of his usual wiseasscommentator state of mind i tore up the paper i guess you recognize it yeah and im not having anything to do with that bunch i didnt hear that bob i need information on them theyre in town theyve taken a shot at me and im betting theyre after the shroud let them have it bob said seriously youve got no idea the kind of power this group has fallen i know i said order of the blackened denarius but they have to play by the rules right harry it isnt just the fallen the people theyve taken are nearly as bad theyre assassins poisoners warriors sorcerers sorcerers the coins make them effectively immortal some of the order have had a thousand years to practice and maybe more that much time even modest talents can grow teeth never mind everything experience would have taught them everything they could have found to make themselves stronger over the years even without infernal superpowers theyd be badass i frowned and tore the bits of paper into smaller bits badass enough to manage that curse theres no question that theyd have the skill maybe enough that they wouldnt need as big a power source great i said and rubbed at my eyes all right then bigleaguers all around i want you to track down the shroud no can do bob said give me a break how many pieces of twothousandyearold linen are in town thats not the point harry the shroud is bob seemed to struggle to find words it doesnt exist on the same wavelength as me its out of my jurisdiction what are you talking about im a spirit of intellect harry of reason logic the shroud isnt about logic its an artifact of faith what i demanded that doesnt make any sense you dont know everything harry bob said you dont even know a lot i cant touch this i cant come anywhere near it and if i even try ill be crossing boundaries i shouldnt im not going up against angels dresden fallen or otherwise i sighed and lifted my hands fine fine is there someone i can talk to bob was quiet for a moment before he said maybe ulsharavas ulsha who ulsharavas shes an ally of the loa an oracle spirit theres details about halfway through your copy of dumonts guide to divinationators how are her prices reasonable bob said youve got everything you need for the calling she isnt usually malicious isnt usually the loa are basically good guys but they all have their darker aspects too ulsharavas is a pretty gentle guide but shes been harsh before dont let your guard down i wont i said and frowned one more thing swing by marcones place and see if theres anything interesting there you dont have to go all david niven just take a look around you think marcones involved in this one his thugs already took a poke at me i might as well find out whatever i can i give you permission to leave in pursuit of that information bob get back before dawn oh do we still have that recipe for the antivenom to vampire spit a cloud of orange lights flowed out of the skull across the table and then up the stairs bobs voice oddly modulated floated back to me red notebook dont forget to light the wardflame while im gone yeah yeah i muttered i gave bob a minute to clear my wards then got down a threecandle holder with green yellow and red candles on it i lit the green one and set the candleholder aside i got out dumonts guide and read over the entry for ulsharavas it looked pretty simple though you couldnt be too careful whenever you called something in from the nevernever i took a couple of minutes to gather what id need the oracle spirit couldnt put together a body for herself not even a nebulous cloud of light like bob could she required a homunculus to manifest in the mortal world dumont recommended a newly dead corpse but as the only one i was likely to find was my own i needed a substitute i found it in another box and plopped it down in the center of my summoning circle i added a cup of whiskey and a freshly opened tin of prince alberts chewing tobacco to the circle the required down payment to convince ulsharavas to show up it was the last of my whiskey and the last of the tins of tobacco so i added get more scotch and prince albert in a can to my todo list and stuck it in my pocket i spent a couple of minutes sweeping the floor around the circle so that i wouldnt kick a stray hair or bit of paper across the circle and flub it up after a brief deliberation i chalked down another circle outside the copper one then i took a moment to go over the guide a last time and to clear my head of distractions i took a deep breath and gathered in my strength then i focused reached down and touched the copper circle willing a tiny jolt of power into it the summoning circle closed i felt it as a tingling prickle on the back of my neck and a faint warmth on the skin of my face i repeated the process with the chalk circle adding a second layer and then knelt down by the circle lifting both hands palmsup ulsharavas i murmured willing energy into the words my voice shook oddly skittering around tones in what seemed a random fashion ulsharavas ulsharavas one lost in ignorance seeks you one darkened by the lack of knowledge seeks your light come guardian of memory sentinel of the yet to come accept this offering and join me here at the conclusion of the ritual words i released the power id been holding sending it coursing from me into the circle and through it to seek out the oracle spirit in the nevernever the response came immediately a sudden swirl of light appeared within the copper circle and briefly made the barrier around it visible as a curved plane of blue sparkles the light drizzled down over the homunculus and a moment later it twitched then sat up welcome oracle i said bob the skull thought you might be of some help the homunculus sat up and stretched out pudgy arms then it blinked looked at its arms and rose to stare down at itself it looked up at me with one eyebrow raised and asked in a tiny voice a cabbage patch doll you expect me to help you while wearing this it was a cute doll blond ringlets fell to her plush shoulders and she wore a pinkandblue calico dress complete with matching ribbons and little black shoes uh yeah sorry i said i didnt have anything else with two arms and two legs and im pressed for time ulsharavas the cabbage patch doll sighed and sat down in the circle legs straight out like a teddy bears she struggled to pick up the comparatively large cup of whiskey and drank it down it looked like she was taking a pull from a rain barrel but she downed the whiskey in one shot i dont know where it went given that the doll didnt actually have a mouth or a stomach but none of it spilled onto the floor that done she thrust a tiny fist into the tobacco and stuffed a wad of it into her mouth so she said between chews you want to know about the shroud and the people who stole it i lifted my eyebrows uh yeah actually youre pretty good there are two problems i frowned okay what are they ulsharavas peered at me and said first i dont work for bokkor im not a bokkor i protested you arent a houngun you arent a mambo that makes you a sorcerer wizard i said im with the white council the doll tilted her head youre stained she said i can feel black magic on you its a long story i said but mostly it isnt mine some of it is i frowned at the doll and then nodded yeah ive made a bad call or two but honest ulsharavas noted well enough second is my price what did you have in mind the doll spat to one side flecks of tobacco landing on the floor an honest answer to one question answer me and i will tell you what you seek yeah right i said you could just ask me for my name ive heard that one before i didnt say youd have to answer in full the doll said i certainly do not wish to threaten you but what you would answer you must answer honestly i thought about it for a minute before i said all right done ulsharavas scooped up more tobacco and started chomping answer only this why do you do what you do i blinked at her you mean tonight i mean always she answered why are you a wizard why do you present yourself openly why do you help other mortals as you do uh i said i stood up and paced over to my table what else would i do precisely the doll said and spat you could be doing many other things you could be seeking a purpose in life in other careers you could be sequestered and studying you could be using your skills for material gain and living in wealth even in your profession as an investigator you could do more to avoid confrontation than you do but instead you consign yourself to a poor home a dingy office and the danger of facing all manner of mortal and supernatural foe why i leaned back against my table folded my arms and frowned at the doll what the hell kind of question is that an important one she said and one that you agreed to answer honestly well i said i guess i wanted to do something to help people something i was good at is that why she asked i chewed over the thought for a moment why had i started doing this stuff i mean it seemed like every few months i was running up against situations that had the potential to horribly kill me most wizards never had the kind of problems i did they stayed at home minded their own business and generally speaking went on about their lives they did not challenge other supernatural forces they didnt declare themselves to the public at large they didnt get into trouble for sticking their noses in other peoples business whether or not theyd been paid to do so they didnt start wars get challenged to duels with vampire patriots or get the windows shot out of their cars so why did i do it was it some kind of masochistic death wish maybe a psychological dysfunction of some sort why i dont know i said finally i guess i never thought about it all that much the doll watched me with unnerving intensity for a full minute before nodding dont you think you should i scowled down at my shoes and didnt answer ulsharavas took one last fistful of tobacco and sat back down in her original position settling her calico dress primly about her the shroud and the thieves you seek have rented a small vessel docked in the harbor it is a pleasure craft called the etranger i nodded and exhaled through my nose all right then thank you for your help she lifted a tiny hand one thing more wizard you must know why the knights of the white god wish you to stay away from the shroud i arched an eyebrow why they received part of a prophecy a prophecy that told them that should you seek the shroud you will most assuredly perish only part of a prophecy i asked yes their adversary concealed some of it from them i shook my head why are you telling me this because ulsharavas said you must hear the second half of the prophecy in order to restore the balance uh okay the doll nodded and fixed me with that unsettling unblinking stare should you seek the shroud harry dresden you will most assuredly perish all right i said so what happens if i dont the doll lay down on her back and wisps of light began flowing back out of her back from whence ulsharavas had come her voice came to me quietly as if from a great distance if you do not they all die and this city with them chapter nine i hate cryptic warnings i know the whole crypticremark concept is part and parcel of the wizard gig but it doesnt suit my style i mean what good is a warning like that all three knights and the population of chicago would die if i didnt get involvedand my number would be up if i did that sounded like the worst kind of selffulfilling crap theres a case to be made for prophecy dont get me wrong mortals even wizards all exist at a finite point in the flow of time or to make it simple if time is a river then you and i are like pebbles in it we exist in one spot at a time occasionally jostled back and forth by the currents spirits dont always have the same kind of existence some of them are more like a long thread than a stonetheir presence tenuous but rippling upstream and down as a part of their existence experiencing more of the stream than the pebble thats how oracle spirits know about the future and the past theyre living in them both at the same time theyre delivering mysterious messages to you thats why they only give brief warnings or mysterious dreams or prophetic knockknock jokes or however they drop their clues if they tell you too much it will change the future that theyre experiencing so they have to give out the advice with a light touch i know it makes my head hurt too i dont put much stock in prophecy as extensive and aware as these spirits might be they arent allknowing and as nutty as people are i dont buy that any spirit is going to be able to keep an absolute lock on every possible temporal outcome maybe genuine prophecies aside i could hardly drop the case now in the first place id been paid up front and i didnt have the kind of financial breathing space i would need to be able to turn down the money and pay my bills at the same time in the second place the risk of imminent death just didnt hit me the same way it used to it wasnt that it didnt scare me it did in that kind of horrible uncertain way that left me with nothing to focus my fears upon but ive beaten risks before i could do it again you want to know another reason i didnt back off i dont like getting pushed around i dont like threats as wellintentioned and polite and caring as michaels threat had been it still made me want to punch someone in the nose the oracles prophecy had been another threat of sorts and i dont let spirits from the nevernever determine what im going to do either finally if the prophecy was right michael and his brother knights could be in danger and they had saved my skinny wizards ass not long ago i could help them they might be heavenonwheels when it came to taking on bad guys in a fight but they werent investigators they couldnt run these thieves down the way i could it was just a question of making them see reason once id convinced them that the prophecy theyd received wasnt wholly correct everything would be fine yeah right i shoved those thoughts aside and checked the clock i wanted to move on ulsharavass tip as soon as possible but i was beat and likely to make mistakes with all the bad guys running around town there was no sense in going out there into the dark exhausted and unprepared id wait for the potions to be ready and bob to come back from his mission at least sunlight would cut down on the risk as well since red court vampires got incinerated by itand i doubted these denarian fruitcakes would get along with it either thus prioritized i checked my notes and started putting together a couple of potions that would offer me a few hours of protection from the narcotic venom of the red court the potions were simple ones brewing any kind of potion required a base liquid and then several other ingredients meant to bind the magic put into the potion to the desired effect one ingredient was linked to each of the five senses then one to the mind and one to the spirit in this case i wanted something that would offset the venomous saliva of the red court vampires a narcotic that rendered those exposed to it passively euphoric i needed a potion that would ruin the pleasurable sensations of the poison i used stale coffee as my base ingredient to that i added hairs from a skunk for scent a small square of sandpaper for touch i tossed in a small photo of meat loaf cut from a magazine for sight a roosters crow id stored in a small quartz crystal went in for hearing and a powdered aspirin for taste i cut the surgeon generals warning label from a pack of cigarettes and chopped it fine to add in for the mind and then lit a stick of the incense i sometimes used while meditating and wafted some of the smoke into the two bottles for the spirit once the potions were bubbling over a burner i drew in my wearied will and released power into the mixes suffusing them with energy they fizzed and frothed with gratifying enthusiasm i let them simmer for a while then took them from the fire and emptied them into a pair of small sportsdrink bottles after that i slumped on a stool and waited for bob to come home i must have nodded off because when my phone rang i jerked myself up straight and nearly fell off my stool i clambered up the ladder and picked up the phone dresden hoss said a weatherbeaten voice on the other end ebenezar mccoy a sometime teacher of mine sounded businesslike did i wake you up no sir i said i was up anyway working on a case you sound tired as a coalmine mule been up all night uh huh ebenezar said hoss i just called to let you know not to worry about this duel nonsense were going to slap it down by we ebenezar meant the senior council members seven of the most experienced wizards on the white council held positions of particular authority especially during times of crisis when quick decisions were needed ebenezar had turned down his chance at a seat on the senior council for nearly fifty years he took it only recently to block a potentially fatal political attack directed against yours truly by some of the more conservative read fanatic members of the white council slap it down no dont do that what ebenezar said you want to fight this duel did you fall and hit your head boy i rubbed at my eyes tell me about it ill work out something to give me a shot at winning sounds like your wagons already pretty full to be letting this vampire push you he knew where to push i said ortega brought a bunch of goons into town vampires and straight hit men too he says that if i dont face him hes going to have a bunch of people i know killed ebenezar spat something in what i presumed was gaelic youd better tell me what happened then i told ebenezar all about my encounter with ortega oh and a contact of mine says that the red court is divided over the issue there are lots of them who dont want the war to end of course they dont ebenezar said that fool of a merlin wont let us take the offensive he thinks his fancy wards will make them give up how are they working out i asked well enough for now ebenezar admitted one major attack has been pushed back by the wards no more council members have been killed in attacks on their homes though the red courts allies are putting pressure on ours and a few wardens have died on intelligencegathering missions but it isnt going to last you cant win a war sitting behind a wall and hoping the enemy decides to leave what do you think we should do officially ebenezar said we follow the merlins lead more than anything now we need to stay together what about unofficially think about it ebenezar snorted if we just sit here the vampires are going to take apart or drive away our allies and then well have to take them all on alone look hoss are you sure about this duel hell no i said i just didnt see much choice ill figure out something if i win it might be worth it to the council neutral territory for meeting and negotiating could come in handy ebenezar sighed aye the merlin will think the same thing he was quiet for a moment before he said not much like the days on the farm is it hoss not much i agreed do you remember that telescope we set up in the loft ebenezar had taught me what i knew of astronomy on long dark summer evenings in the ozark hills hay doors to the barns loft open stars overhead shining in the country darkness by the millions i remember that asteroid we discovered that turned out to be an old russian satellite asteroid dresden was a better name than kosmos five he chuckled and added as an afterthought do you remember whatever happened to that telescope and such i kept meaning to ask you but i never got around to it we packed it in that steamer trunk in the horse stall with the observation logs yeah i said oh thats right ebenezar said obliged sure hoss well agree to the duel if thats what you want but be careful i dont plan to roll over and die i said but if something should happen to me i coughed well if it does there are some papers in my lab youll know how to find them some people id like to make sure are protected of course ebenezar said but im likely to carry on cranky if i have to drive all the way up to chicago twice in as many years hate for that to happen luck hoss thanks i hung up the phone rubbed tiredly at my eyes and stomped back down to the lab ebenezar hadnt come out and said it but the offer had been there behind the old mans talk of days gone by hed been offering me sanctuary at his farm it wasnt that i didnt like chicago but the offer was a tempting one after a couple of rough years slugging it out with various bad guys a quiet year or two on the farm near hog hollow missouri sounded tempting of course the safety offered in that image was an illusion ebenezars place was going to be as well protected as any wizards on earth and the old man himself could be a terrible foe but the red court of vampires had a big network supporting it and they didnt generally bother to play fair theyd destroyed a wizard stronghold the previous summer and if theyd cracked that place they could do it to ebenezars ozark hideaway too if i went there and they found out about it it would make the old mans farm too tempting a target to pass by ebenezar knew that as well as i did but he and i shared a common traithe doesnt like bullies either hed be glad to have me and hed fight to the death against the reds if they came but i didnt want to draw that kind of thing down on him i was grateful for the old mans support but i owed him more than that besides i was almost as well protected here in chicago my own wards defensive screens of magic to protect my apartment had kept me safe and alive for a couple of years and the presence of a large mortal population kept the vampires from trying anything completely overt wizards and vampires notwithstanding everyone in the supernatural community knew damned well that plain old vanilla mortals were one of the most dangerous forces on the planet and went out of their way not to become too noticeable to the population at large the population at large meanwhile did everything it possibly could to keep from noticing the supernatural so that worked out the vampires had taken a poke or two at me since the war began but it hadnt been anything i couldnt handle and they didnt want to risk being any more obvious thus ortega and his challenge so how the hell was i supposed to fight a duel with him without using magic my bed called to me but that thought was enough to keep me from answering i paced around my living room for a while trying to think of some kind of weapon that would give me the most advantage ortega was stronger faster more experienced and more resistant to injury than me how the hell was i supposed to pick a weapon to go up against that i supposed if the duel could be worked into some kind of pizzaeating contest i might have a shot but somehow i didnt think that the pizza spress hungry man special was on the list of approved weaponry i checked the clock and frowned dawn was only minutes away and bob wasnt back yet bob was a spirit being a spirit of intellect from one of the more surreal corners of the nevernever he wasnt evil as much as he was magnificently innocent of any kind of morality but as a spirit daylight was a threat to him as surely as it was to the vampires of the red court if he got caught out in it it could kill him dawn was about two minutes off before bob returned flowing down the ladder and toward the skull something was wrong bobs manifestation of a candle flamecolored cloud of swirling lights bobbed drunkenly left and right on its way back to the shelf with the skull purple globs of glowing plasm dribbled from the cloud in a steady trail striking the floor where they winked out into blobs of transparent goo the cloud flowed into the skull and after a moment faint violet flames appeared in the skulls empty eye sockets ow bob said his voice tired hells bells i muttered bob you all right no bob monosyllabic crap is there anything i can do to help no bob said faintly rest but report bob said have to right hed been sent out on a mission and he was feeling pressured to finish it what happened wards bob said marcones i felt my mouth fall open what wards bob repeated i sat down on my stool how the hell did marcone get wards bobs tone became a shade contemptuous magic the insult relieved me a little if he was able to be a wiseass hed probably be okay could you tell who did the wards no too good damn a spell had to get up pretty early in the morning to get around bob maybe hed been hurt worse than i thought what about ortega rothchild bob said half a dozen vamps with him maybe a dozen mortals bobs eyelights flickered and guttered i couldnt risk losing bob by pushing him too hardand spirit or not he wasnt immortal he wasnt afraid of bullets or knives but there were things that could kill him good enough for now i said tell me the rest later get some sleep bobs eyelights flickered out without another word i frowned at the skull for a while and then shook my head i collected my potion bottles cleaned up the work area and turned to leave and let bob get some rest i was leaning over the wardflames to blow them out when the green candle hissed and shrank to a pinpoint of light the yellow candle beside it flared up without warning brighter than an incandescent lightbulb my heart started pounding and nervous fear danced over the back of my neck something was approaching my apartment thats what it meant when the flame spread from the green to the yellow candle warning spells i had threaded out to a couple of blocks from my house had sensed the approach of supernatural hostility the yellow candle dimmed and the red candle exploded into a flame the size of my head stars and stones the intruder that had triggered the warning system the wardflames were linked to was getting closer and it was something big or else a lot of somethings they were heading in fast to set off the red candle so quickly only a few dozen yards from my house i dashed up the ladder from the lab and got ready to fight chapter ten i got up the ladder in time to hear a car door shut outside my apartment id lost my during a battle between the faerie courts hosted on clouds over lake michigan the previous midsummer so id moved my from the office to home it hung on a gun belt on a peg beside the door just over a wire basket id attached to the wall holy water a couple cloves of garlic vials of salt and iron filings filled the basket intended to be door prizes for anything that showed up in an attempt to suck my blood carry me off to faerieland or sell me stale cookies the door itself was reinforced steel and could stand up to punishment better than the wall around it id had a demon come aknocking before and i didnt want an encore performance i couldnt afford new furniture even secondhand i belted on the gun shook out my shield bracelet and took up my staff and blasting rod anything that came through my door would have to contend with my threshold the aura of protective energy around any home most supernatural things didnt do so well with thresholds after that theyd have to force their way past my wardsbarriers of geometrically aligned energy that would block out physical or magical intrusion turning that energy back upon its source a small gentle push at my wards would result in a similar push against whatever was trying to get in a swift or heavy push would result in more energy feeding back onto the attacker within the wards were sigils of fire and ice which were designed to deliver bursts of destructive energy about as powerful as your average land mine it was a solid and layered defense with luck it should be enough to stop a considerable amount of threat from even reaching my door and since im such a lucky guy i took a deep breath pointed my blasting rod at the door and waited it didnt take long i expected flashes of magical discharge demon howls maybe some kind of pyrotechnics as evil magic clashed against my own defensive spells instead i got seven polite knocks i peered at the door suspiciously and then asked whos there a low rough mans voice growled the archive what the hell the archive who evidently the speaker didnt have a sense of humor the archive the voice repeated firmly the archive has been appointed emissary in this dispute and is here to speak to wizard dresden about the duel i frowned at the door i vaguely remembered mention of an archive of some sort during the last white council meeting id attended as a neutral party at the time id assumed it had been some sort of arcane library id had other things on my mind at the time and i hadnt been listening too closely how do i know who you are there was a rasp of paper on stone and an envelope slid under my door one corner poking out documentation wizard dresden the voice replied and a pledge to abide by the laws of hospitality during this visit some of the tension left my shoulders and i lowered the gun that was one good thing about dealing with the supernatural community if something gave you its word you could trust it within reason then again maybe that was just me of all the things id encountered id been more of a weasel about keeping my word than any of them maybe thats why i was leery about trusting someone else i picked up the envelope and unfolded a sheet of plain paper certifying that its bearer had been approved by the white council to act as emissary in the matter of the duel i passed my hand over it and muttered a quick charm with the last password id gotten from the wardens and in response a brief glowing pentacle appeared centered on the paper like a bioluminescent watermark it was legit i folded the paper closed again but i didnt set my rod and staff aside just yet i undid the dead bolt muttered my wards back and opened the door enough to see outside a man stood on my doorstep he was nearly as tall as me but looked a lot more solid with shoulders wide enough to make the loose black jacket he wore fit tightly on his upper arms he wore a navy blue shirt and stood so that i could see the wrinkles caused by the straps of a shoulder rig a black ball cap reined in dark golden hair that might have fallen to his shoulders he hadnt shaved in a few days and had a short white scar below his mouth that highlighted the cleft in his chin his eyes were greyblue and empty of any expression in a way i had seldom seen not like he was hiding what he felt more like there was simply nothing there dresden he asked yeah i eyed him up and down you dont look very archiveesque he lifted his eyebrows a mildly interested expression im kincaid youre wearing a gun only when company comes over i havent seen any of the councils people carrying a gun good for you he turned and waved his hand this shouldnt take long i glanced past him what do you mean a second later a little girl started down my stairs one hand carefully on the guide rail she was adorable maybe seven years old her blond hair still babyfine and straight clipped neatly at her shoulders and held back with a hairband she wore a plain little corduroy dress with a white blouse and shiny black shoes and her coat was a puffy downfilled jacket that seemed like a bit of overkill for the weather i looked from the kid to kincaid and said you cant be bringing a child into this sure i can kincaid said what couldnt you find a babysitter the child stopped a couple of steps up so that her face was even with my own and said her voice serious and marked with a faint british accent he is my babysitter i felt my eyebrows shoot up or more accurately my driver she said are you going to let us in i prefer not to remain outdoors i stared at the kid for a second arent you a little short for a librarian i am not a librarian the child said i am the archive hang on a minute i said what do you i am the archive the child said her voice steady and assured i assume that your wards detected my presence they seemed functional you i said youve got to be kidding i extended my senses gingerly toward her the air around her fairly hummed with power different from what i would expect around another wizard but strong all the same a quiet and dangerous buzz like that around hightension power lines i had to suppress a sudden rush of apprehension from showing on my face the girl had power she had a hell of a lot of power enough to make me wonder if my wards would be enough to stop her if she decided to come through them enough to make me think of little billy mumy as the omnipotent brat on that old episode of the twilight zone she regarded me with implacable blue eyes i suddenly did not want to take the chance of looking into i can explain it to you wizard she said but not out here i have neither an interest nor an inclination to do you any harm perhaps the opposite i frowned at her promise promise the child said solemnly cross your heart and hope to die she drew an x over her puffy jacket with one index finger you dont know how much kincaid took a couple of steps up and glanced warily around the street make up your mind dresden im not keeping her out here for long what about him i asked the archive and nodded toward kincaid can he be trusted kincaid the girl asked her voice whimsical can you be trusted youre paid up through april the man replied his eyes still scanning the street after that i might get a better offer there the girl said to me kincaid can be trusted until april hes an ethical man in his way she shivered and put her hands into the pockets of her puffy coat she hunched up her shoulders and watched my face generally speaking my instincts about people who werent women who might potentially end up doing adult things with me were pretty good i trusted the archives promise besides she was darling and looked like she was starting to get cold fine i said come inside i stepped back and opened the door the archive came in and told kincaid wait with the car come fetch me in ten minutes kincaid frowned at her and then me you sure quite the archive stepped in past me and started taking off her coat ten minutes i want to head back before rush hour begins kincaid fixed his empty eyes on me and said be nice to the little girl wizard ive handled your kind before i get more threats before nine am than most people get all day i responded and shut the door on him purely for effect i locked it too me petty surely not i lit a couple of candles in order to get a little more light into the living room and stirred up the fire adding more wood to it as soon as the embers were glowing while i did the archive took off her coat folded it neatly over the arm of one of my lumpy comfy chairs and sat down back straight hands folded in her lap her little black shoes waved back and forth above the floor i frowned at her its not like i dont like kids or anything but i hadnt had much experience with them now i had one sitting there wanting to talk to me about a duel how the hell did a child no matter how large her vocabulary manage to get appointed an emissary so uh whats your name she said the archive yeah i got that part but i meant your name what people call you the archive she repeated i do not have a familiar name i am the archive and have always been the archive youre not human i said incorrect i am a sevenyearold human child with no name everybody has a name i said im cant go around calling you the archive the girl tilted her head to one side arching a pale gold eyebrow then what would you call me ivy i said at once why ivy she asked youre the archive right archive archivy ivy the girl pursed her lips ivy she said and then nodded slowly ivy very well she regarded me for a moment and then said go ahead and ask the question wizard we might as well get it out of the way who are you i asked why are you called the archive ivy nodded the thorough explanation is too complex to convey to you here but in short i am the living memory of mankind what do you mean the living memory i am the sum of human knowledge passed down from generation to generation mother to daughter culture science philosophy lore tradition i hold the accumulated memories of a thousand generations of mankind i take in all that is written and spoken i study i learn that is my purpose to procure and preserve knowledge so youre saying that if its been written down you know it i know it i understand it i sat down slowly on the couch and stared at her hells bells it was almost too much to comprehend knowledge is power and if ivy was telling me the truth she knew more than anyone alive how did you get this gig my mother passed it on to me she replied as i was born just as she received it when she was born and your mother lets a mercenary drive you around certainly not my mother is dead wizard she frowned not dead technically but all that she knew and was came into me she became an empty cup a persistent vegetative state her eyes grew a little wistful distant shes free of it but she certainly isnt alive in the most vital sense im sorry i said i wouldnt know why i know my mother and all before her she put a finger to her temple its all in here you know how to use magic i asked i prefer calculus but you can do it yes yikes if the reaction of my wards was any indication it meant that she was at least as strong as any wizard of the white council probably stronger but if that was true if you know that much i said if you are that powerful why did you hire a bodyguard to bring you here my feet dont reach the pedals i felt like smacking myself on the forehead oh right ivy nodded in preparation for the duel i will need some information namely where i might contact your second and what weapon you prefer for the duel i dont have a second yet ivy arched an eyebrow then you have until sundown this evening to gain one otherwise the match and your life will be forfeit forfeit uh how would the forfeit be collected the little girl stared at me for a silent moment then she said ill do it i swallowed a cold chill rippling over me i believed her i believed that she could and i believed that she would um okay look i havent exactly chosen a weapon yet either if i simply choose one mister dresden will skill energy or flesh wait i said i thought i got to pick swords or guns or something ivy shook her head read your copy of the accords i choose what is available and i choose the ancient ways you may match wills with your opponent to gauge which of you is the most determined you may match your skill at arms against his each of you with weaponry of your individual choosing you may wield energy forces against each other or you may challenge him to unarmed combat she considered i would advise against the last thanks i muttered ill take magic energy you realize of course that he will decline in that venue and you will be forced to choose another i sighed yeah but until he does i dont have to pick another one right indeed ivy acknowledged there was a knock on the door and i got up to open it kincaid nodded to me then leaned in and said ten minutes thank you kincaid ivy said she rose drew a business card from her pocket and passed it to me have your second call this number i took the card and nodded i will just then mister emerged from my bedroom and lazily arched his back then he padded over to me and rubbed his shoulder against my shin by way of greeting ivy blinked and looked down at mister and her childs face was suddenly suffused with a pure and uncomplicated joy she said kitty and immediately knelt down to pet mister mister apparently liked her he started purring louder and walked around ivy rubbing up against her while she petted him and spoke to him quietly hells bells it was adorable she was just a kid a kid who knew more than any mortal alive a kid with a scary amount of magical power a kid who would kill me if i didnt show up to the duel but still a kid i glanced up at kincaid who stood frowning down at ivy fawning all over mister he shook his head and muttered now thats just creepy chapter eleven ivy seemed reluctant to leave off petting mister but she and kincaid left without further conversation i shut the door after them and leaned on it listening with my eyes closed until theyd gone i didnt feel as tired as i should have probably because i had a wealth of experience that suggested i would get a lot more worn out before i got a real chance to rest mister rubbed up against my legs until id leaned down to pet him after which he promptly walked over to his food bowl ignoring me altogether i grabbed a coke from the icebox while he ate absently pouring a bit onto a saucer and leaving it on the floor by mister by the time id finished it id made up my mind about what i had to do next make phone calls i called the number vincent had left for me first i expected to reach an answering service but to my surprise vincents voice tense and anxious said yes its harry dresden i said i wanted to check in with you ah yes just a moment vincent said i heard him say something caught a bit of conversation in the background and then heard him walking and a door shut behind him the police he said ive been working with them throughout the evening any luck i asked god only knows vincent said but from my perspective it seems the only thing accomplished is deciding which department is going to handle the investigation homicide i guessed vincents tired voice became dry yes though the mind boggles at the chain of logic that led to it election year city management is politicking i said but once you start dealing with the actual police personnel you should be all right there are good people in every department one hopes have you found anything ive got a lead i dont know how good the thieves might be on a small craft in the harbor im heading down there presently very well vincent said if the lead is good do you want me to call cpd id rather you contacted me first vincent said i am still uncertain of how much trust to place in the local police i cannot help but think it must have been the reason the thieves fled herethat they possessed some contact or advantage with the local authorities id like as much time as possible to decide whom to trust i frowned and thought about marcones flunkies taking a shot at me chicago pd had an unfair reputation for corruption thanks in part to the widespread mob activity during prohibition it was inaccurate but people were people and people arent immune to being bought marcone had attained policeonly information with disturbing speed before might be smart ill check it out and let you know shouldnt be more than an hour or two very good thank you mister dresden is there anything else yeah i said i should have thought of this last night do you have any pieces of the shroud pieces vincent asked scraps or threads i know that many samples were analyzed back in the seventies do you have access to any of those pieces very possibly why i had to remind myself that vincent seemed to be largely a nonbeliever in the supernatural so i couldnt come out and say that i wanted to use thaumaturgy to track down the shroud to confirm identification when i find it i dont want to get foxed with a decoy of course ill make a call vincent said get a sample fedexed here thank you mister dresden i said goodbye hung up and stared at the phone for a minute then i took a deep breath and dialed michaels number even though the sky was barely light with morning the phone rang only once before a womans voice said hello this was my nightmare oh uh hello charity its harry dresden hi the voice said brightly this isnt charity though so maybe it wasnt my nightmare it was my nightmares oldest daughter molly i asked wow you sound all grownup now she laughed yeah the breast fairy came to visit and everything did you want to talk to my mom some might find it significant that it took me a second to realize she wasnt being literal about the faerie sometimes i hate my life well um is your dad around so you dont want to talk to mom check she said hes working on the addition let me get him she set the phone down and i heard footsteps walking away in the background i could hear recorded childrens voices singing the rattle of plates and forks and people talking then there was a rustling sound and a thump as the handset on the other end must have fallen to the floor then i heard the sound of heavy squishy breathing harry sighed another voice from what must have been the same room she sounded much like molly but less cheerful no no honey dont play with the phone give that to me please the phone rattled some more the woman said thank you sweetie and then she picked up the phone and said hello anyone there for a second i was tempted to remain silent or possibly try to imitate a recording of the operator but i steeled myself against that i didnt want to let myself get rattled i was pretty sure that charity could smell fear even over the phone it could trigger an attack hello charity its harry dresden i was calling to speak to michael there was a second of silence during which i couldnt help but imagine the way michaels wifes eyes must have narrowed i suppose it was inevitable she said naturally if there is a situation so dangerous as to require all three of the knights you come crawling out of whatever hole you live in actually this is sort of unrelated i assumed it was your idiocy tends to strike at the worst possible place and time oh come on charity thats not fair growing anger made her voice clearer and sharper if no louder no at the one time in the last year that michael most needs to be focused on his duty to be alert and careful you arrive to distract him anger warred with guilt for dominance of my reaction im trying to help he has scars from the last time you helped mister dresden i felt like slamming the receiver against the wall until it broke but i restrained myself again i couldnt stop the anger from making my words bite though youre never going to give me an inch are you you dont deserve an inch i said is that why you named your son after me that was michael charity said i was still on drugs and the paperwork was done when i woke up i kept my voice calm mostly look charity im real sorry you feel the way you do but i need to talk to michael is he there or not the line clicked as someone else picked up another extension and molly said sorry harry but my dad isnt here sanya says he went out to pick up some doughnuts molly charity said her voice hard its a school day dont dawdle uh oh molly said i swear its like shes telepathic or something i could almost hear charity grinding her teeth that isnt funny molly get off the line molly sighed and said surrender dorothy before she hung up i choked on a sudden laugh and tried to turn it into a series of coughs for charitys benefit from the tone of her voice she hadnt been fooled ill give him a message i hesitated maybe i should ask to wait for him to return there wasnt any love lost between charity and myself and if she didnt pass word along to michael or if she delayed before telling him it could mean my death michael and the other knights were busy with their pursuit of the shroud and god only knew if id be able to get in touch with him again today on the other hand i had neither the time nor the attention to spare to sit there butting heads with charity until michael returned charity had been unreservedly hostile to me for as long as i had known her she loved her husband ferociously and feared for his safetyespecially when he worked with me in my head i knew that her antagonism wasnt wholly without basis michael had been busted up several times when teamed up with me during the last such outing a bad guy gunning for me had nearly killed charity and her unborn child little harry now she worried about the consequences that might be visited on her other children as well i knew that but it still hurt i had to make a decisionto trust her or not i decided to do it charity might not like me but she was no coward and no liar she knew michael would want her to tell him well mister dresden charity asked just let him know that i need to talk to him regarding for a second i debated passing michael my tip on the shroud but michael believed that i was going to get killed if i got involved he took protecting his friends seriously and if he knew that i was poking around he might be inclined to knock me unconscious and lock me in a closet now and apologize later decided against it tell him that i need a second by sundown tonight or bad things will happen to who charity asked me she paused then said ill give him your message and then she hung up on me i hung up the phone frowning that pause wasnt significant i told mister it doesnt mean that she was chewing over the thought of intentionally getting me killed in order to protect her husband and children mister regarded me with that mysticdistance focus in his feline eyes or maybe that was the look he got when his brain waves flatlined either way it was neither helpful nor reassuring im not worried i said not one bit misters tail twitched i shook my head got my stuff together and headed out to investigate the lead at the harbor chapter twelve when i first came to chicago i thought of a harbor as a giant bowl of ocean with ships and boats in the foreground and the faded outline of the buildings on the far side in the background i had always imagined political subversives dressed up as tribal natives and a huge hit in the profit margin of the east india company burnham harbor looked like the parking lot of an oceangoing walmart it might have been able to hold a football field or three white wharves stretched out over the water with pleasure boats and small fishing vessels in rows within a placid oval of water the scent of the lake was one part dead fish one part algaecoated rock and one part motor oil i parked in the lot up the hill from the harbor got out and made sure i had my equipment with me i wore my force ring on my right hand and my shield bracelet on my left wrist and my blasting rod thumped against my leg where i had tied it to the inside of my leather duster id added a can of selfdefense spray to my arsenal and i slipped it into my pants pocket i would rather have had my gun but toting it around in my pocket was a felony the pepper spray wasnt i locked up the car and felt a sudden slithering pressure on my backmy instincts way of screaming that someone was watching me i kept my head down my hands in my pockets and walked toward the harbor i didnt rubberneck around but i tried to get a look at everything while moving only my eyes i didnt see anyone but i couldnt shake the impression that i was being observed doubted it was anyone from the red court the morning hadnt reached full brightness yet but it was still light enough to parboil a vampire that didnt rule out any number of other flavors of assassin though and it was possible that if the thieves were here they were keeping an eye on everyone coming and going all i could do was walk steadily and hope that whoever was watching me wasnt one of marcones thugs a vampire groupie or a rentagun aiming a rifle at my back from several hundred yards away i found the etranger in a few minutes moored at a slip not far from the entrance it was a pretty little ship a white pleasure boat roomy enough to house a comfortable cabin the etranger wasnt new but she looked neat and well cared for a canadian flag hung from a little stand on the ships afterdeck i moved on past the ship at a steady pace and listened as i did listening is a trick id picked up when i was a kid not many people have worked out the trick of it blocking out all other sound in order to better hear one sound in particularsuch as distant voices it isnt as much about magic i think as it is focus and discipline but the magic helps unacceptable said a quiet female voice in the etrangers cabin it was marked with a gentle accent both spanish and british the job entailed a great deal more expense than was originally estimated im raising the price to reflect this nothing more there was a short pause and then the woman said would you like an invoice for your tax return then i told you the quote was only an estimate it happens another pause and then the woman said excellent as scheduled then i stared out at the lake just taking in the view and strained to hear anything else evidently the conversation was over i checked around but there werent any people in sight moving around the harbor on a february weekday morning i took a breath to steady myself and moved closer to the ship i caught a glimpse of motion through a window in the cabin and heard a chirping sound a cell phone rested on a counter beside a pad of hotel stationary a woman appeared in the window dressed in a long gown of dark silk and picked up the cell phone she answered it without speaking and a moment later said im sorry youve the wrong number i watched as she put the phone down and casually let the nightgown slide to the floor i watched a little more i wasnt being a peeping tom this was professional i noted that she had some intriguing curves see professionalism in action she opened a door and a bit of steam wafted out the sound of the water growing louder she stepped in and closed the door again leaving the cabin empty i had an opportunity id seen only one woman and not well enough to positively identify her as either anna valmont or francisca garcia the two remaining churchmice i hadnt seen the shroud hanging from a laundry line or anything even so i had the feeling id come to the right place my gut told me to trust my spiritual informer i made my decision and stepped up a short gangplank onto the etranger i had to move fast the woman on the ship might not be a fan of long showers all i needed to do was get inside see if i could find anything that might verify the presence of the shroud and get out again if i moved quickly enough i could get in and out without anyone the wiser i went down the stairs to the cabin with as much stealth as i could manage the stairs didnt creak i had to duck my head a bit when i stepped into the cabin i stayed close to the door and checked around listening to the patter of the water from the shower the room wasnt large and didnt offer a bonanza of places to hide a double bed took up nearly a quarter of the space in the room a tiny washing machine and dryer were stacked one on another in a corner a basket of laundry stowed atop them a counter and kitchenette with a couple of small refrigerators used up most of the rest i frowned two fridges i checked them out the first was stocked with perishables and beer the second was a fake and opened onto a cabinet containing a heavy metal strongbox bingo the shower kept running i reached out to pick up the strongbox but a thought struck me the churchmice may have gotten themselves into a lot of trouble but theyd evidently been good enough to avoid interpol for a number of years the hiding place for the strongbox was too clumsy too obvious i shut the fake fridge and looked around the room i was starting to get nervous i couldnt have much time left to find the shroud and get out of course i took a couple of long steps to the washer and dryer and grabbed the laundry basket i found it under several clean fluffy towels an opaque plastic package a little larger than a folded shirt i touched it with my left hand a tingling sensation pulsed against my palm and the hairs along my arm rose up straight damn im good i muttered i picked up the shroud and turned to go a woman stood behind me dressed in black fatigue pants a heavy jacket and battered combat boots her peroxideblond hair was cut very short but it did nothing to detract from the appeal of her features she was elegantly pretty and pleasant to look at the gun she had pointed at my nose wasnt pretty though it was an ugly old revolver a cheap saturdaynight special i was careful not to move even a cheap gun can kill you and i doubted i could raise a shield in time to do me any good shed taken me off guard id never heard her coming never sensed her presence damn im good the woman echoed her accent high british a touch of amusement in her voice put the package down i held it out to her here i wouldnt have tried for the gun but if she stepped closer to me it might show that she was an amateur she wasnt and remained standing out of grab range on the counter if you please what if i dont i said she smiled without humor in that case ill have a dreary day of chores dismembering the body and cleaning up the blood ill leave it up to you i put the package on the counter far be it from me to inconvenience a lady what a dear boy you are she said thats a very nice coat take it off slowly if you please i slipped out of the coat and let it fall to the floor you tricked me onto the boat i said that second phone call was you telling your partner to draw me in the shocking thing is that you fell for it the woman said she kept giving directions and she knew what she was doing i leaned forward and put my hands against the wall while she patted me down she found the pepper spray and took it along with my wallet she made me sit down on the floor on my hands while she took my coat and stepped back a stick she said looking at my blasting rod how very preneolithic of you aha a professional she might be but she was a straight she didnt believe in the supernatural i wasnt sure if that was going to help or hurt it might mean that she would be a little less eager to shoot me people who know what a wizard can do get really nervous if they think the wizard is about to try a spell on the other hand it meant that i didnt have either the support of the rest of the council or the threat of my own retribution to use as leverage i decided it was best to act like a normal for the time being the blonde laid my coat on the counter and said clear the door to the bathroom opened and the woman id heard before came out she now wore a knit fabric dress the color of dark wine and a couple of combs held her hair back from her face she wouldnt stand out in a crowd but she wasnt unattractive hes not gaston she said frowning at me no said the blonde he was here for the merchandise he was just about to leave with it the dark haired woman nodded and asked me who are you dresden i said im a private investigator ms garcia francisca garcias features froze and she traded a look with the gunwielding blond how did you know my name my client told me you and ms valmont could be in a lot of trouble anna valmont kicked the wall and spat bollocks she glared at me gun steady on me despite her outburst are you working with interpol rome anna looked at francisca and said we should scrub this sale its falling apart not yet francisca said theres no point in waiting im not leaving yet the darkhaired woman said her eyes hard not until he gets here he isnt coming anna said you know he isnt who i asked francisca said gaston i didnt say anything evidently francisca could read faces well enough that i didnt have to she stared at me for a moment and then closed her eyes the blood draining from her face oh oh dio how anna said the gun never wavered how did it happen murder i said quietly and someone set it up to point the police at chicago who would have done that some bad people after the shroud killers terrorists not that playful i said as long as you have the shroud your lives are in danger if you come with me i can get you to some people who will protect you francisca shook her head and blinked her eyes a couple of times you mean the police i meant the knights but i knew darn well what their stance would be on what to do with the thieves once any supernatural peril was past yeah anna swallowed and looked at her partner something around her eyes softened with concern with sympathy the two of them werent solely partners in crime they were friends annas voice softened as she said cisca we have to move if this one found us others may not be far behind the dark haired woman nodded her eyes not focused on anything yes ill get ready she rose and stepped across the cabin to the washing machine she drew out a pair of gym bags and put them on the counter over the package then she slipped into some shoes anna watched for a moment and then said to me now we cant have you running to the police to tell them everything i wonder what to do with you mister dresden it really does make a great deal of sense to kill you messy remember youd have that dreary day i pointed out that got a bit of a smile from her ah yes id forgotten she reached into her pocket and drew out a pair of steel handcuffs they were police quality not the naughty fun kind she tossed them to me underhand i caught them put one on your wrist she said i did theres a ring on that bulkhead put the other through it and lock the cuffs i hesitated watching francisca slip into a coat her expression still blank i licked my lips and said you dont know how much danger you two are in ms valmont you really dont please let me help you i think not were professionals mister dresden thieves we might be but we do have a work ethic you didnt see what they did to gaston larouche i said how bad it was when isnt death bad the bulkhead mister dresden but anna lifted the gun i grimaced and lifted the cuffs to a steel ring protruding from the wall beside the stairs as a result i was looking up them to the ships deck when the second denarian in twelve hours came hurtling down the stairway straight toward me chapter thirteen i only saw it coming out of the corner of my eye and i barely had time to register the movement and lunge as far as i could to one side the demon went by me in a blur of rustling metallic whispers carrying the scent of lake water and dried blood neither of the churchmice screamed though whether this was intention or a byproduct of surprise i couldnt tell the demon was more or less human generally speaking and disturbingly female the lines of curvy hips swept down to legs that were oddly hinged backjointed like a lions she had skin of metallic green scales and her arms ended in fourfingered metallicclawed hands like the demon form of ursiel she had two sets of eyes one luminescent green one glowing cherry red and a luminous sigil burned at the center of her forehead her hair was long i mean like fifteen feet long and looked like the demented love child of medusa and doctor octopus it had seemingly been cut in oneinch strips from half a mile of sheet metal it writhed around her like a cloud of living serpents metallic strands thrusting into the walls and the floor of the ship supporting her weight like a dozen additional limbs anna recovered from the surprise first she already had a gun out and ready but she hadnt been trained in how to use it in real combat she pointed the gun more or less at the denarian and emptied it at her in the space of a panicked breath since i was a couple of feet behind the demon i flopped to one side as best i could stayed low and prayed to avoid becoming collateral damage the demon flinched once maybe taking a hit before it shrieked and twisted its shoulders and neck a dozen metallic ribbons of writhing hair lashed across the room one of them hit the gun itself and metal shrieked as the demon tendril slashed clean through the guns barrel half a dozen more whipped toward annas face but the blond thief had reflexes fast enough to get her mostly out of the way a tendril wrapped around annas ankle jerked and sent the woman sprawling to the floor while another lashed across her belly like a scalpel cutting through her jacket and sprinkling the cabin with fine drops of blood francisca stared at the thing for a second her eyes huge and surrounded by white then she jerked open a drawer in the tiny galley pulled out a heavy cutting knife and lunged at the denarian blade flickering it bit into the demons arm and drew a furious shriek that did not sound at all human from her throat the denarian spun silvery blood glistening on her scaly skin and ripped one claw in a sweeping arch the demons claws sliced into franciscas forearm drawing blood the knife tumbled to the ground francisca cried out and reeled back into one of the walls the denarian eyes burning whipped her head in a circle the motion boneless unnerving too many tendrils for me to count lanced across the room and slammed into francisca garcias belly thrusting like knives she let out a choking gasp and stared down at her wounds as several more tendrils thrust through her they made a thunking sound as they hit the wooden wall of the cabin the demon laughed it was a quick breathless excited laugh the kind you expect from a nervous teenage girl her face twisted into a feral smile showing a mouthful of metallicseeming teeth and both sets of eyes glowed brightly francisca whispered oh my gaston then her head bowed dark hair falling about her face in a veil and her body relaxed the demon shivered and the tendrilblades whipped out of her the last foot or so of each soaked in scarlet the tendrils lashed about in a sort of mad excitement and more droplets of blood appeared everywhere francisca slumped down to the floor blood beginning to soak her dress and fell limply onto her side then the denarians two sets of eyes turned to me and a swarm of razoredged tendrils of her hair came whipping toward me i had already begun to ready my shield but when i saw francisca fall a surge of fury went coursing through me filling me from toes to teeth with scarlet rage the shield came together before me in a quarterdome of blazing crimson energy and the writhing tendrils slammed against it in a dozen flashes of white light the denarian shrieked jerking back and the attacking tendrils went sailing back across the cabin with their ends scorched and blackened i looked around wildly for my blasting rod but it wasnt where anna had left it when she took it from me the pepper spray was though i grabbed it and faced the denarian in time to see her raise her clawed hand a shimmer in the air around her fingers threw off a prismatic flash of color and with a flash of light from the upper set of eyes the demoness drove her fist at my shield she hit the shield hard and she was incredibly strong the blow drove me back against a wall and when the heatshimmer of power touched my scarlet shield it fractured into shards of light that went flying around the cabin like the sparks from a campfire i tried to get to one side away from the demons vicious strength but she snarled and strands of hair punched into the hull on either side of me caging me the denarian reached for me with her claws i shouted a panicked battle cry and gave her the pepper spray full in the face right into both sets of eyes the demoness screamed again twisting her face away ruining the tendrilcage the human eyes squeezing shut over a sudden flood of tears the glowing demoneyes did not even blink and a sweep of the denarians arm fetched me a backhanded blow that sent me sprawling and made me see stars i got back to my feet terrified at the notion of being caught helpless on the ground the denarian seemed able to blow off my magic with a bit of effort and she was deadly in these confined quarters i didnt think i could get up the stairs without her tearing me apart which meant i had to find another way to get the demon away the denarian swiped a clawed hand at her eyes and snarled in mangled throaty english you will pay for that i looked up to see that anna had dragged herself across the floor to the fallen francisca and knelt over her shielding the other woman from the denarian with her body her face was white with pain or shock or bothbut she shot me a glance and then jerked her head toward the far side of the cabin i followed her gaze and got her drift as the denarian recovered and blinked watery murderous eyes at me i lunged toward the far side of the room and shouted get it out of the fridge they must not have it the denarian spat out what i took to be an oath and i felt that lionlike foot land in the middle of my back flattening me to the floor claws digging into my skin she stepped over me past me and her tendrils tore open the real fridge taking the door from its hinges before slithering inside and knocking everything within to the floor she hadnt quite finished with the first fridge before her hair had gone on to tear open the dummy fridge and dragged out the steel strongbox while the denarian did that i looked wildly around the cabin and spotted my blasting rod on the floor i rolled my back burning with pain and grabbed the blasting rod calling up fire within the tiny cabin was a bad ideabut waiting around for the denarian to murder me with her hairdo was even worse she stood up with the strongbox just as i began channeling energy into the blasting rod its carved runes began to burn with golden radiance and the tip of the rod suddenly gleamed with red light and wavered with hotair shimmer the denarian crouched demonic limbs too long feminine shape disturbingly attractive red light gleaming on her metallicgreen scales her hair writhed in a hissing mass striking sparks as one edge rasped against another violent lust burned in both sets of eyes for a second and then she turned away her hair tore the cabins ceiling apart like papiermвchй and using her hair an arm and one long leg she swarmed out of the ships cabin i heard a splash as she hit the water taking the strongbox with her what was that stammered anna valmont clutching franciscas limp form to her what the bloody hell was that i didnt drop the blasting rod or look away from the hole in the roof because i didnt think the denarian was the sort to leave a lot of people alive behind her the end of the blasting rod was wavering drunkenly how is she i watched the hole in the ceiling for several shaking breaths until anna said her voice barely audible shes gone a stabbing feeling went through my belly sharp and hot maybe im some kind of neanderthal for thinking so but it hurt me a minute ago francisca garcia had been talking planning grieving breathing living shed been killed by violence and i couldnt stand the thought of things like that happening to a woman it wouldnt have been any less wrong had it happened to a man but in my gut it wasnt the same dammit i whispered how are you can you walk before she could answer the ship lurched and leaned to one side there was a wrenching snapping roar and the rushing sound of water icy cold ran over my ankles and began to rise the hulls breached anna said were taking on water i headed for the stairway blasting rod up to make sure it was clear can you get out light exploded behind my eyes and i dropped to my hands and knees at the bottom of the stairway anna had slugged me with something a second burst of light and pain drove my head far enough down to splash some cold water against my forehead i dimly saw annas foot kick my blasting rod away from me then she picked up the shroud in its package from the counter and tore off the top sheet of the hotel memo pad i saw that she had blood on her jacket soaked through and staining her fatigue pants down to the top of her left leg she grabbed my coat wincing and one of the duffel bags she put my leather duster on covering the blood the water had filled the cabin almost to the tops of her combat boots i tried to get my wits together but something was keeping me from doing much besides focusing my eyes i knew that i needed to leave but i couldnt get the message from my head to my arms and legs anna valmont stepped past me and went up the stairs she stopped about halfway up spat out another curse and came back down them enough to reach down and splash cold water into my face the shock jumpstarted something in my body and i coughed my head spinning and started to move again id been too drunk to stand up a time or two but even then id been more capable than i was at that moment the blond thief grabbed my arm and half hauled me up a couple of stairs her face twisted in pain i desperately held on to that momentum struggling up another stair even after she stopped pulling she kept going up the stairs and didnt look back as she said im only doing this because i like your coat dresden dont come near me again then she padded up out of the cabin and disappeared with the shroud my head had started to throb and swell but it was clearing rapidly also but evidently i wasnt all that bright even when fully conscious because i staggered back down into the ships cabin francisca garcias corpse had fallen onto its side glassy eyes staring mouth slightly open one of her cheeks had been halfcovered by water there were still the tracks of tears on the other one the water around her was a cloudy brownish pink my stomach heaved and the anger that came with it nearly sent me to the floor again instead i sloshed through the freezing water to the counter i picked up the cell phone there and the blank memo pad i hesitated over francisca she didnt deserve to have her body swallowed by the lake like a discarded beer bottle my balance wobbled again the water had begun to rise more quickly it covered my shins already and i couldnt feel my feet for the cold i tried to lift her body but the effort brought a surge of pain to my head and i almost threw up i settled the body back down unable to even curse coherently and made do with gently closing her eyes with one hand it was all i could do for her the police would find her of course probably within a few hours and if i didnt get moving theyd find me too i couldnt afford to spend a night in the pokey while i was interrogated charged and awaiting bail but what else was new id get in touch with murphy as soon as i could i folded my arms against the growing cold hugging the memo pad and cell phone to my chest and slogged out of the bloody water of the etrangers cabin and onto the deck i had to make a short jump up to the dock a couple of people were on the sidewalk above the little harbor staring down and i saw a couple of folks out on the decks of their ships also staring i ducked my head thought inconspicuous thoughts and hurried away before my morning could get any worse chapter fourteen ive been clouted in the head a few times in my day the bump anna valmont had given me was smaller than some but my head pounded all the way home at least my stomach settled down before i started throwing up all over myself i shambled in washed down a couple of tylenol with a can of coke and folded some ice into a towel i sat down by the phone put the ice pack against the back of my head and called father vincent the phone rang once yes its in town i said the two churchmice had it on a boat in burnham harbor vincents voice gained an edge of tension you have it uh i said not strictly speaking no something went wrong what happened he demanded his voice growing more frustrated angrier why didnt you call me a third party made a grab for it and what do you think im doing right now i had a shot to recover the thing i took it i missed and the shroud was taken from the thieves thief singular chicago pd is probably recovering the body of her partner right now they turned on each other not even a new player killed garcia valmont duped the third party into taking a decoy then she grabbed the real mccoy and ran and you didnt see fit to follow her my head pounded steadily she ran really fast vincent was silent for a moment before he said so the shroud is lost to us once more for now i said i might have another lead you know where it has gone i took in a deep breath and tried to sound patient not yet thats why its called a lead and not a solution i need that sample of the shroud to be frank mister dresden i did bring a few threads with me from the vatican but great get one of them to my office and drop it off with security downstairs theyll hold it for me until i can pick it up ill call you as soon as i have anything more definite but i hung up on vincent and felt a twinge of vindictive satisfaction you didnt see fit to follow her i muttered to mister doing my best to imitate vincents accent i gotcher didnt see fit to follow her whitecollar jerk how about i ring your bell a few times and then you can go say mass or something mister gave me a look as if to say that i shouldnt say such things about paying clients i glared at him to let him know that i was well aware of it got up went into my bedroom and rummaged in my closet until i found a stick of charcoal and a clipboard then i lit several candles on the end table next to my big comfy chair and settled down with the memo pad id taken from the etranger i brushed the stick of charcoal over it as carefully as i could and hoped that francisca garcia hadnt been using a felt tip she hadnt faint white letters began to appear amidst the charcoal on the paper it read marriott on the first line and on the second i frowned down at the pad marriott one of the hotels it could have been someones last name too or maybe some kind of french word no dont make it more complicated than it has to be harry it probably meant the hotel the number appeared to be military time for a quarter to midnight maybe even a room number i glared at the note it didnt tell me enough even though i may have had the time and place i didnt know where and when i looked at the cell phone id taken i knew as much about cell phones as i did about gastrointestinal surgery there were no markings on the case not even a brand name the phone was off but i didnt dare turn it on it would probably stop working hell it would probably explode i would need to ask murphy to see what she could find out when i talked to her my head kept pounding and my eyes itched with weariness i needed rest the lack of sleep was making me sloppy i shouldnt have chanced going onto the ship in the first place and i should have been more careful about watching my back id had a gut instinct someone was watching me but i had been too tired too impatient and id nearly gotten myself shot impaled concussed and drowned as a result i headed into the bedroom set my alarm clock for a couple hours after noon and flopped down on my bed it felt obscenely good naturally it didnt last the phone rang and i gave serious thought to blasting it into orbit where it could hang around with asteroid dresden i stomped back into the living room picked up the phone and snarled what oh uh said a somewhat nervous voice on the other end this is waldo butters i was calling to speak to harry dresden i moderated my voice to a mere snarl oh hey i woke you up huh some yeah late nights suck look theres something odd going on and i thought maybe i could ask you something sure sullen monosyllabism a sure sign of sleep deprivation eh now descending into formless vocalization my time is short butters cleared his throat and said the germs are gone germs i asked in the samples i took from that body i ran all the checks again just to be sure and better than half of them turned up negative nothing zip zero ungh i said okay then caveman og where germs go sunrise i said poof butters voice sounded bewildered vampire germs the tiny capes are a dead giveaway i said i started pulling my train of thought into motion at last not vampire germs constructs see at sunrise its like the whole magical world gets reset to zero new beginnings most spells dont hold together through even one sunrise and it takes a lot to make them last through two or three magic germs butters asked are you telling me ive got magic germs magic germs i confirmed someone called them up with magic like an actual magic spell usually you call nasty hurtful spells a curse but by tomorrow or the next day those other samples will probably have zeroed out too are they still infectious assume they are theyre good as real until the energy that holds them together falls apart christ youre serious its for real well yeah is there a book or a cliffs notes or something on this stuff i actually smiled that time just me anything else not much i swept the body for genetic remains but got nothing the cuts on the corpse were made with either a surgical scalpel or some other kind of small fine blade maybe a utility knife ive seen cuts like that before yeah heres the best part the same blade evidently took off the hands and head the cuts are cleaner than a surgeon could manage on an operating table three single cuts the heat from it half cauterized parts of the wounds so what kind of tool can cut fine precise lines and cleave through bones too sword have to be one hell of a sharp sword theres a few around like that any luck identifying the victim none sorry s okay you want to know if anything changes yeah or if you see anyone else come in like that guy god forbid will do you find anything on that tattoo called the eye of thoth i said trying to narrow down exactly who uses it around here oh give murphy a call let her know about those samples already did shes the one who told me to keep you in the loop i think she was heading toward sleep too would she want me to wake her up to talk to you i talked through a yawn nah it can wait thanks for the call butters no trouble he said sleep is god go worship i grunted hung up the phone and didnt get to take the second step toward my bed when someone knocked at the door i need one of those trapdoors i muttered to mister i could push a button and people would fall screaming down a wacky slide thing and land in mud somewhere mister was far too mature to dignify that with a response so i kept a hand near my gift rack as i opened the door a crack and peeked out susan tilted her head sideways and gave me a small smile she was wearing jeans an old tee a heavy grey fleece jacket and sunglasses hi she said hi you know its hard to tell through the door but your eyes look sunken and bloodshot did you sleep last night what is this thing you speak of sleep susan sighed and shook her head mind if i come in i stepped back and opened the door wider no scolding susan came in and folded her arms always so cold in here in the winter i had a couple suggestions on how to warm up but i didnt say them out loud maybe i didnt want to see her response to them i thought about what murphy had said about setting up a talk i got some more wood and stirred up the fireplace want me to make some tea or something she shook her head no susan never turned down a cup of hot tea i tried but i couldnt keep a hard edge out of my voice just going to dump me and run then driveby dumping harry that isnt fair susan said i could hear the hurt in her voice but only barely i raked harder at the fire making sparks fly up though flames were already licking the new wood this isnt easy for anyone my mouth kept running without checking in with my brain my heart maybe but not my brain i shot her a look over my shoulder and said except for captain mediocrity i guess she raised both eyebrows do you mean martin isnt that what this is about a spark flipped out of the fire and landed on my hand stinging i yelped and pulled my hand away i closed the heavy mesh curtain over the fire and put the poker away and before you say anything i know damn well im being insane and possessive i know that we were quits before you left town its been more than a year and its been hard on you its only natural for you to find someone its irrational and childish for me to be upset and i dont care harry she began and its not as if you havent been thinking about it i continued somewhere i knew that id start choking on my foot if i kept shoving it in my mouth you kissed me you kissed me susan i know you you meant it this isnt ill bet you dont kiss snoozy martin like that susan rolled her eyes and walked to me she sat down on the lintel of my little fireplace while i knelt before it she cupped my cheek in one hand she was warm it felt good i was too tired to control my reaction to the simple gentle touch and i looked back at the fire harry she said youre right i dont kiss martin like that i pulled my cheek away but she put her fingers on my chin and tugged my face back toward her i dont kiss him at all im not involved with martin i blinked youre not she drew an invisible x over her heart with her index finger oh i said i felt my shoulders ease up a little susan laughed was that really worrying you harry that i was leaving you for another man i dont know i guess god you are a dolt sometimes she smiled at me but i could see the sadness in it it always shocked me how you could understand so many things and be such a complete idiot about so many others practice i said she looked down at me for a while with that same sad smile and i understood it doesnt change anything does it martin yeah she nodded it doesnt change anything i swallowed a sudden frog in my throat you want it to be over i dont want it she said quickly but i think its necessary for both of us you came back here to tell me that susan shook her head i dont have my mind set i think it wouldnt be fair to do that without talking to you about it we both have to make this decision i growled and looked back at the fire would be a lot simpler if you just gave me the dear john speech and left simpler she said easier but not fair and not right i didnt say anything ive changed susan said not just the vampire thing theres a lot thats been happening in my life a lot of things that i didnt know like what how dangerous the world is for one she said i wound up in peru but i went all over south america central america i couldnt have imagined what things are like there harry the red court is everywhere there are whole villages out in the country supporting groups of them like cattle bred for the lord of the manor the vampires feed on everyone addict them all her voice hardened even the children my stomach twitched unpleasantly i hadnt ever heard that not many know i mopped a hand over my face god kids i want to help to do something ive found where i can help down there harry a job im going to take it something in my chest hurt a literal pain i thought this was our decision im coming to that she said i nodded okay she slipped to the floor next to me and said you could come with me go with her leave chicago leave murphy the alphas michael leave a horde of problemsmany of them ones id created for myself i thought of packing up and heading out maybe fighting the good fight being loved again held again god i wanted that but people would get hurt friends others who might be in my kind of danger and have no one to turn to i looked into susans eyes and saw hope there for just a moment then understanding she smiled but it was somehow sadder than ever susan i said she pressed a finger to my lips and blinked back tears i know and then i understood she knew because she was feeling the same way there are things you cant walk away from not if you want to live with yourself afterward now do you understand she asked i nodded but my voice came out rough wouldnt be fair not to either of us i said not being together both of us hurting susan leaned her shoulder against mine and nodded i put my arm around her maybe someday things will change i said maybe someday she agreed i love you i never stopped loving you harry yeah i said i choked on the end of the word and the fire went blurry i love you too dammit we sat there and warmed up in front of the fire for a couple of minutes before i said when are you leaving tomorrow she said with martin she nodded hes a coworker hes helping me move watching my back i have to put everything in order here pack some things from the apartment what kind of work pretty much the same kind investigate and report only i report to a boss instead of to readers she sighed and said im not supposed to tell you anything else about it hells bells i muttered will i be able to reach you she nodded ill set up a drop you can write id like that yeah stay in touch long minutes after that susan said youre on a case again arent you does it show she leaned a little away from me and i drew my arm back i smelled it she said and stood up to add wood to the fire theres blood on you yeah i said a woman was killed about five feet away from me vampires susan asked i shook my head some kind of demon are you okay peachy thats funny because you look like hell susan said i said no scolding she almost smiled youd be smart to get some sleep true but im not all that bright i said besides i didnt have a prayer of falling asleep now after talking to her ah she said is there anything i can do to help dont think so you need rest i waved a hand at the stationery pad i will i just have to run down a lead first susan folded her arms facing me directly so do it after you get some rest there probably isnt time susan frowned and picked up the pad marriott the hotel dunno likely what are you looking for i sighed too tired to stick to my confidentiality guns very closely stolen artifact i think the note is probably about a site for the sale who is the buyer i shrugged lots of legwork then yeah susan nodded let me look into this you get some sleep its probably better if you dont she waved a hand cutting me off i want to help let me do this for you i opened my mouth and closed it again i guess i could relate i knew how much id wanted to help her i couldnt it had been tough to handle it would have been a relief to me to have done her some good no matter how small it was all right i said but just the phone work okay okay she copied down the word and the number on a sheet she tore from the bottom of the memo pad and turned toward the door susan i said she paused without turning to look back at me do you want to get dinner or something before you go i mean i want to uh you know say goodbye she said quietly yeah all right she left i sat in my apartment in front of the fire and breathed in the scent of her perfume i felt cold lonely and tired i felt like a hollowedout husk i felt as if i had failed her failed to protect her to begin with failed to cure her after the vampires had changed her change maybe thats what this was really about susan had changed shed grown she was more relaxed than i remembered more confident there had always been a sense of purpose to her but now it seemed deeper somehow shed found a place for herself somewhere where she felt she could do some good maybe i should have gone with her after all but no part of the change was that she felt hungrier now too more quietly sensual as if every sight and sound and touch in the room was occupying most of her attention shed smelled drops of blood on my clothing and it had excited her enough to make her move away from me another change she had an instinctive hunger for my blood and she could throw vampires twenty feet through the air she sure as hell wouldnt have any trouble tearing my throat out in an intimate moment if her control slipped i washed my face mechanically showered in my unheated shower and went shivering to my bed the routine hadnt helped me it only delayed me from facing the harshest truth of my relationship with susan she had left chicago probably for good that was going to hurt like hell in the morning chapter fifteen i had bad dreams they were the usual fare flames devoured someone who screamed my name a pretty girl spread her arms eyes closed and fell slowly backward as dozens of fine cuts opened all over her skin the air became a fine pink spray i turned from it into a kiss with susan who drew me down and tore out my throat with her teeth a woman who seemed familiar but whom i did not recognize shook her head and drew her hand from left to right the dreamscenery faded to black in the wake of her motion she turned to me dark eyes intent and said you need to rest mickey mouse woke me up my alarm jangling noisily his little hand on two and the big hand on twelve i wanted to smack the clock for waking me up but i reined in the impulse im not against a little creative violence now and then but you have to draw the line somewhere i wouldnt sleep in the same room with a person who would smack mickey mouse i got up got dressed left a message for murphy another for michael fed mister and hit the road michaels house did not blend in with most of the other homes in his neighborhood west of wrigley field it had a white picket fence it had elegant window dressings it had a tidy front lawn that was always green even in the midst of a blazing chicago summer it had a few shady trees a lot of wellkept shrubberies and if i had found a couple of deer grazing on the lawn or drinking from the birdbath it wouldnt have surprised me i got out of the beetle holding my blasting rod loosely in my right hand i opened the gate and a few jingle bells hanging on a string tinkled happily the gate swung shut on a lazy spring behind me i knocked on the front door and waited but no one answered i frowned michaels house had never been empty before charity had at least a couple kids who werent old enough to be in school yet including the poor little guy theyd named after me harry carpenter how cruel is that i frowned at the cloudhazed sun werent the older kids getting out of school shortly charity had some kind of maternal obsession with never allowing her kids to come home to an empty house someone should have been there i got a sick twisty feeling in the pit of my stomach i knocked again put my ear against the door and listened i could hear the slow tick of the old grandfather clock in the front room the heater cycled on for a moment and the vents inside whispered there were a few sounds when a bit of breeze touched the house the creaks of old and comfortable wood nothing else i tried the front door it was locked i stepped back off the porch and followed the narrow driveway to the back of the property if the front of the carpenter home would have qualified for better homes and gardens the back would have been fit for a craftsman commercial the large tree centered on the back lawn cast lots of shade in the summer but with the leaves gone i could see the fortresslike tree house michael had built for his kids in it it had finished walls an actual window and guardrails anywhere anyone could possibly have thought about falling the tree house had a porch that overlooked the yard hell i didnt have a porch its an unfair world a big section of the yard had been bitten off by an addition connected to the back of the house the foundation had been laid and there were wooden beams framing what would eventually be walls heavy contractors plastic had been stapled to the wooden studs to keep the wind off the addition the separate garage was closed and a peek in the window showed me that it was pretty well filled with lumber and other construction materials no cars i muttered maybe they went to mcdonalds or church do they have church at three in the afternoon i turned around to go back to the beetle id leave a michael a note my stomach fluttered if i didnt get a second for the duel it was likely to be a bad evening maybe i should ask bob to be my second or maybe mister no one dares to mess with mister something rattled against the metal gutters running the length of the back of the house i jumped like a spooked horse and scrambled away from the house toward the garage at the back of the yard so that i could get a look at the roof given that in the past day or so no less than three different parties had taken a poke at me i felt totally justified in being on edge i got to the back of the yard but couldnt see the whole roof from there so i clambered up into the branches then took a sixfoot ladder up to the main platform of the tree house from there i could see that the roof was empty i heard brisk somewhat heavy footsteps below me and beyond the fence at the back of the little yard i froze in place in the tree house listening the heavy footsteps padded up to the fence at the back of the yard and i heard the scrape of chain link dragging against dry leaves and other latewinter detritus i heard a muted grunt of effort and a long exhalation then the footsteps came to the base of the tree leather scraped against a wooden step and the tree shivered almost imperceptibly someone was climbing up i looked around me but the ladder was the only way down unless i felt like jumping it couldnt have been more than nine or ten feet down odds were i could land more or less in one piece but if i misjudged the jump i could sprain an ankle or break a leg which would make running away both impractical and embarrassing jumping would have to be a last resort i gathered in my will and settled my grip on my blasting rod pointing it directly at where the ladder met the platform the tip of the blasting rod glowed with a pinpoint of bright red energy blond hair and the top half of a girls angelic young face appeared at the top of the ladder there was a quiet gasp and her blue eyes widened holy crap i jerked the tip of the blasting rod up and away from the girl releasing the gathered energy molly the rest of the girls face appeared as she climbed on up the ladder wow is that an acetylene torch or something i blinked and peered more closely at molly is that an earring in your eyebrow the girl clapped her fingers over her right eyebrow and your nose molly shot a furtive look over her shoulder at the house and scrambled the rest of the way up to the tree house as tall as her mother molly was all coltish legs and long arms she wore a typical privateschool uniform of skirt blouse and sweaterbut it looked like shed been attacked by a lech with razor blades where fingers should have been the skirt was essentially slashed to ribbons and underneath it she wore black tights also torn to nigh indecency her shirt and sweater had apparently endured the blitz but the bright red satin bra that peeked out from beneath looked new she had on too much makeup not as bad as most kids too old to play tag but too young to drive but it was there she wore a ring of fine gold wire through one pale gold eyebrow and a golden stud protruded from one side of her nose i worked hard not to smile smiling would have implied that i found her outfit amusing she was young enough to be hurt by that kind of opinion and i had a vague memory of being that ridiculous at one time let he who hath never worn parachute pants cast the first stone molly clambered in and tossed a bulging backpack down on the wooden floor you lurk in tree houses a lot mister dresden im looking for your dad molly wrinkled up her nose then started removing the stud from it i didnt want to watch i dont want to tell you how to investigate stuff but generally speaking you wont find him in tree houses i came over but no one answered the door when i knocked is that normal molly took out the eyebrow ring dumped the backpack out onto the floorboards and started sorting out a long skirt with a floral print a tshirt and a sweater it is on errands day mom loads up the sandcrawler with all the little snotnosed jawas and goes all over town oh do you know when shes due back anytime molly said she hopped into the skirt and wriggled out of the tattered skirt and tights in that mystifyingly modest way that girls always seem to manage to acquire sometime in their teens the shirt and pink sweater went on next and the ripped up sweater and to my discomfort the bright red bra came out from under the conservative clothes and got tucked back into the backpack i turned my back on the girl as well as i could in the limited space the link of handcuff anna valmont had slapped onto my wrist chafed and pinched i scratched at it irritably youd think id been cuffed enough times that i should have gotten myself a key by now molly took a wetwipe from somewhere and started peeling the makeup from her face hey she asked a minute later whats wrong i grunted and waved my wrist vaguely swinging the cuff around hey neat molly said are you on the lam is that why youre hiding in a tree house so the cops wont find you no i said its kind of a long story ohhhh molly said wisely those are funtime handcuffs not badtime handcuffs i gotcha no i protested and how the hell would you know about funtime handcuffs anyway youre like ten she snorted fourteen whatever too young internet she said sagely expanding the frontiers of adolescent knowledge god im old molly clucked and dipped into the backpack again she grabbed my wrist firmly shook out a ring of small keys and started trying them in the lock of the cuffs so give me the juicy details she said you can say bleep instead of the fun words if you want i blinked where the bleep did you get a bunch of cuff keys she looked up at me and narrowed her eyes think about this one do you really want to know i sighed no probably not cool she said and turned her attention back to the handcuffs so stop dodging the issue whats up with you and susan why do you want to know i like romance plus i heard mom say that you two were a pretty hot item your mom said that molly shrugged sorta as much as she ever would she used words like fornication and sin and infantile depravity and moral bankruptcy so are you morally bankrupt a hot item with susan i shrugged and said not anymore dont move your wrist molly fiddled with one key for a moment before discarding it what happened a lot i said its complicated oh molly said the cuffs clicked and loosened and she beamed up at me there thanks i rubbed my sore wrist and put the cuffs in my coat pocket molly bent over and picked up a piece of paper she read it and said ask michael about duel whiskey and tobacco its a shopping list molly frowned oh she was quiet for a moment and then asked so was it the vampire thing i blinked at the girl again was there a pbs special or something is there some kind of unauthorized biography of my life i snuck downstairs so i could listen to dad tell mom what had happened do you eavesdrop on every private conversation you can she rolled her eyes and sat down on the edge of the platform her shoes waving in the air no one says anything interesting in a public conversation do they why did you guys split up i sat down next to her like i said it was complicated complicated how i shrugged her condition gives her an impulsecontrol problem i said she told me that strong emotions and uh other feelings are dangerous for her she could lose control and hurt someone oh molly said and scrunched up her nose again so you cant make a play for her or bad things could happen and then shed be a full vampire but you both want to be together molly asked yeah she frowned god thats sad you want to be with her but the sex part i shuddered ewg you are far too young to say that word the girls eyes shone what word sex i put my hands over my ears gah molly grinned and enunciated but the bleep part would make her lose control i coughed uncomfortably lowering my hands basically yeah why dont you tie her up i stared at the kid for a second she lifted her eyebrows expectantly what i stammered its only practical molly stated firmly and hey youve already got the handcuffs if she cant move while the two of you are bleeping she cant drink your blood right i stood up and started climbing down the ladder this conversation has become way too bleeping disturbing molly laughed at me and followed me back to the ground she unlocked the back door with another key presumably from the same ring and that was when charitys light blue minivan turned into the driveway molly opened the door darted into the house and returned without her backpack the minivan ground to a halt and the engine died charity got out of the van frowning at me and at molly in more or less equal proportions she wore jeans hiking boots and a heavy jacket she was a tall woman only an inch or so under six feet and carried herself with an assurance that conveyed a sense of ready strength her face had the remote beauty of a marble statue and her long blond hair was knotted behind her head without being told molly went to the rolling side panel door opened it and reached inside unloading children from safety seats while charity went to the rear of the van and opened the rear doors mister dresden she said lend a hand i frowned uh im sort of in a hurry i was hoping to find michael here charity took a twentyfourpack of coke from the van in one arm and a couple of bulging paper grocery sacks in the other she marched over to me and shoved them at my chest i had to fumble to catch them and my blasting rod clattered to the ground charity waited until i had the sacks before heading for the van again put them on the table in the kitchen but i said she walked past me toward the house i have ice cream melting meat thawing and a baby about to wake up hungry put them on the table and well talk i sighed and looked glumly at the groceries they were heavy enough to make my arms burn a little which probably isnt saying much i dont spend much time working out molly appeared from the van lowering a tiny towheaded girl to the driveway she was wearing a pink dress with a clashing orange sweater and bright purple shoes and a red coat she walked up to me and said words edged with babyish syllables my name is amanda im five and a half and my daddy says im a princess im harry your highness i said she frowned and said theres already a harry you can be bill with that she broke into a flouncing skip and followed her mother into the house well im glad thats settled i muttered molly lowered an even smaller blond girl to the driveway this one was dressed in blue overalls with a pink shirt and a pink coat she held a plush dolly in one arm and a batteredlooking pink blanket in the other upon seeing me she retreated a couple of steps and hid around the corner of the van she leaned out to look at me once and then hid again ive got him said an accented male voice molly hopped out of the van grabbed a grocery bag from the back and said come on hope the little girl followed her big sister like a duckling while molly went into the house but hope glanced back at me shyly three or four times on the way shiro emerged from the van carrying a baby seat the little old knight carried the walking stick that concealed his sword on a strap over one wide shoulder and his scarred hands held the chair carefully a boy probably not yet two years old slept in it little harry i asked yes bill shiro said his eyes sparkled behind his glasses i frowned and said goodlooking kid dresden snapped charitys voice from the house youre holding the ice cream i scowled and told shiro guess wed better get in shiro nodded wisely i took the groceries into the carpenters big kitchen and put them on the table for the next five minutes shiro and molly helped me carry in enough groceries to feed a mongol horde after all the perishables got put away charity fixed a bottle of formula and passed it off to molly who took it the diaper bag and the sleeping boy into another room charity waited until she had left then shut the door very well she said still putting groceries away i havent spoken to michael since you called this morning i left a message with his cell phone voice mail where is he i asked shiro laid his cane on the table and sat down mister dresden we have asked you not to get involved in this business that isnt why im here i said i just need to talk to him why are you looking for him shiro asked im dueling a vampire under the accords i need a second before sundown or i get disqualified permanently shiro frowned red court yeah some guy named ortega heard of him shiro said some kind of war leader i nodded thats the rumor thats why im here i had hoped michael would be willing to help shiro stroked a thumb over the smooth old wood of his cane we received word of denarian activity near st louis he and sanya went to investigate when will they get back shiro shook his head i do not know i looked at the clock and bit my lip christ charity walked by with an armload of groceries and glared at me i lifted my hands sorry im a little tense shiro studied me for a moment and then asked would michael help him charitys voice drifted out of the cavernous walkin pantry my husband is sometimes an idiot shiro nodded and said then i will assist you in his stead mister dresden youll what i asked i will be your second in the duel you dont have to do that i said i mean ill figure out something shiro lifted an eyebrow have the weapons been set for the duel uh not yet i said then where is the meeting with the emissary and your opponents second i fished out the card id gotten from the archive i dont know i was told to have my second call this number shiro took the card and rose without another word heading for the phone in the next room i put my hand on his arm and said you dont need to take any chances you dont really know me michael does that is enough for me the old knights support was a relief but i felt guilty somehow for accepting it too many people had been hurt on my behalf in the past michael and i had faced trouble together before looked out for each other before somehow it made it easier for me to go to him and ask for help accepting the same thing from a stranger knight of the cross or not grated on my conscience or maybe on my pride but what choice did i have i sighed and nodded i just dont want to drag someone else into more trouble with me charity muttered let me think where have i heard that before shiro smiled at her the expression both paternal and amused and said ill make the call i waited while shiro made a call from the room that served as the family study and the office for michaels contracting business charity stayed in the kitchen and wrestled a huge crockpot onto the counter she got out a ton of vegetables stew meat and a spice rack and set to chopping things up without a word to me i watched her quietly she moved with the kind of precision you see only in someone who is so versed at what they are doing that they are already thinking of the steps coming twenty minutes in the future i thought she took her knife to the carrots a little more violently than she needed to she started preparing another meal somewhere in the middle of making the stew this one chicken and rice and other healthy things i rarely saw in three dimensions i fidgeted for a bit until i stood up washed my hands in the sink and started cutting vegetables charity frowned at me for a moment she didnt say anything but she got a few more veggies out and put them down next to me then collected what had been cut so far and pitched them into the crockpot a couple of minutes later she sighed opened a can of coke and put it on the counter next to me i worry about him she said i nodded and focused on cucumbers i dont even know when hell be home tonight good thing you have a crockpot i said i dont know what i would do without him what the children would do id feel so lost what the hell an ounce of wellintentioned but irrational reassurance didnt cost anything i took a sip of the coke hell be all right he can handle himself and he has shiro and sanya with him hes been hurt three times you know three i asked three with you every time so its my fault my turn to chop vegetables like teenagers in a slasher movie i see i couldnt see her face but her voice was more than anything else tired it isnt about blame or whose fault it is all that matters is that when youre around my husband my childrens father gets hurt the knife slipped and i cut off a neat little slice of skin on my index finger ow i snarled i slapped the cold water on in the sink and put my finger under it you cant tell with cuts like that how bad theyre going to be until you see how much youre leaking charity passed me a paper towel and i examined the cut for a minute before wrapping the towel around it it wasnt bad though it hurt like hell i watched my blood stain the paper towel for a minute and then i asked why didnt you get rid of me then i looked up to see charity frowning at me there were dark circles under her eyes that i hadnt noticed before what do you mean just now i said when shiro asked you if michael would help me you could have said no but he would have helped you in an instant you know that shiro didnt her expression became confused i dont understand you could have lied her face registered comprehension and some fire came back into her eyes i dont like you mister dresden i certainly dont care enough for you to abandon beliefs i hold dear to use you as an excuse to cheapen myself or to betray what my husband stands for she stepped to a cabinet and got out a small neat medical kit without another word she took my hand and the paper towel and opened the kit so youre taking care of me i asked i dont expect you to understand whether or not i can personally stand you it has no bearing on what choices i make michael is your friend he would risk his life for you it would break his heart if you came to grief and i will not allow that to happen she fell silent and doctored the cut with the same brisk confident motions shed used for cooking i hear that they make disinfectants that dont hurt these days but charity used iodine chapter sixteen shiro came out of the office and showed me an address written on a piece of paper we meet them tonight at eight after sundown i noted i know the place ill pick you up here yes i will need a little time to prepare me too around seven i told them goodbye and headed for the door charity didnt answer me but shiro did i got into my car more kids came pelting into the house as i did two boys and a girl the smaller of the two boys stopped to peer at my car but charity appeared in the door and chivvied him inside she frowned at me until i coaxed the blue beetle to life and pulled out driving home left me with too much time to think this duel with ortega was something i had no way to prepare for ortega was a warlord of the red court hed probably fought duels before which meant that hed killed people before hell maybe even wizards id squared off against various toughs but that had been freeforall fighting i had been able to find ways to cheat by and large in a oneonone duel i wasnt going to be able to fall back on cleverness to take advantage of whatever i could find in my environment this was going to be a straight fight and if ortega was better than me hed kill me simple as that the fear was simple too simple and undeniable i swallowed and my knuckles turned white i tried to relax my fingers but they wouldnt they were too afraid to let go of the wheel stupid fingers i got back to my apartment pried my fingers off the steering wheel and found my door halfway open i ducked to one side in case someone had a gun pointed up the narrow stairway down to my apartment door and drew out my blasting rod harry called a quiet female voice from my apartment harry is that you i lowered the blasting rod murph get inside murphy said i looked down the stairway and saw her appear in the doorway her face pale hurry i came down the stairs warily feeling out my wards as i did they were intact and i relaxed a little i had given murphy a personalized talisman that would let her through my defenses and it would only have worked for her i slipped into my apartment murphy shut the door behind me and locked it shed started a fire in the fireplace and had one of my old kerosene lamps lit i went to the fireplace and warmed up my hands watching murphy in silence she stood with her back and shoulders rigid for a moment before she came over to stand beside me facing the fire her lips were held into a tense neutral line we should talk people keep saying that to me i muttered you promised me youd call me in when you had something whoa there hang on who said i had anything there is a corpse on a pleasure ship in burnham harbor and several eyewitnesses who describe a tall darkhaired man leaving the scene and getting into a multicolored volkswagen beetle wait a second theres been a murder dresden i dont care how sacred client confidentiality is to you people are dying frustration made me clench my teeth i was going to tell you about it its been a really busy day too busy to talk to the police about a murder you may have witnessed murphy said that is considered aiding and abetting a firstdegree murder in some places like courts of law this again i muttered my fingers clenched into fists i remember how this one goes you slug me in the jaw and arrest me i damn well should hells bells murph relax she sighed if that was what i had in mind youd be in the car already my anger evaporated oh after a moment i asked then why are you here murphy scowled im on vacation youre what murphys jaw twitched her words sounded a little odd since she kept her teeth ground together while she talked ive been taken off the case and when i protested i was told that i could either be on vacation or collecting unemployment holy crap the mucketymucks at cpd had ordered murphy off a case but why murphy answered the question i hadnt asked yet because when butters looked at the victim from the harbor he determined that the weapon used to kill her and the one used on that victim you saw last night were the same i blinked what same weapon murphy said butters seemed pretty confident about it i turned that over in my head a few times trying to shake out the kinks in the chains of logic i need a beer you yeah i went over to the pantry and grabbed a couple of brown bottles i used an old bottle opener to take off the lids and took the drinks back to murphy she took her bottle in hand and eyed it suspiciously its warm its the new recipe mac would kill me if he heard i served his brown cold i took a pull from my bottle the ale had a rich full flavor a little nutty and it left a pleasant aftertaste lingering in the mouth make what jokes you will about trendy microbrews mac knew his stuff murphy made a face ugh too much taste wimpy american i said murphy almost smiled homicide got wind that there was a link between the killing in italy the one here by the airport and the one this morning so they pulled strings and hogged the whole thing how did they find out rudolph murphy spat theres no way to prove anything but ill bet you the little weasel heard me on the phone with butters and ran straight over there to tell them isnt there anything you can do officially yes but in real life people are going to start accidentally losing reports and forms and requests if i try to file them and when i tried to apply some pressure of my own i got put down hard she took another angry drink i could lose my job that both sucks and blows murph tell me about it she frowned and looked up at my eyes briefly harry i want you to back off on this case for your own sake thats why i came over here i frowned wait a minute you mean people are threatening you with me thats a switch dont joke about it murphy said harry youve got a history with the department and not everyone thinks well of you you mean rudolph not just rudolph there are plenty of people who dont want to believe youre for real besides that you were near the scene of and may have witnessed a felony they could put you away obviously my life was too easy already i swigged more beer murph cop crook or creature it doesnt matter i dont back off because some bully doesnt like what i do im not a bully harry im your friend i winced and youre asking me she nodded pretty please with sugar with sugar hell murph i took a drink and squinted at her how much do you know about whats going on i had some of the files taken away before i could read them she glanced up at me but i can read between the lines okay i said this might take a little explaining you arent backing off are you it isnt an option stop there then murphy said the less you tell me the less i can testify to testify hell there should be some kind of rule about being forced to dodge several kinds of legal land mines at the same time this isnt a friendly situation i said if straight cops go into it like its normal business theyre going to get killed id be really worried even if it were si okay murphy said she didnt look happy she drank her beer in a long pull and set the bottle on my mantel i put my hand on her shoulder she didnt snap it off at the wrist murph this looks bad already i have a hunch it could get worse fast i have to i know she said i wish i could help did you get the information on that cell phone no she said but as she said it she passed me a folded piece of paper i unfolded it with my fingers and read murphys printing quebec nationale inc owner no phone number address a po box dead end a dummy company probably i thought the churchmice could have it set up to do a lot of the buying and selling for them maybe dead gaston had been from quebec instead of france got it thanks murph i dont know what youre talking about murphy said she picked up her jacket from where shed tossed it on my couch and shrugged into it theres no apb out for you yet harry but id be discreet if i were you discreet thats me im serious serious yep dammit harry but she smiled when she said it you probably dont want me to call you if i need help she nodded hell no that would be illegal keep your nose clean walk the straight and narrow okay murphy paused and asked i dont think ive seen you without that coat outside of summer wheres your duster i grimaced missing in action oh you talk to susan i said yeah i felt murphys eyes on my face she got it without being told oh she said again sorry harry thanks see you she opened my door kept her hand near her gun and then warily padded on out i shut my door after her and leaned against it murphy was worried she wouldnt have come to me in person if she werent and shed been extra careful with the legal stuff were things that dicey in the cpd murphy was the first head of special investigations not to get her rear bounced onto the street after a token week or three of unsolvable cases generally speaking when the administration wanted someone off the force theyd get promoted to running si or at least working in it every cop there had some kind of failing that had landed them what everyone else considered to be a cruddy assignment it had by and large created a strong sense of camaraderie among the si officers a bond only made tighter by the way they occasionally faced off with one kind of nightmarish creature or another si cops had taken down several halfassed dark spellslingers half a dozen vampires seven or eight ravening trolls and a demon that had manifested itself out of a mound of compostheated garbage behind a pawnshop in chinatown si could handle itself pretty well because they played careful they worked together and they understood that there were unnatural beings that sometimes had to be dealt with in ways not strictly in accordance with police procedure oh and because they had a hired wizard to advise them about bad guys of course i liked to think that i had contributed too but i guess every bucket of fruit has something go rotten sooner or later in si the stinker was detective rudolph rudy was young goodlooking cleancut and had slept with the wrong councilmans daughter he had applied some industrialstrength denial to his experiences with si despite freak encounters with monsters magic and human kindness he had clung to a steadfast belief that everything was normal and the realm of the paranormal was all makebelieve rudy didnt like me rudy didnt like murphy if the kid had sabotaged murphys investigation in order to curry favor with the folks in homicide maybe he was angling to get out of si and maybe hed lose a bunch of teeth the next time he walked through a quiet parking garage i doubted murphy would take that kind of backstabbing with good grace i spent a moment indulging myself in a pleasant fantasy in which murphy pounded rudys head against the door of her office at sis home building until the cheap wood had a rudolphshaped dent in it i enjoyed the thought way too much i gathered up a few things from around my apartment including the antivenom potions bob had helped me with i checked on bob while i was in the lab and got a sleepy and incoherent response that i understood to mean that he needed more rest i let him went back upstairs and called my answering service i had a message from susan a phone number i called it and a second later she answered harry youve become clairvoyant if you can do a foreign accent you could get a hot line like sure as if susan drawled ditzily california isnt foreign i said youd be surprised how did things go okay i guess i said i got a second michael she asked shiro who hes like michael but shorter and older oh uh good i did the legwork i thought of some work id seen susans legs do before but i only said and and the downtown marriott is hosting an art gala this very night including a gallery sale and a fundraiser auction for charity i whistled wow so lots of art and money moving around changing hands being shipped hither and yon hither maybe but i dont think ups does yon susan said seems like a good place to sell a hot article or three and its all sponsored by the chicago historical and art society who a very small and very elite club for the upper crust gentleman johnny marcone is chairman of its board of directors sounds like smuggling country all right i said how do i get in you put up a fivethousanddollarperplate donation to charity five thousand i said i dont think ive ever had that much all in one place at one time then you might try option two which is susans voice took on a note of satisfaction you go with a reporter from the midwest arcane on her last assignment for her editor i talked to trish and got two tickets that had originally been given to a reporter on the tribune im impressed i said it gets better i got us formal wear the gala begins at nine us uh susan i dont want to sound like an ass but do you remember the last time you wanted to come on an investigation with me this time im the one with the tickets she said are you coming with me or not i thought about it for a minute but didnt see any way around it there wasnt time for a long argument either im in i have to meet the reds at mcannallys at eight meet you there with your tux eightthirty yeah thank you sure she said quietly glad i could help silence stretched long enough to become painful for both of us i finally broke it at the same time as susan well id better well id better let you go susan said i have to hurry to get all of this done all right i said be careful stones and glass houses harry see you this evening we hung up and i made sure i was ready to go then i went to pick up my second and work out the terms to a duel i was increasingly certain i had little chance of surviving chapter seventeen i put on an old fleecelined denim jacket and went by my office the night security guy gave me a little trouble but i eventually browbeat him into opening the safe in the office to retrieve my envelope from father vincent i opened it and found a plastic case the size of a playing card like the kind coin collectors use to frame paper money in the exact center of the case was a single dirty white thread about two inches long the sample from the shroud it wasnt much to work with i could use the thread to create a channel to the rest of the shroud but nothing was certain the thread had presumably been absent from the rest of the shroud for going on thirty years not only that but it had presumably been handled by various scientists or clergy and it was possible that they had left enough of a psychic residue on the thread to cloud a seeking spell on top of all that the thread was tiny i would have to be extremely careful if i used a spell to go hunting the shroud or the forces in it would overload the thread in the same way that enough electrical current will overload the filament in a lightbulb im not so great with delicate spell work ive got plenty of power but fine control of it could be a problem by necessity i would have to use a very gentle spell and that would put severe limits on the range of it the spell would be a metal detector rather than a radar dish but it was a whole lot better than nothing i hit the door rather than inflicting another charity encounter upon myself i pulled the beetle up to the curb in front of michaels house and honked the horn a moment later shiro appeared the little old man had shaved the white down from his head and where he didnt have liver spots the skin shone he wore some kind of loosefitting black pants that looked a lot like the ones id seen murphy wear at one of her aikido tournaments he also wore a black shirt and a white gi jacket with a scarlet cross on either side of his chest a belt of red silk held the jacket closed and he wore his sword through it still in its wooden canesheath he opened the door slipped into the beetle and held his sword across his lap i got going and neither of us said anything for a while my knuckles were getting white again so i started talking so youve done one of these duels before hai he said nodding many times why shiro shrugged many reasons protect someone force something to leave an area in peace fight without involving others to the death shiro nodded many times guess youre pretty good at it then i said shiro smiled a little eyes wrinkling even more always someone better you ever dueled a vampire hai jade court black court jade court i said ive never heard that there was such a thing southeast asia china japan very secretive but they respect the accords have you dueled any of the denarians he frowned out the window twice but they do not honor agreements treachery both times i thought that over for a while before i said im going for energy if he wont take it well do will shiro glanced aside at me and nodded but there is a better choice what dont fight cant lose a fight you dont have i felt a snort coming on but i held it back im sort of locked into it now both parties want to quit duel over shiro said i will be talking to ortegas second ortega will be there smart for you try to talk him out of it i dont think hell do it maybe maybe not not fighting always smarter says the militant knight of the cross and his holy blade i hate fighting i glanced at him for a second then said you dont usually hear that from someone good at it shiro smiled fighting is never good but sometimes necessary i blew out a deep breath yeah i guess i know what you mean the rest of the ride to mcannallys was quiet in the streetlights my knuckles looked the same color as the rest of my hands mcannallys is a tavern not a bar not a pub but an actual old worldstyle tavern when i went in i stepped down three steps to the hardwood floor and looked around the place the bar has thirteen stools at it there were thirteen columns of dark wood each one handcarved with swirling leaves and images of beings of tale and fantasy thirteen tables had been spaced out around the room in an irregular pattern and like the columns and bar stools they had been intentionally placed that way in order to deflect and scatter random magical energies it cut down on the accidents from grumpy wizards and clueless kids just discovering their power several ceiling fans whirled lazily and were low enough that i always felt a bit nervous about one of them whirling into my eyebrows the place smells of wood smoke old whiskey barrels fresh bread and roasting meat i like it mac stood behind the bar i didnt know much about mac he was tall medium build bald and somewhere between thirty and sixty he had large and facile hands and thick wrists all ive ever seen him wear is dark pants with a loose white shirt and an apron that somehow remained free of splatters of grease spilled drinks and the various other things he prepared for customers mac caught my eye when i came in and nodded to my left i looked a sign on the wall said accorded neutral ground i looked back at mac he drew a shotgun out from behind the bar so that i could see it and said got it no problem i answered good the room was otherwise empty though normally there would be a couple of dozen members of the local magical scene not fullfledged wizards or anything but there were plenty of people with a dab of magical talent then there were a couple of different wiccan groups the occasional changeling scholars of the arcane a gang of dogooder werewolves members of secret societies and who knew what else mac must have put out the word that a meeting was happening here no one sane wants to be anywhere close to what could be a fight between a white council member and a red court warlord i knew i was sane because i didnt want to be there either i walked over to the bar and said beer mac grunted and plopped down a bottle of brown i pushed some bills at him but he shook his head shiro stood at the bar next to me facing the opposite way mac put a bottle down beside him shiro twisted off the cap with one hand took a modest sip and set the bottle back down then he glanced at it thoughtfully picked it up and took a slower sip yosh mac grunted thanks shiro said something in what i guessed was japanese mac answered monosyllabically a man of many talents and few syllables is mac i killed time with a couple more sips and the door opened kincaid walked in in the same outfit id seen that morning but without the baseball cap his dark blond hair was instead pulled back into an unruly tail he nodded at mac and asked all set ungh said mac kincaid prowled the room looking under tables and behind columns and checked the rest rooms and behind the counter as well mac said nothing but i had the impression that he felt the precaution to be useless kincaid went to a corner table nudging other tables back from it a bit and put three chairs around it he drew a gun out of a shoulder rig and set it on the table then took a seat hi i said toward him nice to see you too wheres ivy past her bedtime kincaid said without smiling im her proxy oh i said she has a bedtime kincaid checked his watch she believes very strongly in an early bedtime for children heh heh ehheh i dont fake amused chuckles well so wheres ortega saw him parking outside kincaid said the door opened and ortega entered he wore a casual black blazer with matching slacks and a shirt of scarlet silk he hadnt worn a coat despite the cold his skin was darker than i remembered it maybe hed fed recently he carried himself with a relaxed patient quality as he entered and surveyed the room he bowed slightly at the waist toward mac who nodded back the vampires eyes landed on shiro and narrowed shiro said nothing and did not move ortega then regarded me with an unreadable expression and gave me a very slight nod it seemed polite to nod back to him so i did ortega did the same to kincaid who returned it with a lazy wave of one hand where is your second kincaid asked ortega grimaced primping he hadnt finished the word before a young man slapped the door open and stepped jauntily into the tavern he was wearing tight white leather pants a black fishnet shirt and a white leather jacket his hair was dark and hung to his shoulders in an unruly mane he had a male models face smoky grey eyes and thick dark eyelashes i knew him thomas raith a white court vampire thomas i said by way of greeting evening harry he answered what happened to your duster there was a woman i see thomas said pity it was the only thing you owned that gave me hope that there might be a feeble flicker of style in you you should talk that outfit youre wearing is treading dangerously close to the elvis zone young sleek elvis aint bad thomas said i meant old fat elvis possibly michael jackson the pale man put a hand to his heart that hurts harry yeah ive had a rough day too gentlemen kincaid said a note of impatience in his voice shall we begin i nodded so did ortega kincaid introduced everyone and produced a document that stated he was working for the archive it was written in crayon i drank some more beer after that kincaid invited shiro and thomas to join him at the corner table i went back to the bar and a moment later ortega followed me he sat down with a couple of empty stools between us while kincaid thomas and shiro spoke quietly in the background i finished my bottle and set it down with a thump mac turned around to get me another i shook my head dont bother ive got enough on my tab already ortega put a twenty down on the bar and said ill cover it another for me as well i started to make a wiseass remark about how buying me a beer would surely make up for threatening my life and the lives of those i cared about but i bit it back shiro had been right about fighting you cant lose a fight you dont show up to so i took the beer mac brought me and said thanks ortega he nodded and took a sip his eyes lit up a bit and he took a second slower one its good mac grunted i thought you guys drank blood i said its all we really need ortega said then why do you have anything else ortega held up the bottle life is more than mere survival all you need is the water after all why drink beer you ever tasted the water in this town he almost smiled touchй i turned the plain brown bottle around in my fingers i dont want this i said the duel i nodded ortega leaned an elbow on the bar and considered me neither do i this isnt personal it isnt something i want so dont do it i said we could both walk and the war would go on its been going on for nearly two years i said its mostly been cat and mouse a couple of raids fights in back alleys its like the cold war only with fewer republicans ortega frowned and watched mac cleaning the grill behind the bar it can get worse mister dresden it can get a great deal worse and if the conflict escalates it will threaten the balance of power throughout the worlds of flesh and spirit alike imagine the destruction the loss of life that could ensue so why not contribute to the peace effort starting with this duel maybe we could get some beads and some fringe and make signs that say make blood not war or something this time ortega did smile it was a weary expression on him its too late for that he said your blood is all that will satisfy many of my peers i can donate i said lets say once every two months you provide cookies and orange juice ortega leaned toward me the smile fading wizard you murdered a noble of our court i got angry my voice gained heat the only reason ortega cut me off lifting his hand i do not say that your reasons were not valid but the fact of the matter is that you appeared in her home as a guest and representative of the council and you attacked and eventually killed both bianca and those under her protection killing me wont bring her back i said but it will slake the thirst for vengeance that plagues many of my kinsmen when you are no more they will be willing to at least attempt a peaceful resolution dammit i muttered and fiddled with the bottle though ortega murmured his eyes became distant for a moment there might be another way what other way yield ortega said yield to the duel and let me take you into custody if you are willing to work with me i could place you under my protection work with you i said my stomach flipflopped you mean become like you it is an alternative to death ortega said his expression earnest my kinsmen may not like it but they could not argue against it for taking biancas life you could replace it with your own as one of you ortega nodded as one of us he was quiet for a moment then said you could bring miss rodriguez with you be together she would not be a threat to you were you both my vassals he put his beer down i think you will find that we are much alike dresden were just playing for different teams i rubbed at my mouth my instinctive reaction to ortegas offer was one of revulsion the red court vampires dont look like most would think they looked like giant hairless bats with slick rubbery skin they could cover themselves with a flesh mask in order to look human but id seen what was underneath the mask id been exposed to it thoroughly i still had nightmares i opened my eyes let me ask you a question very well do you live in a manor casaverde ortega responded its in honduras there is a village nearby uh huh i said so you feed on the villagers carefully i provide them with supplies medical attention other necessities sounds reasonable i said its beneficial to both of us the villagers know that yeah they probably do i finished off the bottle do you feed on children ortega frowned at me what do you mean i didnt bother to hide the anger in my voice do you feed on children its the safest way the more the feeding is spread among many the less dangerous it is for all of them youre wrong were different i stood up you hurt kids were done ortegas voice sharpened dresden do not lightly discard my offer the offer to make me into a blooddrinking monster in eternal slavery to you why would i want to do that it is the only way to keep your life ortega said i felt the anger coalescing into rage my upper lip curled away from my teeth baring them in a snarl i thought life is more than mere survival ortegas expression changed it was only for a second but in that moment i saw furious rage arrogant pride and violent bloodlust on his face he regained his calm quickly but traces of the hidden emotions thickened his accent so be it i will kill you wizard he sounded convincing it scared me i turned and walked to the door ill be outside i said to no one in particular and stepped out into the latefebruary cold that way id have an excuse to be trembling chapter eighteen i didnt have long to wait the door opened behind me and kincaid emerged he didnt say a word to me just got into a rented sedan and left ortega came next a car swung in off the street and he opened the passenger door he paused and looked back at me i have a measure of respect for your principles and skills dresden but this situation is of your own making and i cannot allow it to continue im sorry i watched him get in the car and i didnt offer him any reply hell he hadnt said a word that was untrue ortega had a genuine ax to grind and peoplewell fellow monstersto protect and thus far the dresdenversusvampires scoreboard read a whole bunch to zero if a vampire had done that to the white council i wonder if we would have reacted with as much reason and calm the taillights of ortegas car hadnt yet gotten out of sight when thomas emerged from the tavern and swaggered casually over to me thomas was a shade under six feet tall which put him at half a head shorter than me he was betterlooking though and despite my earlier comments about his outfit he was one of those men who made anything look good the fishnet shirt he wore cast patterns of shadow over the pale skin beneath it adding to the lines of muscle on his stomach my stomach had muscles but not so many that you could see them rippling id have looked pathetic in a shirt like that that was simple enough thomas said he drew a pair of black leather driving gloves from his jacket pocket and started tugging them on though i take it this duel isnt the only game in town at the moment why would you say that i asked ive had a pro hitter following me ever since i landed yesterday the itch between my shoulder blades got annoying i glanced around is he here now thomass eyes glittered no i introduced him to my sisters the white court were the most human of the vampires and in some ways the weakest they fed on psychic energies on pure life force rather than on blood most often they would seduce those they fed upon drawing life from them through physical contact during the act if a couple of thomass sisters had met the hired gun tailing thomas the assassin probably wasnt going to be a problem to anyone ever my eye twitched the gunman was probably ortegas i said he hired some goons to take out people i knew if i didnt agree to this duel that explains it then thomas said ortega really doesnt like me much must be the unsavory company ive kept in the past gee thanks how the hell did you end up his second its my fathers idea of a joke thomas said ortega asked him to be his second show of solidarity between the red and white courts instead daddy dearest found the most annoying and insulting member of the family he possibly could to stand in you i said cest moi thomas confirmed with a little bow one would almost think father was trying to get me killed i felt one side of my mouth tug up into a smile nice father figure him and bill cosby hows justine thomas grimaced shes in aruba is how she is which is where i was until one of pappa raiths goons dragged me back up here what did you two decide on for the duel thomas shook his head cant tell you shiro is supposed to do that i mean technically im at war with you i grimaced and stared after ortegas vanished car yeah thomas was quiet for a second then said he means to kill you i know hes dangerous harry smart my father is afraid of him i could like him i said its sort of refreshing to have someone trying to kill me right to my face instead of throwing me a bunch of curveballs and shooting me in the back its almost nice to have a fair fight sure theoretically theoretically thomas shrugged ortegas been alive for about six hundred years it isnt something you do by playing nice from what ive heard the archive will object to any monkey business its only cheating if he gets caught i frowned at him and said are you saying someone is planning to avoid getting caught thomas put his hands in his jacket pockets im not saying anything i wouldnt mind seeing you kick his ass but im sure as hell not going to do something that would attract attention to me you intend to participate without being involved thats clever thomas rolled his eyes i wont throw a banana peel under you but dont expect any help from me either im just making sure its a fair fight and then im back at my beach house he drew car keys from his pocket and headed for the parking lot good luck thomas i said to his back thanks for the headsup he paused i asked why do it the vampire glanced over his shoulder at me and smiled life would be unbearably dull if we had answers to all our questions he walked out to a white sports car and slipped into it a second later loud screaming metal music started from the cars stereo the engine roared and thomas drove off i checked my watch ten more minutes until susan arrived shiro emerged from mcannallys and put on his glasses once he spotted me he walked over and took the glasses off again ortega refused to cancel the duel he made me an offer i couldnt excuse i said shiro grunted duel is wills tomorrow just after sundown wrigley field a stadium why dont we put it on payperview while were at it i glowered at the street and checked my watch again im meeting someone in a minute ill give you the keys to my car i can pick it up from michaels tomorrow no need shiro said mac called me a cab okay i pocketed my keys shiro stood quietly for a moment lips pursed thoughtfully before he said ortega means to kill you yes yes he does i said i managed not to grind my teeth as i said it everyone is saying that like i didnt know it already but you do not know how i frowned and looked down at shiro his shaved head gleamed under a nearby streetlight the war is not your fault i know that i said but my voice lacked conviction no shiro said it truly is not your fault what do you mean the red court has been quietly building its resources for years he said how else were they ready to start their attacks in europe only days after you defeated bianca i frowned at him shiro drew a cigar from inside his jacket and bit off the end he spat it to one side you were not the cause of the war you were merely the excuse the reds would have attacked when they were ready no i said thats not how it is i mean damn near everyone ive spoken to on the council shiro snorted he struck a match and puffed on the cigar a few times while he lit it the council arrogant as if nothing significant could happen unless a wizard did it for someone who wasnt on the white council shiro seemed to have its general attitude pretty well surrounded if the red court wanted a war why is ortega trying to stop it premature shiro said needed more time to be completely prepared the advantage of surprise is gone he wishes to strike once and be certain it is a lethal stroke i watched the little old man for a minute everyones got advice tonight why are you giving it because in some ways you are every bit as arrogant as the council though you do not realize it you blame yourself for what happened to susan you want to blame yourself for more so what if i do shiro turned me and faced me squarely i avoided meeting his eyes duels are a test of fire they are fought in the will the heart if you do not find your balance ortega will not need to kill you you will do so for him i guess you were a psychoanalyst before you were a swordswinging vigilante against evil shiro puffed on the cheroot either way been alive longer than you see more than you like what like this vampire warlord how he manipulates you he is not what he seems to be really ive never seen that one before i said someone not what they appear to be however will i adjust shiro shrugged he is centuries old he is not from the same world the world ortega lived in was savage brutal men like him destroyed entire civilizations for gold and glory and for hundreds of years since then he has fought rival vampires demons and enemies of his kind if he approaches you through formal civilized channels it is because he thinks it is the best way to kill you regardless of what happens in the duel he intends to see you dead by any means necessary maybe before maybe after but dead shiro didnt put any particular emphasis on the words he didnt need to they were enough to scare me without any added dramatics i glowered at his cigar and said those things will kill you the old man smiled again not tonight id think a good christian boy wouldnt be puffing down the cigars technicality shiro said the cigars my christianity shiro said when i was a boy i liked elvis had a chance to see him in concert when we moved to california it was a big revival meeting there was elvis and then a speaker and my english was not so good he invited people backstage to meet the king thought he meant elvis so i go backstage he sighed found out later i had become a baptist i barked out a laugh youre kidding no but it was done so i tried not to be too bad at being baptist he rested a hand on the handle of his sword then came into this made the whole thing more simple i serve serve who heaven or the divine in nature the memory of my fathers past my fellow man myself all pieces of the same thing do you know the story of the blind men and the elephant have you heard the one about the bear that walks into a bar i responded i think that is a no shiro said three blind men were shown an elephant they touched it with their hands to determine what the creature was the first man felt the trunk and claimed that an elephant was like a snake the second man touched its leg and claimed that an elephant was like a tree the third man touched its tail and claimed that the elephant was like a slender rope i nodded oh i get it all of them were right all of them were wrong they couldnt get the whole picture shiro nodded precisely i am just another blind man i do not get the whole picture of what transpires in all places i am blind and limited i would be a fool to think myself wise and so not knowing what the universe means i can only try to be responsible with the knowledge the strength and the time given to me i must be true to my heart sometimes that isnt good enough i said he tilted his head and looked up at me how do you know a cab swerved in from the street and rattled to a stop shiro stepped over to it and nodded to me will be at michaels if you need me be watchful i nodded at him thank you shiro said thank me after then he got into the cab and left mac closed up shop a minute later and put on a dark fedora on his way out he nodded at me on the way to his trans am and said nothing i found a shadowy spot to linger in as mac left and kept an eye on the street id hate for someone to drive by and shoot me with a plain old gun embarrassing a long dark limo pulled into the parking lot a uniformed driver got out and opened the door nearest to me a pair of long honeybrown legs slid out of the limo on top of black stiletto heels susan glided out of the car managing grace despite the shoes which probably qualified her for superhuman status all by itself a sleeveless sheath of shimmering black cloth clung to her an evening gown slit high on one side dark gloves covered her arms to the elbow and her hair had been done up in a pile on top of her head held in place with a couple of gleaming black chopsticks my tongue dropped out of my mouth and flopped onto my shoes well not literally but if id been a cartoon my eyeballs would have been about six feet long susan had read my face and apparently enjoyed my reaction how much goodlooking i looked down at my rumpled clothing i think im a tad underdressed one tuxedo coming up susan said the driver opened the trunk and drew out a hanger covered with a drycleaning bag when he turned around with it i realized that the driver was martin all hed done to disguise himself was don an archetypical uniform and i hadnt even recognized him until second glance i guess sometimes its handy to be bland is it my size i asked taking the tux when martin passed it to me i had to guess susan said lowering her eyelids in a sultry expression but it wasnt like i didnt know my way around martins face might have flickered with disapproval my heart sped up a bit all right then i said lets get moving ill dress on the way do i get to look susan asked itll cost you extra i said martin opened the door for susan and i slid in after her i filled her in on what id found out about the shroud and those after it i should be able to find the thing if we get close you think there will be any more of these denarians there probably i said if anything gets ugly well take the best part of valor pronto these guys play hardball susan nodded agreement sounds like the thieves arent exactly shy about waving guns either and well have marcone around too whither he goeth there too goeth armed thugs and homicide investigations susan smiled it was a new expression to mea small quiet fierce little smile that showed her teeth it looked natural on her youre all about fun arent you harry i am the bruce lee of fun i concurred give me some space here susan slid over as far as she could to give me room to climb into the tux i tried not to mar it too badly in the limited space susan glanced at me with a faint frown what i asked her youre wrinkling it this isnt as easy as im making it look i responded if you werent staring at my legs maybe it wouldnt be such a challenge i wasnt staring i lied susan smiled at me as the car cruised through downtown and i did my best to dress like roger moore her expression became thoughtful after a moment and she said hey what what happened to your leather coat chapter nineteen the downtown marriott was huge brilliantly lit and busy as an anthill several blueandwhites were parked nearby and a couple of officers were helping to direct traffic in front of the hotel i could see maybe twenty limos on the street and pulling through the archway in front of the hotel doors and every one of them looked bigger and nicer than ours valets rushed around to park the cars of guests who had driven themselves there were a dozen men in red jackets standing around with bored expressions that some might mistake for inattention hotel security martin pulled up to the entryway and said ill wait for you out here he passed a palmsized cell phone to susan she slipped it into a black clutch if you get into trouble speeddial one at that point a valet opened the door on my side and i slipped out of the car my rental tux felt a little awkward the shoes were long enough for me but they were an inch and a half too wide i shrugged my jacket into place straightened the cummerbund and offered a hand to susan she slid out of the car with a brilliant smile and straightened my tie smile she said quietly everyone here is worried about image if you walk in scowling like that we wont blend in i smiled in what i thought was a camouflaging manner susan regarded the expression critically nodded and slipped her arm through mine we walked in under the cover our smiles provided one of the security guards stopped us inside the door and susan presented the tickets to him he waved us through first thing to do is find some stairs i said from behind my smile the loading docks will be near the kitchens and theyre below us thats where theyll be bringing in the art stuff susan held her course toward the stairs not yet she said if we snoop around the second we get in the door someone is likely to notice we should mingle until the auction is running people will be distracted then if we wait the whole thing could go down while we hobnob maybe susan said but odds are that anna valmont and the buyer are both thinking the same thing when does the auction start eleven assuming the note means that the sale is at eleven fortyfive that doesnt give us much time to look around this place is huge we got onto an escalator and susan arched an eyebrow at me do you have any better ideas not yet i said i caught a glimpse of myself in a polished brass column i didnt look halfbad theres a reason the tux has weathered a century virtually unchanged you dont fix what isnt broken tuxedos make anyone look good and i was a living testament to it think they will have anything to eat im starving just keep the shirt clean susan muttered no problem i can wipe my fingers on the cummerbund i cant take you anywhere susan said she leaned a little against me and it felt nice i felt nice generally speaking i cleaned up pretty well it would seem and i had a lovely womanno i had susan on my arm looking lovely it was a small silver lining compared to the troubled clouds id been floundering through but it was something and it lasted all the way up the escalator i take the good moments wherever i can get them we followed the flow of formally dressed men and women up another escalator or three to a cavernous ballroom chandeliers hung from the ceiling and tables laden with expensivelooking snacks and ice sculptures all but overflowed onto the floor a group of musicians played on the far side of the ballroom they didnt seem to be stretching themselves with some relaxed and classy jazz couples who also werent stretching themselves danced together on a floor the size of a basketball court the room wasnt crammed with people but there were a couple of hundred there already and more coming in behind us polite but insincere chatter filled the space accompanied by equally insincere smiles and laughter there were a number of city officials whom i recognized in the immediate area plus a couple of professional musicians and at least one motionpicture actor a waiter in a white jacket offered us a tray of champagne glasses and i promptly appropriated a pair of them passing the first to susan she lifted the glass to her mouth but didnt drink the champagne smelled good i took a sip and it tasted good im not a terribly impressive drinker so i stopped after the first sip chugging down champagne on an empty stomach would probably prove inconvenient if it turned out i needed to do any quick thinking or quick leaving or quick anything susan said hello to an older couple and stopped for introductions i kept my duck blind of a smile in place and mouthed appropriately polite phrases in the right spots my cheeks had already started hurting we repeated that for half an hour or so while the band played a bunch of lowkey dance music susan knew a lot of people shed been a reporter in chicago for five or six years before shed had to leave town but she had evidently managed to ingratiate herself to more people than i would have guessed you go susan food i said after a stooped older man kissed susans cheek and walked away feed me seymour its always the brain stem with you she murmured but she guided us over to the refreshment tables so that i could pick up a tiny sandwich i didnt wolf the thing down in one bite which was just as well since it had a toothpick through it to hold it together but the sandwich didnt last long at least chew with your mouth closed susan said i took a second sandwich cant help it i got all kinds of joie de vivre baby and smile chew and smile at the same time do i look like jackie chan she had a retort but it died after a syllable i felt her hand tighten on my arm i briefly debated wolfing the second sandwich just to get it out of the way but i took the more sophisticated option instead i put it in my jacket pocket for later and turned to follow susans gaze i looked just in time to meet the gaze of gentleman johnny marcone he was a man of slightly above average height and unassuming build he had handsome but unremarkable features central casting would have placed him as the genial nextdoor neighbor he didnt have the usual boaters tan it being february and all but the crowsfeet at the corners of his pale green eyes remained he looked a lot like the fictional public image he projectedthat of a normal respectable businessman an american tale of middle class made good that said marcone scared me more than any single human being id ever met id seen him produce a knife from his sleeve faster than a hyperstrong psychotic could swing a tire iron at him hed thrown another knife through a rope while spinning in circles as he hung upside down in the dark later the same night marcone may have been human but he wasnt normal hed taken control of chicagos organized crime during a freeforall gang war and hed run it ever since despite the efforts of both everyday and supernatural threats hed done it by being deadlier than anything that came after him of all the people in the room marcone was the only one i could see who wasnt wearing a fake smile it didnt look like he was particularly troubled by the fact either mister dresden he said and miss rodriguez i believe i didnt realize you were an art collector i am the foremost collector of velvet elvii in the city of chicago i said at once elvii marcone inquired the plural could be elvises i guess i said but if i say that too often i start muttering to myself and calling things my precious so i usually go with the latin plural marcone did smile that time it was a cool expression tigers with full stomachs wear smiles like marcones when theyre watching baby deer play ah i hope you can find something to suit your tastes tonight im easy i said any old rag will do marcone narrowed his eyes there was a short pointed silence while he met my gaze he could do that id gotten into a soulgaze with him in the past it was one of the reasons he scared me in that case i would advise you to exercise caution in your acquisitions cautious thats me i said you sure you wouldnt rather make this simple in deference to your limitations i almost would marcone said but im afraid im not quite sure what youre talking about i felt my eyes narrow and i took a step forward susans hand pressed against my arm silently urging restraint i lowered my voice to something between marcone and myself tell you what lets start with one of your monkeys trying to punch my ticket in a parking garage from there we can move along to the part where i come up with a suitable reply i didnt expect what happened next marcone blinked it wasnt a huge giveaway at a card table only a couple of the players would have seen it but i was right in his face and i knew him and i saw it my words startled marcone and for half a second it showed he covered it bringing out a businessmans smile that was a lot better than my fake smile and clapped a hand gently to my arm dont try me in public dresden you cant afford to do it i cant afford to let you a shadow fell over marcone and i looked up to see hendricks hulk into view behind him hendricks was still huge still redheaded still looked vaguely like a defensive lineman a little too awkward to make it from college to pro ball his tux was nicer than mine i wondered if he was wearing body armor under it again cujo hendricks had a date he had a blond date he had a gorgeous leggy blueeyed elegant tall nordic angel of a date she was wearing a white gown and silver flashed at her throat on each wrist and on one ankle id seen bikinis in issues of sports illustrated that might have felt too plain to be worn by hendrickss date she spoke and her voice was a throaty purr mister marcone is there a problem marcone arched an eyebrow is there mister dresden i probably would have said something stupid but susans nails dug into my forearm through my jacket no trouble susan said i dont believe weve met no said the blonde with a faint roll of her eyes we havent mister dresden miss rodriguez i believe you both know mister hendricks and this is miss gard ah i said shes an employee i take it miss gard smiled professional smiles all around tonight it would seem im from the monoc foundation she said im a consultant regarding what one wonders said susan she definitely had the sharpest smile of those present security gard said unruffled she focused on me i help make sure that thieves spies and poor wandering spirits dont wind up all over the lawn and i got it whoever miss gard was it seemed fairly likely that she was responsible for the wards that had torn bob up so badly my head of righteous fury died out replaced by caution marcone had been concerned about my talents hed started taking steps to balance things and marcone wasnt one to show his hand early which meant that he was already prepared for trouble of one kind or another with me he was ready to fight me marcone read my features and said neither one of us wants any unpleasantness dresden his eyes became flat and hard if you want to talk call my office tomorrow in the meantime i suggest you search for your classic renditions of elvis elsewhere ill take it under advisement i answered marcone shook his head and walked away to do his own mingling which seemed to consist mainly of shaking hands and nodding in the appropriate spots hendricks and the amazonian gard shadowed marcone never far away what a charmer you are susan murmured i grunted such diplomacy me and kissinger i scowled after marcone and said i dont like this why not because hes up to something he set up magical defenses around his house like he was expecting trouble susan said yeah you think hes the buyer for the shroud would make a lot of sense i said hes got enough contacts and money to do it the buy is apparently going down here at his gala i scanned the room as i spoke he doesnt do anything without planning it out to his advantage hes probably got friends in hotel security it would give him all kinds of freedom to meet valmont where no one was watching i spotted marcone as he found a spot near a wall and lifted a tiny cell phone to his ear he spoke into it his eyes hard and he had the look of a man who wasnt listening only giving orders i tried to listen in on what he was saying but between the band the ballroom and the chatter of voices i wasnt able to make anything out but why susan asked hes got the means and the resources but what reason would he have to buy the shroud hell if i know susan nodded he certainly isnt happy to see you here yeah something unsettled him gave him a nasty surprise did you see his face susan shook her head what do you mean a reaction during the conversation im sure i saw it he got caught flatfooted when i was talking to him and he didnt like it you rattled him maybe i said enough to push him into moving early susans dark eyes had also picked out marcone who snapped the cell phone closed and headed for one of the service doors with gard and hendricks behind him marcone paused to speak to a redjacketed security guard and glanced in our direction looks like wed better get moving i said i need a minute to use the spell on this thread sample and lead us to the shroud why havent you done that already limited range i said and the spell wont last long we need to be close how close susan asked maybe a hundred feet marcone left the room and the security guard lifted his radio to his mouth crap i said relax susan said though her own voice sounded tight these are the upper crust of chicago the security guards wont want to make a scene right i said and started for the door slowly susan said her smile in place again dont rush i tried not to rush despite the security guard closing in behind us i saw red jackets moving in my peripheral vision as well we kept up the slow graceful walk of people wandering around a party and susan smiled enough for both of us we got as far as the doors before another red jacket appeared in the doors in front of us cutting us off i recognized the manthe gunman outside the television studio the one who had nearly ventilated father vincent and me in the parking garage his eyes widened in recognition and his hand moved toward his jacket where a gun would be inside a shoulder holster the body language was clear come along quietly or get shot i looked around us but other than the partygoers the dance floor and the other security guards nothing really seemed to present itself as an option then the band struck up something a little faster with a syncopated latin beat and several of the younger couples who hadnt been dancing previously moved out onto the floor come on i said and guided susan with me what are you doing she asked buying some time to get across the room to those other doors i said i turned to her put one hand on her waist and took her other hand in mine and led off onto the dance floor with an uncomplicated twostep just follow i looked back to her to see her mouth open in shock you told me you couldnt dance not like in clubs and stuff i said she followed me well enough to let me do a little dip and step into a restrained hustle i dont do so well with rock and roll ballroom is something else susan laughed her dark eyes shining even as she watched the crowd around us for more red jackets between this and the tux youre threatening to become classy where did you learn i kept us moving down the dance floor rolling susan out to the length of our arms and then drawing her in again when i first came to chicago i had a bunch of jobs until i hooked up with nick christian at ragged angel investigations one of them was as a dance partner with a seniorcitizen organization you learned from little old ladies tough to tango with someone with lumbago i said it requires great skill i spun susan again this time bringing her back to me with her back to my chest one hand still on her hip with the other holding her arm out there was a subtle electricity in touching her her waist slender and supple under my hand her hair smelled of cinnamon and her dress left quite a bit of her back naked to view it was distracting as hell and when she glanced over her shoulder at me her eyes were growing heated she felt it too i swallowed focus harry see those doors behind the food tables susan nodded i checked over my shoulder the security guards had been slowed down by the press of the crowd and we had beaten them to the other side of the room thats where were going we need to ditch these guys and find valmont before marcone gets to her wont security just follow us through the kitchen not if vanilla martin diverts their attention before we leave the floor susans eyes glittered and she kept dancing with me drawing the tiny cell phone from her clutch you have a devious mind call me crazy but id rather not have marcones goons walk us out a little luck came our way and the band moved to a somewhat slower number susan was able to stay closer to me half concealing her cell phone i heard the phone dialing numbers and i tried to still my thoughts and feelings it hadnt worked for long at the larry fowler studio but if i could rein in my emotions susan should at least be able to make a call it worked she spoke quietly into the phone for all of three or four seconds then clicked it closed and put it away two minutes she said damn martin was good i could pick out a couple of security guards at the main doors marcones darkhaired hitter was closer he had trouble making his way politely through the crowd and we had managed to gain a small lead on him as we danced do we have a signal or anything i think we wait for something distracting to happen susan said like what the sudden shriek of braking tires cut through the band music there was a loud crunch and the sound of plate glass breaking along with shrieks from the hotel lobby below the band stopped in confusion and people crowded toward the exit to see what was happening like that susan said we had to swim upstream so to speak but it didnt look like anyone was bothering to look at us i caught a glimpse of marcones hitter heading out toward the ruckus the ass had his gun in his hand despite any possible field of fire he might have picked being filled with rich and influential socialites at least he was holding the weapon low and against his leg the staff were just as interested in the disturbance as anyone else and we were able to duck back into the service hallway without comment from anyone susan took a quick look around and said elevator stairs if they have them if someone shoots at us on stairs we can scream and flail around a lot more i spotted a fire alarm diagram on the wall and traced my finger over it here down the hall and left susan stepped out of her shoes while i did that it left her a lot shorter but her feet were silent on the utilitarian carpet we went down the hall found the stairs and started down them we went down three flights which put us at ground level again i guessed i opened the door from the stairwell and took a look around a dingy little elevator opened and a couple of guys in the foodstained white of kitchen hands went walking down the hallway peering ahead and chattering i heard a siren or two wailing outside ill say this for martin i muttered when he distracts he distracts he has a strong work ethic susan agreed keep an eye out i said and stepped back from the door susans gaze flicked around the stairwell and over the hallway while i stepped back to kneel on the ground drawing out what i would need for my seeking spell i pulled out a black magic marker and drew a smooth circle on the tiled landing all the way around me the marker squealed as i did and as i closed the circle i willed it shut a gentle barrier something i couldnt see but could easily feel closed around me screening out disruptive forces so that i could work my spell is that a permanent marker susan asked thus do i strike a blow for anarchy whenever the mood takes me i muttered just a minute i took out the sample from father vincent and a windup plastic duck which isnt as goofy as it sounds stay with me i touched the thread to the ducks bill then wound the duck up i muttered a low chant mostly nonsense syllables and focused on what i wanted i set the duck down on the floor but instead of beginning to waddle it instead waited completely still i had to use a rubber band to attach the tiny thread to the ducks bill it was too short to tie on i focused brushing aside any thoughts besides those i needed for the spell and let the gathered magic go with a whispered seek seek seek the power poured out of me leaving me a bit short of breath the little yellow duck quivered and then lurched into motion spinning about in an aimless circle i nodded once reached out a hand and with an effort of will to support the gesture i broke the circle the screen vanished as quickly as it had arrived and the little yellow duck quacked and marched toward the door i glanced up at susan her dark and lovely eyes watched the duck with what could charitably be termed extreme skepticism i scowled at her dont say it i didnt say anything well dont she fought down a smile i wont i opened the door the duck waddled out into the hallway quacked and turned to the left i stepped out picked the duck up and said its close lets move we just check the duck at intersections does the duck know about stairs more or less come on i dont know how long the spell will last i led the way im not the worlds mightiest athlete but i exercise a bit i have really long legs and i can walk faster than some run the duck led us down a pair of long hallways to a door with an employees only sign on it i opened the door peeked in and reported in a whisper big laundry room footsteps sounded behind us coming down another hallway susan looked at me with wide eyes i pushed into the room susan close behind me i closed the door almost all the way holding it from closing completely so that the lock wouldnt click and give us away the footsteps came closer a couple sets of them and two shapes went quickly by passing close to the cracked doorway hendricks and gard i murmured to susan how do you know she whispered back smelled the blondes perfume i counted silently to ten and opened the door looking out the hallway was clear i closed the door and turned on the lights the room was fairly large with several commercial washing machines ranked against one wall a bank of dryers faced them on the opposite side of the room and in between were several long counters that held stacks and stacks of folded white sheets and towels i put the duck on the floor and it waddled off down the row of counters this is how they had it hidden on the yacht concealed among laundry and those professionalthief types tend to be so predictable susan asked i frowned and put the duck on the floor watch the door the duck waddled at once over to the far side of the room and bumped into some hanging laundry i pulled the hanging sheets to one side and found a large ventilation grate behind them i knelt down running my fingers and eyes over the edges of the grate and found a pair of holes where screws had been a quick tug on the grate had it off the wall revealing a vent maybe three feet square i stuck my head in and found a ventilation shaft running between the walls the duck waddled in and took a determined right air duct i said i twisted out of the tuxedo jacket and absently ripped off the tie from around my neck i stepped out of the clumsy shoes and rolled up my shirtsleeves baring my shield bracelet to view be right back harry susan began her voice worried i saw alien im not tom skerritt i winked at susan picked up the duck and entered the air duct moving as quietly as i could evidently it was very quiet the duct ran straight grates opening into utility rooms every fifteen or twenty feet i had gone past three of the grates when i heard voices this isnt according to the deal came marcones voice it had the scratchy edges of a radio transmission to it anna valmonts smooth british accent answered it from the other side of the next grate neither was an early rendezvous i dont like it when a buyer changes the plan a radio clicked marcones voice came through it smooth and calm i assure you that i have no interest in breaking faith with your organization it isnt good business when i have confirmation of the transfer of funds youll get the article not a second before my factor in zurich do you think im an idiot this job has already cost us more than any of us bargained for clear off the bloody radio and contact me when you have something worth saying or ill destroy the bloody thing and leave wait marcone said there was tension in his voice you cant cant i valmont answered dont fuck with me yank and add another million to the bill for telling me my job im calling off the deal if the money isnt there in ten minutes out i came up to the grate and found it sitting not quite squarely in its frame valmont must have entered the hotel and moved around through the air shafts i peered out through the grate valmont had set up in a storage room of some kind the only light in the room was a dim green shimmer that rose up from what must have been a palmtop computer valmont muttered something to herself beneath her breath her eyes on the screen she was wearing a lot of tightfitting black clothing and a black baseball cap she wasnt wearing my coat dammit but i guess i couldnt have expected to find everything wrapped up in a nice package i checked the duck setting it down facing toward me it immediately walked in a little circle and pointed toward anna valmont the thief paced the room like a restless cat eyes on the palmtop my eyes adjusted to the dimness over the course of a few minutes of waiting and i saw that valmont was pacing back and forth around a tube with a carrying strap the tube wasnt more than five or six feet from me i watched valmont pace until her expression and steps froze eyes locking hard on the palmtop great jupiters balls she said quietly he paid it now or never i put my hands on the grate and pushed it as gently as i could it slid soundlessly from the wall and i set it to one side valmont was focused entirely on her little computer if the prospect of payment distracted valmont for a moment more id be able to slip away with the shroud which would be very james bond of me hopefully the tuxedo would help out with that i needed only a few seconds to creep out nip the shroud and get back into the vents i almost died when valmonts radio crackled again and marcones voice said there as agreed plus your additional fee will that be sufficient quite you will find your merchandise in a storage closet in the basement marcones voice gained an edge please be more specific i slipped out of the vents thinking silent thoughts a long stretch put my fingertips on the tubes carrying strap if you wish valmont replied the article is in a locked room in a couriers tube the tube itself is outfitted with an incendiary a radio transmitter in my possession has the capacity to disarm or to trigger the device once i am safely on my way from the city i will disarm the device and notify you via telephone until that time i suggest you do not try to open it i jerked my fingers away from the tube again you have altered our agreement marcone said he said it in a voice as smooth and cold as the inside wall of a refrigerator it does seem to be a sellers market there are very few people able to speak about taking advantage of me valmont let out a quiet bitter little laugh come now this is nothing more than an entirely reasonable piece of insurance valmont said be a good boy and your precious cloth is in no danger attempt to betray me and youll have nothing and if the authorities find you on their own marcone asked youll need a broom and a dustpan when you come for the article i should think you would be wise to do whatever you can to clear the path for me she turned the radio off i bit my lip thinking furiously even if i took the shroud now marcone would be upset when he didnt get his hands on it if he didnt have valmont killed hed at least tip off the police to her valmont in turn would destroy the shroud if i took it i would have to move fast to get the shroud away from the device i couldnt count on simply blowing the device out with magic it was as likely to malfunction and explode as it was to just go dead i would need the transmitter too and there was only one way to get it i stepped up behind valmont and pressed the bill of the plastic duck against her spine dont move i said ill shoot she stiffened dresden let me see your hands i said she held them up the green light of the palmtop showing columns of numbers wheres the transmitter what transmitter i pushed the duck against her a little harder ive had a long day too miss valmont the one you just told marcone about she let out a small sound of discomfort if you take it marcone will kill me yeah he takes his image seriously youd be smart to come with me and get protection from the authorities now where is the transmitter her shoulders slumped and she bowed her head forward for a moment i felt a twinge of guilt she had planned on being here with friends theyd been killed she was a young woman alone in a strange land and regardless of what happened she wasnt likely to come out of this situation ahead of the game and here i was holding a duck to her back i felt like a bully my left jacket pocket valmont said her tone quiet i reminded myself that i was a professional and reached into her pocket to get the transmitter she clobbered me one second i was holding the duck to her back and reaching into her pocket the next i was falling to the ground with a bruise shaped like one of her elbows forming on my jaw the light from the palmtop clicked out a small redtinted flashlight came on and valmont kicked the duck out of my hand the beam of the flashlight followed the duck for a silent second and then she laughed a duck she said she dipped a hand into her pocket and came out with a small silver semiautomatic i was fairly certain you wouldnt shoot but that goes a step beyond ridiculous ive got to get a concealedcarry permit you wont shoot either i said and started to get up so you might as well put the gun d she pointed the gun at my leg and pulled the trigger pain flashed through my leg and i let out an involuntary shout i grabbed at my thigh as the red flashlight settled on me i pawed at my leg i had a couple of smallish cuts but i hadnt been shot the bullet had hit the concrete floor next to me and gouged a bite out of the concrete a flying chip or two must have cut my leg terribly sorry valmont said were you saying something nothing important i responded ah valmont said well it would be bad etiquette to leave a corpse here for my buyer to clean up so it seems as though ill be handdelivering to marcone after all we cant have you running off with what everyone is so excited over marcone is the least of your worries i said no actually hes quite prominent among them marcone isnt going to sprout horns and claws and start tearing you apart i said or at least i dont think he is theres another group after that shroud like the thing from the ship this morning i couldnt see her face from the other end of the red flashlight but her voice sounded a little shaky what was it a demon a real demon there was a strained tone in her voice as though she couldnt decide whether to laugh or sob id heard it before you expect me to believe it was a literal demon yeah and youre some sort of angel i suppose hell no i said im just working for them sort of look i know people who can protect you from those things people who wont hurt you theyll help i dont need help valmont said theyre dead theyre both dead gaston francisca my friends whoever these people these things are they cant hurt me any more the locked door of the storeroom screamed as something tore it off its hinges and out into the hall the hallway lights poured in through the gap in a blinding flood and i had to shield my eyes against them for a second i could see dim shapes shadows in front of the light one was lean and crouched with shadowy tendrils of razoredged hair slithering around it in a writhing cloud one was sinuous and stronglooking like a man who had traded its legs in on the scaled body of an enormous snake between them stood a shape that looked human like a man in an overcoat his hands in his pocketsbut the shadows the shape cast writhed and boiled madly making the lights flicker and swim in a nauseating fashion cannot hurt you any more said the central shape in a quietly amused male voice no matter how many times i hear that one its always a fresh challenge chapter twenty my eyes adjusted enough to make out some details the demonic female with the joan jett hair two sets of eyes a glowing sigil and vicious claws was the same denarian who had attacked at the harbor that morning the second demonic being was covered in dark grey scales flecked with bits of rust red from shoulders to waist he looked more or less human from the neck up and the waist down he looked like some kind of flattened serpent no legs coils slithered out behind him scales rasping over the floor he too had the double pair of eyes one set golden and serpentine the other inside the first glowing faintly bluegreen matching the pulsing symbol of the same light that seemed to dance in the gleam of the scales of the snakes head one little two little three little denarians or so i judged the last of them of the three he was the only one that looked human he wore a tan trench coat casually open his clothes were tailorfit to him and looked expensive a slender grey tie hung loosely around his throat he was a man of medium height and build with short dark hair streaked through with an offcenter blaze of silver his expression was mild amused and his dark eyes were halfclosed and sleepylooking he spoke english with a faint british accent well well what have we here our bold thief and her i got the impression that he would have been glad to begin one of those trademark bantering conversations all the urbane bad guys seem to be such big fans of but before he could finish the sentence anna valmont turned with her little pistol and shot him three times in the chest i saw him jerk and twist blood abruptly stained his shirt and coat shed hit the heart or an artery the man blinked and stared at valmont in shock as more red spread over his shirt he opened his coat a bit and looked down at the spreading scarlet i noted that the tie he wore wasnt a tie as such it looked like a piece of old grey rope and though he wore it as apparent ornamentation it was tied in a hangmans noose i do not appreciate being interrupted the man said in a sharp and ugly tone i hadnt even gotten around to the introductions there are proprieties to observe young woman a girl after my own heart anna valmont had a quick reply she shot him some more he wasnt five feet away the blond thief aimed for the center of mass and didnt miss him once the man folded his arms as bullets hit him tearing new wounds that bled freely he rolled his eyes after the fourth shot and made a rolling move this along gesture with his left hand until valmonts gun clicked empty the slide open where was i he said proprieties purred the feminine demon with the wild hair the word came out a little mangled due to the heavy canines that dimpled her lips as she spoke proprieties father there seems little point the man said thief you have stolen something i have an interest in give it to me at once and you are free to go your own way refuse me and i will become annoyed with you anna valmonts upper lip had beaded with sweat and she looked from her empty gun to the man in the trench coat with wide wild eyes frozen in confusion and obvious terror the gunshots would bring people running i needed to buy a little time i leaned up fished a hand into valmonts jacket pocket and drew out a small box of black plastic that looked vaguely like a remote control to a vcr i held up the transmitter put my thumb on it as if i knew what i was doing and said to the man in the trench coat hey bogart you and the wonder twins back off or the bedsheet gets it the man lifted his eyebrows excuse me i waggled the remote click boom no more shroud the snakeman hissed body twisting in restless lithe motion and the demongirl parted her lips in a snarl the man between them stared at me for a moment his eyes flat and empty before he said youre bluffing like the bedsheet matters to me i said the man stared at me without moving but his shadow did it writhed and undulated and the motion made me feel vaguely carsick his eyes went from me to valmont to the couriers message tube on the floor a remote detonator i take it you do realize you are standing next to the device i realized it i had no idea how big the incendiary was but that was all right since i had no idea which button to push to set it off either yup you would kill yourself rather than surrender the shroud rather than letting you kill me who said i would kill anyone i glared at him and at the demongirl and said francisca garcia mentioned it the mans shadow boiled but he watched me with flat calculating eyes perhaps we can reach an arrangement which would be he drew a heavycaliber handgun from his pocket and pointed it at anna valmont give me the remote and i wont kill this young woman the demon groupie headman uses a gun youve got to be kidding me i said call me nicodemus he glanced at the revolver trendy i know but one can only watch so many dismemberments before they become predictable he pointed the gun at the terrorstricken valmont and said shall i count to three i threw on a puppets transylvanian accent count as high as you vant but you vont get one one detonator ah ah ah one nicodemus said do you expect me to hand it over on reflex or something youve done such things repeatedly when there was a woman in danger harry dresden two this nicodemus knew me and hed picked a pressure tactic that wasnt going to take long however it turned out so he knew i was stalling for time crap i wasnt going to be able to bluff him hold on i said he thumbed back the hammer of the revolver and aimed at valmonts head thr so much for cleverness all right i snapped and i tossed the remote to him underhand here you go nicodemus lowered the gun turning to catch the remote in his left hand i waited until his eyes flicked from valmont to the remote and then i pulled up every bit of power i could muster in that instant hurled my right hand forward and snarled fuego fire rose up from the floor in a wave as wide as the doorway and rolled forward in a surge of superheated air it expanded as it lashed out and slammed into nicodemuss bloodied chest the force of it threw him back across the hallway and into the wall on the opposite side he didnt quite go through the wall but only because there must have been a stud lined up with his spine the drywall crumpled in from his shoulders to his hips and his head snapped back in a whiplash of impact it almost seemed that his shadow was thrown back with him slapping wetly against the wall around him like blobs of tar the snakeman moved with blinding speed slithering to one side of the blast the demongirl shrieked and her bladed tresses gathered together in an effort to shield her as the fire and concussion threw her back and away from the door the heat was unbearable an ovenhot flash that sucked the air from my lungs backwash from the explosion drove me back across the floor rolling until i hit the wall myself i cowered and shielded my face as the scarlet flames went out replaced with a sudden cloud of ugly black smoke my ears rang and i couldnt hear anything but the hammering of my own heart the fire spell had been something i wouldnt have done if id had an option thats why i had made a blasting rod downanddirty fast magic was difficult dangerous and likely to run out of control the blasting rod helped me focus that kind of magic contain it it helped me avoid explosions that left heat burns on my lungs i fumbled around in the blinding smoke unable to breathe and unable to see i found a feminine wrist with one hand followed it up to a shoulder and found anna valmont i hauled on her with one hand found the couriers tube with the other and crawled for the ventilation duct hauling them both behind me there was air in the ventilation shaft and valmont coughed and stirred as i dragged her into it enough of the storage room had caught on fire that i had light enough to see one of valmonts eyebrows was gone and one side of her face was red and blistered i screamed move at her as loudly as i could her eyes blinked with dull comprehension as i pushed her past me and toward the opening in the laundry room and she started moving stiffly in front of me valmont didnt crawl as quickly as i wanted her to but then she wasnt the one closest to the fire and the monsters my heart hammered in my ears and the shaft felt oppressively small i knew that the demonic forms of the denarians were tougher than either me or anna valmont unless id gotten lethally lucky theyd recover from the blast and it wouldnt be long before they came after us if we couldnt shake them or get into a car and fast theyd catch us plain and simple i shoved at valmont growing more frantic as my imagination turned up images of whipping tendrils cutting my legs to shreds or venomous serpent fangs sinking into my calves as scaled hands dragged me backward by my ankles valmont tumbled out of the air shaft and into the laundry room i followed her closely enough to make me think of a program id seen about howler monkey mating habits my ears were starting to get their act together and i heard the high buzzing ring of a fire alarm in the hallway outside harry susan said she looked between valmont and me and helped the woman to her feet whats happening i got to my feet and choked out we need to be gone right now susan nodded at me and then shoved me hard i went stumbling sideways and into the wall of drying machines slamming my shoulder and head i looked back to see the demongirls hair pureeing its way out of the vents and then the rest of the denarian came out scales claws and all rolling to all fours with dizzying grace fast as the denarian was susan was faster the demongirl came up with those rich lips split into a snarl and susan drove her heel right into them she kicked hard enough that something crunched and the demongirl screamed in surprise and pain susan i shouted look i was going to say out but there wasnt time half a dozen bunches of tendrils drove at susan like spears susan dodged them all of them she had to fling herself across the room to the washing machines to do it and the denarian regained her balance and pursued more blades drove toward susan but she ducked to one side one hand ripping open the door to one of the washing machines susan slammed the door down on the demongirls hair and without missing a beat kicked the denarians reversejointed knee in sideways the demongirl shrieked in pain struggling i knew she was strong enough to pull free of the washing machine before long but for the moment she was trapped susan reached up and tore a folddown ironing board from where it was mounted on a nearby wall then she spun around and slammed it edgeon into the denarian susan hit her three times in the wounded leg the small of the back and the back of the neck the denarian shrieked at the first two blows and then collapsed into a limp heap at the third susan stared down at the demongirl for a moment dark eyes hard and hot the ironing boards metal frame was now bent and twisted from the force of the blows susan had dealt with it susan took a deep breath and then tossed the ironing board to one side straightened her hair with one hand and commented bitch wow i said are you all right harry susan asked she wasnt looking at me yeah i said wow susan walked over to the counter where shed left her clutch she opened it got the phone and said ill have martin pick us up at the exit i shook myself into motion and helped draw anna valmont to her feet what exit susan pointed wordlessly at a fireescape diagram on the wall still not looking at me she spoke maybe a dozen quiet words into the phone and then folded it shut hes coming theyre evacuating the hotel well need to i felt a surge of magical energies the air around susan grew darker and then coalesced into a cloud of shadows within a heartbeat the cloud deepened then solidified into a writhing tangle of snakes of all sizes and colors wrapped all around susan the air suddenly filled with the sound of hissing and buzzing rattles i saw the snakes begin to strike fangs flashing susan let out a scream i turned to the doorway and saw the snakeman denarian standing in it one notquitehuman hand was held out toward susan his serpent mouth was rolling out hissing sounds and i could feel the thrumming tension in the air between the denarians outstretched hand and susan rage flooded over me and i barely stopped myself from throwing out another blast of raw spellfire at the snakeman with that much rage behind it id probably have killed everyone in the room instead i reached out to the air in the hallway beyond the denarian and pulled it all toward him the words ventas servitas thundering off my lips a column of wind hit the snakeman from behind lifted him from the floor and flung him across the room he slammed into the wall of washing machines driving a footandahalfdeep dent in one of them and let out a wailing hissing whistle of what i hoped was surprise and pain susan flung herself onto the ground rolling tearing at snakes flinging them away i could see flashes of her honeybrown skin and saw the black dress tearing droplets of red blood appeared on the floor near her on her skin and on the discarded snakes but they were hanging on she was tearing herself apart in her panic to remove the snakes i closed my eyes for a second that felt a year long and gathered together enough will to attempt to disrupt the denarians spell i formed the counterspell in my head and hoped to god that i didnt misjudge how much power id need to undo it too little and the spell might actually get stronger like steel forged in a flame too much and the counterspell could unleash the power of both spells in a random destructive flash of energies i focused my will on the cloak of serpents over susan and lashed out at them with my power letting loose the counterspell with a snarled entropus the counterspell worked the serpents writhed and thrashed around for a second and then imploded vanishing leaving behind nothing but a coating of clear glistening slime in their place susan scrambled away still gasping still bleeding her skin shone wet and slick with the residue of the conjured serpents rivulets of blood laced her arms and one leg and thick black bruises banded the skin of one arm one leg her throat and one side of her face i stared for a second the darkness on her skin wasnt bruising it gained shape as i watched resolving itself from vague discoloration to the dark sharp lines of a tattoo i watched the tattoo come into being over her skin all curves and points maoristyle it began on her cheek under one eye and wound down around her face around the back of her neck and on down over one collarbone and into the neckline of her evening gown it emerged again winding down along her left arm and left leg finishing at the back of her hand and over the bridge of her left foot she hauled herself to her feet panting and shaking the swirling designs lending a savage aspect to her appearance she stared at me for a moment her eyes dark and enlarged the irises too big to be human they filled with tears that didnt fall and she looked away the snakeman recovered enough to slither his way vertical again looking around he focused yellow snake eyes on susan and let out a surprised wheeze fellowship he rasped the word a hiss fellowship here the denarian looked around and spotted the couriers tube still hanging by its strap from my shoulder its tail lashed about and the denarian darted toward me i slipped to one side keeping a table between us and shouted susan the snakeman struck the table with one arm and broke it in half then he came at me over the piecesuntil susan ripped a dryer out of the wall and threw it at his head the denarian saw it coming and dodged at the last second but the dryer clipped him and sent him sprawling he hissed again and slithered away from both of us shooting into the air shaft and out of sight i panted and watched the vent for a second but he didnt reappear then i hauled the stillstunned valmont toward the door and asked susan fellowship her lips pressed together and she averted her toolarge eyes not now i ground my teeth in frustration and worry but she was right the smoke was getting thicker and we had no way of knowing if tall green and scaly would be reappearing i pulled valmont along with me made sure i still had the shroud and followed susan out the door she ran along barefoot without breaking stride and between the pain in my lungs and the blond thiefs torpor i could barely keep up with her we went up a flight of stairs and susan opened a door on a pair of gorillas in red security blazers they tried to stop us susan threw a right and a left cross and we walked over them on our way out i kind of felt bad for them getting punched out by a dame was not going to pad their goon resumes we left the building through a side door and the dark limo was waiting martin standing beside it i could hear sirens people shouting the blaring horns of fire vehicles trying to get to the hotel martin took one look at susan and stiffened then he hurried over to us take her i rasped martin picked up valmont and carried her to the limo like a sleepy child i followed him martin put the blond thief in and got behind the wheel susan slipped in after her and i slung the tube off my shoulder to get in behind her something grabbed me from behind wrapping around my waist like a soft squishy rope i slapped at the car door but i managed only to slam it shut as i was hauled back off my feet i landed on the ground near the fire door harry susan shouted go i gasped i looked at martin behind the wheel of the limo i grabbed the shroud and tried to throw it at the car but something pinned my arm down before i could get out get help no susan screamed and tried for the door martin was faster i heard locks click shut on the limo then the engine roared and the car screamed into the street and away i tried to run something tangled my feet and i couldnt even get off the ground i turned to find nicodemus standing over me the hangmans noose the only thing he wore that wasnt soaked with blood his shadow his freaking shadow was wrapped around my waist my legs my hands and it moved and wriggled like something alive i reached for my magic but the grasping shadowcoils grew suddenly cold colder than ice or frosted steel and my power crumbled to frozen powder beneath it one of the shadowcoils took the couriers tube from my numbed hands curling through the air to hand it to nicodemus excellent he said i have the shroud and i have you harry dresden what do you want i rasped just to talk nicodemus assured me i want to have a polite conversation with you blow me his eyes darkened with cold anger and he drew out the heavy revolver great harry i thought thats what you get for trying to be a hero you get to eat a sixpack of ninemillimeter bonbons but nicodemus didnt shoot me he clubbed me over the head with the butt of the gun light flashed in my eyes and i started to fall i was out before my cheek hit the ground chapter twentyone the cold woke me i came to my senses in complete darkness under a stream of freezing water my head hurt enough to make the wound on my leg feel pleasant by comparison my wrists and shoulders hurt even more my neck felt stiff and it took me a second to realize that i was vertical my hands bound together over my head my feet were tied too my muscles started jumping and twitching under the cold water and i tried to get out from under it the ropes prevented me the cold started cutting into me it hurt a lot i tried to get loose working my limbs methodically testing the ropes trying to free my hands i couldnt tell if i was making any progress thanks to the cold i couldnt even feel my wrists and it was too dark to see i got more scared by the moment if i couldnt work my hands free i might have to risk using magic to scorch the ropes hell i was cold enough that the thought of burning myself had a certain appeal but when i started trying to reach out for the power to manage it it slithered away from me then i understood running water running water grounds magical energies and every time i tried to get something together the water washed it away the cold grew more intense more painful i couldnt escape it i panicked thrashing wildly dull pain flaring in my bound limbs and fading away into numbness under the cold i screamed a few times i think i remember choking on water while i tried i didnt have much energy after a few minutes i hung panting and hurting and too tired to struggle any more the water only getting colder bound limbs screaming i hurt but i figured the pain couldnt possibly get any worse a few hours went by and showed me how wrong i was a door opened and firelight stabbed at my eyes i would have flinched if i had been able to move that much a couple of large blocky men came through the door carrying actual flaming torches the light let me see the room the wall beside the door was finished stone but the walls all around me were a mishmash of fallen rubble and ancient brick and one was made of curved concretesome kind of piping for the citys water system i supposed the ceiling was all rough earth some stone some roots water poured down from somewhere over me and vanished down a groove worn in the floor they had taken me to undertown a network of caves ruined buildings tunnels and ancient construction that underlay the city of chicago undertown was dark damp cold full of various creatures that shunned sunlight and human company and might have been radioactive the tunnels where the manhattan project had been housed were just the start of undertown the people who knew of its existence didnt come down herenot even wizards like meunless matters were desperate no one knew their way around down here and no one would be coming to find me been working out pretty hard i muttered to the two men my voice a croak one of you guys got a cold beer maybe a freeze pop they didnt so much as look at me one man took up a position on the wall to my left the other took the wall to my right i should have cleaned up i know i told them if id realized i was having company id have taken a shower mopped the floor no answer no expression on their faces no nothing tough room i said youll have to forgive them said nicodemus he came through the door and into the torchlight freshly dressed shaved and showered he wore pajama pants slippers and a smoking jacket of hugh hefner vintage the grey noose still circled his throat i like to encourage discretion in my employees and i have very high standards sometimes it makes them seem standoffish you dont let your goons talk i asked he removed a pipe from his pocket along with a small tin of prince albert tobacco i remove their tongues i guess your human resources department isnt exactly under siege is it i said he tamped tobacco into his pipe and smiled youd be surprised i offer an excellent dental plan youre going to need it when the formalwear police knock your teeth out this is a rented tux his dark eyes glittered with something ugly little maggies youngest youve grown up to be a man of considerable strengths i stared at him for a long second shivering and startled into silence my mothers name was margaret and i was her youngest as far as i knew i had been an only child but i knew precious little of my parents my mother died giving birth to me my father had suffered an aneurism when i had been about six years old i had a picture of my father on a piece of yellowed newspaper i kept in a photo album it showed him performing at a childrens benefit dinner in a small town in ohio i had a polaroid instant picture showing my father and my mother her stomach round with pregnancy standing in front of the lincoln memorial i wore my mothers pentacle amulet around my neck it was scarred and dented but thats to be expected when you run around using it to kill werewolves they were the only concrete things i had left of my parents id heard stories before that my mother hadnt run with a very pleasant crowd nothing of substance just inferences made from passing comments id had a demon tell me that my parents had been murdered and the same creature had hinted that i might have relatives id shied away from the whole concept deciding that the demon had been a dirty liar and given that nicodemus and chauncy worked for the same organization i probably couldnt trust the denarian either he was probably lying probably but what if he wasnt keep him talking i decided fish for information it wasnt like i had a lot to lose and knowledge was power i might find out something that would give me some kind of edge nicodemus lit the pipe with a match and puffed on it a few times watching my face with a little smile on his lips he read me easily i avoided looking at his eyes harry may i call you harry would it matter if i told you no it would tell me something about you he said id like to get to know you and i would rather not make this a trip to the dentist if i can avoid it i glared at him shivering under the freezing water the bump on my head pounding and my limbs aching beneath the ropes ive got to askjust what kind of freaking dentist do you go to ortho de sade smokin joe mengele dds nicodemus puffed on the pipe and regarded my bonds another expressionless man came in this one older thin with thick grey hair he pushed a roomservice cart he unfolded a small table and set it up over to one side where the water wouldnt splash on it nicodemus toyed with the bowl of his pipe dresden may i be frank with you i figured the cart would open up to show an array of hardware intended to frighten me with its potential torture applications if its okay with frank i guess i dont mind nicodemus watched the valet set out three folding chairs and cover the table with a white cloth you have faced a great many dangerous beings but by and large they have been idiots i try to avoid that whenever i am able and that is why you are bound and held under running water youre afraid of me i said boy youve destroyed three rival practitioners of the arts a noble of the vampire courts and even one of the faerie queens they underestimated you as well as your allies i dont i suppose you could think of your current position as a compliment yeah i muttered shaking freezing water out of my eyes youre way too kind nicodemus smiled the valet opened the cart and something far more diabolical than torture hardware was there it was breakfast the old valet started setting out food on the table hash browns some cheese some biscuits bacon sausages pancakes toast fruit and coffee dear god hot coffee the smell hit my stomach and even frozen as it was it started crawling around on the inside of my abdomen trying to figure out how to get away and get some food nicodemus sat down and the valet poured him some coffee i guess pouring his own was beneath him i did try to keep you out of this affair yeah you seem like such a sweet guy youre the one who edited the prophecy ulsharavas told me about youve no idea how difficult it is to waylay an angelic messenger uh huh i said so whyd you do it nicodemus was not too important to add his own cream no sugar his spoon clinked on the cup i have a fond memory or two of your mother it cost me little to attempt it so why not thats the second time youve mentioned her i said yes i respected her which is quite unusual for me you respected her so much you snatched me and brought me here i see nicodemus waved his hand it worked out that way i needed someone of a certain metaphysical mass you interfered in my business you were convenient and you fit the recipe recipe what recipe he sipped at his coffee and closed his eyes in enjoyment the bastard i take it that this is the portion of the conversation where i reveal my plans to you what have you got to lose and apparently you expect me to tell you of any vulnerabilities i might have as well i am wounded by the lack of professional respect this implies i ground my teeth chicken he picked up a piece of bacon and nibbled at it it is enough for you to know that one of two things will happen oh yeah master of repartee thats me indeed either you will be freed and sit down to enjoy a nice breakfast he picked up a slightly curved and sharplooking knife from the table or i will cut your throat as soon as i finish eating he said it scarywithout any melodrama to it at all matteroffact the way most people say that they need to take out the trash ye olde join up or die ultimatum i said gee no matter how many times i get it that one never goes out of style your history indicates that you are too dangerous to leave alive im afraidand i am on a schedule nicodemus said a schedule he was working against a time limit then im really inconvenient that way dont take it personal i dont he assured me this isnt easy for either of us id use some sort of psychological technique on you but i havent gotten caught up on some of the more recent developments he took a piece of toast and buttered it then again i suppose not many psychologists can drive chariots so perhaps it balances out the door opened again and a young woman came into the room she had long sleeptousled dark hair dark eyes and a face a little too lean to be conventionally pretty she wore a kimono of red silk belted loosely so that gaps appeared as she moved she evidently didnt have anything on underneath it like i said undertown is cold the girl yawned and stretched lazily watching me as she did she too spoke with an odd vaguely british accent good morning and you little one harry dresden i dont believe youve been introduced to my daughter deirdre i eyed the girl who seemed vaguely familiar we havent met yes we have deirdre said reaching out to pluck a strawberry from the breakfast table she took a slow bite from it lips sealed around the fruit at the harbor ah madame medusa i presume deirdre sighed ive never heard that one before its so amusing may i kill him father not just yet nicodemus said but if it comes to that hes mine deirdre nodded sleepily have i missed breakfast nicodemus smiled at her not at all give us a kiss she slid onto his lap and did with tongue yuck after a moment she rose and nicodemus held one of the chairs out for her as she sat down he reseated himself and said there are three chairs here dresden are you sure you wouldnt like to take breakfast with us i started to tell him what he could do with his third chair but the smell of food stopped me i suddenly felt desperately painfully hungry the water got colder what did you have in mind nicodemus nodded to one of the goons the man walked over to me drawing a jewelry box out of his pocket he opened it offering it out to me i mimed a gasp but this is so sudden the goon glared nicodemus smiled inside the jewelry box was an ancient silver coin like the one id seen in the alley behind the hospital the tarnish on the coin was in the shape of another sigil you like me you really like me i said without enthusiasm you want me to join up you neednt if you do not wish to nicodemus said i just want you to hear our side of things before you make up your mind to die needlessly accept the coin have some breakfast with us we can talk after that if you dont want to have anything to do with me you may leave youd just let me go sure if you accept the coin i doubt id be able to stop you so what says i wouldnt turn around and use it against you nothing nicodemus said but i am a great believer in the benevolence of human nature like hell he was do you actually think you could convince me to join up with you yes he said i know you do not do too he replied i know more about you than you do yourself such as such as why you chose this kind of life for yourself to appoint yourself protector of mortal kind and to make yourself the enemy of any who would do them harm to live outcast from your own kind laughed at and mocked by most mortals living in a hovel barely scraping by spurning wealth and fame why do you do it im a disciple of the tao of peter parker obviously i said i guess nicodemus was a dc comics fan because he didnt get it it is all you will allow yourself and i know why all right why because you are ruled by fear you are afraid dresden i said of what of what you could be if you ever let yourself stray from the righthand path nicodemus said of the power you could use youve thought about what it might be like to bend the world to your will the things you could have the people some part of you has considered and found joy in the idea of using your abilities to take what you wish and you are afraid of that joy so you drive yourself toward martyrdom instead i started to deny his words but i couldnt he was right or at least not wholly wrong my voice came out subdued everyone has thoughts like that sometimes no nicodemus said they dont most people never consider such actions it never crosses their minds the average mortal would have no sure way of taking that kind of power but for you its different you may pretend you are like them but you are not thats not true i replied of course it is nicodemus said you might not like to admit it but that makes it no less true its denial there are a number of ways you express it in your life you dont want to see what you are so you have very few pictures of yourself no mirrors either i ground my teeth im not different in any way that matters im not any better than anyone else we all put our pants on one leg at a time granted nicodemus said but a century from now your mortal associates will be rotting in the earth whereas barring amputation or radical shifts in fashion you will still be putting your pants on one leg at a time all these allies and friends you have made will be withered and gone while you are just beginning to come into your full strength you look like a mortal dresden but make no mistake you arent one oh shut up you are different you are a freak in a city of millions you are all but alone which explains my dating life i said but i couldnt put much zing in the words something in my throat felt heavy nicodemus had the valet pour coffee for deirdre but he spooned sugar into it himself youre afraid but you dont have to be youre above them dresden theres an entire world waiting for you uncounted paths you could take allies who would stand with you over the years who would accept you instead of scorning you you could discover what happened to your parents avenge them find your family find a place where you truly belonged hed chosen to use words that struck hard on the oldest wound in me a childs pain that had never fully healed it hurt to hear those words it stirred up a senseless old hope a yearning it made me feel lost empty alone harry nicodemus said his voice almost compassionate i used to be much as you are now you are trapped you are lying to yourself you pretend to be like any other mortal because you are too terrified to admit that you arent i didnt have an answer for that the silver coin gleamed still offered out to me nicodemus laid one hand on the knife again im afraid i must ask you for an immediate decision deirdre looked at the knife and then at me eyes hot she licked some spilled sugar off the rim of her coffee cup and remained silent what if i did take the coin if nicodemus was on the level i could at least live to fight another day i had no doubts that nicodemus would kill me as he had gaston larouche francisca garcia and that poor bastard butters had cut into there was nothing stopping him and with the water still running over me i doubted that even my death curse would be at one hundred percent i couldnt stop myself from imagining what it would feel like to bleed to death there under the cold water a hot burning line on my throat dizziness and cold weakness fading into warmth that became perfect endless darkness death god help me i didnt want to die but id seen the poor bastard ursiel had enslaved and driven mad what hed suffered was worse than death and chances were that if i took the coin the demon that came with it might coerce or corrupt me into the same thing im not a saint im not even particularly sterling morally speaking ive had dark urges before ive been fascinated by them attracted to them and more than once ive given in to them it was a weakness that the demon in the ancient coin could exploit i wasnt immune to temptation the demon the fallen would drown me in it its what the fallen do i made my decision nicodemus watched me eyes steady his knife hand perfectly still lead us not into temptation i said but deliver us from evil isnt that how it goes deirdre licked her lips the goon shut the box and stepped back are you certain dresden nicodemus said in a quiet voice this is your very last chance i slumped weakly there didnt seem to be much of a point to bravado anymore id made the call and that was that im certain fuck off nick nicodemus stared at me impassively for a moment then he stood up with the knife and said i suppose ive had enough breakfast chapter twentytwo nicodemus walked over to me his expression somewhat distracted i realized with a chill that he looked like a man planning his activities for the day to nicodemus i wasnt a person anymore i was an item on his checklist a note in his appointment book he would feel no differently about cutting my throat than he would about putting down a check mark when he got within arms reach i couldnt stop myself from trying to get away from him i thrashed at the ropes hanging on to the desperate hope that one of them might break and give me a chance to fight to run to live the ropes didnt break i didnt get loose nicodemus watched me until id exhausted myself again then he took a handful of my hair and pulled my chin up and back twisting my head to my right i tried to stop him but i was immobilized and exhausted be still he said ill make it clean do you want the bowl father deirdre asked nicodemuss expression flickered with annoyance his voice came out tight and impatient where is my mind today porter bring it to me the grey haired valet opened the door and left the room a heartbeat later there was a wheezing grunt and porter flew back through the doorway and landed on his back he let out a pained croak and curled into a fetal position nicodemus sighed turning bother what now nicodemus had looked bored when anna valmont emptied her gun into him when id blasted a nicodemusshaped dent in the drywall of the hotel hed come through it without a ruffled hair but when he saw the valet laying on the ground before the open door nicodemuss face went pale his eyes widened and he took a pair of quick steps to stand behind me his knife at my throat even his shadow recoiled rolling back away from the open door the jap nicodemus snarled kill him there was a second of startled silence and then the goons went for their guns the one nearest the door didnt get his weapon out of its holster shiro still in the outfit hed worn at mcannallys came through the opening in a flash of black and white and red his cane in his hand he drove the end of the cane into goon as neck and the thug dropped to the ground goon b got his gun out and pointed it at shiro the old man bobbed to his left and then smoothly rolled right the gun went off and sparks flew up from two of the walls as the bullet ricocheted shiro drew fidelacchius clear of its wooden sheath as he spun closer to the goon the movement so fast that the sword looked like a blurred sheet of shining steel goon bs gun went flying through the air his shooting hand still gripping it the man stared at the stump at the end of his arm as blood gouted from it and shiro spun again one heel rising to chin level the kick broke something in the wounded goons jaw and the man collapsed to the damp floor shiro had taken out three men in half as many seconds and he hadnt stopped moving fidelacchius flashed again and the chair beneath deirdre collapsed spilling her onto the floor the old man promptly stepped on her wealth of dark hair whirled the sword and brought its tip down to rest against the back of deirdres neck the room became almost completely silent shiro kept his blade to deirdres neck and nicodemus did the same to mine the little old man didnt look like the same person id talked to not that he had physically changed so much as that the sheer presence of him was differenthis features hard as stone weathering the years only to grow stronger when he had moved it had been with a dancers grace speed and skill his eyes flashed with a silent strength that had been concealed before and his hands and forearms were corded with muscle the swords blade gleamed red with blood and torchlight nicodemuss shadow edged a bit farther back from the old man i think the freezing water was blending in with my sudden surge of hope and making me a little loopy i found myself drunkenly singing speed of lightning roar of thunder fighting all who rob or plunder underdog be quiet nicodemus said you sure i asked cause i could do mighty mouse if youd rather underdog had this whole substanceuse issue anyway nicodemus pressed the knife a bit harder but my mouth was on autopilot that looked fast i mean im not much of a fencer but that old man looked amazingly quick to me did he look that quick to you bet that sword could go right through you and you wouldnt even realize it until your face fell on your feet i heard nicodemuss teeth grind harry shiro said quietly please i shut up and stood there with a knife at my throat shivering aching and hoping the wizard is mine nicodemus said hes through you know that he chose to be a part of this yes shiro said you cannot take him from me shiro glanced pointedly at the goons lying on the floor and then at the captive he held pinned down maybe yes maybe no take your chances with it and the wizard dies youve no claim of redemption here shiro was quiet for a moment then we trade nicodemus laughed my daughter for the wizard no ive plans for him and his death will serve me as well now as later harm her and i kill him now shiro regarded the denarian steadily i did not mean your daughter i suddenly got a sick feeling in my stomach i almost heard nicodemuss smile very clever old man you knew id not pass the opportunity by i know you shiro said then you should know that your offer isnt enough nicodemus said not by half shiros face did not show any surprise name it nicodemuss voice dropped lower swear to me that you will make no effort to escape that you will summon no aid that you will not release yourself quietly and let you keep me for years no but i will give you this day twentyfour hours it is enough i shook my head at shiro dont do this i knew what i was doing michael will need your nicodemus delivered a swift jab to my right kidney and i lost my breath be silent he said he focused his attention on shiro and inclined his head slowly twentyfour hours agreed shiro mirrored the gesture now let him go very well nicodemus said as soon as you release my daughter and lay down your sword the wizard will go free i swear it the old knight only smiled i know the value of your promises and you know the value of mine i felt an eager tension in my captor he leaned forward and said swear it i do shiro said and as he did he placed his palm lightly along the base of his swords blade he lifted it to show a straight cut on his hand already dribbling blood set him free i will take his place as you demand nicodemuss shadow writhed and boiled on the ground at my feet bits of it lashing hungrily toward shiro the denarian let out a harsh laugh and the knife left my neck he made a couple of quick movements cutting the rope holding my wrists without the support of my bonds i fell my body screamed in pain it hurt so much that i didnt notice him cutting my feet free until it was done i didnt make any noise partly because i was too proud to let nicodemus know how bad i felt partly because i didnt have enough breath to whimper anyway harry shiro said get up i tried my legs and feet were numb shiros voice changed carrying a quiet note of authority and command get up i did it barely the wound on my leg felt hot and painful and the muscle around it twitched and clenched involuntarily foolishness nicodemus commented courage shiro said harry come over here get behind me i managed to lurch to shiros side the old man never looked away from nicodemus my head spun a bit and i almost lost my balance my legs felt like dead wood from the knees down and my back had started cramping i ground my teeth and said i dont know how far i can walk you must shiro said he knelt down by deirdre rested his knee on her spine and wrapped one arm around her throat she began to move but the old man applied pressure and deirdre went still again with a whimper of discomfort that done shiro gave fidelacchius a flick and the beads of blood upon it sprinkled against one wall he sheathed the blade in a liquid movement drew the canesheath from his belt and then passed the hilt of the sword back toward me take it uh i said i dont have a real good record with handling these things take it michael and sanya might not be too happy with me if i do shiro was quiet for a moment before he said they will understand take it now i swallowed and did the wooden hilt of the sword felt too warm for the room and i could sense a buzz of energy emanating from it in rippling waves i made sure i had a good grip on it shiro said quietly they will come for you go second right ladder up nicodemus watched me as i fell back through the doorway into the dimness of the hall beyond it i stared at shiro for a moment he knelt on the floor still holding deirdres neck at the breaking point his eyes on nicodemus from the back i could see the wrinkled skin on the back of his neck the age spots on his freshly shaved scalp nicodemuss shadow had grown to the size of a movie screen and it covered the back wall and part of the floor twitching and writhing slowly closer to shiro i turned and headed down the tunnel as quickly as i could behind me i heard nicodemus say keep your word japan release my daughter i looked back shiro released the girl and stood up she flung herself away from him and as she did nicodemuss shadow rolled forward like an ocean wave and crashed over the old knight one moment he was there the next the room where he stood went totally black filled with the rasping seething mass of nicodemuss demon shadow kill the wizard nicodemus snarled get the sword deirdre let out wild primal scream from somewhere inside the darkness i heard ripping tearing sounds i heard popping noises that might have been bones breaking or joints being dislocated then i heard the steely slithery rasp of deirdres hairdo and half a dozen metallic strands whipped toward me from the darkness i shuffled back and the blades fell short of me i turned around and started hobbling away i didnt want to leave shiro there but if id stayed i only would have died with him my shame dug at me like a knife more blades emerged from the dark presumably while deirdre was still transforming into her demonic aspect it couldnt be long before she finished and came flashing down the hallway after me if i couldnt get myself clear id be done for so once again i ran like hell and hated myself for doing it chapter twentythree the shrieks died off more quickly than i would have thought and i did my best to keep moving in a straight line it was mostly dark i was aware of a couple of doorways passing on my left and i stumbled along until i found the second one on my right i took it and found a ladder that led up some kind of pipe or shaft with a light shining down from about seven hundred miles above i got a couple of rungs off the floor when something hit me at knee level grabbed my legs and twisted i fell off the ladder the cane clattering onto the floor i had a brief impression of a mans face and then my attacker let out a wordless snarl and hit me hard on my left eye i ducked and rolled with the punch the good news was that it didnt tear my face off or anything which meant that the person throwing the punch was probably another mortal the bad news was that he was built more heavily than me and probably had a lot more muscle he piled atop me trying to grasp my throat i hunched my shoulders and ducked my head as much as i could and kept him from squeezing my head off he threw another punch at me but its tough to throw a good punch when youre rolling around on the floor in the dark he missed and i started fighting dirty i reached up and raked my nails across his eyes i got one of them and he yelled flinching away i managed to wriggle out from under him giving him a hard shove that added to the momentum of the flinch he fell rolled and started to rise i kicked him in the head with my rented formal shoes my shoe went flying off which i was pretty sure never happened to james bond the goon faltered wobbling so i kicked him with the other foot he was tough he started coming back from that one too i bent over and slammed my fist down sledgehammer style at the back of his neck several times i was shouting as i did it and the edges of my vision burned with a film of red the rabbit punches dropped him and he fell limp to the ground son of a bitch i panted feeling around until i found shiros cane i didnt get my ass kicked good day to get that lottery ticket susan said she came down the last several feet of ladder dressed again in the black leather pants the dark coat she checked to make sure the goon wasnt faking it wheres shiro i shook my head he isnt coming susan took a breath and then nodded can you climb think so i said eyeing the ladder i held out the cane take this for me susan reached out to take the blade there was a flicker of silver static and she hissed jerking her fingers back what the hell is that magic sword well it sucks susan said go ahead ill come up behind you i fumbled around with the cane slipping it as best i could through the tuxs cummerbund i started up the ladder and once again deirdre shrieked this time her voice wholly demonic echoing weirdly through the stone corridors wasnt that susan asked shaking her fingers yeah climb i said climb fast the action and adrenaline had done something to thaw me out or at least it felt that way my fingers tingled but they were functional and i gained speed as i climbed howd you find me shiro susan responded we went to michaels house for help he seemed to know where to go like instinct i saw michael do that once i said panting he told me he knew how to find where he was needed how long is this freaking ladder another twenty or thirty feet susan said comes out in the basement of an empty building south of the loop martins waiting with the car why did that guy talk about a fellowship when he saw you back at the auction i asked what fellowship its a long story condense it later but i didnt get to protest any further because i slipped and nearly fell when i reached the top of the ladder i recovered my balance and scrambled up into a completely dark room i looked back over my shoulder and saw susan outlined a dim shadow against a faint greengold light whats that light i asked eyes susan said her voice was a little thready coming up move over i did susan slid onto the floor as the greengold light grew brighter and i heard the steely rasping sound of deirdres hair moving below susan turned and drew something from her jacket pocket there was a clinking clicking sound then she whispered one one thousand two one thousand three one thousand four one thousand and dropped something down the ladder she turned to me and i felt her fingers cover my eyes pushing me away from the ladder i got it then and leaned away from the shaft the ladder had come up just before there was a hellishly loud noise and a flash of light scarlet through susans fingertips my ears rang and my balance wavered susan helped me to my feet and started moving out through the darkness her steps swift and certain from the shaft i could dimly hear the demongirl shrieking in fury i asked was that a grenade just a stunner susan said lots of light and noise and you had it in your pocket i said no martin did i borrowed it i tripped over something faintly yielding in the darkness a limp form whoa what is that i dont know some kind of guard animal shiro killed it my next step squished in something damp and faintly warm that soaked through my sock perfect susan slammed a door open onto nighttime chicago and i could see again we left the building behind us and went down a flight of concrete steps to the sidewalk i didnt recognize the neighborhood offhand but it wasnt a good one it had that wary hardcore feel that made the jungle seem like mary poppins by comparison there was dim light in the skyevidently dawn was not far away susan looked up and down the street and cursed quietly where is he i turned and looked at susan the dark swirls and spikes of her tattoo still stood out dark against her skin her face looked leaner than i remembered another shrieking scream came from inside the building this is a really bad time for him to be late i said i know she said flexing her fingers harry i dont know if i can handle that demon bitch if she comes at us again she looked down at her own hand where the dark tattoos swirled and curved im almost out out i asked of what her lip lifted into a quiet snarl and she swept dark eyes up and down the street control ooooookay i said we cant just stand here we need to move just then an engine growled and a dark green rental sedan came screeching around the corner of the block it swerved across to the wrong side of the street and came up on the curb before sliding to a stop martin threw open the back door there was a cut on his left temple and a streak of blood had dried dark on his jaw tattoos like susans but thicker framed one eye and the left side of his face theyre behind me he said hurry he didnt have to tell either of us twice susan shoved me into the back of the car and piled in after me martin had the car moving again before shed shut the door and i looked back to see another sedan after us before wed gone a block a second car slid in behind the first and the two accelerated coming after us dammit martin said glaring at his rearview mirror what did you do to these people dresden i turned down their recruiting officer i said martin nodded and snapped the car around a corner id say they dont handle rejection well wheres the old man gone he exhaled through his nose these idiots are going to land us all in jail if this keeps up how bad do they want you more than most martin nodded do you have a safe house my place ive got some emergency wards i can set off they could keep out a mailorder record club i bobbed my eyebrows at susan for a while anyway martin juked the car around another corner it isnt far you can jump out well draw them off he cant susan objected he can barely move hes been hurt and he could go into shock he isnt like us martin martin frowned what did you have in mind ill go with him he stared up at the rearview mirror for a moment at susan its a bad idea i know its dangerous i know she said voice tight theres no choice and no time to argue martin turned his eyes back to the road and said are you sure yeah god be with you both then sixty seconds wait a minute i said what are you both martin screeched around another corner and roared ahead at top speed i bounced off the door on my side and flattened my cheek against the window i recognized my neighborhood as i did i glanced at the speedometer of the car and wished i hadnt susan reached across me to open the door and said we get out here i stared at her and then motioned vaguely at the door she met my eyes and that same hard delighted smile spread over her lips trust me this is kid stuff cartoons are kid stuff petting zoos are kid stuff jumping out of a car is insane you did it before she accused me the lycanthropes that was different yes you left me in the car susan crawled across my lap which appreciated her especially in the tight leather pants my eyes agreed with my lap wholeheartedly especially about the tight leather pants susan then crouched one foot on the floorboards one hand on the door and offered her other hand to me come on susan had changed in the last year or maybe she hadnt she had always been good at what she did shed just altered her focus to something other than reporting she could take on demonic murderers in handtohand combat now rip home appliances from the wall and throw them with one hand and use grenades in the dark if she said she could jump out of a speeding car and keep us both from dying i believed her what the hell i thought it wasnt like i hadnt done this beforealbeit at a fifth the speed but there was something deeper than that something darker that susans vulpine smile had stirred inside of me some wild reckless primal piece of me had always loved the danger the adrenaline had always loved testing myself against the various and sundry wouldbe lethalities that crossed my paths there was an ecstasy in the knife edge of the struggle a vital energy that couldnt be found anywhere else and part of me a stupid insane but undeniably powerful part missed it when it was gone that wildness rose up in me and gave me a smile that matched susans i took her hand and a second later we leapt from the car i heard myself laughing like a madman as we did chapter twentyfour as we went out the door susan pulled me hard against her on general policy i approved she got one arm around the back of my head shielding the base of my skull and the top of my neck we hit the ground with susan on the bottom bounced up a bit rolling and hit the ground again the impacts were jolting but i was on the bottom only once the rest of the time the impact was something i felt only through my contact with susan we wound up on the tiny patch of grass two doors down from my boardinghouse in front of some cheap converted apartments several seconds later the two pursuing cars went roaring by after martin and his rented sedan i kept my head down until they had passed and then looked at susan i was on top susan panted quietly beneath me one of her legs was bent at the knee half holding my thigh between hers her dark eyes glittered and i felt her hips twitch in the kind of motion that brought a number of evenings and mornings and afternoons and late nights to mind i wanted to kiss her a lot i held off you all right i asked you never complained she answered her voice was a little breathless nothing too bad you anything hurt my ego i said youre embarrassing me with the superstrength and whatnot i rose took her hand and drew her to her feet hows a guy supposed to assert his masculinity youre a big boy youll think of something i looked around and nodded i think wed better get off the street pronto is running and hiding assertively masculine we started for my apartment the part where we dont die is she nodded thats practical but im not sure its masculine shut up there you go susan said we went only a couple of steps before i felt the spell coming it started as a low shiver on the back of my neck and my eyes twitched almost of their own accord up to the roof of the apartment house we were walking by i saw a couple of bricks from one of the chimneys fall free of their mortar i grabbed susans collar and sidestepped pulling her with me the bricks shattered into shards and red powder on the sidewalk a step from susans feet susan tensed and looked up what was that an entropy curse i muttered a what i looked around struggling to sense where the next surge of magic might come from sort of a badluck spell a really really badluck spell preferred magic for getting rid of someone who annoys you who is doing it my guess snakeboy he seems to have some talent and he could have gotten some of my blood to target me with i felt another gathering surge of energy to my right and my eyes went to the power lines running overhead oh hell run susan and i broke into a sprint as we did i heard one of the power lines snap cables squealing the longer end of loose cable flew toward us trailing a cloud of blue and white sparks it hit the ground somewhere behind us my clothes hadnt yet dried out from nicodemuss guest accommodations if it had been raining the downed power line might have killed me as it was i felt a vibrating clenching tingle wash over my legs i almost fell but managed to get a few more paces away from the sputtering line and regained control of my legs i felt another magical strike building bringing a gust of wind with it but before i could zero in on it susan shouldered me to one side i fell to the ground just as i heard a loud cracking sound a branch as thick as my thigh slammed to the ground i looked up to see a strip of bare white bark showing along the trunk of the old tree behind my boardinghouse susan helped drag me to my feet and we ran the rest of the way to my apartment door even as we did i felt another strike building stronger than the last i fumbled open the lock while thunder rumbled through the predawn grey and we got inside i could still feel the curse growing and reaching for me it was a strong one and i wasnt sure that either my apartments threshold or my standard wards would be able to keep it out i slammed the door closed behind me locked it the room fell into darkness as i reached for the basket beside the door there was a waxy lump the size of my fist in it and i lifted it and slammed it hard against the door across the crack between the door and the jamb i found the wick standing out from the wax focused on it and drew in my will i murmured flickum bicus and released the magic and the wick suddenly glowed with a pure white flame around the room at precisely the same moment two dozen other candles of white and buttercolored wax also lit with a gentle flicker of white fire as they did i felt a sudden thrum of my own magic prepared months before raise into a rampart around my home the curse pulsed again somewhere outside and hammered against the barrier but my protection held the malevolent energy shattered against it boo ya snakeboy i muttered letting out a tense breath stick that in your scaly ass and smoke it the actionhero oneliner doesnt count if you mix metaphors susan said panting looks like no harry dresden action figures for me i answered did you get him slammed the door on his curse i answered we should be safe for a while susan looked around her at all the lit candles getting her breath back i saw her expression soften and turn a little sad wed eaten a lot of dinners here by candlelight wed done a lot of things that way i studied her features while she stood lost in thought the tattoos changed her i decided they changed the proportions and lines of her face they lent her features a sort of exotic remoteness an alien beauty thirsty i asked she shot me a look with a hint of frustration in it i lifted my hands sorry i didnt think she nodded turning a little away from me i know sorry coke yeah i limped to the icebox which was going to need more ice before long i didnt have the leftover energy to freeze the water again by magic i grabbed two cans of cocacola opened them both and took one to susan she took a long guzzle and i joined her youre limping she said when she was done i looked down at my feet only one shoe it makes me lopsided youre hurt she said her eyes were fastened on my leg bleeding it isnt too bad ill clean it up in a minute susans eyes never wavered but they got darker her voice grew quieter do you need help i turned a bit warily so that she couldnt see the injured leg she shivered and made an evident effort to look away the tattoos on her face were lighter nownot fainter but changing in colors im sorry harry im sorry but id better go you cant i said her voice remained very quiet very toneless you dont get it ill explain everything to you in a little while i promise but i have to leave i cleared my throat um no you dont get it you cant cannot literally what the defenses i put up have two sides and they dont have an off switch we literally physically cant leave until they go down susan looked up at me and then folded her arms staring at her coke can crud she said how long i shook my head i built them to run for about eight hours sunrise is going to degrade it a little though maybe four hours five at the most five hours she said under her breath oh god whats wrong she waved a hand vaguely ive been been using some of the power to be faster stronger if im calm it doesnt get stirred up but i havent been calm its built up inside of me water on a dam it wants to break free to get loose i licked my lips if susan lost control of herself there was no place to run what can i do to help she shook her head refusing to look up at me i dont know let me have some quiet try to relax something cold and hungry flickered in her eyes get your leg cleaned up i can smell it its distracting see if you can build the fire i said and slipped into my room closing the door behind me i went into the bathroom and closed that door too my firstaid kit had its own spot on one of the shelves i downed a couple of tylenol slipped out of the remains of my rented tux and cleaned up the cut on my leg it was a shallow cut but a good four inches long and it had bled messily i used disinfectant soap with cold water to wash it out then slathered it in an antibacterial gel before laying several plastic bandages over the injury to hold it closed it didnt hurt or at least i didnt pick it out from the background of aches and pains my body was telling me about shivering again i climbed into some sweats a tshirt and a flannel bathrobe i looked around in my closet at a couple of the other things id made for a rainy day i took one of the potions id brewed the ones to counter the venom of the red court and put it in my pocket i missed my shield bracelet i opened the door to the living room and susan was standing six inches away her eyes black with no white to them the designs on her skin flushed a dark maroon i can still smell your blood she whispered i think you need to find a way to hold me back harry and you need to do it now chapter twentyfive i didnt have much left in me in the way of magic i wouldnt until i got a chance to rest and recuperate from what nicodemus had done to me i might have been able to manage a spell that would hold a normal person but not a hungry vampire and that was what susan was shed gained strength in more senses than the merely physical and that never happened without granting a certain amount of magical defense even if in nothing but the naked will to fight snakeboys serpentcloud had been one of the nastier spells id seen and it had only slowed susan down if she came at me and it looked like she might i wouldnt be able to stop her my motto after the past couple of years was to be prepared i had something that i knew could restrain herassuming i could get past her and to the drawer where i kept it susan i said quietly susan i need you to stay with me talk to me dont want to talk she said her eyelids lowered and she inhaled slowly i dont want it to smell so good your blood your fear but it does the fellowship i said i struggled to rein in my emotions for her sake i couldnt afford to feel afraid i edged a little toward her lets sit down you can tell me about the fellowship for a second i thought she wouldnt give way but she did fellowship she said the fellowship of saint giles saint giles i said the patron of lepers and other outcasts like me theyre all like me you mean infected infected halfturned halfhuman halfdead there are a lot of ways to say it uh huh i said so whats their deal the fellowship tries to help people the red court has harmed work against the red court expose them whenever they can find a cure there is no cure i put my hand on her arm and guided her toward my couch she moved with a dreamy deliberation so the tattoos are what your membership card a binding she said a spell cut into my skin to help me hold the darkness inside to warn me when it is rising what do you mean warn you she looked down at her designcovered hand then showed it to me the tattoos there and on her face were slowly growing brighter and had turned a shade of medium scarlet to warn me when im about to lose control red red red danger danger danger the first night shed arrived when shed been tussling with something outside shed stayed in the shadows for the first several moments inside her face turned away shed been hiding the tattoos here i said quietly sit down she sat on the couch and met my eyes harry she whispered it hurts it hurts to fight it im tired of holding on i dont know how long i can i knelt down to be on eye level with her do you trust me with my heart with my life close your eyes i said she did i got up and walked slowly to the kitchen drawer i didnt move quickly you dont move quickly away from something that is thinking about making you food it sets them off whatever had been placed inside her was growingi could feel that see it hear it in her voice i was in danger but it didnt matter because so was she i usually keep a gun in the kitchen drawer at the time i had a gun and a short length of silverandwhite rope in there i picked up the rope and walked back over to her susan i said quietly give me your hands she opened her eyes and looked at the soft fine rope that wont hold me i made it in case an ogre i pissed off came visiting give me your hands she was silent for a moment then she shrugged out of her jacket and held her hands out wrists up i tossed the rope at her and whispered manacus id enchanted the rope six months before but id done it right it took barely a whisper of power to set the rope into motion it whipped into the air silver threads flashing and bound itself around her wrists in neat loops susan reacted instantly going completely tense i saw her set herself and strain against the ropes i waited watching for a full half a minute before she started shaking and stopped trying to break them she let out a shaking breath her head bowed hair fallen around her face i started to move toward her when she stood up legs spread enough to brace herself firmly and tried again lifting her arms i licked my lips watching i didnt think shed break the ropes but id underestimated people before her face her tooblack eyes scared me she strained against the ropes again the movement drawing her shirt up showing me her smooth brown stomach the winding swirls and barbs of her tattoo red and stark against her skin there were dark bruises over her ribs and patches of skin that had been scraped raw she hadnt come away from our tumble from martins car without being hurt after all after a minute more she hissed out a breath and sat down hair a tumbled mess around her face i could feel her eyes on me more than i could actually see them they didnt feel like susans eyes anymore the tattoos stood out against her skin red as blood i backed off again deliberately calmly and got the first aid kit out of the bathroom when i came back out she flung herself at me in blinding speed and utter silence id been expecting as much and snapped forzare the silver rope flashed with a glitter of blue light and darted toward the ceiling her wrists went with it and she was pulled completely from the floor her feet swung up and she twisted again in silence fighting the bonds on her she didnt get free and i let her swing there until her legs had settled again her toes barely touching the floor she let out a quiet sob and whispered im sorry harry i cant stop it its okay ive got you i stepped closer to examine the injuries on her midsection and winced god you got torn up i hate this im so sorry it hurt me to hear her voice there was enough pain in it for both of us shhhh i said let me take care of you she fell quiet then though i could sense flashes of that feral hunger in her i got a bowl of water a cloth and set to cleaning up the scrapes as best i could she quivered once in a while once she let out a pained groan the bruises went all the way up her back and she had another patch of abraded skin on her neck i put my hand on her head and pushed forward she bowed her head and let it hang forward while i tended to the wound while i did the quality of the tension changed i could smell her hair her skin their scent like candle smoke and cinnamon i became suddenly intensely aware of the curve of her back her hips she leaned back a little toward me bringing her body into contact with mine the heat of her something that could have singed me her breathing changed growing faster heavier she turned her head enough to look at me over her shoulder her eyes burned and her tongue flickered over her lips need you she whispered i swallowed susan i think maybe that dont think she said her hips brushed against the front of my sweats and i was abruptly so hard that it hurt dont think touch me somewhere i knew it wasnt the best of ideas but i laid the fingers of one hand on the curve of her waist wrapping them slowly to her heated skin soft smoothness caressed my hand there was a pleasure in it a primal possessive pleasure in touching her i ran my palm and spread fingers over her flank her belly in slow and light circles she arched at the caress her eyes closing and whispered yes over and over again yes i let the washcloth fall from my other hand and reached up to touch her hair more softness rich texture dark hairs gliding between my fingers i felt a second of gathering tension in her and then she whipped her head around teeth bared reaching for my hand i should have drawn my hand away instead i tightened my fingers in her hair and pulled back forcing her chin up and keeping her from reaching me i expected anger from her but instead her body became pliant again moving against me with a more willing abandon a languid smile spread over her lips and faded away to an openmouthed gasp as i slid my other hand up beneath the cotton shirt and ran my fingertips lightly over her breasts she gasped and at the sound all of my recent worry fear anger painit all faded away burned to ash by a sudden fire of raw need to feel her under my hand again to have the scent of her filling my headid dreamed of it on too many cold and lonely nights it wasnt the smart thing to do it was the only thing i slid both hands around her body teasing her breasts loving the way their tips hardened to rounded points beneath my fingers she tried to turn on me again but i jerked her back hard against me my mouth pressing against the side of her throat keeping her from turning her head it only excited her more need she whispered panting need you dont stop i wasnt sure i could have i couldnt get enough of the taste of her onto my lips impatient i shoved her shirt up over her breasts to the top of her back and spent a slow and delicious moment following the line of her spine with my lips and tongue tasting her skin testing its texture with my teeth some part of me struggled to remember to be gentle another part didnt give a damn feel taste indulge my teeth left small marks here and there on her skin and i remember thinking that they looked intriguing beside the curling scarlet designs that swept in a spiral around her body the dark leather of her pants blocked my mouth a sudden ugliness beneath my lips and i straightened with a snarl to get it out of my way for the record tight leather pants dont come off easily berserk lust is likely not the best frame of mind for removing them i didnt let that stop me she gasped when i started taking them off started squirming and wriggling trying to help me mostly it just drove me insane as she brushed against me as i watched her move in sinuous delicious need her panting gasps all had a quiet vocalization to them now a sound that both spoke of her need and urged me on i got the pants down over her hips there wasnt anything else beneath them i shivered and paused to spend another moment savoring her with my hands my mouth placing delicate kisses around the scrapes biting at unmarred skin to elicit more desperate movements louder moans the scent of her was driving me insane now she whispered a frenzied edge to her voice now but i didnt hurry i dont know how long i stood there kissing touching driving her cries into higher and more desperate pitches all i knew was that something id wanted needed longed for had come to me again at that moment there was nothing on earth in heaven or hell that meant more to me she looked over her shoulder at me eyes black and burning with hunger she tried for my hand again driven beyond words now i had to control her head again fingers knotted into her hair while my free hand got the interfering clothes out of the way she let out mewling sounds of raw need until i pulled her hips back against me feeling my way and in a rush of fire and silk felt my hardness press into her her eyes flew open wide out of focus and she cried out moving against me meeting my motion with her own i had a fleeting thought of slowing down i didnt neither of us wanted that i took her that way my mouth on her ear her throat one hand in her hair her hands stretched out over her body straining back to meet mine god she was beautiful she screamed and started shuddering and it was all i could do not to explode i fought away the inevitable for a little time more susan sagged down after a moment until with my hands with my mouth with the thrusts of my body i kindled the quiet moans once again to cries of need she screamed again the motions of her body swift liquid desperate and there wasnt any way i could keep her from driving me over the brink with her our cries mingled together as we intertwined the strain of muscles and bodies and hungers overwhelmed me pleasure like fire consumed us both and burned my thoughts to ash time drifted by and did not touch us when i recovered my senses i found myself on the floor susan lay on her stomach beneath me her stillbound arms laid out above her head not much time had passed both of us were still short of breath i shivered and felt myself still inside her i didnt remember releasing the spell that held the bonds up to the ceiling but i must have done it i moved my head to kiss her shoulder her cheek very softly her eyes blinked slowly open human again though her pupils were dilated until they all but hid the dark brown of her irises she didnt focus them she smiled and made a soft sound somewhere between a moan and a cats purr i stared at her for a moment until i realized that the designs on her face had gone dark again and had begun to fade away as i watched over the next few moments they vanished completely i love you she whispered i love you wanted that me too i said dangerous harry you could have been hurt i might have i leaned down and kissed the corner of her mouth silencing her you didnt its okay she shivered but nodded so tired i felt like nothing more than dropping off to sleep but instead i got to my feet susan let out a soft sound half pleasure and half protest i gathered her up and put her on the couch i touched the rope willing it to release her and it slid away from her skin coiling itself into neat loops in my hand i pulled a blanket from the back of the couch and folded it over her sleep i said get some rest you should i will promise but i dont think it would be a good idea to go to sleep near you susan nodded wearily youre right im sorry its okay i said should call martin the phone wont call out i said not until the defenses go down i didnt think her voice sounded particularly disappointed as she snuggled down a bit more onto my couch oh she said well have to wait it out then yeah i said i stroked her hair susan she touched my hand with hers and closed her eyes its all right i told you id never be able to separate the hungers with you it it was a release took some of the pressure off me i wanted it needed it did i hurt you she made a purring sound without opening her eyes maybe a little i didnt mind i shivered and said youre okay she nodded slowly as i can be get some rest harry yeah i said i touched her hair again and then shuffled into my bedroom i didnt shut the door i put my pillows at the foot of my bed so that i could see the couch when i lay down i watched her face graced by pale candlelight until my eyes closed she was so lovely i wished that she were with me chapter twentysix i opened my eyes a while later and saw susan standing in the living room her eyes closed she was crouched her hands held before her as if grasping an invisible basketball as i watched she moved arms and legs gliding through gentle circular motions tai chi it was a meditative form of exercise that had originally come from martial arts lots of people who practiced tai chi didnt realize that the movements they followed were beautiful slowmotion renditions of bonebreaking throws and joint locks i had a feeling susan knew she wore her tshirt and a pair of my running shorts she moved with the graceful simplicity of a natural talent honed by training a turn showed me her face her expression set in peaceful concentration i spent a minute watching her in silence cataloging my own aches and pains she suddenly smiled without opening her eyes and said dont start drooling harry my house i can drool as much as i want what was that rope you used she asked still going through her routine ive broken handcuffs before magic shoptalk i had hoped for some other kind of discussion or maybe id been nervous about it work talk held a certain appeal for me too it was safe faerie make i said has hair from a unicorns mane woven through it really i shrugged thats what fix said i imagine he knows would be handy to have around if the denarians showed up again dont you think not unless they came here i told her its set to this place take it out of here and it wouldnt work why not because im not that good yet i said its easy to make something that works at home takes a lot more knowhow than i have to take an enchantment on the road i got out of bed and got moving the clock said that it wasnt yet ten in the morning i hopped in and out of the shower dressed slapped a comb through my hair and decided that the rakish unshaven look was in by the time i got back out into the living room susan was dressed in the leather pants again and only four or five candles were still lit the defensive barriers were winding down what happened after martin took off from the hotel i asked susan slouched into a chair i tried to get him to stop he wouldnt we fought about it and he put a gun in my face i choked he what to be fair i wasnt being very rational hells bells martin didnt want to but i convinced him to go to michaels place i figured if anyone could get you out of a mess with the denarians it would be him seems reasonable to me i said i debated between coffee and cola the coke won by virtue of convenience susan nodded at me before i could get the question out of my mouth and i got her one too what about anna valmont she was in shock charity put her to bed did you call the police susan shook her head i thought she might have known something that would help we wouldnt be able to find out what it was if she was angry and locked away what did michael have to say about it he wasnt there susan said shiro was charity said that michael and someone named sanya hadnt come back from st louis and hadnt called i frowned and passed over the second can to her that doesnt sound like him i know they were worried she frowned or charity was i dont think shiro was worried at all it was almost as though hed been expecting all of it he was still dressed in the samurai clothes and he opened the front door before i could knock michaels done that kind of thing before fringe benefit of his job maybe susan shook her head god works in mysterious ways i shrugged maybe so did shiro say anything he just told martin where to turn left or right and where to park then he told me to give him two minutes lead and to get ready to get you back to the car he just smiled a little the whole time it would have been a little spooky on anyone else he seemed content maybe he just had a good poker face i toyed with my can has he has a good poker face susan arched an eyebrow i dont understand i dont think hes dead not yet he he agreed to give himself over to the denarians in exchange for them letting me go the head denarian guy said his name was nicodemus made shiro promise to not to fight back or escape for twentyfour hours that doesnt sound good i shivered yeah i figure theyre archenemies when shiro offered himself nicodemus looked like a kid on christmas morning susan sipped at her drink how bad are these people i thought of nicodemus and his knife of the sheer helplessness id felt as he drew my head back baring my throat i thought of sliced and diced corpses bad susan regarded me quietly for a moment while i stared at my drink harry she said finally you going to open that or just look at it i shook my head and popped the tab on the can my wrists felt sore and the skin around them had been pretty thoroughly abraded evidently nicodemus preferred regular old ropes to special unicornmane custom jobs sorry got a lot to think about yeah she said her own voice softening whats our next move i checked the candles three to go barrier will go down in maybe twenty minutes well call a cab pick up the beetle at mcannallys and head to michaels place what if the denarians are waiting outside for us i picked up my blasting rod from the stand in the corner by the door and twirled it around in my fingers theyll have to find their own cab and then i picked up my staff and leaned it against the wall by the door we tell michael and sanya what happened assuming theyre back uh huh i opened the kitchen drawer and got out my gun and its holster after that i ask the nice denarians to let shiro go susan nodded we ask i flipped open the cylinder on the gun and loaded it ill say pretty please i said and snapped the cylinder shut again susans eyes flashed count me in she watched me while i put on a shoulder rig and slipped the gun into it harry she said i dont want to break up the righteousvengeance vibe but there are a couple of questions that are really bothering me why do the denarians want the shroud and what are they going to do with it i said yeah i got an old squall jacket out of my room and slid it on it felt wrong i hadnt worn anything but my old canvas duster or the newer leather one susan had given me for the past several years i checked the candles and they had all gone out i laid my hand on the wall feeling for the defenses there was a faint echo of them left but nothing of substance so i went back out into the living room and called for a cab were good to go i think ive got an idea of what theyre doing but i cant be sure she straightened my jacket collar absently very sloppy of you didnt you get the megalomaniacal bragfest from this nicodemus he must have read that evil overlord list sounds like someone who intends to get things done he sure as hell had he let a couple things slip i think we can get ahead of him she shook her head harry when i went down there with shiro i didnt see much but i heard their voices through the tunnels there was she closed her eyes for a moment her expression one of faint nausea its hard for me to explain their voices gave me a strong impression shiro sounded like i dont know a trumpet clear and strong the other one his voice stank it was rotted corrupt i didnt understand what would have made susan say that maybe it was something that the vampires had done to her maybe it was something shed learned between tai chi classes maybe it was just pure intuition but i knew what she was talking about there was a sense to nicodemus of something quiet and still and dangerousof something patient and vile and malicious beyond the scope of mortal understanding he scared the hell out of me i know what you mean nicodemus isnt another misguided idealist or some greedy bastard out to make money i said hes different susan nodded evil and he plays hardball i wasnt sure if i was asking susan or myself but i said you ready she got her jacket on i went to the door and she followed the one bad thing about the duster she mused i could never see your butt i never noticed if you went around noticing your own ass id worry about you harry i looked over my shoulder at her smiling she smiled back it didnt last long both of our smiles turned a little sad susan i said she put two fingertips to my lips dont dammit susan last night shouldnt have happened she said her voice sounded tired but her eyes stayed steady on mine it doesnt change anything i finished i sounded bitter even to me she took her hand away and buttoned up the dark leather jacket right i said i should have stuck to shoptalk i opened the door and looked outside cabs here lets get to work chapter twentyseven i grabbed my staff blasting rod and shiros cane and made a note to get myself a freaking golf bag we took the cab to mcannallys the blue beetle was still in the nearby lot and it hadnt been stolen vaporized or otherwise mishandled what happened to your back window susan asked one of marcones goons winged a few shots at me outside the larry fowler studio susans mouth twitched you went on larry fowler again i dont want to talk about it uh huh and what about the hood little holes are from marcones thug big dent was a chlorofiend i said a what plant monster oh why dont you just say plant monster i have my pride your poor car i got out my keys but susan put her hand on mine and walked a circle around the car she crouched down and looked beneath it a couple of times then said okay i got in thank you double oh seven but no one bombs a volkswagen theyre too cute susan got in the passenger door and said cute confetti if you arent careful harry i grunted revved up the car and puttered to michaels place the morning was cold and clear winter hadnt yet given up its grip on the great lakes and where lake michigan went chicago went too susan got out and looked around the front lawn frowning from behind black sunglasses how does he manage to make this place so nice run his own business and fight demons on the side he probably watches a lot of those homeandgarden shows i said she frowned the grass is green its february and his grass is green doesnt that strike you as strange sod works in mysterious ways she made a disgusted sound and then followed me up the walk to the door i knocked a moment later father forthill said whos there donny and marie i responded saltnpepa asked us to fill in for them he opened the door smiling from behind his goldrimmed glasses he was the same short stocky balding old forthill but he looked strained and tired the lines of his face had grown deeper than i remembered hello harry father i said you know susan he looked at her thoughtfully by reputation he said come in come in we did and as i came in forthill set a louisville slugger baseball bat down in the corner i raised my eyebrows traded a look with susan and then put my staff and shiros cane beside the bat we followed forthill into the kitchen wheres charity i asked taking the children to her mothers house forthill said she should be back soon i let out a breath of relief anna valmont guest room sleeping i need to call martin susan said excuse me she stepped aside into the small study coffee doughnut father forthill asked i sat down at the table father youve never been closer to converting me he laughed the fantastic forthill saving souls one danish at a time he produced the nectar of the gods themselves in dunkin donuts paper sacks and styrofoam cups taking some for himself as well ive always admired your ability to make jokes when faced with adversity matters are grave i sort of noticed i said through a mouthful of glazed doughnut wheres michael he and sanya went to st louis to investigate possible denarian activity they were both arrested by the local police they what what for no charges were filed forthill said they were arrested held for twentyfour hours and released sand trap i said someone wanted them out of the way forthill nodded so it would seem i spoke to them about two hours ago theyre on their way back now and should be here soon then as soon as they get here we have to go get shiro back forthill frowned and nodded what happened to you last night i told him the short versionall about the art auction and the denarians but i elided over the details afterward which were none of his chaste business and which would have embarrassed me to tell im not particularly religious but come on the man was a priest when i finished forthill took off his glasses and stared hard at me he had eyes the color of robins eggs and they could be disturbingly intense nicodemus he said quietly are you sure that is what he called himself yeah without a doubt yeah we had a nice chat forthill folded his hands and exhaled slowly mother of god harry could you describe him for me i did while the old priest listened oh and he was always wearing a rope around his neck not like a ships hawser a thin rope like clothesline i thought it was a string tie at first forthills fingers reached up to touch the crucifix at his throat tied in a noose yeah what did you think of him he asked i looked down at my halfeaten doughnut he scared the hell out of me hes bad i guess wrong the word you are looking for is evil harry i shrugged ate the rest of the doughnut and didnt argue nicodemus is an ancient foe of the knights of the cross forthill said quietly our information about him is limited he has made it a point to find and destroy our archives every other century or so so we cannot be sure who he is or how long he has been alive he may even have walked the earth when the savior was crucified didnt look a day over five hundred i mumbled how come some knight hasnt gone and parted his hair for him theyve tried forthill said hes gotten away forthills eyes and voice stayed steady hes killed them hes killed all of them more than a hundred knights more than a thousand priests nuns monks three thousand men women children and those are only the ones listed in the pages recovered from the destroyed archives only two knights have ever faced him and survived i had a flash of insight shiro is one of them thats why nicodemus was willing to trade me for him forthill nodded and closed his eyes for a moment likely though the denarians grow in power by inflicting pain and suffering on others they become better able to use the strength the fallen give them and they gain the most from hurting those meant to counter them hes torturing shiro i said forthill put his hand on mine for a moment his voice quiet calming we must have faith we may be in time to help him i thought the whole point of the knights was to deal out justice i said the fists of god and all that so why is it that nicodemus can slaughter them wholesale for much the same reason any man can kill another forthill said he is intelligent cautious skilled ruthless like his patron fallen angel i guessed at the name badassiel forthill almost smiled anduriel he was a captain of lucifers after the fall anduriel leads the thirty fallen who inhabit the coins nicodemus wasnt seduced into anduriels domination its a partnership nicodemus works with fallen as a nearequal and of his free will no one of the priesthood of any of the knightly orders of the knights of the cross has so much as scratched him the noose i guessed the rope its like the shroud isnt it it has power forthill nodded we think so yes the same rope the betrayer used in jerusalem how many denarians are working with him i take it that they probably dont get along with each other you are correct thank god nicodemus rarely has more than five or six other denarians working with him according to our information usually he keeps three others nearby snakeboy demongirl and ursiel yes how many coins are running around the world only nine are accounted for at this time ten with ursiels coin so nicodemus could theoretically have nineteen other fallen working with him plus a side order of goons goons goons normal hired hands they looked like ah they arent normal forthill said from what we have been able to tell they are almost a small nation unto themselves fanatics their service is hereditary passed on from father to son mother to daughter this gets better and better i said harry forthill said i know of no tactful way to ask this so i will simply ask did he give you one of the coins he tried i said i turned him down forthills eyes stayed on my face for a moment before he let out a breath i see do you remember the sigil upon it i grunted in affirmation picked up a chocolatecovered jelly and drew the symbol in the chocolate with a forefinger forthill tilted his head frowning lasciel he murmured lasciel i said it came out muffled since i was licking chocolate off my finger the seducer forthill murmured he smeared his finger over the chocolate erasing the sigil lasciel is also called the webweaver and the temptress he said between licks though it seems odd that nicodemus would want to free her typically she does not follow anduriels lead a rebel angel among rebel angels perhaps forthill said it is something better not discussed for now susan stepped out of the little office a wireless phone to her ear all right she said to the phone and walked past us jerking one hand at us to tell us to follow her father forthill lifted his eyebrows and we went out to the carpenter familys living room it was a fairly huge room divided into several clumps of furniture the television was in the smallest clump and still looked about three sizes too small susan marched over to it flicked it on and flipped through stations she stopped on a local station a news report that showed a helicopter angle of a building being consumed by a raging fire about a dozen yellowandred fire trucks circled around it but it was obvious that they were only containing the fire the building was lost whats this forthill asked dammit i snarled and turned away from the television pacing its the building shiro took us to last night susan said the denarians were in some tunnels beneath it not anymore i snapped theyve left and covered their tracks hell theyve had what six hours they could be a couple of states away by now nicodemus forthill said its his style well find them susan said quietly how i asked she pressed her lips together and turned away from me she spoke quietly into the phone i couldnt hear what she said but it had that endofconversation tone to it she turned the handset off a moment later what can we do i can go to the underworld i said call up some answers from there but i cant do it until the sun sets forthill said quietly you mustnt do that its far too dangerous none of the knights would want i slashed my hand through the air cutting him off we need information or shiro is going to die not only that but if we dont run down nicodemus he gets to do whatever badness hes getting ready to do with the shroud if i have to go to downbelow for answers then thats where i go what about michael susan asked couldnt he find shiro the way shiro found harry forthill shook his head not necessarily it isnt something he can control at times the knights are given that kind of discernment but they cant call it up at will i checked my watch figuring up distances michael and sanya should be back here in what an hour or so barring further difficulties forthill said fine well see if the side of the angels wants to pitch in if they dont im calling chauncy up as soon as the sun goes down i took the phone from susan and walked out of the room where are you going susan asked to talk to anna valmont and after that im going to call my client on the off chance i survive i want to look like i at least tried to be professional charity kept a guest room that had slowly been engulfed in a jungle of fabric clear boxes full of the stuff in every imaginable color stood stacked against one wall and a small sewing machine sat on a table barely visible among neatly folded stacks of more more boxes of fabric had been stacked into a rampart around a single bed which was occupied by a lump buried underneath several quilts i turned on a small lamp on the sewing table and hoped that the room wouldnt burst into flame anna wake up the lump made a mumbling sound and stirred before settling again i turned the phone on and let the dial tone sound in the rooms silence i know youre awake miss valmont and you know that i saved your ass back at the marriott so if you dont sit up and talk to me right now im calling the cops to come pick you up she didnt move i punched in a number and let the phone start to ring bastard she muttered with the british accent it came out bahstuhd she sat up her expression wary holding the covers to her front her shoulders were bare very well what do you want my coat for starters i said but since i doubt youre palming it ill settle for the name of your buyer she stared at me for a moment before she said if i tell you that it could kill me if you dont im turning you over to the police she shrugged which while unpleasant wont kill me besides you intend to turn me over in any case i scowled at her i saved your life twice i am aware of that she said she stared through me for a moment before she said its so hard to believe even though it happened to me it seems mad like a dream you arent crazy i said or at least you arent hallucinating or anything she half laughed i know cisca is dead gaston is dead it happened to them my friends her voice broke and she started blinking very quickly i just wanted to finish it so that they didnt die for nothing at all i owed it to them i sighed look ill make this easy for you was it marcone she shrugged without focusing her eyes we went through an intermediary so i cant be sure but was it marcone valmont nodded if i had to guess i would say it was the buyer was someone with a great deal of money and local influence does he know that you know one doesnt mention to the buyer that you know who he is when he is taking precautions to prevent it its impolite if you know anything about marcone you know that he isnt going to pay you off and let you walk away without delivering i said she rubbed at her eyes ill offer to return it good idea assuming he doesnt kill you before you finish offering she glared at me for a second angry and crying what do you want from me i picked up a box of tissues from behind a bunch of yellow cotton on the table and offered it to her information i want to know everything its possible youve heard or seen something that might help me recover the shroud help me out and i might be able to buy you some time to leave town she took the box and blotted her eyes on a tissue how do i know you will deliver on that promise earth to larceny spice come in larceny spice ive saved your life twice i think you can safely assume goodwill she looked down biting her lip i i dont know this is a limitedtime offer she drew in a shaking breath all right all right let me clean up a little get dressed ill tell you what i know fine i said come on theres a shower in the bathroom at the end of the hall ill get you towels and stuff is this your house friends but ive stayed here before she nodded and fished around until she came up with the black shirt shed been wearing the night before she slipped into it and rose she had long pretty and bruised legs and as she stepped onto her right leg she let out a pained cry and fell forward i caught her before she could hit the ground and she leaned into me lifting her right foot from the floor bloody hell she wheezed i must have twisted my ankle last night she shot me a hardeyed glance hands i jerked my hand off something pleasantly smooth and firm sorry accident can you manage she shook her head balanced on one leg i dont think so lend me your arm a moment i helped her hobble down the hall and into the bathroom i dug some more towels out of the linen closet then passed them into her through a mostly closed door she locked it behind her and started the shower i shook my head and went back down the hall dialing father vincents phone number on the fifth ring he answered his voice sounding tired and strained vincent its harry dresden i said i know where the shroud came into chicago and who was buying it got intercepted by a third party and they have it now youre certain vincent demanded yeah do you know where it is not exactly but im going to find out i should know by this evening maybe sooner why will it take until this evening vincent asked well uh its a little hard to explain i said perhaps the police should handle the rest of the investigation id advise against it why i have some information that indicates your mistrust may not have been misplaced oh vincent said his voice sounded worried i think we should meet and talk mister dresden id rather not discuss this over the phone two oclock at the room we spoke in last i can probably do that i said until then said vincent and hung up i paced back into the living room and found susan sitting and reading the morning paper with coffee and a doughnut one of the sliding glass doors that had previously led to the back patio was open and on the other side was a lot of bare wood and plasticthe addition michael was building the rasping of a saw came through the open door i stepped out and found father forthill at work hed taken off his coat and collar he had a shortsleeved black shirt underneath he wore leather work gloves and safety glasses he finished sawing a beam and blew dust off the cut before rising how is father vincent sounds tired i said im going to talk to him later assuming we dont have something going on first i worry for him forthill said he held up the beam to the top of what would eventually be a window here hold this for me i did forthill started driving in a few nails clenching several in his teeth and miss valmont taking a shower shes going to cooperate with us forthill frowned taking a nail from his lips i really wouldnt have expected that from her from the sense i had of her its my charming personality i said the ladies cant resist mmmm forthill said around the nails its the only decent thing to do and her back is against a wall right forthill drove the nail in and frowned he looked at me i looked back at him for a moment and then said ill just go check on her i got about halfway across the living room before i heard a car door shut immediately followed by a car engine i ran to the front door and threw it open just in time to see the shattered rear window of the blue beetle zipping down the street and out of sight i fumbled at my pockets and groaned my keys were missing son of a bitch i snarled i punched the door frame in sheer frustration i didnt punch it very hard i was angry not looking to break my own knuckles the old stumble and bump and i fell for it susan stepped up beside me and sighed harry you idiot youre a good man but an idiot where women are concerned first my coat and now my car thats freaking gratitude for you susan nodded no good deed goes unpunished i stared at her are you laughing at me she faced me from behind a perfectly straight face but her voice sounded a little choked no you are her face turned pink and she shook her head laughing at my pain she turned and walked back to the living room and picked up her paper she sat down and held it up so that i couldnt see her face choked sounds came out from behind the paper i stalked back out to the addition growling forthill looked back at me his eyebrows raised give me something to break or hit really hard i told him his eyes sparkled youll hurt yourself here hold this for me i lifted another cut board into place while forthill reached up to hammer it in as he did the sleeve of his shirt tugged up and showed me a pair of green lines wait i said and snapped my hand over to his arm the board slipped out of my other hand and bonked me on the head on the way down i scowled at it wincing but tugged the sleeve up forthill had a tattoo on the inside of his right arm an eye of thoth what is this i demanded forthill looked around and tugged his sleeve back down a tattoo duh a tattoo i know that what does it mean its something i had done when i was younger he answered an organization i belonged to i tried to calm down but my voice still sounded harsh what organization forthill blinked mildly at me i dont understand why you are so upset harry what organization he continued to look confused just several of us who took our orders together we were barely more than boys really and wed well wed happened on to some of the stranger events of our day and records of others a vampire had killed two people in town and we stopped it together no one believed us of course of course i said what about the tattoo forthill pursed his lips thoughtful i havent thought about it in so long well the next morning we went out and got the tattoos we swore an oath to be always watchful against the forces of darkness to help one another whenever we could then what after the hangovers faded we went a very good distance out of our way to make sure none of the senior clergy saw them forthill responded smiling faintly we were young and then and then no other supernatural events presented themselves over the next few years and the five of us drifted apart until i heard from vittoriofrom father vincent last week i hadnt spoken to any of them in years wait vincent has a tattoo like this i suppose he could have had it removed he might be the sort to do that what about the others in the group passed away over the last several years forthill said he stripped off one of the work gloves and regarded his weathered hand back then i dont think any of us thought we would ever live to be so old the wheels spun in my head and i got it i understood what was happening and why on pure intuition i stalked to the front of the house gathering up my things on the way father forthill followed me harry i walked past susan who set her paper aside and stood up to follow me harry i got to the front door and jerked it open the engine of michaels white pickup rattled to a halt as i did and he and sanya got out of the truck they looked a little rumpled and unshaven but fine michael blinked at me and asked harry i think i just saw a woman driving your car toward the highway whats going on get anything you need for a fight i said were going chapter twentyeight when father vincent answered my knock i kicked the door into his face as hard as i could he fell back with a grunt of surprise i came into the room with father forthills louisville slugger in my hands and jabbed the broad end of the bat into vincents throat the old priest made a sick croaking sound and clutched at his neck on the way to the floor i didnt let it stop there i kicked him in the ribs twice and when he rolled over trying to get away from me i stomped down on the back of his neck drew my gun and shoved it against his skull dio vincent whimpered panting dio wait please dont hurt me i dont have time to play pretend i said drop the act please mister dresden i dont know what you mean he coughed panting and i saw droplets of scarlet dripping onto the carpet id bloodied his nose or maybe his lip he turned his head a tiny bit eyes wide with panic please dont do anything to me i dont know what you want but im sure that we can talk about it i drew back the hammer on the revolver and said im sure that we cant his face went white no wait im getting tired of playing pretend three but i dont know he choked and i heard him trying not to retch you have to tell me two i said im not going to elaborate about the other number you cant you cant one i said and pulled the trigger in the instant between the word and the deed vincent changed a sheath of green scales appeared over his skin and his legs twined together into a serpents long and sinuous body the eyes went last changing to vertically slit yellow orbs while a second set of glowing green eyes opened above the first the trigger came down on an empty chamber click the snake twisted to bite me but i was already getting out of the way michael came through the door his unshaven face set in grim determination amoracchius blazing with its own white light the snakeman whirled to face michael with a hiss michael tried for a clean horizontal cut but the snakeman ducked under it and went for the door in a streak of gleaming green scales when the snakeman went out the door sanya brought a fourfoot length of twobysix down on its head the blow drove the snakemans chin flat to the ground it twitched a couple of times and then lay still you were right michael noted he slipped the sword away into its sheath better get him back inside before some maid sees him i said michael nodded grabbed the snakemans tail and hauled him back into the hotel room sanya looked in nodded and set the end of the length of heavy board down with a certain amount of satisfaction i realized hed used the thing with one arm good grief i needed to get to the gym good the big russian said let me put this back in the truck and i will join you a few minutes later the snakeman woke up in the corner of the hotel room with me michael and sanya standing over him his tongue flickered out and in a few times and his two sets of eyes darted around the room what did i miss it hissed the last word came out with an extra large helping of s sounds a tattoo i said father vincent had a tattoo on the inside of his right arm there was no tattoo the snakeman insisted maybe it was covered with all the blood you made a stupid mistake its understandable most criminals arent all that bright so you were working uphill from the getgo the snakeman hissed shifting its scales restlessly a cobralike hood flaring around its neck and shoulders michael drew amoracchius sanya did the same with esperacchius the two blades threw pure white light over the snakeman and he subsided flinching back from them what do you want to talk i said see the way it works is that i ask you questions you answer them and as long as you do well all be happy and if i dont the snakeman hissed i get a new pair of boots the snakes scales and coils twined around on one another rasping its eyes remained on the two knights ask heres what i figure happened somehow your glee club heard that the churchmice were being hired to find and take the shroud you thought youd just nip it from them on their way out of town but you missed you caught gaston larouche but he didnt have the shroud so you tortured him until he told you everything and after he told us everything the snakeman said nicodemus was indulging his little bitch i think its sweet to see a father and daughter doing things together so you found out what larouche knew killed him and left his body where it would be found pointed at where the shroud was going you figured youd let the mortal authorities do the work of finding them for you and take the shroud when they did drudge work unworthy of us youre gonna hurt my feelings snakeboy you found out who the church was sending over then you grabbed poor father vincent at the airport you took his place any infant could reason as much the denarian hissed i pulled up a chair and sat heres where it gets interesting because you decided to hire me on why why do you think to keep tabs on the knights i said or to distract them by making them try to keep me out of the search or maybe you thought i could really turn up the shroud for you probably all three no sense doing things for one reason when you can fit in a few ulterior motives for free you even gave me a sample of the shroud to make it more likely id find it i leaned back in the chair thats where i started seeing something wrong i talked to marcone about his new thug gunning for me and he blinked i dont know what you are talking about the snakeman said marcone was the buyer a cold laugh slithered out of the snakemans mouth a mortal nothing more yeah well the mortal figured out that father vincent had been replaced and he sent an assassin to kill you the new guy wasnt shooting at me outside of fowlers studio he was after you impossible the snakeman said pride goeth legs marcone wasnt born yesterday i am sure you have pleased yourself with your cleverness wizard it gets better i said brightly see nicodemus didnt let much drop other than that he was on a deadline and he needed someone savvy to the supernatural his daughter did though she asked if he didnt want a silver bowl thats a ceremonial bowl and if i was guessing id say it was meant to be used to catch lifeblood fuel a ritual the snakemans tail lashed around restlessly i think father vincent was a warmup a test for the ritual i think he came over here with two samples from the shroud and you used one of them as the focus for the plague curse that killed him once you knew it would work you went after the shroud itself you know nothing wizard said the snakeman the glowing sigil on his forehead throbbed in time with the extra set of eyes you are pathetic youre hurting my feelings dont make me get the baseball bat i said nicodemus covered his tracks this morning by burning down the building youd been in i suppose he sent you to cover everything up nice and neat with the cops and with me i think hes got something in mind and i think its tonight so why not make this a comparatively pleasant discussion and tell me all about it do you think that you frighten me wizard said the denarian i was destroying men more powerful than you before this pathetic nation was born where is nicodemus and what is he doing with the shroud ill give you a hint its got something to do with a plague curse i have served nicodemus since since my last dental appointment i get it i said but let me point something out to you nicodemus isnt here i held my palms out to either side of me vanna whitestyle these two gentlemen are very much here and very much angry sanya stared at the denarian the saber in his hand swishing back and forth a little he growled it was enough to make me want to edge away from him look i told him were going to find nicodemus and push his face in were going to shut down whatever hes got in mind and were going to get shiro back and youre going to tell us what we need to know or michael said in a very quiet voice i end you the snakeman stared at me for a very long time then he started to rasp and shake it took me a minute to realize that he was laughing at me snakes werent really meant for laughter it didnt sit well on a serpentine body you cannot threaten me he said there is nothing you can do to me i see a couple of holy swords here that make me think otherwise no the denarian said he reached up to his forehead and clawed at the sigil there as if trying to peel off his own skin the symbol flashed and then faded along with the second set of eyes the whole of him rippled scales abruptly melting away for a second the features of father vincent emerged from beneath the scales then they too faded away replaced by a mans pinched and hardened features he was dark of skin maybe moorish and he wasnt big five feet and a little change and not more than onefifty average height several centuries ago the man lowered his hand and let a slightly tarnished silver coin roll across the floor to michaels feet my name is quintus cassius and i have long been slave to the will of the demon saluriel his dark eyes glittered with malice and his tone dripped with sarcasm i beg you for mercy and the chance to mend my ways how ever can i thank you sir knight for saving me from that torment shit he was playing the morality card i shot a glance at michael the big man frowned at snakeboy cassius but didnt miss a beat in drawing out a white handkerchief embroidered with a silver cross and folding the coin up in it michael and sanya exchanged a long look and then both of them put away their swords uh guys what the hell are you doing dangerous demon murderer here remember harry michael said we cant not if hes surrendered the coin and asked mercy what i demanded thats stupid of course it is cassius said glee danced in his voice they know that i am not sincere they know i will turn on them at the first opportunity that i will obtain one of the other coins and return to what i have done for centuries i stood up angry enough that the chair fell over michael if you turn the other cheek on this bastard hell tear it off your face youre supposed to be the freaking fist of god no im not harry michael said the purpose of the knights is not to destroy those who serve evil indeed not cassius said somehow there was more of a hiss in his voice now than when hed been a snake theyre here to save us to save them i stared at michael is he kidding michael shook his head no one else can face the denarians harry no one else can challenge the fallen this moment might be the only chance cassius has to turn aside from what he has chosen to change his path great im all for changing his path lets change it to a direct line to the bottom of lake michigan michaels expression was pained the knights are here to protect freedom to give those who are under the oppression of dark forces the chance to win free of them i cannot sit in judgment on this mans soul harry dresden not for you not for anyone all i can do is remain faithful to my calling give him the chance to see hope for his future to show him the love and compassion any human being should show another the rest is out of my hands i watched cassiuss face while michael spoke his expression changed it became harder more brittle and bitter what michael said had touched him i didnt believe for a second that it had touched cassius enough to change his mind but it touched him enough to drive him toward fury i turned to michael and said do you really think that thing is going to start sipping of the milk of human kindness no michael said but that doesnt change my purpose he has surrendered his coin and the influence of it the rest is not for sanya or me to decide it is cassiuss choice youve seen these things i snarled stalking over to face michael ive seen the corpses theyve left they would have killed me susan youhell all of uswithout blinking an eye god only knows what they have in mind with that curse theyre putting together all power has its limits harry he shook his head this is the limit of mine without really thinking about it i shoved his shoulder they might already have killed shiro and youre going to let this bastard walk michael caught my arm in one hand and twisted michael is strong i had to rise up onto my toes to relieve the pressure he put on my elbow and he shoved me back from him his eyes hard and cold and angry as hell i know that he said in that same deadly quiet voice i know theyve hurt him that theyre going to kill him just as shiro knew that nicodemus would betray his promise to set you free its one of the things that makes us different than they are harry the blood on their hands does not make it right to bloody my own my choices are measured against my own soul not against the stains on theirs he looked at cassius and the denarian flinched away from the silent flame in michaels expression it is not for me to judge his soul no matter how much i might want to hells bells i muttered no wonder nicodemus has killed so many knights if youre all as idiotic as this harry michael began i interrupted him look at him michael he isnt a victim hes a freaking collaborator that poor bastard rasmussen might have been dragooned into working with the denarians but cassius does it because he wants to do it theres no way for you to be sure of that harry sanya said why are you giving him a fair chance which of them has ever turned away from their coins sanya put his dark hand on my shoulder and said i did i looked back at him frowning i was of their number sanya said i was less experienced foolish proud i did not set out to be a monster but that much power corrupts shiro faced the fallen i had allowed in he exposed its lies and i made a better choice traitor said cassius his voice cold we handed you the world power glory everything you could have wanted sanya faced the man and said what i wanted you could never give me i had to find it for myself he extended a hand cassius you can leave them just as i did help us please and let us help you cassius leaned back as though sanyas hand might burn him and hissed i will eat your eyes we cant leave him here i said hell shoot us in the back hell try to kill us maybe michael said quietly and didnt move i wanted to be angry with sanya and michael but i couldnt im only human id flirted with dark powers before made stupid deals bad choices id been given a chance to work free of them or id have been dead long ago i understood what michael and sanya were saying and doing i understood why i didnt like it but i couldnt really gainsay it without making a hypocrite of myself there but for the lack of a demoninfested coin went i cassius started wheezing and laughing his dry contemptuous laugh run along he said run along ill think over your words reexamine my life walk the straight and narrow lets go michael said quietly we cant leave him i insisted the police arent going to have anything on him harry were not going to kill him were finished here have faith well find an answer somehow cassius laughed at michaels back as he walked out sanya followed him lingering to look back over his shoulder at me fools cassius murmured rising weak fools i picked up the bat again and turned to the door youre wrong i said to cassius weak cassius repeated the old man was screaming after only an hour you know nicodemus started with his back lashed him with chains then deirdre played with him i gave cassius a hard look over my shoulder he was sneering lip lifted from his teeth deirdre likes to break fingers and toes i wish id been able to stay longer i only got to pull out his toenails his smile widened eyes gleaming the woman the fellowship woman she is yours i felt my lip lift away from my teeth cassiuss eyes gleamed she bled prettily didnt she the next time i catch her you wont be there to disrupt my conjuration ill let the snakes eat her bite by bite i stared at him cassius smiled again but there is mercy for me is there not forgiveness indeed god is great i turned away from him again and said very quietly people like you always mistake compassion for weakness michael and sanya arent weak fortunately for you theyre good men cassius laughed at me unfortunately for you im not i spun around swinging the bat as hard as i could and broke cassiuss right kneecap he screamed in shock and sudden surprise and went down odd crackling sounds came from the joint i swung again and broke his right ankle cassius screamed i broke his left knee for him too and his left ankle he was thrashing around and screaming a lot so it took me maybe a dozen swings stop he managed to gasp stop stop stop i kicked him in the mouth to shut him up stomped his right forearm to the floor and crushed his hand with another half dozen swings i pinned his left arm down the same way and put the bat on my shoulder listen to me you worthless piece of shit you arent a victim you chose to be one of them youve been serving dark forces your whole life freddie mercury would say beelzebub has a devil put aside for you what do you think youre doing he gasped you cant you wont i leaned down and twisted his false priests collar half choking him the knights are good men im not and i wont lose a seconds sleep over killing you i shook him with each word hard enough to rattle his bloodied teeth where is nicodemus cassius broke sobbing his bladder had let go at some point and the room smelled like urine he choked and spat out blood and a broken tooth ill tell he gasped please dont i let his collar go and straightened where i dont know he said cowering away from my eyes he didnt tell me meeting him tonight was going to meet him tonight eight meet him where airport cassius said he started throwing up i kept his arm pinned so it mostly went all over himself i dont know exactly where what is he doing the curse hes going to unleash the curse use the shroud the old mans blood he has to be moving when he completes the ritual why curse is a contagion he has to spread it as far as he can more exposure to it make himself stronger aapocalypse i took my foot off of his arm and smashed the motels phone to pieces with the bat i found his cell phone and crushed it too then i reached into my pocket and dropped a quarter on the floor near him theres a pay phone on the other side of the parking lot past a patch of broken glass youd better get yourself an ambulance i turned and walked to the door without looking back if i see you againeverill kill you michael and sanya waited for me outside the door sanyas face held a certain amount of satisfaction michaels expression was grave worried his eyes on mine it had to be done i said to michael my voice sounded cold hes alive its more than he deserves perhaps michael said but what you did harry it was wrong a part of me felt sick another part felt satisfied i wasnt sure which of them was bigger you heard what he said about shiro about susan michaels eyes darkened and he nodded it doesnt make it right no it doesnt i met his eyes think godll forgive me michael was quiet for a moment and then his expression softened he clasped my shoulder and said god is always merciful what you did for him was actually quite generous sanya said philosophically relatively speaking he might be hurt but he is after all alive hell have a nice long while to reconsider his choices uh huh i said im a giver did it for his own good sanya nodded gravely good intentions michael nodded who are we to judge you his eyes flashed and he asked sanya did you see the snakes face right when harry turned with the bat sanya smiled and started whistling as we walked through the parking lot we piled into the truck drop me off at my place i said i need to pick up a couple things make some phone calls the duel michael asked harry are you sure you dont want me to leave it to me i said youve already got something on your plate i can handle things ill meet you at the airport afterward and help you find shiro if you live sanya said yes thank you comrade obvious the russian grinned was that a quarter you gave cassius yeah for the phone yeah michael noted phone calls cost more than that now i slouched back and allowed myself a small smile yeah i know sanya and michael burst out laughing michael pounded on the steering wheel i didnt join them but i enjoyed their laughter while i could the february sun was already sinking fast toward the horizon chapter twentynine back at my apartment i called murphy on her personal cell phone i used simple sentences and told her everything dear god murphy said can i summarize or what they can infect the city with this curse thing looks like i said how can i help weve got to keep them from getting it into the air they wont be on public transportation find out if any chartered planes are taking off between seven and eightthirty helicopters too hang on murphy said i heard computer keys clicking murphy saying something to someone a police radio a moment later she said voice tense theres trouble yeah there are a pair of detectives heading out to arrest you looks like homicide wants you for questioning theres no warrant listed crap i took a deep breath rudolph brownnosing rat murphy muttered harry theyre almost to your place youve only got a few minutes can you decoy them get some manpower to the airport i dont know murphy said im supposed to be a mile from this case and it isnt as though i can announce that terrorists are about to use a biological weapon on the city use rudolph i said tell him off the record that i said the shroud is leaving town on a chartered flight from the airport let him take the heat for it if they dont find anything murphy let out a harsh little laugh there are times when you can be a clever man harry it takes me by surprise why thank you what else can i do i told her youre kidding no we may need the manpower and si is out of this one just when i had hope for your intelligence too youll do it yeah cant promise anything but ill do it get moving theyre less than five minutes away gone thank you murph i hung up the phone opened my closet and dug into a couple of old cardboard boxes i kept at the back until i found my old canvas duster it was battered and torn in a couple of places but it was clean it didnt have the same reassuring weight as the leather duster but it did more to hide my gun than my jacket and it made me look cool well maybe cooler anyway i grabbed my things locked up my place behind me and got into martins rental car martin wasnt in it susan sat behind the wheel hurry i said she nodded and pulled out a few minutes later no one had pulled us over i take it martin isnt helping susan shook her head no he said he had other duties that took precedence he said that i did too what did you say that he was a narrowminded hidebound anachronistic egotistical bastard no wonder he likes you susan smiled a little and said the fellowship is his life he serves a cause what is it to you i asked susan remained silent for a long time as we drove across town how did it go we caught the impostor he told us where the bad guys would be later tonight what did you do with him i told her she looked at me for a while and then said are you all right fine you dont look fine its done but are you all right i shrugged i dont know im glad you didnt see it susan asked oh why youre a girl beating up bad guys is a boy thing chauvinist pig susan said yeah i get it from murphy shes a bad influence we hit the first traffic sign directing us toward the stadium and susan asked do you really think you can win yeah hell ortega is only the third or fourth most disturbing thing ive tangled with today but even if you do win what does it change me getting killed now that way i get to be killed later tonight instead susan laughed there was nothing happy in it you dont deserve a life like this i squinted my eyes and made my voice gravelly deserves got nothin so help me god if you quote clint eastwood at me im wrapping this car around a telephone pole do you feel lucky punk i smiled and turned my left hand palm up i felt her hand settle lightly on mine a moment later and she said a girls got to draw the line somewhere we rode the rest of the way to the stadium in silence holding hands i hadnt ever been to wrigley when it was empty that wasnt really the point of a stadium you went there to be among about a bajillion people and see something happen this time with acres and acres of unoccupied asphalt the stadium at its center looked huge and somehow more skeletal than when it was filled with vehicles and cheering thousands the wind sighed through the stadium gusting whistling and moaning twilight had fallen and the unlit street lamps cast spidery shadows over the lots darkness gaped in the arches and doorways of the stadium empty as the eyes of a skull thank god that isnt too creepy or anything i muttered what now susan asked another car pulled in behind us i recognized it from mcannallys the night before the car pulled up maybe fifty feet away and rolled to a stop ortega got out and leaned down to say something to the driver a man with a dark complexion and ambertone glasses there were two more men in the backseat though i couldnt see much of them i was betting they were all red court lets not look scared i said and got out of the car i didnt look at ortega but drew out my staff with me planted it on the ground and stared at the stadium the wind caught my coat and blew it back enough to show the gun on my hip now and again id traded in my sweats for dark jeans and a black silk shirt the mongols or somebody wore silk shirts because they would catch arrows as they entered wounds and enable them to pull barbed arrowheads out without ripping their innards apart i wasnt planning on getting shot with barbed arrows but weirder things have happened susan got out and walked up to stand beside me she stared at the stadium too and the wind blew her hair back the same way it did my coat very nice she murmured hardly moving her mouth thats a good look on you ortegas driver is about to wet his pants you say the nicest things to me we just stood there for a couple of minutes until i heard a deep rhythmic rumblingone of those annoyingly loud bass stereos in some morons car the rumbling got louder then there was a squealing of tires taking a tight turn and thomas pulled into the lot in a different white sports car than id seen him in the night before the music got louder as he sped across the lot and parked his car diagonally across the lines id unconsciously respected when id parked he killed the stereo and got out a small cloud of smoke emerging with him it wasnt cigarette smoke paolo thomas caroled he wore tight blue jeans and a black tshirt with a buffy the vampire slayer logo the laces to one of his combat boots were untied and he carried a bottle of scotch in his hand he pulled from it cheerfully and wove a drunken line to ortega thomas offered out the bottle his balance wobbling have a swig ortega slapped the bottle from thomass hand it shattered on the ground shpoilshport thomas slurred wavering hola harry hola susan he waved at us and all but fell down i was going to offer you some too but that plans been blown all to hell now maybe another time susan said a blue light appeared in one of the tunnels from the stadium a moment later a vehicle somewhere between a compact car and a golf cart rolled into the parking lot a whirling blue bubble light flashing on its roof with the quiet hum of electric motors it zipped over to us and stopped kincaid sat behind the steering wheel and nodded to the rear of the vehicle in were set up inside we walked over to the security cart ortega started to get on but i held up my hand to him ladies first i said quietly and gave susan my hand as she got on i followed her ortega and thomas followed thomas had put on a pair of headphones and was bobbing his chin in a vague fashion that was probably supposed to be in rhythm kincaid started up the cart and called over his shoulder where is the old man gone i said i jerked a thumb at susan had to go to the bench kincaid looked from me to susan and shrugged nice bench he drove us through several passages in the stadium somehow finding his way despite the fact that no lights were on and i could barely see eventually we rolled out onto the field from one of the bullpens the stadium was dark but for where three spotlights basted the pitchers mound and first and third base in pools of light kincaid drove to the pitchers mound stopped and said everyone out we did kincaid parked the cart over home plate then padded through the shadows to the visiting teams dugout theyre here he said quietly the archive emerged from the dugout carrying a small carved wooden box before her she wore a dark dress with no frills or ruffles and a grey cape held closed with a silver brooch she was still little still adorable but something in her bearing left no illusions about the difference in her apparent age and her knowledge and capability she walked to the pitchers mound not looking at anyone her focus on the box she carried she set it down very carefully and then lifted the lid from the top of the box and stepped back a wave of nauseating cold flooded out when she opened the box it went past me through me i was the only one there to react to it susan put her hand on my arm kept her eyes on ortega and thomas and asked harry my last meal had been a drivethrough taco on the way back from the meeting with cassius but it was trying to leave i kept it down and forced the sickening cold away from me with an effort of will the sensation lessened fine i said im fine the archive looked up at me child features solemn you know what is inside the box i think so ive never actually seen it seen what thomas asked instead of answering the archive drew a small box out of her pocket she opened the box and delicately plucked out an insect as long as her own fingersa brown scorpionby its tail she looked around to make sure she had everyones attention she did then she dropped the scorpion into the box there was an instant immediate sound somewhere between a wildcats scream and the sizzle of bacon hitting a hot skillet something that looked vaguely like a cloud of ink in clear water floated up out of the box it was about the size of a babys head dozens of shadowy tendrils held the scorpion drawing it up into the air along with the inky cloud dark violet flickers of flame played over the insects shell for all of two or three secondsand then it simply crumbled carapace falling away in flakes and dust the cloudy mass rose up to a height of about five feet before the archive murmured a word it stopped in place bobbing gently holding there damn thomas said he took the earphones out music with many electric guitars sounded tinnily from them and this is what mordite i said quietly deathstone yes the archive said ortega drew in a slow breath and nodded in understanding deathstone huh thomas said it sort of looks like someone spraypainted a soap bubble and gave it tentacles it isnt a soap bubble i said theres a solid piece inside the energies it carries in it are what create that shroud effect around it thomas poked a finger at it what does it do i caught his wrist before he could touch it and pushed his hand away it kills hence the name deathstone you halfwit oh thomas said nodding with drunken sagacity it looked cool when it gacked that little thing but so what its a bug zapper if you disrespect this thing its going to get you killed i said it would kill anything living exactly the same way anything its not from our world its extraterrestrial asked susan you do not understand miss rodriguez ortega said quietly mordite is not from this galaxy or this universe it is not of our reality i had reservations about ortegas presence on the hometeam roster but i nodded its from outside its congealed antilife a chip of this stuff makes nuclear waste look like secondhand smoke being near it draws the life off you bit by bit if you touch it it kills you period precisely said the archive she stepped forward to look at both ortega and me an enchantment binds the particle in place it is also sensitive to applied will the duelists will face each other the mordite between them will it toward your opponent he with the greatest force of will controls the mordite the duel will end when it has devoured one of you gulp the archive continued seconds will observe from first and third bases facing their duelists opponent mister kincaid will ensure that no undue interference is perpetrated by either second i have instructed him to do so with extreme prejudice thomas wobbled a little and eyed the archive eh the girl faced him and said hell kill you if you interfere oh thomas said cheerfully gotcha punkin ortega glared at thomas and made a disgusted sound thomas found something else to look at and backed a prudent step away i will monitor both duelists to ensure that no energies are employed on their behalf i too will resolve any infractions with extreme prejudice do you understand ortega nodded i said yeah are there any questions gentlemen the archive asked i shook my head ortega did too each of you may make a brief statement said the archive ortega drew a band of black and silver beads from his pocket without making an effort i could feel the defensive energies bound up within them he regarded me with casual mistrust as he bound the bracelet to his left side and said this can end in only one way in answer i fished one of the antivenom potions from my pocket popped the top and slugged it down i burped and said excuse me youve really got class dresden susan said class oozes out my every orifice i agreed i passed her my staff and rod hold these for me seconds please retire to your positions said the archive susan put her hand on my arm fingers clenching tight for a second i reached up and touched her hand she let go and backed away to third base thomas offered to highfive ortega ortega glared thomas smiled a colgate smile and swaggered over to first base he drew a silver flask of something from his hip pocket on the way and took a sip the archive looked back and forth between me and ortega she was standing on the pitchers mound next to the floating glob of chilling energy so she was a shade taller than ortega and a shade shorter than me her face was solemn even grim it didnt sit well on a child who should have been getting up for school in the morning are you both resolved to this duel i am ortega said uh huh i nodded the archive nodded gentlemen present your right hands please ortega lifted his right arm palm faced toward me i mirrored him the archive gestured and the mordite sphere floated up until it hovered precisely halfway between ortega and me tension gathered against my palm an invisible and silent pressure it felt vaguely like holding my hand against a recirculating outlet in a swimming poolit was a tenuous thing that felt like it might easily slide to one side if it did id get to see the mordite up close and personal my heart skittered over a couple of beats and i took a deep breath trying to focus and ready myself if i was ortega id want to open up with everything i had in the first heartbeat of the contest and end it almost before it began i took a couple of deep breaths and narrowed my focus my thoughts until the pressure against my hand and the deadly darkness a few feet away from it were all that existed begin said the archive she backed quickly toward home plate ortega let out a shout a battle cry his body dipping slightly hips twisting shoving his hand forward like a man trying to close a vault door with one arm his will flooded toward me wild and strong and the pressure of it drove me back onto my heels the mordite sphere zipped across three of the four feet between it and me ortegas will was strong really really strong i tried to divert it to overcome it and stop the sphere for a panicked second i had nothing the sphere kept drifting closer to me a foot ten inches six inches small tendrils of inky darkness drifted out from the cloud around the mordite reaching out blindly toward my fingers i gritted my teeth hardened my will and stopped the thing five inches from my hand i tried to mount up some momentum of my own but ortega held strong against me dont draw this out boy ortega said through clenched teeth your death will save lives even if you kill me my vassals at casaverde are sworn to hunt you down you and everyone you know and love the sphere came a bit closer you said you wouldnt harm them if i agreed to the duel i growled i lied ortega said i came here to kill you and end this war anything else is immaterial you bastard stop fighting it dresden make it painless for yourself if you kill me they will be executed by surrendering you preserve them your miss rodriguez the policewoman the investigator you apprenticed under the owner of that bar the knight and his family the old man in the ozarks the wolfchildren at the university all of them i snarled buddy you just said the wrong thing i let the anger ortegas words had ignited flood down through my arm a cloud of scarlet sparks erupted against the mordite sphere and it started creeping the other way ortegas face became strained his breathing heavier he didnt waste any effort on words now his eyes darkened until they were entirely black and inhuman there were ripples here and there under the surface of his skinthe flesh mask that contained the vaguely batlike monster those of the red court really were the monstrous ortega the true ortega stirred underneath the false human shell and he was afraid the sphere crept closer ortega renewed his efforts with another war cry but the sphere made it to the midway point and got closer to him fool ortega said in a gasp murderer i said and shoved the sphere another foot closer to him his jaw clenched harder the muscles in his face bulging youll destroy us all starting with you the sphere darted a little nearer you are a selfish selfrighteous madman you murder and enslave children i said i shoved the mordite sphere to within a foot of him you threaten the people i love i shoved it closer still how does it feel ortega being too weak to protect yourself how does it feel to know you are about to die in answer a slow smile crept over his face his shoulders moved a little and i saw that one of his arms hung limply at his side like an empty sleeve a small bulge appeared just to one side of his stomach like a gun being held in an overcoat pocket i stared at it in shock hed pulled his real arm out of the flesh mask he was holding a gun on me how does it feel ortega asked voice very quiet why dont you tell me chapter thirty you cant i said i shot a glance toward home plate but the archive apparently hadnt noticed anything amiss my will wavered and the mordite sphere bobbed back and forth theyll hear the shot theyll kill you quite possibly he agreed as i said i am prepared to accept that his words chilled me and the mordite sphere darted at my head i caught it a couple of feet from me and held it but just barely i told you dresden theres only one way this can end i would have preferred an honorable demise for you but any death will do i stared at the hidden gun a dot of bright scarlet light appeared on ortegas chest and tracked slowly up my expression must have changed because ortega glanced down too the bright pinpoint of the laser sight settled over his heart and became still ortegas eyes widened and his expression twisted into fury a lot of things happened at once there was a hissing sound a thump and a big section of ortegas chest dented in scarlet sprayed out behind him an instant later a booming sound much deeper than the crack of a rifle echoed around the stadium ortega let out a screech that went off the high end of the scale fire erupted from the hidden gun burning through ortegas flesh mask and shirt to reveal the muzzle of a smallcaliber revolver clenched in an inhuman black hand the bullet ortega had taken had half twisted him and he missed i thought hanging around to let him try again was a bad idea so i threw myself to one side and gave the mordite sphere another shove ortega dodged the mordite and even wounded he was fast a bright red dot appeared on his thigh for half a second and with another hissthumpboom the unseen gunman hit him again i heard the bones of ortegas leg break susan threw my staff and rod to me and leapt for ortega grabbing his free arm and twisting as if to throw him instead the vampire writhed weirdly and she wound up tearing the flesh mask from him peeling it away like a banana skin to reveal the slimeslick flabbybodied creature beneath itthe true ortega he still held the gun though and he turned to shoot at me again i screamed ventas servitas at the top of my lungs throwing my will at dirt of the pitchers mound it whirled up into a miniature cyclone of fine brown soil forcing the vampire to turn its head and shield its eyes the second shot went wild as well and i scrambled to get my blasting rod the flying dirt slowed her down but susan still went for ortegas gun hand it was a mistake even with only one leg to support him ortega screeched again twisted and flung susan from the pitchers mound into the third row of seats behind first base she hit with bonebreaking force and dropped out of sight sudden screeches filled the air and i looked up to see as many as a dozen of the red court revealed in their true forms coming into the stadium some climbed over the walls some jumped in from the upper levels and some came bursting out of private boxes in showers of exploding glass i spun toward ortega lifting my blasting rod rammed my will through it and shouted fuego a jet of flame as thick as my arm roared at him but one of the incoming vampires hit him at the shoulder dragging him out of the line of fire the newcomer was set alight though greasy skin going up like a bonfire and it screamed hideously as it burned i sensed movement behind me and turned to find kincaid dashing across the ground he scooped up the archive and raced for one of the dugouts one of the red court vamps got in his way kincaids arm blurred a semiautomatic appearing in it and without missing a step he put two shots neatly between the vampires eyes the vampire started to fall and as he went by it kincaid pumped another half dozen shots into its belly which erupted in a messy shower of scarlet and left the vampire screaming and thrashing weakly on the ground harry look out thomas screamed i didnt look out i figured on the worst and leapt forward i heard a vampire hiss as it missed me and it came rushing up behind me i turned and unleashed another gout of fire from my blasting rod but missed the vampire closed on me spraying venomous saliva into my face id been hit with vampire venom before and the stuff worked fast particularly in large amounts but id taken the potion to block it and all this did was make me itch i used the time while the vampire sprayed me to prepare another blast and unleashed the strike with the rod pressed against the vamps flabby body it scorched a wound in the vampires belly the size of my fist and blew a twofoot hole in the creatures back the vampire went into weak spasms and i kicked it off me rising seven or eight vampires were within fifty feet of me and coming fast thomas sprinted toward me a knife gleaming in his hand and hit one of the vamps from behind he cut open the vampires belly with a single slice and the creature collapsed to the ground harry get out no i shouted get susan out of here thomas gritted his teeth but changed course he leapt up onto the firstbase dugout and hopped neatly over the rail into the stands no help there and there wasnt time to look for options i crouched and concentrated chanting defendre defendre in a steady litany it was difficult to do without my shield bracelet to focus it but i brought up all the defensive energy i could manage in a dome around me the vampires hit it slamming against it in mindless shrieking rage any one of them could have flipped my car over lengthwise with only a little effort their blows against the shield could have crushed concrete within seconds and i knew i was not going to be able to hold the defense in place for long once it went down they were going to literally tear me limb from limb i gave the shield my all and felt them slowly breaking it down then there was a roar and a flash of brilliant light a jet of fire streaked over me and took one of the vampires fullon in the head it burst into flame screaming and waving its toothin arms and went down onto the field thrashing like a halfcrushed bug my shield collapsed overloaded and the bracelet began burning my wrist i crouched lower another jet of fire went by incinerating the head of another vampire all of them stopped crouching shrieking in confusion kincaid stood outside the dugout and dropped a smoking shotgun to the ground he reached into a golf bag next to him smooth and professional and drew out another doublebarreled shotgun one of the vampires leapt at him but kincaid was too fast he pulled the trigger and the shotgun roared a jet of flame streaked out and went through the vampire taking this one in the neck and continuing to the rightfield fence where it blew a hole the size of my face in the wall there was a sound behind him and kincaid spun to shoot the other barrel at a vampire bounding down through the stands above the thirdbase dugout he put the shot right down the vampires throat literally and the creature went up in flames kincaid discarded that shotgun as well and reached for the stock of another in his golf bag the other vampires leapt at kincaid when he turned his back they got to deal with the archive instead the child stepped out from behind the golf bag the tenebrous mordite sphere floating between her hands she released the sphere and made a single gesture the little cloud of darkness blurred toward the vampires and streaked into each in turn at the pace of a busy workmans hammer bangbangbang when the mordite sphere struck them there was a flash of cold purple light a swell of darkness and then the sphere passed on through it left ash and black bones raining down behind it i could barely follow the mordite spheres path it moved so fast one second the vampires were all there and then they were simply gone black bones and grey ash littered the ground around me silence fell and the only thing i could hear was my own ragged breathing and the roaring of my own pulse in my ears i looked around wildly but i didnt see ortega anywhere the two vampires who had been gutted writhed feebly on the ground kincaid drew the last shotgun from the golf bag and with two more flaming blasts executed them both the mordite sphere glided gently back to rest between the archives tiny hands and she stood regarding me for a long and silent moment there was nothing in her expression nothing in her eyes nothing i felt the beginnings of a soulgaze and pulled my face away fast who broke the sanctity of the duel first kincaid asked the archive couldnt tell kincaid answered he wasnt so much as breathing hard but dresden was winning the archive stood there a moment more and then said thank you for letting me pet your kitty mister dresden and thank you for my name that sounded frighteningly like a goodbye but it was only polite to answer youre welcome ivy the archive nodded and said kincaid the box please i looked up to watch kincaid set the wooden box down on the ground the archive sent the mordite sphere gliding slowly down into it and then closed the lid on the box these proceedings are concluded i looked around at the bones dust and smoldering vampire corpses you think the archive regarded me with neutral eyes and said lets go its after my bedtime im hungry kincaid said shouldering his golf bag well hit a drivethrough you can have the cookies cookies arent good for me the archive said but she smiled kincaid said dresden hand me that will you i looked numbly at the ground where he pointed one of the shotguns was there its barrels were still smoking hot i picked it up gingerly by the stock and passed it to kincaid who wrapped it with the other gun hed used in some kind of silverlined blanket what the hell are those things i asked incendiary rounds he said he passed my dropped staff over to me work real well on the reds but theyre so hot they warp gun barrels if you get unlucky the second shot can blow back into your face so you have to use throwaway guns i nodded thanks and took my staff where can i get some kincaid grinned i know a guy ill have him call you see you dresden kincaid and the archive started out of the stadium a thought finally made its way through the combat adrenaline and i broke into a sprint toward the firstbase dugout thomas had simply hopped up onto it i managed to flop and clamber my way up then into the stands thomas was already there on the ground with susan hed taken off her jacket and used it to elevate her feet slightly it looked as if hed tilted her head back a little to clear the airway he looked up and said shes unconscious but shes alive i crouched down too and touched her throat just to be certain how bad is she hurt he shook his head no real way to tell we have to get her to a hospital then i said rising thomas caught my arm you dont want her waking up injured and dazed in a place packed to the roof with weakened prey then what the hell do we do look if shes not dead odds are shell recover thomas held up his hand and fished out a ballpoint pen from his pocket he twisted it and said clear then he twisted it again and put it back a moment later martin came rapidly down the aisle he somehow made even that look boring as if he were simply a man wanting to take his seat again before the opening pitch it was especially impressive since he carried a huge rifle a military sniper weapon with a telescopic sight and a laser attachment he set the rifle aside and went over susan for a moment feeling here and there before he said shell be sore you i asked you were the gunman obviously martin said why do you think we were in chicago to begin with susan said she was getting her things he looked up at me skeptically you believed that i would have thought you knew susan well enough to know that material things dont hold a lot of interest for her i knew that i said but she said i trailed off and shook my head martin looked up and said we knew ortega was coming to kill you we knew that if he succeeded he might be able to bring the war to a peaceful conclusion only to begin it again twenty years from now from a much stronger position i was sent to make sure ortega did not kill you and to eliminate him if i could did you martin shook his head he had planned for the contingency two of his vassals got to him during the fight they pulled him out i dont know how badly he was hurt but its likely hell make it back to casaverde you want the war to keep going youre hoping the white council will destroy the red court for you martin nodded how did you find out about the duel martin didnt answer i narrowed my eyes and looked at thomas thomas put on an innocent expression dont look at me im a drunken chemicalbesotted playboy who does nothing but cavort sleep and feed and even if i had the mind to take a bit of vengeance on the red court i wouldnt have the backbone to actually stand up to anyone he flashed me a radiant smile im totally harmless i see i said i took a deep breath and regarded susans face quietly for a moment then i bent down got into her pockets and got the keys to the rental car are you leaving now martin yes i dont think our presence will be noticed here but theres no sense in taking chances take care of her for me i said martin looked up at me for a second and then said in a quiet voice everything in my power you have my word i nodded thank you i stood up and started for the exits drawing the coat to cover my gun where are you going thomas called the airport i answered ive got to meet some people about an old man and a bedsheet chapter thirtyone i parked at a rental lot outside ohare about five minutes after seven i got out of the car with my staff and rod in hand there was only one old light burning on the lot but the moon had risen huge and bright and i had no trouble seeing michael coming his white truck came crunching to a halt on the gravel in front of me i walked around to the passenger door sanya swung it open for me then slid over he was wearing blue denim and a big black cowboy hat harry michael said as i got in i was getting worried you won not exactly you lost not exactly i had ortega on the ropes and he cheated both of us cleared the benches i came out of it in one piece he came out in a couple of pieces but he got away is susan all right she got thrown about twentyfive yards through the air and hit steel and concrete shell be fine something tickled my nose and i sniffed the sharp odor of metal filled the cab of the truck michael are you wearing the armor i am wearing the armor michael said and the cloak hello michael were going to an airport the kind with metal detectors its all right harry things will work out will it sound like alarms going off when they do i glanced at the younger knight and said sanya isnt wearing armor sanya half turned toward me and pulled his denim jacket open revealing a kevlar vest beneath it i am he said soberly fifteen layers with ceramic plating over critical areas well at least you dont look like a renaissance festival i said this thing might actually protect you besides making a slightly less medieval fashion statement is this the new stuff or the old stuff new sanya said will stop civilian munitions even some military rounds but not knives or claws michael murmured or arrows sanya buttoned his coat back up frowning yours will not stop bullets michael said my faith protects me i exchanged a skeptical look with sanya and said okeydokey michael do we have any idea where the bad guys are the airport michael said i sat there silently for a second before i said needle haystack where at the airport michael shrugged smiling and opened his mouth to speak i held up my hand we must have faith i said doing my best to imitate michaels voice how did i guess did you bring fidelacchius in the tool locker michael said i nodded shiros going to need it back michael was quiet for a moment before he said yes of course were going to save him i pray it is so harry we will i said i stared out the window as michael pulled into the airport proper its not too late ohare is huge we drove around in crowded parking lots and auto loading zones for nearly half an hour before michael abruptly slowed the truck down outside the international concourse his spine and neck straightening as if hed heard a warning klaxon sanya glanced aside at michael and said what is it do you feel that michael asked him feel what close your eyes michael said try to still your thoughts i muttered i sense a great disturbance in the force you do michael asked blinking at me i sighed and rubbed at the bridge of my nose sanya closed his eyes and a second later his expression twisted in distaste rot the russian reported sour milk mildew the air smells greasy theres a pizza hut kiosk about fifty feet away i pointed out looking through the windows of the concourse but maybe its just a coincidence no michael said its nicodemus he leaves a kind of stain everywhere he goes arrogance ambition disregard i only smell rotten things sanya said youre sensing him too michael said your mind is interpreting it differently hes here he started pulling forward but a cab zipped in front of him and stopped the cabby got out and began unloading an elderly couples bags i muttered to myself and sniffed i even reached out with my magical senses trying to detect what michael had i felt nothing but the usualpatternless white noise of thousands of lives moving around us i opened my eyes and found myself staring at the back of detective rudolphs head he had on the usual expensive suit and stood with a spare wellcoiffed man i recognized from the district attorneys office i froze for a second then i snatched sanyas black stetson and pulled it down over my head i tugged the brim down over my eyes and slouched down as low as i could what is it michael asked police i said i took a more careful look around i spotted seven uniformed officers and maybe ten other men who wore suits and casual clothes but walked and stood like cops i passed word to them that the shroud might be on the way out of chicago through here then why are you hiding a witness reported me leaving the scene of a murder if someone identifies me im going to spend the next day or so getting questioned and that wont help shiro michaels brow knitted in concern true do the police know of the denarians probably not si isnt on the case probably theyve been told theyre some kind of terrorists and to be considered dangerous the cabby in front of us finally finished up and michael pulled away from the loading zone and toward the parking lot that isnt good enough we cant have them there as long as the police are around it will restrict the denarians movements make them keep their heads down and play nice michael shook his head most supernatural creatures will hesitate before killing a mortal police officer but nicodemus wont he has nothing but contempt for mortal authorities if we confront him he will kill anyone who attempts to stop him as well as taking hostages to use against us sanya nodded not to mention that if this plague curse is as formidable as you say it would be dangerous to those nearby its worse than that i said michael rolled the steering wheel toward a parking space how so forthill told me that the denarians get a power boost from hurting people right causing mayhem and destruction yes michael said the curse is only going to last a few days but while it does its going to make the black death look like chicken pox thats why hes here its one of the busiest international terminals on the planet mother of god michael swore sanya whistled flights from here go directly to every major nation in the world if the denarians plague is easily communicable i think i pretty well summed that up with the black death comment sanya the russian shrugged sorry what do we do we call in a bomb threat clear out the people and shut down the planes we need to be inside immediately sanya said how long would it take the authorities to react it would only work if i knew who to call to get an immediate reaction do you sanya asked i held out my hand out to michael he slapped his cell phone into it no i said but i know someone who does i called murphy trying to remain calm and hoping that the phone didnt explode against my head when i got the connection it was cloudy with bursts of static but i managed to tell her what was going on youre insane dresden murphy said do you know how incredibly irresponsibleand illegalit is to falsify a bomb threat yeah less irresponsible than letting cops and civilians get in these peoples way murphy was quiet for a second and then asked how dangerous are they worse than the loupgarou i said ill make the call did you get in touch with him i asked i think so yes do you need any more muscle got plenty i said what im short on is time please hurry be careful harry i hung up the phone and got out of the truck michael and sanya came with me murphys going to report a bomb threat the cops will clear everyone out of the building that will clear out the area for us leaving the denarians without anyone to infect or take hostage sanya said thats the idea after that theyll call in the bomb squad and backup well have twenty minutes tops to take advantage of the confusion michael unlocked the tool locker in the back of the pickup and drew out shiros cane he tied a strap to it and slung it over his shoulder while he did sanya buckled esperacchius to his hip then drew a freaking assault rifle out of the tool locker kalashnikov isnt it i asked thats an extremely chuck heston look for the knights of the cross sanya slapped a magazine into the weapon chambered a round and made sure the guns safety was on i consider myself a progressive too random for my taste michael said too easy to hurt the wrong person maybe sanya said but the only people inside should be the denarians yes and shiro i said i will not shoot shiro sanya assured me michael buckled amoracchius onto his hip how much longer will it take the buzzing ring of a fire alarm blared from the concourse and the police got together a grizzled detective in a bad suit took charge and started directing suits and uniforms around people started hurrying out of the concourse ask and ye shall receive i said lets circle around get in through one of the service entrances sanya slipped the assault rifle into an overtheshoulder sports bag but kept one hand on the stock michael nodded to me and i took the lead we circled around the building until we could see some of the planes ground crews were rushing around in confusion and several guys with orange flashlights were waving them at flight crews directing the wallowing jets away from the ramps to the concourse we had to climb a fence and drop down a tenfoot retaining wall to get behind the concourse but in the dark and the confusion no one noticed us i led us through a groundcrew door and through a room that was part garage and part baggage storage emergency lights were on and fire alarms still jangled i passed a section of wall covered with calendar pinup girls pictures of trucks and a map of the concourse whoa stop i said sanya bumped into my back i glowered at him and then peered at the map here i said pointing at a marked door well come out on this stairway midway through michael noted which way do we go split up sanya suggested michael and i said bad idea at precisely the same time think i muttered mostly to myself if i were an arrogant psychotic demoncollaborating terrorist out to trigger an apocalypse where would i be sanya leaned over to look at the map and said the chapel the chapel said michael the chapel i echoed down this hall up the stairs and to the left we ran down the hall and up the stairs i pushed open the door and heard a recorded voice telling me to be calm and proceed to the nearest exit i checked my right before i did my left and it saved my life a man in nondescript business wear stood watching the door and holding a submachine gun when he saw me he lifted the weapon hesitated for a fraction of a second and started shooting the slight pause was enough to let me reverse my direction a couple of bullets went right through the steel fire door but i stumbled back into sanya the big man caught me and spun putting his back between me and the incoming bullets i felt him jerk and heard him grunt once and then we hit a wall and sank down i knew the gunman would be coming right then he was probably circling out to the far wall across from the door once he had a clear line of fire down the stairs hed move up and gun us down i saw his shadow in the crack under the door and i struggled to regain my feet sanya was doing the same thing and the two of us managed to do little but keep each other down the gunman came closer his shadow moving in the little space beneath the doors edge michael stepped over me and sanya amoracchius in hand and shouted as he lunged forward both hands driving the weight of the sword at the closed steel door the sword went through the door sinking almost to the hilt an erratic burst of gunfire sounded michael drew the sword back out of the door blood gleamed wet and scarlet along the length of the weapons blade michael put his back against the wall of the stairwell the gun barked a couple of times more and fell silent after a minute blood seeped under the door in a spreading red puddle sanya and i got untangled and got up youre hit michael had already moved and stood behind sanya he ran his hands over sanyas back grunted and then held up a small bright piece of metal presumably the round it hit a strike plate the vest caught it progressive sanya panted wincing youre lucky the bullet had to go through a steel door before it got to you i muttered i readied a shield and pressed the door slowly open the gunman lay on the floor michaels thrust had taken him just under the floating ribs and had to have hit an artery to kill him so quickly his gun lay in his hand and his finger was limp on the trigger sanya and michael slipped out of the stairwell sanya had his rifle in hand they stood lookout while i bent down and pried open the dead gunmans mouth he didnt have a tongue one of nicodemuss boys i said quietly something is wrong michael said blood dripped from the tip of the sword to the floor i dont feel him anymore if you can feel him can he feel you could he know if you were getting close to him michael shrugged it seems likely hes cautious i said remembering how nicodemus had reacted when shiro came through the door he doesnt take chances he wouldnt wait around to start a fight he wasnt sure he could win hes running i stood up and headed for the chapel come on just as i got to the chapels door it swung open and two more men came out both of them slapping clips into submachine guns one of them didnt look up in time to see me so i checked him in the forehead with a doublehanded thrust of my staff getting my whole weight behind the blow his head snapped back and he dropped the other gunman started to bring his weapon up but i batted the barrel aside with a sweep of my staff then snapped the end of it hard into his nose before he could recover sanya stepped into him and slammed the butt of the kalashnikov against his head he fell on top of the first guy tongueless mouth lolled open i stepped over them and into the chapel it had been a small modest room there were two rows of three pews each a pulpit a table and subdued lighting there were no specific religious trappings to the place it was simply a room set aside to accommodate the spiritual needs of worldwide travelers of every belief creed and faith any one of them would have felt profaned by what had been done to the room the walls had been covered in sigils somewhat similar to those i had seen on the denarians so far they were painted in blood and still wet the pulpit had been leaned against the back wall and the heavy table laid along it so that it lay at an angle to the floor on either side of the table was a chair covered in bits of bone a few candles on one of the chairs was a carved silver bowl almost entirely covered in fresh blood the room smelled sickly sweet and whatever was in those candles made the air thick languid and hazy maybe opium it had probably accounted for the slowed reaction of the second two gunmen the candles shed muted light over the tables surface what was left of shiro lay on it he was on his back and shirtless torn flesh and dark savage bruises some of them in the clear outline of chains lapped around from his back his hands and feet were grotesquely swollen theyd been broken so badly and in so many places that they looked more like sausages than human limbs his belly and chest had been sliced up as id seen before on the real father vincent and on gaston larouches corpse as well theres so much blood i whispered i felt michael enter the room behind me he made a soft choking sound i stepped closer to shiros remains noting clinical details his face had been left more or less untouched there were several items scattered around him on the floorritual implements whatever they had intended him for theyd already done it there were sores on his skin fever blisters i thought and his throat was swollen the damage to his skin probably hid many other such marks of pestilence were too late michael said quietly have they already worked the spell yeah i said i sat down on the first pew harry michael said theres so much blood i said he wasnt a very big person you wouldnt think there could be so much blood harry theres nothing else we can do here i knew him and he wasnt very big you wouldnt think there would be enough for all the painting the ritual we should go michael said and do what the plague has already started odds are we have it if we carry it out we only spread it nicodemus has the shroud and hes probably out looking for a full school bus or something hes gone we missed harry michael said quietly we must anger and frustration suddenly burned hot and bright behind my eyes if you talk to me about faith ill kill you you dont mean that michael said i know you too well shut up michael he stepped up next to me and leaned shiros cane against my knee then without a word he drew back to the wall and waited i picked up the cane and drew the wooden handle of the old mans sword out enough to see five or six inches of clean gleaming metal i slapped it shut again stepped up to shiro and composed him as best i could then i rested the sword beside him when he coughed and wheezed i almost screamed i wouldnt have thought that anyone could survive that much abuse but shiro drew in a ragged breath and blinked open one eye the other had been put out and his eyelid looked sunken and strange hells bells i stammered michael michael and i both rushed down beside him it took him a moment to focus his eye on us ah good he rasped was getting tired waiting for you weve got to get him to a hospital i said the old man twitched his head in a negative gesture too late would do no good the noose the barabbus curse what is he talking about i asked michael the noose nicodemus wears so long as he bears it he apparently cannot die we believe the noose is the one used by judas michael said quietly so whats this barabbus curse just as the romans put it within the power of the jews to choose one condemned prisoner each year to be pardoned and given life the noose allows nicodemus to mandate a death that cannot be avoided barabbus was the prisoner the jews chose though pilate wanted to free the savior the curse is named for him and nicodemus used it on shiro shiro twitched his head again and a faint smile touched his mouth no boy on you he was angry that you escaped him despite his treachery hells bells the entropy curse that had nearly killed both me and susan with me i stared at shiro for a second and then at michael michael nodded we cannot stop the curse he said but we can take the place of its subject if we choose to do it thats why we wanted you to stay away harry we were afraid nicodemus would target you i stared at him and then at shiro my vision blurred it should be me lying there i said dammit no shiro said there is much you do not yet understand he coughed and pain flashed over his face you will you will he twitched the arm nearest the sword take it take it boy no i said im not like you like any of you i never will be remember god sees hearts boy and now i see yours take it hold it in trust until you find the one it belongs to i reached out and picked up the cane how do i know who to give it to you will know shiro said his voice becoming thinner trust your heart sanya entered the room and padded over to us the police heard the gunfire theres an assault team getting ready to he froze staring at shiro sanya shiro said this is our parting friend i am proud of you sanya swallowed and knelt down by the old man he kissed shiros forehead blood stained his lips when he straightened michael shiro said the fight is yours now be wise michael laid his hand on shiros bald head and nodded the big man was crying though his face was set in a quiet smile harry shiro whispered nicodemus is afraid of you afraid that you saw something i dont know what he should be afraid i said no the old man said dont let him unmake you you must find him take the shroud from him so long as he touches it the plague grows if he loses it it ends we dont know where he is i said train shiro whispered his backup plan a train to st louis how do you know michael asked told his daughter they thought i was gone shiro focused on me and said stop them my throat clenched i nodded i managed to half growl thank you you will understand shiro said soon then he sighed like a man who has just laid down a heavy burden his eye closed shiro died there was nothing pretty about it there was no dignity to it hed been brutalized and savagely murderedand hed allowed it to happen to him in my place but when he died there was a small contented smile on his face maybe the smile of someone who had run his course without wavering from it someone who had served something greater than himself who had given up his life willingly if not gladly sanya said his voice strained we cannot remain here i stood up and slung the cane on its strap over my shoulder i felt cold and shivered i put a hand to my forehead and found it clammy and damp the plague yeah i said and strode out of the room and back toward the bloodspattered stairs clocks running michael and sanya kept pace where are we going the airfield i said hes smart hell figure it out hell be there who michael asked i didnt answer i led them back down through the garage area and out onto the airfield tarmac we hurried down along the concourse and then out onto the open acres of asphalt that led from the concourses to the landing fields once wed gotten out there i took off my pentacle amulet and held it aloft focusing on it in order to cause it to begin to shed a distinctive blue light what are you doing sanya asked signaling i said who our ride it took maybe fortyfive seconds before the sound of a helicopters blades whirled closer to us the aircraft a blueandwhitepainted commercial job zipped down to hover over us before dropping down for a precise if hurried landing come on i said and headed for the craft the side door opened and i climbed in with michael and sanya close behind me gentleman johnny marcone dressed in dark fatigues nodded to me and to the two knights good evening gentlemen he said just tell me where to take you southwest i said yelling over the noise of the chopper theyre going to be on a commercial train heading for st louis michael stared at marcone in shock this is the man who ordered the shroud stolen to begin with he said you dont think hes going to work with us sure he will i said if nicodemus gets away with the shroud and pulls off this big curse marcones spent all that money for nothing not to mention that the plague would be bad for business marcone added i think we can agree to help one another against this nicodemus we can discuss the disposition of the shroud afterward he turned and thumped the pilots shoulder a couple of times and yelled directions the pilot glanced back at us and i saw cards profile against the flight instruments hendricks leaned in from the passenger seat listening to marcone and nodded himself very well then marcone called leaning back into the cabin he took a largecaliber hunting rifle down from a rack and settled into a seat buckling up best strap in gentlemen lets go recover the holy shroud i settled in and told michael now if only we had a bit of wagner to send us on our way i saw cards reflection in the choppers front windows look up at my words then she flicked a couple of switches and ride of the valkyries started thrumming through the helicopters cabin yee haw i said as my elbows and knees started a nagging ache as long as were going we might as well go out in style chapter thirtytwo after a few minutes the ride got bumpy the chopper started jouncing at random lurching several feet in any given direction if i hadnt been strapped in i probably would have slammed my head against the walls or ceiling marcone put on a headset and spoke into a microphone he listened to the answer and then shouted to the rest of us the ride may be a bit bumpier the stabilizers are run by the onboard computer which has failed he gave me a direct look i can only speculate as to why i looked around picked up another headset put it on and said blow me excuse me came cards somewhat outraged voice over the intercom not you blondie i was talking to marcone marcone folded his arms in his seat half smiling its all right miss gard compassion dictates that we must make allowances mister dresden is a diplomatically challenged individual he should be in a shelter for the tactless ill tell you what you can do with your shelter i said marcone i need to speak to you marcone frowned at me and then nodded how much time before we reach the southbound tracks were over the first one now gard replied three minutes to catch the train inform me when we reach it mister hendricks please switch the cabin headphones to channel two hendricks didnt say anything and it made me wonder why he had bothered with a headset there came marcones voice after a moment were speaking privately why didnt you tell me i said tell you that i hadnt sent mister franklin for you yeah would you have believed me no would you have thought i was playing some kind of game with you yes then why waste the time and make you more suspicious generally speaking you are quite perceptivegiven enough time and i know you well enough to know that i do not wish to have you as my enemy i glowered at him he arched an eyebrow meeting my gaze without fear or hostility why do you want the shroud thats none of your business i scowled actually it is literally why do you want it why do you because the denarians are going to kill a lot of people with it marcone shrugged thats reason enough for me as well sure it is its simple business mister dresden i cant conduct business with a mound of corpses why dont i believe you marcones teeth flashed because given enough time you are a perceptive individual there was a beep in the headphones and gard said fifteen seconds sir thank you marcone replied dresden why should these people take the shroud and this plague of theirs to st louis its another international airport i said its the central hub for twa and hell as long as theyre there they could probably go for a swim in the mississippi why not simply stay in chicago i nodded toward michael and sanya them plus i figure they know that murphy and si would give them a hard time even the regular cops were out in force looking for them he looked speculatively at michael and sanya i assume you have a means to locate the shroud if that is the correct train yeah i said and heres the deal you drop us off and we get the shroud im going with you marcone said no you arent i can always order miss gard to return to ohare where well all die of the plague since we didnt stop the denarians that may be either way im going with you i scowled at him then shook my head and leaned back against the seat shivering you suck you suck diseased moose wang marcone marcone smiled with just his mouth how colorful he looked out the window and said my people tell me there are only three trains leaving chicago for st louis this evening two freight trains and a passenger train they wont be on the passenger train i said theyd have to ditch weapons and goons and they wont even odds that this is the one then marcone said the chopper descended until the trees near the tracks were swaying in the downblast thats the nice part about the midwest go twenty miles from a town hall and theres nothing but lightly settled farm country i looked out the window and saw a long train rumbling along the tracks michael sat bolt upright and nodded to me this is it i said to marcone now what i bought this helicopter as coast guard surplus its fitted with a rescue winch we climb down it onto the train youre joking right nothing worth doing is ever easy dresden marcone took off the headphones and shouted to sanya and michael sanyas reaction was about like mine but michael only nodded and got unstrapped marcone opened a locker and drew out several nylon harnesses he strapped one on himself and passed out another to each of us then he hauled the side door of the helicopter open wind filled the cabin marcone opened a cabinet and started drawing a length of cable from it i looked and saw the winch inside marcone looped the cable through a ring outside the door then said who first michael stepped forward me marcone nodded and clipped the cable onto the harness a minute later michael hopped out of the helicopter marcone flicked a switch near the electric winch and cable began playing out marcone watched intently and then nodded hes down the winch reeled back in and sanya stepped up to the door it took a couple of minutes and it felt like the chopper was doing too much lurching around but marcone eventually nodded dresden my mouth felt dry as marcone checked my harness and clipped the cable to it then he shouted go i didnt want to go but i sure as hell wasnt going to chicken out in front of marcone i clutched my staff and rod to me made sure shiros cane was strapped to my back took a deep breath and jumped i swung around a little on the cable and then felt myself going down the downdraft from the chopper all but blinded me but when i did look around i could see the train beneath me we were being lowered onto a car just forward of the end of the train a large metal container with a flat lid the helicopter had a searchlight pointed at the train and i could see michael and sanya crouching and looking up at me i swayed and dangled like a kids first yoyo my legs got clipped by an outgrown tree branch that hit me hard enough to leave bruises when i got close michael and sanya grabbed me and brought me down in one piece marcone came down his rifle hanging on his shoulder i figured hendricks was operating the winch the knights pulled marcone safely in and he detached the cable it swung away and the chopper arched up and away turning its searchlight out it took a moment for my eyes to adjust to the brilliant moon and i stayed crouched so that i could keep my balance harry michael called where now head for the engine and look for a boxcar i told him something it would be easy for them to hop into michael nodded sanya rear guard the big russian held his rifle like trained military and fell back to the rear of our group watching behind us michael took the lead one hand on his sword and moved forward with a predatory grace and purpose i glowered at marcone and said im not going anywhere with you behind me marcone smiled again and took his gun off his shoulder he looked like trained military too he fell into line behind michael i pulled my old duster back until it fell behind the handle of my pistol leaving it clear for a draw it probably didnt look military it probably looked more like a spaghetti western i moved in behind marcone staff in my left hand rod in my right we all moved forward over the rumbling freight cars just like every western movie youve ever seen if i hadnt been feverish and nauseous it might have been fun michael abruptly crouched and held a closed fist beside his ear marcone stopped immediately crouching the rifle at his shoulder closed fist means stop check i crouched too michael turned around to face us poked a couple of fingers at his eyes held three fingers up and pointed at the car ahead of us i took it to mean that he could see three bad guys up there michael beckoned sanya and the russian slipped silently forward michael pointed at me and then at the back of the train i nodded to him and kept an eye out behind us i checked over my shoulder and saw michael and sanya both swing down between the cars and out of sight when i faced the rear of the train again i saw a nightmare running toward me over the cars whatever creation process this thing had undergone it hadnt been a kind one fourlegged and lanky it looked vaguely like a cat but it didnt have fur its skin was leathery wrinkled and mottled its head was somewhere between that of a jaguar and a wild boar it had both tusks and fangs in its gaping drooling mouth and it moved with graceless speed i let out a strangled cry lifting my blasting rod i pushed power through it yelled the word and loosed a flashing bolt of fire at it the bolt hit the thing in the face just as it gathered itself to leap at me it let out an unnerving wailing cry then convulsed in pain as it jumped and sailed off the side of the car the fire blinded me for a moment leaving a bright green dot over my vision i heard the next one coming but i couldnt see it i dropped down to my stomach and yelled marcone the rifle cracked three times in deliberately spaced reports i heard the thing squeal and then saw it as my eyes started to adjust it lay on top of the car maybe ten feet from me hindquarters dragging struggling to haul itself forward with one claw marcone stepped closer lifted the hunting rifle and coolly put another shot right between its eyes the creature twitched fell and slid bonelessly over the side of the train marcone peered after it what was that some kind of guard dog i said interesting demon i pushed myself to my feet doubt it demons are usually a lot tougher then what was it how the hell should i know never seen anything like it before where are michael and sanya we went to look the next car was an empty one with spaced wooden slats and an open top it looked like something used to haul cattle there were three men in it unconscious or dead michael climbed the far wall of the cattle car and onto the next car in line we climbed down into the car dead marcone asked napping sanya said marcone nodded we should finish them these men are fanatics if they wake up theyll attack us without hesitation armed or not i eyed him were not going to murder them in cold blood is there a particular reason why not shut up marcone they would show us no such mercy and if they are allowed to live they will surely be used by the denarians to cause pain and death its their purpose were not killing them marcones mouth curled into a bitter smile how did i guess he snapped open a case on his belt and tossed two sets of handcuffs at sanya the russian caught them and cuffed the downed men together looping one of the sets around a metal strut of the car there marcone said i suppose well just have to take the chance that none of them will chew off his own hand at the wrist and slip free sanya michaels voice thundered over the noise of the train and a sudden brilliant glare of white light leapt up from the top of the next car steel chimed on steel sanya shoved his assault rifle at me i caught it and he pushed past me to start climbing out of the car he hauled himself up with his right arm his injured arm dangling and heaved himself to the lip of the cattle car he stood drew esperacchius in a blaze of more white light and threw himself to the next car with a rumbling shout i let my staff drop and fumbled with the assault rifle trying to find the safety marcone set his hunting rifle aside and said youre going to hurt yourself he took the assault rifle out of my hands checked a couple of things without needing to look at the weapon and then slung it over his shoulder as he climbed out of the car i muttered to myself and went up the wooden slats beside him the next car was another metal box michaels and sanyas swords shone like the sun and i had to shield my eyes against them they stood side by side with their backs to me facing the front of the train nicodemus stood against them the lord of the denarians wore a grey silk shirt and black pants the shroud had been draped over his body like a contestant in a beauty pageant the noose around his neck blew out toward the rear of the train in the wind he held a sword in his hands a japanese katana with a worn hilt droplets of blood stained the very tip of the sword he held the sword at his side a small smile on his lips to all appearances relaxed michael checked over his shoulder and i saw a line of blood on his cheek stay back harry nicodemus attacked in the moment michaels attention was elsewhere the denarians weapon blurred and michael barely managed to get amoracchius into a parry he was thrown off balance and to one knee for a fatal second but sanya roared and attacked whipping his saber through whistling arcs and driving nicodemus back the russian drove the denarian toward the far side of the car i saw the trap coming and shouted sanya back off the russian couldnt stop his forward momentum entirely but he pivoted and lunged to one side as he did steely blades erupted from within the car the metal of the roof screamed as the blades pierced it rising to a height of four or five feet in a line a half breath behind sanya nicodemus turned to pursue the russian michael got his feet whipped the heavy blade of amoracchius around and slashed three times at the roof of the railcar a triangular section three feet across fell down into the car and the edges of the metal glowed dull orange with the heat of the parted steel michael dropped down through the hole and out of sight i lifted up my blasting rod and focused on nicodemus he shot a glance at me and flicked his wrist in my direction his shadow flashed across the top of the railcar and smashed into me the shadow wrenched the blasting rod from my grip dragged it through the air and then crushed it to splinters sanya let out a cry as a blade tore through the cars roof and one of his legs collapsed he fell to one knee then brilliant light flared up within the car beneath the combatants spears of white lancing out through the holes the blades had cut into the metal i heard deirdres demon form shriek in the car beneath us and the blades harassing sanya vanished nicodemus snarled he flung a hand toward me and his shadow sent the splinters of my blasting rod shrieking toward my face as they did nicodemus attacked sanya his sword flickering in the moonlight i got my arms up in time to deflect the splinters but i was helpless to assist sanya nicodemus knocked sanyas saber out to one side sanya rolled avoiding the stroke that would have taken his head doing it left sanyas wounded arm on the ground and nicodemus crushed the heel of his boot down upon it sanya screamed in pain nicodemus raised his sword for the death blow gentleman johnny marcone opened up with the kalashnikov marcone shot in three chattering bursts of fire the first one tore through nicodemuss chest and neck just above the shroud the next hit on his arm and shoulder opposite the shroud all but tearing it off his torso the last burst ripped apart his hip and thigh on the hip opposite the shrouds drape nicodemuss expression blackened with fury but the bullets had torn half his body to shreds and he toppled from the car and out of sight below there was another demonic shriek and the sound of wrenching metal the shrieks faded toward the front of the train and a moment later michael climbed up the ladder rungs on the side of the boxcar his sword in its sheath i leapt forward and ran to sanya he was bleeding a lot from his leg he had already taken off his belt and i helped him wrap it around the leg in a makeshift tourniquet marcone stepped up to where nicodemus had fallen frowned and said dammit he should have dropped in place now well have to go back for the shroud no we wont i said you didnt kill him you probably just pissed him off michael stepped past marcone to help sanya tearing off a section off his white cloak do you think so marcone asked the damage seemed fairly thorough i dont think he can be killed i said interesting can he run faster than a train probably i said marcone said to sanya do you have another clip where is deirdre i asked michael he shook his head wounded she tore her way through the front wall of the car into the next one too risky to pursue her alone in close quarters i stood up and crawled back over to the cattle car i clambered down in it to fetch my staff after a moment of hesitation i got marcones rifle too and started back up as it turned out i was mistaken nicodemus could not run faster than a train he flew faster than a train he came sailing down out of the sky his shadow spread like immense bat wings his sword flashed toward marcone marcones reflexes could make a striking snake look sluggish and he dodged and rolled out of the way of the denarians sword nicodemus sailed to the next car on the train and landed in a crouch facing us a glowing sigil had appeared on his forehead the sign itself something twisting nauseating to look upon his skin was marred and ugly where marcones shots had hit him but it was whole and getting better by the second his face twisted in fury and a kind of ecstatic agony and his shadow flooded forward over the length of the railcar in front of him and dipping down between his car and ours there was a wrenching sound and our car shook then the sound of tearing metal and our car started shuddering hes uncoupled the cars i shouted as i did nicodemuss car began drawing away from us as our own slowed down the gap between them growing go sanya shouted ill be all right michael stood and threw himself over the gap without hesitation marcone ditched the assault rifle and sprinted toward the gap he threw himself over it arms windmilling and landed barely on the other cars roof i got to the top of the car and did the same thing i imagined missing the other car and landing on the tracks in front of the uncoupled end of the train even without an engine pure momentum would be more than enough to kill me i dropped marcones rifle and gathered my will in my staff as i leapt i thrust the staff back behind me and screamed forzare the raw force i sent out behind me shoved me forward actually it shoved me too far forward i landed closer to nicodemus than either michael or marcone but at least i didnt wind up sprawled at his feet michael stepped up to stand beside me and a second later marcone did as well he had an automatic pistol in either hand the boy isnt very fast is he michael said nicodemus youre an adequate opponent i suppose not as experienced as you could be but its hard to find someone with more than thirty or forty years of practice much less twenty centuries not as talented as the japanese but then not many are give up the shroud nicodemus michael shouted it is not yours to take oh yes it is nicodemus answered you certainly will not be able to stop me and when ive finished you and the wizard ill go back for the boy three knights in a day as it were he cant make bad puns i muttered thats my shtick at least he didnt overlook you entirely marcone answered i feel somewhat insulted hey i shouted old nick can i ask you a question please do wizard once we get to the fighting there really isnt going to be much opportunity for it why i said beg pardon why i asked again why the hell are you doing this i mean i get why you stole the shroud you needed a big battery but why a plague have you read revelations not in a while i admitted but i just cant buy that you really think youre touching off the apocalypse nicodemus shook his head dresden dresden the apocalypse as you refer to it isnt an event at least it isnt any specific event one day im sure there will be an apocalypse that really does bring on the end but i doubt it will be this event that begins it then why do this nicodemus studied me for a moment before smiling apocalypse is a frame of mind he said then a belief a surrender to inevitability it is despair for the future it is the death of hope michael said quietly and in that kind of environment there is more suffering more pain more desperation more power to the underworld and their servants exactly nicodemus said we have a terrorist group prepared to take credit for this plague it will likely stir up reprisals protests hostilities all sorts of things one step closer said michael thats how he sees it progress i like to think of it as simple entropy nicodemus said the real question to my mind is why do you stand against me it is the way of the universe knight things fall apart your resistance to it is pointless in answer michael drew his sword ah said nicodemus eloquence stay back michael said to me dont distract me michael i mean it he stepped forward to meet nicodemus nicodemus took his time sauntering up to meet michael he crossed swords with him lightly then lifted his blade in a salute michael did the same nicodemus attacked and amoracchius flared into brilliant light the two men met each other and traded a quick exchange of cuts and thrusts they parted and then clashed together again steps carrying each past the other both of them emerged from it unscathed shooting him hardly seems to inconvenience him marcone said quietly to me i take it that the knights sword can harm him michael doesnt think so i said marcone blinked and looked at me then why is he fighting him because it needs to be done i said do you know what i think marcone said you think we should shoot nicodemus in the back at the first opportunity and let michael dismember him yes i drew my gun okay just then demongirl deirdres glowing eyes appeared several cars ahead of us and came forward at a sprint i caught a glimpse of her before she jumped onto our carstill all supple scales and hairstyle by the tasmanian devil but in addition she had a sword gripped in one hand michael i shouted behind you michael turned and dodged to one side avoiding deirdres first attack her hair followed him lashing at him tangling around the hilt of his sword i acted without thinking i stripped shiros cane from my back shouted michael and threw the cane at him michael didnt so much as turn his head he reached out caught the cane and with a sweep of his arm threw the canesheath free of the sword so that fidelacchiuss blade shone with its own light without pausing he swung the second sword and struck deirdres tangling hair from his arm sending her stumbling back nicodemus attacked him and michael met him squarely shouting o dei lava quod est sordium cleanse what is unclean o god michael managed to hold his ground against nicodemus their blades ringing michael drove nicodemus to one side and i had a shot at his back i took it beside me marcone did the same the shots took nicodemus by surprise and stole his balance michael shouted and pressed forward on the offensive seizing the advantage for the first time both shining blades dipped and circled through attack after attack and michael drove nicodemus back step by step hells bells hes going to win i muttered but nicodemus drew a gun from the back of his belt he shoved it against michaels breastplate and pulled the trigger repeatedly light and thunder made even the rushing train sound quiet michael fell and did not move the light of the two swords went out i shouted no i raised my gun and started shooting again marcone joined me we didnt do too badly considering we were standing on a moving train and all but nicodemus didnt seem to care he walked toward us through the bullets jerking and twitching occasionally he casually kicked the two swords over the side of the train i ran dry on bullets and nicodemus took the gun from my hand with a stroke of his sword it hit the top of the boxcar once then bounced off and into the night the train thundered down a long shallow grade toward a bridge demongirl deirdre leapt over to her fathers side on all fours her face distorted in glee tendrils of her hair ran lovingly over michaels unmoving form i drew up my unfocused shield into a regular barrier before me and said dont even bother offering me a coin i hadnt planned on it nicodemus said you dont seem like a team player to me he looked past me and said but ive heard about you marcone are you interested in a job i was just going to ask you the same thing marcone said nicodemus smiled and said bravo sir i understand im obliged to kill you but i understand i traded a look with marcone i flicked my eyes at the upcoming bridge he took a deep breath and nodded nicodemus lifted the gun and aimed for my head his shadow suddenly swept forward under and around my shield seizing my left hand it ripped at my arm hard pulling me off balance marcone was ready he let one of his empty guns fall and produced a knife from somewhere on his person he flicked it at nicodemuss face i went for his gun hand when he flinched the gun went off my senses exploded with a flash of light and i lost the feeling in my left arm but i trapped his gun arm between my body and my right arm and pried at his fingers marcone went for him with another knife it swept past my face missing me but it hit the shroud marcone cut through it cleanly seized it and pulled it off nicodemus entirely i felt the release of energy as the shroud was removed a wave of feverhot magic that swept over me in a sudden potent surge when it was gone my chills and my aching joints were gone with it the curse had been broken no nicodemus shouted kill him deirdre leapt at marcone marcone turned and jumped off the train just as it rolled out over the river he hit the water feet first still clutching the shroud and was lost in the darkness i pried the gun from nicodemuss fingers he caught me by the hair jerked my head back and got his arm around my throat he started choking me hissing its going to take days to kill you dresden hes afraid of you said shiros voice in my mind in my memories i watched nicodemus edge away from shiro as the old man entered the room the noose made him invulnerable to any lasting harm but in a flash of insight i was willing to bet that the one thing the noose wouldnt protect him against was itself i reached back fumbling until i felt the noose i pulled on it as hard as i could and then twisted it pressing my knuckles hard into nicodemuss throat nicodemus reacted in sudden and obvious panic releasing my throat and struggling to get away i held on for dear life and dragged him off balance i tried to throw him off the train letting go of the noose at the last moment he went over the edge but deirdre let out a shriek and leapt forward her tendrils writhing around one of his arms and holding him kill him nicodemus choked kill him now coughing and wheezing i picked up michaels still form as best i could and leapt off the train we hit the water together michael sank i wouldnt let go of him i sank too i tried to get us out but i couldnt and things started to become confusing and black i had almost given up trying when i felt something near me in the water i thought it was a rope and i grabbed it i was still holding on to michael as whoever had thrown the rope started pulling me out i gasped for breath when my head broke water and someone helped me drag michaels body over to the shallows at the side of the river it was marcone and he hadnt thrown me a rope hed hauled me out with the shroud chapter thirtythree i woke up in the back of michaels pickup staring up at the stars and the moon and in considerable pain sanya sat at the back of the truck facing me michael lay still and unmoving beside me hes awake sanya said when he saw me moving murphys voice came from the front of the truck harry be still okay we dont know how badly youve been shot okay i said hi murph it should have torn what murphy asked shroud it should have torn like wet tissue that just makes sense right shhhhh harry be still and dont talk that sounded fine to me the next time i opened my eyes i was in the morgue this all by itself is enough to really ruin your day i was lying on the examining table and butters complete with his surgical gown and his tray of autopsy instruments stood over me im not dead i sputtered im not dead murphy appeared in my field of vision her hand on my chest we know that harry easy weve got to get the bullet out of you we cant take you to the emergency room they have to report any gunshot wounds i dont know butters said this x ray is all screwed up im not sure its showing me where the bullet is if i dont do this right i could make things worse you can do it murphy said the technical stuff always messes up around him things spun around michael stood over me at one point his hand on my head easy harry its almost done and i thought great im going to require an armed escort to make sure i get to hell when i woke up again i was in a small bedroom stacks and boxes and shelves of fabric filled the place nearly to the ceiling and i smiled recognizing it the carpenters guest room on the floor next to the bed was michaels breastplate there were four neat holes in it where the bullets had gone through i sat up my shoulder screamed at me and i found it covered in bandaging there was a sound by the door a small pair of eyes peeked around the corner and little harry carpenter stared at me with big bluegrey eyes hi i said to him he dutifully lifted his pudgy fingers and waved them at me im harry i said he frowned thoughtfully and then said hawwy good enough kid he ran off a minute later he came back reaching way up over his head to hold on to his daddys fingers michael came in the room and smiled at me he was wearing jeans a clean white tshirt and bandages over one arm the cut on his face was healing and he looked rested and relaxed good afternoon he said i smiled tiredly at him your faith protects you eh michael reached down and turned the breastplate around there was a creamcolored material lining in the inside of the breastplate with several deep dents in it he peeled it back to show me layers and layers of bulletproof fabric backing ceramic strike plates set against the front of the breastplate my faith protects me my kevlar helps i laughed a little charity made you put it in michael picked up little harry and put him on his shoulders she did it herself said she wasnt going to spend all that trouble making the breastplate and then have me get killed with a gun she made the breastplate i asked michael nodded all of my armor she used to work on motorcycles my shoulder throbbed hard enough to make me miss the next sentence sorry what did you say i said youll need to take your medicine can you handle some food first ill try i had soup it was exhausting i took a vicodin and slept without dreaming over the next couple of days i managed to piece together what had happened from talking to michael and on the second day to sanya the big russian had come out of things all right marcone after getting me and michael out of the water had called murphy and told her where to find us she had already been on the way and got there in only a couple of minutes the crew of the train it turned out had been killed the three goons that had been trussed up on the train had bitten down on suicide pills and were dead when the cops found them murphy had taken us all to butters instead of to the emergency room since once my gunshot wound was reported rudolph and company could have made my life hell i must be out of my mind murphy told me when she visited i swear dresden if this comes back to bite me in the ass im taking it out on your hide were fighting the good fight murph i said she rolled her eyes at me but said i saw the body at the airport concourse harry did you know him i looked out the window at michaels three youngest playing in the yard watched over by a tolerant molly he was a friend it could have been me instead murphy shivered im sorry harry the people who did it did they get away from you i looked at her and said i got away from them i dont think i did much more than annoy them what happens when they come back i dont know i said wrong murphy said the answer to that question is that you dont know exactly but that you will certainly call murphy from the getgo you get less busted up when im around thats true i covered her hand with mine and said thanks murph youre gonna make me puke dresden she said oh so you know rudolph is out of si the assistant da he was working for liked his toadying style rudolph the brownnosed reindeer i said murphy grinned at least hes not my problem anymore internal affairs has to worry now rudolph in internal affairs that cant be good one monster at a time on the fourth day charity inspected my wound and told michael that i could leave she never actually spoke to me which i considered an improvement over most visits that afternoon michael and sanya came in michael was carrying shiros battered old cane we got the swords back michael said this is for you youll have a better idea what to do with that than me i told him shiro wanted you to have it michael said oh and you got some mail i what michael offered me an envelope and the cane as a unit i took them both and frowned at the envelope the lettering was in black calligraphy and flowed beautifully across the envelope to harry dresden and its your address michael postmarked two weeks ago michael shrugged i opened the envelope and found two pages inside one was a copy of a medical report the other was ornately handwritten like the envelope it read dear mr dresden by the time you read this letter i will be dead i have not been given the details but i know a few things that will happen over the next few days i write you now to say what i might not have the chance to in the flesh your path is often a dark one you do not always have the luxury that we do as knights of the cross we struggle against powers of darkness we live in black and white while you must face a world of greys it is never easy to know the path in such a place trust your heart you are a decent man god lives in such hearts enclosed is a medical report my family is aware of it though i have not shared it with michael or sanyo it is my hope that it will give you a measure of comfort in the face of my choice do not waste tears on me i love my work we all must die there is no better way to do so than in the pursuit of something you love walk in mercy and truth shiro i read over the medical report blinking at several tears what is it sanya asked its from shiro i said he was dying michael frowned at me i held up the medical report cancer terminal he knew it when he came here michael took it and let out a long breath now i understand i dont michael passed the report to sanya and smiled shiro must have known that we would need you to stop the denarians its why he traded himself for your freedom and why he accepted the curse in your place why michael shrugged you were the one we needed you had all of the information you were the one who realized cassius was masquerading as father vincent you had contacts within the local authorities to give you access to more information to help us when we needed the concourse emptied you were the one who could call in marcone for his help im not sure that says anything good about me i said glowering it says that you were the right man in the right place and at the right time michael said what of the shroud does marcone have it i think so how should we handle it we dont i do michael regarded me for a moment then said all right he stood up and then said oh the dry cleaners called they said theyre going to charge you a late fee if you dont swing by and pick up your laundry today im running out for groceries i can take you i dont have anything that goes to a dry cleaners i muttered but i went with michael the dry cleaners had my leather duster it had been cleaned up and covered with a protective treatment in the pockets were the keys to the blue beetle along with a bill to a parking garage on the back of the bill written in flowing letters were the words thank you so i guess anna valmont wasnt all that horrible a person after all but then ive always been a sucker for a pretty face when i got back to my house i found a postcard with a picture of rio and no return address with my mail there was a number on the back i called the number and after a few rings susan asked harry harry i said are you all right shot i said itll heal did you beat nicodemus i got away from him i said we stopped the plague but he killed shiro oh she said quietly im sorry i got my coat back and my car not a total loss i started opening mail as i spoke susan asked what about the shroud jurys not out yet marcone got involved what happened she said he saved my life i said michaels too he didnt have to do it wow yeah sometimes it feels like the older i get the more confused everything is susan coughed harry im sorry i wasnt around by the time i was conscious we were already over central america its okay i said i didnt know what martin had in mind she said honestly i wanted to talk to you and to trish and pick up a few of my things i thought martin was only coming along to help i didnt know that he had come here to kill ortega he used me to cover his movements its okay it isnt okay and im sorry i opened an envelope read it and blurted oh youre kidding me what i just opened a letter its from larry fowlers lawyer the jerk is suing me for trashing his car and his studio he cant prove that susan said can he whether or not he can this is going to cost me a fortune in legal fees smarmy mealymouthed jerk then i hate to add more bad news ortega is back in casaverde recovering hes called in all his strongest knights and let it be widely known that hes coming to kill you personally ill cross that bridge when i come to it did you see the subtle humor there vampires cross god im funny susan said something in spanish not into the phone and sighed damn i have to go saving nuns and orphans i asked leaping tall buildings in a single bound i should probably put on some underwear that brought a smile to my face you joke around a lot more than you used to i said i like it i could picture the sad smile on her face as she spoke im dealing with a lot of scary things she said i think you have to react to them and you either laugh at them or you go insane or you become like martin shut off from everything and everyone trying not to feel so you joke i said i learned it from you i should open a school maybe so she said i love you harry i wish things were different my throat got tight me too ill get you a drop address if you ever need my help get in touch only if i need your help i asked she exhaled slowly and said yeah i tried to say okay but my throat was too tight to speak good bye harry susan said i whispered goodbye and that was the end of that i woke up to a ringing telephone the next day hoss ebenezar said you should watch the news today he hung up on me i went down to a nearby diner for breakfast and asked the waitress to turn on the news she did extraordinary event reminiscent of the sciencefiction horror stories around the turn of the millennium what appeared to be an asteroid fell from space and impacted just outside the village of casaverde in honduras the screen flickered to an aerial shot of an enormous smoking hole in the ground and a halfmilewide circle of trees that had been blasted flat just past the circle of destruction stood a poorlooking village however information coming in from agencies around the world indicates that the socalled meteor was in actuality a deactivated soviet communications satellite which decayed in orbit and fell to earth no estimates of the number of deaths or injuries in this tragic freak accident have yet reached authorities but it seems unlikely that anyone in the manor house could possibly have survived the impact i sat slowly back pursing my lips i decided that maybe i wasnt sorry asteroid dresden turned out to be an old soviet satellite after all and i made a mental note to myself never to get on ebenezars bad side the next day i tracked down marcone it wasnt easy i had to call in a couple of favors in the spirit world to get a beaconspell going on him and he knew all the tricks for losing a tail i had to borrow michaels truck so that i could have a prayer of following him inconspicuously the beetle may be way sexy but subtle it aint he changed cars twice and somehow called into effect the magical equivalent of a destructive electromagnetic pulse that scrambled my beaconspell only quick thinking and some inspired thaumaturgy combined with my investigative skills let me stay with him he drove right on into the evening to a private hospital in wisconsin it was a longtermcare and therapeutic facility he pulled in dressed in casual clothes and wearing a baseball cap which alone generated enough cognitive dissonance to make me start drooling he pulled a backpack out of the car and went inside i gave him a little bit of a lead and then followed him with my beacon i stayed outside peering in windows at lit hallways keeping pace and watching marcone stopped at a room and went inside i stood at the window keeping track of him the paper tag on the door from the hall read doe jane in big permanent marker letters that were faded with age there was a single bed in the room and there was a girl on it she wasnt old id place her in her late teens or early twenties she was so thin it was hard to tell she wasnt on life support but her bedcovers were flawlessly unwrinkled combined with her emaciated appearance i was guessing she was in a coma whoever she was marcone drew up a chair beside the bed he pulled out a teddy bear and slipped it into the crook of the girls arm he got out a book then he started reading to her out loud he sat there reading to her for an hour before he slipped a bookmark into place and put the book back into the backpack then he reached into the pack and pulled out the shroud he peeled down the outermost blanket on her bed and carefully laid the shroud over the girl folding its ends in a bit to keep it from spilling out then he covered it up with the blanket and sat down in the chair again his head bowed i hadnt ever pictured john marcone praying but i saw him forming the word please over and over he waited for another hour then his face sunken and tired he rose and kissed the girl on the head he put the teddy bear back into the backpack got up and left the room i went to his car and sat down on the hood marcone stopped in his tracks and stared at me when he saw me i just sat there he padded warily over to his car and said voice quiet how did you find me wasnt easy i said is anyone else with you no i saw the wheels spinning in his head i saw him panic a little i saw him consider killing me i saw him force himself to slow down and decide against any rash action he nodded once and said what do you want the shroud no he said there was a hint of frustration to his voice i just got it here i saw i said who is the girl his eyes went flat and he said nothing okay marcone i said you can give me the shroud or you can explain it to the police when they come out here to search this place you cant he said his voice quiet you cant do that to her shed be in danger my eyes widened shes yours ill kill you he said in that same soft voice if you so much as breathe in her direction ill kill you dresden myself i believed him whats wrong with her i asked persistent vegetative state he said coma you wanted it to heal her i said quietly thats why you had it stolen yes i dont think it works like that i said it isnt as simple as plugging in a light but it might work he said i shrugged maybe ill take it he said its all i have i looked back toward the window and was quiet for a minute i made up my mind and said three days he frowned what three days i said threes a magic number and supposedly thats how long christ was wrapped in it in three days three sunrises you should know whether its going to help or not and then then the shroud is returned in a plain brown wrapper to father forthill at saint mary of the angels i said no note no nothing just returned and if i dont youll expose her i shook my head and stood up no i wont do that ill take it up with you he stared at me for a long moment before his expression softened all right i left him there when id first met marcone hed tricked me into a soulgaze though i hadnt known the specifics i knew then that he had a secretone that gave him the incredible amount of will and inner strength needed to run one of the nations largest criminal empires he had something that drove him to be remorseless practical deadly now i knew what that secret was marcone was still a black hat the pain and suffering of the criminal state he ruled accounted for an untold amount of human misery maybe hed been doing it for a noble reason i could understand that but it didnt change anything marcones good intentions could have paved a new lane on the road to hell but dammit i couldnt hate him anymore i couldnt hate him because i wasnt sure that i wouldnt have made the same choice in his place hate was simpler but the world aint a simple place it would have been easier to hate marcone i just couldnt do it a few days later michael threw a cookout as a farewell celebration for sanya who was heading back to europe now that the shroud had been returned to father forthill i was invited so i showed up and ate about a hundred and fifty grilled hamburgers when i was done with them i went into the house but stopped to glance into the sitting room by the front door sanya sat in a recliner his expression puzzled blinking at the phone again he said molly sat crosslegged on the couch near him with a phone book in her lap and my shopping list shed picked up in the tree house laid flat over one half of it her expression was serious but her eyes were sparkling as she drew a red line through another entry in the phone book how strange she said and read off another number sanya started dialing hello he said a moment later hello sir could you please tell me if you have prince albert in a can he blinked again mystified and reported to molly they hung up again weird molly said and winked at me i left before i started choking on the laugh i had to hold back and went out into the front yard little harry was there by himself playing in the grass in sight of his sister inside heya kid i said you shouldnt be out here all by yourself people will accuse you of being a reclusive madman next thing you know youll be wandering around saying woahsebud i heard a clinking sound something shining landed in the grass by little harry and he immediately pushed himself to his feet wobbled then headed for it i panicked abruptly and lunged out ahead of him slapping my hand down over a polished silver coin before the child could squat down to pick it up i felt a prickling jolt shoot up my arm and had the sudden intangible impression that someone nearby was waking up from a nap and stretching i looked up to see a car on the street driverside window rolled down nicodemus sat at the wheel relaxed and smiling be seeing you dresden he drove away i took my shaking hand from the coin lasciels blackened sigil lay before my eyes i heard a door open and on pure instinct palmed the coin and slipped it in my pocket i looked back to find sanya frowning and looking up and down the street his nostrils flared a few times and he paced over to stand near me he sniffed a few more times and then peered down at the baby aha he rumbled someone is stinky he swooped the kid up in his arms making him squeal and laugh you mind if i steal your playmate for a minute harry go ahead i said i need to get going anyway sanya nodded and grinned at me offering his hand i shook it it has been a pleasure to work with you sanya said perhaps we will see each other again the coin felt cool and heavy in my pocket yeah maybe so i left the cookout without saying goodbye and headed home i heard something the whole time something whispering almost inaudibly i drowned it out with loud and offkey singing and got to work ten hours later i put down the excavating pick and glowered at the twofoot hole i had chipped in my labs concrete floor the whispering in my head had segued into sympathy for the devil by the stones harry whispered a gentle voice i dropped the coin into the hole i slipped a steel ring about three inches across around it i muttered to myself and willed energy into the ring the whispering abruptly cut off i dumped two buckets of cement into the hole and smoothed it until it was level with the rest of my floor after that i hurried out of the lab and shut the door behind me mister came over to demand attention i settled on the couch and he jumped up to sprawl on his back over my legs i petted him and stared at shiros cane resting in the corner he said that i must live in a world of greys to trust my heart i rubbed misters favorite spot behind his right ear and he purred in approval mister at least for the moment agreed that my heart was in the right place but its possible he wasnt being objective after a while i picked up shiros cane and stared down at the smooth old wood fidelacchiuss power whispered against my fingertips there was a single japanese character carved into the sheath when i asked bob he told me that it read simply faith it isnt good to hold on too hard to the past you cant spend your whole life looking back not even when you cant see what lies ahead all you can do is keep on keeping on and try to believe that tomorrow will be what it should beeven if it isnt what you expected i took susans picture down i put the postcards in a brown envelope i picked up the jewel box that held the dinky engagement ring id offered her and that shed turned down then i put them all away in my closet i laid the old mans cane on my fireplace mantel maybe some things just arent meant to go together things like oil and water orange juice and toothpaste me and susan but tomorrow was another day
