on their mouths she kissed them both with glee from hideous thrall were they both set free she kissed them both with good will i ween they changed to her brothers who lost had been they all pressed her fondly to their breast from sorrow and woe she is now at rest the wrestlingmatch as one day i wandered lonely in extreme distress of mind i a pleasant garden entered hoping comfort there to find up and down i paced the garden till an open space i spied there i saw a crowd of people and i heard a voice that cried come and see what love is doing here is love performing more wondrous feats than eer were witnessed at olympian games of yore this he conquers that he conquers young and old before him lie great and small alike he conquers none with him a fall must try hearing this at once i entered midst the crowd collected there some of whom no doubt were eager like myself to banish care i would fain behold this being this same wondrous lad survey who twas said in each encounter bore with ease the prize away quickly i the crowd divided soon i pierced the multitude and this love stood full before me and what think you twas i viewd why a boy a little darling full of captivating grace rather roguish were his glances but how lovely was his face soon as i beheld this warrior gibings i began to throw at the wretches who had suffered fell defeat from such a foe then to me his visage turning of the conquered standing by one replied and in replying tears he shed abundantly o poor youth twas thus he answered little little dost thou know that in coming here thou comest not to joy but bitter woe tears and pains and wounds most ghastly wounds for which there is no cure every kind of evil treatment such as no one can endure when these words i heard him utter i was filled with bitter rage and forthwith made preparation with the warrior to engagehearken master love i shouted from this spot stir not away you and i must have a battle must engage in deadly fray that it may be known for certain which is strongest of us two then into the arena bounding there i stood in all mens view in the midst of it expecting firm the onset of the foe doubting not should he attack me him at once to overthrow love he was not slow to follow with a blythe and joyous air crying out my dearest fellow for the fight yourself prepare round the waist each other clasping now lets strive like wrestlers true do your best and i will show you what young master love can do then around the waist i clasped him he his arms around me wound long we hugged and hugged each other each his match in tother found said at length the urchin to me sadly tired friend am i very much fatigued and weary really friend just fit to die therefore take from me i prythee what thou anxiously hast sought and for which in this arena with me gallantly hast fought then a blast of wild consuming fire he breathed into my breast straight my breast it quick enkindled all deprived was i of rest then he ran away exulting to some other wretched wight such a zest he has for conflict in such fray is his delight as for me i fell half senseless on the fatal fatal spot fierce consuming fire within me never sure was one so hot rising up i followed shrieking oh have mercy love on me see my tears my sad affliction cure me of my misery then he cried dost not remember all the boasts thy lips outpourd know henceforth in every region love is conqueror and lord thus he cried and proudly left me and wherever now i rove i reproach myself for thinking i could vanquish mighty love the warrior from the arabic thou lovst to look on myrtles green and the narcissus bright of hue i love the blaze of sabres keen i love the daggers flash to view thou thou mayst drink the rosy wine from golden goblets sculptured oer from foemens skulls the joy be mine to drink my foemens reeking gore london printed for thomas j wise hampstead nw edition limited to thirty copies footnotes here the old balladi speak of the original
