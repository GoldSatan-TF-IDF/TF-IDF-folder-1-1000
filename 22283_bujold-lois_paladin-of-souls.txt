lois mcmaster bujold paladin of souls chapter one ista leaned forward between the crenellations atop the gate tower the stone gritty beneath her pale hands and watched in numb exhaustion as the final mourning party cleared the castle gate below their horses hooves scraped on the old cobblestones and their goodbyes echoed in the portals vaulting her earnest brother the provincar of baocia and his family and retinue were last of the many to leave two full weeks after the divines had completed the funeral rites and ceremonies of the interment dy baocia was still talking soberly to the castle warder ser dy ferrej who walked at his stirrup grave face upturned listening to the stream no doubt of final instructions faithful dy ferrej who had served the late dowager provincara for all the last two decades of her long residence here in valenda the keys of the castle and keep glinted from the belt at his stout waist her mothers keys which ista had collected and held then turned over to her older brother along with all the other papers and inventories and instructions that a great ladys death entailed and that he had handed back for permanent safekeeping not to his sister but to good old honest dy ferrej keys to lock out all danger and if necessary ista in its only habit you know im not mad anymore really it wasnt as though she wanted her mothers keys nor her mothers life that went with them she scarcely knew what she wanted she knew what she fearedto be locked up in some dark narrow place by people who loved her an enemy might drop his guard weary of his task turn his back love would never falter her fingers rubbed restlessly on the stone dy baocias cavalcade filed off down the hill through the town and was soon lost from her view among the crowded redtiled roofs dy ferrej turning back walked wearily in through the gate and out of sight the chill spring wind lifted a strand of istas dun hair and blew it across her face catching on her lip she grimaced and tucked it back into the careful braiding wreathing her head its tightness pinched her scalp the weather had warmed these last two weeks too late to ease an old woman bound to her bed by injury and illness if her mother had not been so old the broken bones would have healed more swiftly and the inflammation of the lungs might not have anchored itself so deeply in her chest if she had not been so fragile perhaps the fall from the horse would not have broken her bones in the first place if she had not been so fiercely willful perhaps she would not have been on that horse at all at her age ista looked down to find her fingers bleeding and hid them hastily in her skirt in the funeral ceremonies the gods had signed that the old ladys soul had been taken up by the mother of summer as was expected and proper even the gods would not dare violate her views on protocol ista imagined the old provincara ordering heaven and smiled a little grimly and so i am alone at last ista considered the empty spaces of that solitude its fearful cost husband father son and mother had all filed down to the grave ahead of her in their turn her daughter was claimed by the royacy of chalion in as tight an embrace as any grave and as little likely to return from her high place five gods willing as the others from their low ones surely i am done the duties that had defined her all accomplished once she had been her parents daughter then great unlucky iass wife her childrens mother at the last her mothers keeper well i am none of these things now who am i when i am not surrounded by the walls of my life when they have all fallen into dust and rubble well she was still lord dy lutezs murderer the last of that little secret company left alive now that she had made of herself and that she remained she leaned between the crenellations again the stone abrading the lavender sleeves of her court mourning dress catching at its silk threads her eye followed the road in the morning light starting from the stones below and flowing downhill through the town past the river and where all roads were one road they said a great net across the land parting and rejoining all roads ran two ways they said i want a road that does not come back a frightened gasp behind her jerked her head around one of her lady attendants stood on the battlement with her hand to her lips eyes wide breathing heavily from her climb she smiled with false cheer my lady ive been seeking you everywhere do do come away from that edge now istas lips curled in irony content you i do not yearn to meet the gods facetoface this day or on any other never again the gods and i are not on speaking terms she suffered the woman to take her arm and stroll with her as if casually along the battlement toward the inner stairs careful ista noted to take the outside place between ista and the drop content you woman i do not desire the stones i desire the road the realization startled almost shocked her it was a new thought a new thought me all her old thoughts seemed as thin and ragged as a piece of knitting made and ripped out and made and ripped out again until all the threads were frayed growing ever more worn but never larger but how could she gain the road roads were made for young men not middleaged women the poor orphan boy packed his sack and started off down the road to seek his hearts hope a thousand tales began that way she was not poor she was not a boy and her heart was surely as stripped of all hope as life and death could render it i am an orphan now though is that not enough to qualify me they turned the corner of the battlement making toward the round tower containing the narrow winding staircase that gave onto the inner garden ista cast one last glance out across the scraggly shrubs and stunted trees that crept up to the curtain wall of the castle up the path from the shallow ravine a servant towed a donkey loaded with firewood heading for the postern gate in her late mothers flower garden ista slowed resisting her attendants urgent hand upon her arm and mulishly took to a bench in the stillbare rose arbor i am weary she announced i would rest here for a time you may fetch me tea she could watch her lady attendant turning over the risks in her mind regarding her high charge untrustingly ista frowned coldly the woman dropped a curtsey yes my lady ill tell one of the maids and ill be right back i expect you will ista waited only till the woman had rounded the corner of the keep before she sprang to her feet and ran for the postern gate the guard was just letting the servant and his donkey through ista head high sailed out past them without turning round pretending not to hear the guards uncertain my lady she walked briskly down the steepening path her trailing skirts and billowing black velvet vestcloak snagged on weeds and brambles as she passed like clutching hands trying to hold her back once out of sight among the first trees her steps quickened to something close to a run she had used to run down this path to the river when she was a girl before she was anybodys anything she was no girl now she had to concede she was winded and trembling by the time the rivers gleam shone through the vegetation she turned and strode along the bank the path still held its remembered course to the old footbridge across the water and up again to one of the main roads winding around the hill toor fromthe town of valenda the road was muddy and pocked with hoof prints perhaps her brothers party had just passed on its way to his provincial seat of taryoon he had spent much of the past two weeks attempting to persuade her to accompany him there promising her rooms and attendants in his palace under his benign and protective eye as though she had not rooms and attendants and prying eyes enough here she turned in the opposite direction court mourning and silk slippers were no garb for a country road her skirts swished around her legs as though she were trying to wade through high water the mud sucked at her light shoes the sun climbing the sky heated her velvetclad back and she broke into an unladylike sweat she walked on feeling increasingly uncomfortable and foolish this was madness this was just the sort of thing that got women locked up in towers with lackwitted attendants and hadnt she had enough of that for one lifetime she hadnt a change of clothes a plan any money not so much as a copper vaida she touched the jewels around her neck theres money yes too much valuewhat countrytown moneylender could match for them they were not a resource they were merely a target bait for bandits the rumble of a cart drew her eyes upward from picking her way along the puddles a farmer drove a stout cob hauling a load of ripe manure for spreading on his fields he turned his head to stare dumfounded at the apparition of her on his road she returned him a regal nodafter all what other kind could she offer she nearly laughed out loud but choked back the unseemly noise and walked on not looking back not daring to she walked for over an hour before her tiring legs dragging the weight of her dress stumbled at last to a halt she was close to weeping from the frustration of it all this isnt working i dont know how to do this i never had a chance to learn and now i am too old horses again galloping and a shout it flashed across her mind that among the other things she had failed to provision herself with was a weapon even so much as a belt knife to defend herself from assault she pictured herself matched against a swordsman any swordsman with any weapon she could possibly pick up and swing and snorted it made a short scene hardly likely to be worth the bother she glanced back over her shoulder and sighed ser dy ferrej and a groom pounded down the road in her wake the mud splashing from their horses hooves she was not she thought quite fool enough or mad enough to wish for bandits instead maybe that was the trouble maybe she just wasnt crazed enough true derangement stopped at no boundaries mad enough to wish for what she was not mad enough to graspnow there was a singularly useless lunacy guilt twinged in her heart at the sight of dy ferrejs red terrified perspiring face as he drew up by her side royina he cried my lady what are you doing out here he almost tumbled from his saddle to grasp her hands and stare into her face i grew weary of the sorrows of the castle i decided to take a walk in the spring sunshine to solace myself my lady you have come over five miles this road is quite unfit for you yes and i am quite unfit for it no attendants no guardsfive gods consider your station and your safety consider my gray hairs you have stood them on end with this start i do apologize to your gray hairs said ista with a little real contrition they do not deserve the toil of me nor does the remainder of you either good dy ferrej i just wanted to take a walk tell me next time and i will arrange by myself you are the dowager royina of all chalion stated dy ferrej firmly you are royina iselles own mother for the five gods sake you cannot go skipping off down the road like a country wench ista sighed at the thought of being a skipping country wench and not tragic ista anymore though she did not doubt country wenches had their tragedies too and much less poetic sympathy for them than did royinas but there was nothing to be gained by arguing with him in the middle of the road he made the groom give up his horse and she acquiesced to being loaded aboard it the skirts of this dress were not split for riding and they bunched uncomfortably around her legs as she felt for the stirrups ista frowned again as the groom took the reins from her and made to lead her mount dy ferrej leaned across his saddle bow to grasp her hand in consolation for the tears standing in her eyes i know he murmured kindly your lady mothers death is a great loss for us all i finished weeping for her weeks ago dy ferrej she had sworn once to neither weep nor pray ever again but she had forsworn herself on both oaths in those last dreadful days in the sickroom after that neither weeping nor praying had seemed to have any point she decided not to trouble the castle warders mind with the explanation that she wept now for herself and not in sorrow but in a sort of rage let him take her as a little unhinged by bereavement bereavement passed dy ferrej quite as tired out as she by the past weeks of grief and guests did not trouble her with further conversation and the groom did not dare she sat her plodding horse and let the road roll up again beneath her like a carpet being put away denied its use what was her use now she chewed her lip and stared between her horses bobbing ears after a time its ears flickered she followed its snorting glance to see another cavalcade approaching down a connecting road some dozen or two riders on horses and mules dy ferrej rose in his stirrups and squinted but then eased back in his saddle at the sight of the four outriders clad in the blue tunics and gray cloaks of soldierbrothers of the daughters order whose mandate encompassed the safe conveyance of pilgrims on the road as the party rode closer it could be seen that its members included both men and women all decked out in the colors of their chosen gods or as close as their wardrobes could manage and that they wore colored ribbons on their sleeves in token of their holy destinations the two parties reached the joining of the roads simultaneously and dy ferrej exchanged reassuring nods with the soldierbrothers stolid conscientious fellows like himself the pilgrims stared in speculation at ista in her fine somber clothes a stout redfaced older womanshes not any older than i am surelyoffered ista a cheery smile after an uncertain moment istas lips curved up in response and she returned her nod dy ferrej had placed his horse between the pilgrims and ista but his shielding purpose was defeated when the stout woman reined her horse back and kneed it into a trot to come up around him the gods give you a good day lady the woman puffed her fat piebald horse was overburdened with stuffed saddlebags and yet more bags tied to them with twine and bouncing as precariously as its rider it dropped back to a walk and she caught her breath and straightened her straw hat she wore mothers greens in somewhat mismatched dark hues proper to a widow but the braided ribbons circling her sleeve marched down in a full rank of five blue wound with white green with yellow red with orange black with gray and white twined with cream after a moments hesitation ista nodded again and you we are pilgrims from around baocia the woman announced invitingly traveling to the shrine of the miraculous death of chancellor dy jironal in taryoon well except for the good ser dy brauda over there she nodded toward an older man in subdued browns wearing a redandorange favor marking allegiance to the son of autumn a more brightly togged young man rode by his side who leaned forward to frown quellingly around him at the greenclad woman hes taking his boy over thereisnt he a pretty lad now eh the boy recoiled and stared straight ahead growing flushed as if to harmonize with the ribbons on his sleeve his father was not successful in suppressing a smile up to cardegoss to be invested in the sons order like his papa before him to be sure the ceremony is to be performed by the holy general the royseconsort bergon himself id so like to see him they say hes a handsome fellow that ibran seashore he comes from is supposed to be good for growing fine young men i shall have to find some reason to pray in cardegoss myself and give my old eyes that treat indeed said ista neutrally at this anticipatory but on the whole accurate description of her soninlaw i am caria of palma i was wife of a saddler there most lately widow now and you good lady is this surly fellow your husband then the castle warder listening with obvious disapproval to such familiarity made to pull his horse back and fend off the tiresome woman but ista held up her hand peace dy ferrej he raised his brows but shrugged and held his tongue ista continued to the pilgrim i am a widow of valenda ah indeed why and so am i the woman returned brightly my first man was of there though ive buried three husbands altogether she announced this as though it were an achievement oh not all together of course one at a time she cocked her head in curiosity at istas high mourning colors did you just bury yours then lady pity no wonder you look so sad and pale well dear its a hard time especially with the first you know at the beginning you want to diei know i didbut thats just fear talking things will come about again dont you worry ista smiled briefly and shook her head in faint disagreement but was not moved to correct the womans misapprehension dy ferrej was clearly itching to depress the creatures forwardness by announcing istas rank and station and by implication his own and perhaps driving her off but ista realized with a little wonder that she found caria amusing the widows burble did not displease her and she didnt want her to stop there was apparently no danger of that caria of palma pointed out her fellow pilgrims favoring ista with a rambling account of their stations origins and holy goals and if they rode sufficiently far out of earshot with opinions of their manners and morals thrown in gratis besides the amused veteran dedicat of the son of autumn and his blushing boy the party included four men from a weavers fraternity who went to pray to the father of winter for a favorable outcome of a lawsuit a man wearing the ribbons of the mother of summer who prayed for the safety of a daughter nearing childbirth and a woman whose sleeve sported the blue and white of the daughter of spring who prayed for a husband for her daughter a thin woman in finely cut green robes of an acolyte of the mothers order with a maid and two servants of her own turned out to be neither midwife nor physician but a comptroller a wine merchant rode to give thanks and redeem his pledge to the father for his safe return with his caravan almost lost the previous winter in the snowy mountain passes to ibra the pilgrims within hearing who had evidently been riding with caria for some days now rolled their eyes variously as she talked on and on an exception was an obese young man in the white garb grimed from the road of a divine of the bastard he rode along quietly with a book open atop the curve of his belly his muddy white mules reins slack and glanced up only when he came to turn a page blinking nearsightedly and smiling muzzily the widow caria peered at the sun which had topped the sky i can hardly wait to get to valenda there is a famous inn where we are to eat that specializes in the most delicious roast suckling pigs she smacked her lips in anticipation there is such an inn in valenda yes said ista she had never eaten there she realized not in all her years of residence the mothers comptroller who had been one of the widows more pained involuntary listeners pursed her mouth in disapproval i shall take no meat she announced i made a vow that no gross flesh would cross my lips upon this journey caria leaned over and muttered to ista if shed made a vow to swallow her pride instead of her salads it would have been more to the point for a pilgrimage im thinking she sat up again grinning the mothers comptroller sniffed and pretended not to have heard the merchant with the fathers grayandblack ribbons on his sleeve remarked as if to the air im sure the gods have no use for pointless chatter we should be using our time betterdiscussing highminded things to prepare our minds for prayer not our bellies for dinner caria leered at him aye or lower parts for better things still and you ride with the fathers favor on your sleeve too for shame the merchant stiffened that is not the aspect of the god to which i intendor needto pray i assure you madam the divine of the bastard glanced up from his book and murmured peaceably the gods rule all parts of us from top to toe there is a god for everyone and every part your god has notably low tastes observed the merchant still stung none who open their hearts to any one of the holy family shall be excluded not even the priggish the divine bowed over his belly at the merchant caria gave a cheerful crack of laughter the merchant snorted indignation but desisted the divine returned to his book caria whispered to ista i like that fat fellow i do doesnt say much but when he speaks its to the point bookish men usually have no patience with me and i surely dont understand them but that one does have lovely manners though i do think a man should get him a wife and children and do the work that pays for them and not go haring off after the gods now i have to admit my dear second husband didntwork that isbut then he drank drank himself to death eventually to the relief of all who knew him five gods rest his spirit she signed herself touching forehead lip navel groin and heart spreading her hand wide over her plump breast she pursed her lips raised her chin and her voice and called curiously but now i think on it youve never told us what you go to pray for learned the divine placed his finger on his page and glanced up no i dont think i have he said vaguely the merchant said all you called folk pray to meet your god dont you i have often prayed for the goddess to touch my heart said the mothers comptroller it is my highest spiritual goal to see her facetoface indeed i often think i have felt her from time to time anyone who desires to see the gods facetoface is a great fool thought ista although that was not an impediment in her experience you dont have to pray to do that said the divine you just have to die its not hard he rubbed his second chin in fact its unavoidable to be godtouched in life corrected the comptroller coolly that is the great blessing we all long for no its not if you saw the mothers face right now woman you would drop weeping in the mud of this road and not get up for days ista became aware that the divine was squinting at her in arrested curiosity was he one of the godtouched ista possessed some practice at spotting them the reverse also held true unfortunately or perhaps that calf like stare was just shortsightedness discomforted she frowned back at him he blinked apologetically and said to her in fact i travel on business for my order a dedicat in my charge came by chance across a little stray demon possessed by a ferret i take it to taryoon for the archdivine to return to the god with proper ceremony he twisted around to his capacious saddlebags and rummaged therein trading the book for a small wicker cage a lithe gray shape turned within it ahha so thats what youve been hiding in there caria rode closer wrinkling her nose it looks like any other ferret to me the creature stood up against the side of the cage and twitched its whiskers at her the fat divine turned in his saddle and held up the cage to istas view the animal circling froze in her frown for just a moment its beady eyes glittered back with something other than animal intelligence ista regarded it dispassionately the ferret lowered its head and backed away until it could retreat no farther the divine gave ista a curious sidelong look are you sure the poor thing isnt just sick said caria doubtfully what do you think lady the divine asked ista you know very well it has a real demon why do you ask me why i think the good archdivine will certainly know what it is and what to do with it the divine smiled faintly at this guarded reply indeed it is not much of a demon he tucked the cage away again i wouldnt name it more than a mere elemental small and unformed it hasnt been long in the world id guess and so is little likely to tempt men to sorcery it did not tempt ista certainly but she understood his need to be discreet acquiring a demon made one a sorcerer much as acquiring a horse made one a rider but whether skilled or poor was a more open question like a horse a demon could run away with its master unlike a horse there was no dismounting to a souls peril hence the temples concern caria made to speak again but the path to the castle split off at that point and dy ferrej reined his horse aside the widow of palma converted whatever shed been about to say to a cheery farewell wave and dy ferrej escorted ista firmly off the road he glanced back over his shoulder as they started down the bank into the trees vulgar woman ill wager she has not a pious thought in her head she uses her pilgrimage only to shield her holidaymaking from the disapproval of her relatives and get herself a cheap armed escort on the road i believe you are entirely right dy ferrej ista glanced back over her shoulder at the party of pilgrims advancing down the main road the widow caria was now coaxing the divine of the bastard to sing hymns with her though the one she was suggesting more resembled a drinking song she had not one man of her own family to support her dy ferrej continued indignantly i suppose she cant help the lack of a husband but youd think she could scare up a brother or son or at least a nephew im sorry you had to be exposed to that royina a not entirely harmonious but thoroughly goodnatured duet rose behind them fading with distance im not said ista a slow smile curved her lips im not chapter two ista sat in her mothers rose arbor twisting a fine handkerchief in her fingers her lady attendant sat near her poking at a piece of embroidery with a needle as narrow as though rather sharper than her mind ista had paced the garden round and round in the cool morning air till the woman her voice rising had begged her to stop she paused now in her sewing to stare at istas hands and ista irritably set the tortured scrap of linen aside beneath her skirts safely hidden one silkslippered foot took up a nervousno furiousdrumming a gardener bustled about watering the flowers in the tubs placed around all the doorways for the daughters season just as he had done for years under the direction of the old provincara ista wondered how long it would be before those drilled habits died awayor would they continue forever as if the old ladys meticulous ghost still oversaw each task but no her soul had truly been taken up and out of the world of men there were no new ghosts in the castle or ista would have felt them all the sundered spirits left here were ancient and tired and fading a mere chill in the walls at night she breathed out through pursed lips flexing both curtained feet she had waited several days to spring to her castle warder the proposal that she go on pilgrimage this season in hopes that he would have forgotten the widow caria a pilgrimage in humility with only a small company few attendants simple gear no royal train a hundred riders long as he seemed instantly to think would be the minimum required dy ferrej had thrown up a dozen annoyingly practical objections and wondered at her sudden piety hed dismissed istas hint that she sought penance for her sins being under the impression that she could have committed none to speak of under his good guard which was she had to admit certainly the case for such gross sins of the flesh as he imagined dy ferrej was not a theologically subtle man as istas arguments had grown more intense dy ferrej had grown more stolid and cautious till ista had to bite back a frantic urge to scream at the man the more fiercely she pleaded the worse she made her case sound in his ears she was sure a galling paradox a page trotted across the garden favoring ista with a most peculiar bow in passing a sort of bending in midbounce he disappeared into the keep a few minutes later dy ferrej appeared with the page at his heels and trod gravely back across the garden the castle keys mark of his ward ship jingled at his belt where away dy ferrej ista called idly she forced her feet to stillness he paused and gave her a bow suitable to her rank and his dignity and girth and made the page do his over correctly as well i am told some riders from cardegoss have arrived royina he hesitated briefly your argument that i by my oath to you and yours owed you obedience as well as protection has been much on my mind ahha so that one had struck home good ista smiled slightly he smiled slightly back the openly relieved expression on his features edged with triumph as my pleas did not seem to move you i wrote to court to ask those to whom you will listen to add their voices and their more august authority to my own old dy ferrej indeed has no right to thwart you save for whatever forbearance he may be owedno that you may bestow upon him in charityfor his years of service istas lips thinned at his words i cry a foul but royina iselle and royse bergon are your liege lords now as well as having concern for your safety as their mother and i believe chancellor dy cazaril is a man whose opinion you do somewhat regard if im not mistaken some calming advice arrives with these messengers he nodded in satisfaction and moved off ista clenched her teeth she declined to call down curses on iselle bergon or cazaril or in truth on old dy ferrej as he was pleased to style himselfa disputants ploy he was scarcely more than a decade older than ista but the tension in her body seemed almost to constrict her breathing she half believed that in their urgency to guard her from old madness her earnest protectors would drive her mad anew the clack of horses hooves voices and the calls of grooms floated around the curve of the keep abruptly ista rose and paced after dy ferrej her lady attendant disentangled herself from her embroidery scrambled to her feet and pattered after her making little protesting noises through sheer habit ista decided in the cobbled entry court two riders in the garb of the daughters order were dismounting under dy ferrejs benevolent and welcoming eye they were certainly not local men from the temple at valenda nothing about their clothing or gear was mismatched crude or rustic from their polished boots up through neat blue trousers and tunics clean embroidered white wool vest cloaks and the gray hooded cloaks of their order their clothing shouted of cardegoss tailoring weapons and their housings were clean and meticulously cared for the brightwork polished and the leather oil rubbedbut not new one officerdedicat was a little above middle height light and wiry the shorter fellow was deeply muscled and the heavy broadsword that hung from his baldric was clearly no courtiers toy as dy ferrej finished speaking a welcome and directing the servants ista stepped up beside him she narrowed her eyes gentlemen do i not know you smiling they handed off their reins to the cluster of castle grooms and swept her courtly bows royina the taller murmured a pleasure to see you again not giving her a chance to be discomfited with shaky memory he added ferda dy gura my brother foix ah yes you are those young men who rode with chancellor dy cazaril on his great ibran mission three years ago i met you at bergons investiture the chancellor and royse bergon praised you highly kind of em murmured the stout one foix honored to serve you lady the elder dy gura came to a species of attention before her and recited chancellor dy cazaril presents us to you with his compliments to escort you upon your journey royina he begs you will regard us as your right hand hands ferda faltered and extemporized or right and left hand as the case may be his brother raised an impenitent eyebrow at him and murmured but which is which dy ferrejs satisfied look gave way to a startled one the chancellor approves this this venture ista wondered what less flattering word he had just swallowed ferda and foix looked at each other foix shrugged and turned to dig in his saddlebag mlord dy cazaril gave me this note to give into your hand lady with a cheerful flourish he presented a paper folded with both a large red chancellery seal and dy cazarils personal stamp a crow perched on the letters caz pressed in blue wax ista took it with thanks and considerable mystification dy ferrej craned his neck as she broke it open on the spot scattering wax on the cobbles she turned a little away from him to read it it was brief and written in a fine chancellery script addressing her with all her full formal titles the heading was longer than the body of the letter it read i give you these two good brothers ferda and foix dy gura to attend you as captains and companions upon your road wherever it may take you i trust they may serve you as well as they have served me five gods speed you on your journey your most humble and obedient and a semicircle with trailing scrawl dy cazarils signature in the same vile handwritingdy cazarils fingers had more strength than delicacy ista recalledwas written a postscript iselle and bergon send a purse in memory of the jewels pawned for another jaunt that bought a country i have entrusted it to foix do not be alarmed by his humor he is much less simple than he looks slowly istas lips curled up i think that is very clear she handed off the letter to the hovering dy ferrej his face fell as his eyes sped down the lines his lips made an o but were too well trained perhaps to complete the expletive ista credited the old provincara for that dy ferrej looked up at the brothers butthe royina cannot take to the roads with only two outriders no matter how excellent certainly not sir ferda gave him a little bow we brought our full troop i left them down in town to batten upon the temples larder except for the two men i dispatched to another task they should return tomorrow to complete our numbers other task said dy ferrej marshal dy palliar seized our going this way to add a chore he sent up a fine roknari stallion that we captured in the gotorget campaign last fall to cover the mares at our orders breeding farm at palma ferdas face grew animated oh i wish youd had a chance to see him royina he bounds from the earth and trots on airthe most glorious silver coatsilk merchants would swoon in envy hooves that ring like cymbals when they strike the ground tail like a banner flying mane like a maidens hair a marvel of nature his brother cleared his throat er concluded ferda a very fine horse withal i suppose dy ferrej said staring into the middle distance with the chancellors note still in his hand we could write to your brother dy baocia in taryoon for a detachment of his provincial cavalry in addition and ladies of his household to wait upon you in full panoply your good sisterinlaw perhapsor some of your nieces may be old enough ladies of his court and your own attendants of course and all the necessary maids and grooms and we must send down to the temple for a suitable spiritual conductor no betterwe should write to cardegoss and ask archdivine mendenal to recommend a divine of high scholarship that would take another ten days said ista in alarm at least her thrill at dy ferrejs forced reversal sank in dismay if he had his way so far from escaping she would be constrained to crawl over the countryside trailed by a veritable army i wish no such delay the weather and the roads are much improved now she threw in a little desperately i would prefer to take advantage of the clear skies well well we can discuss that he said glancing up at the fair blue day as if allowing her the point safely minor ill speak with your ladies and write to your brother his mouth turned down in thought iselle and bergon plainly mean some message by that purse perhaps royina they intend for you to pray for a grandson on your pilgrimage that would indeed be a great blessing to the royacy of chalion and a very befitting purpose for your prayers the idea clearly held more charm for him than it did for her as hed been enormously pleased recently by the birth of his own first grandson but since it was the first positive remark hed yet made about her venture she forbore to wrest it from him the dy gura brothers and their horses were led off to the hospitality of the castle and its stables respectively and dy ferrej hurried about his selfimposed tasks istas woman promptly began gabbling about all the problems of selecting clothing for such an arduous journey for all the world as if ista proposed an expedition across the mountains to darthaca or beyond instead of a pious amble around baocia ista considered pleading a headache to make her stop her chatter concluded it would ill serve her purposes and set her teeth to endure the woman was still prattling and worrying by late afternoon trailed by three maids she dodged about istas rooms in the old keep sorting and resorting piles of gowns robes cloaks and shoes trading off the need for colors appropriate for istas high mourning with preparation for every likely or unlikely contingency ista sat in a window seat overlooking the entry court letting the endless words flow over her like a drip from a gutter spout her headache was now quite real she decided a clatter and bustle at the castle gate announced unusually another visitor ista sat up and peered through the casement a tall bay horse clopped in through the archway its rider wore the castleandleopard tabard of the chancellery of chalion over more faded clothing the rider swung down bouncing onoh her toes the courier was a freshfaced young woman with her hair in a black braid down her back she pulled a bundle from behind her saddle and unrolled it with a snap to reveal a skirt with decidedly perfunctory modesty she hitched up her tunic and wrapped the garment around her trousers at her slim waist shaking out the hem around her booted ankles with a cheerful swing of her hips de ferrej appeared below the girl unsealed her chancellery pouch and held it upside down to drop out a single letter dy ferrej read the direction and tore it open then and there by which ista deduced it was a personal missive from his beloved daughter lady betriz attendant upon the royina iselle at court perhaps it contained news of his grandson for his face softened was it time yet for first teeth if so ista would hear of the infants achievement in due course she had to smile a little the girl stretched restored her pouch checked her horses legs and hooves and turned the animal over to the castle groom with some string of instructions ista became conscious of her own ladyinwaiting peering over her shoulder ista said impulsively i would speak to that courier girl fetch her to me my lady she had only the one letter well then ill have to hear the news of court from her lips her woman snorted such a rude girl is not likely to be in the confidence of the court ladies at cardegoss nonetheless fetch her it might have been the sharp tone of voice in any case the woman moved off at length a firm tread and an aroma of horses and leather announced the girls arrival in istas sitting room even before her womans dubious my lady here is the courier as you asked ista swung round in the casement seat and stared up waving her woman out she departed with a disapproving frown the girl stared back with slightly daunted curiosity she managed an awkward bob halfway between a bow and a curtsey royina how may i serve you ista scarcely knew whats your name girl liss my lady after a moment of rather empty silence she offered short for annaliss where do you come from today i picked up my dispatch case at the station in noaltogether oh um my father had a little estate near the town of teneret in the province of labra he raised horses for the brothers order and sheep for the wool market still does as far as i know a man of substance she was not escaping some dire poverty then how did you become a courier i had not thought about it till one day my sister and i came to town to deliver some horses to the temple and i saw a girl gallop in riding courier for the daughters order she smiled as if in some happy memory i was on fire from that moment perhaps it was the confidence of her calling or of her youth and strength the girl while very polite was by no means tonguetied in the royinas presence ista noted with relief arent you afraid out there alone on the roads she tossed her head making her braid swing i outride all danger so far anyway ista could believe it the girl was taller than ista but still shorter and slighter than the average man even the wiry fellows favored for couriers she would sit her horse lightly or or uncomfortable you must ride in heat cold all weather i dont melt in the rain and the riding keeps me warm in the snow if i have to i can sleep wrapped in my cloak on the ground under a tree or up it if the place seems chancy its true the courier station bunks are warmer and less bumpy her eyes crinkled with humor slightly ista sighed in faint awe of such boundless energy how long have you been riding for the chancellery three years now since i was fifteen what had ista been doing at age fifteen training to be a great lords wife she supposed when roya iass eye had fallen on her at about the age this girl was now the schooling had seemed to succeed beyond her familys wildest dreamstill the dream had melted into the long nightmare of iass great curse now broken thank the gods and lord dy cazaril now broken these three years gone the choking fog of it had lifted from her mind that day the dullness of her life the stalemate of her soul since then was just long habit how came your family to let you leave home so young the girls flickering amusement warmed her face like the sun through green leaves i believe i forgot to ask come to think on it and the dispatcher allowed you to sign on without your fathers word i believe he forgot to ask too being in great need of riders just then its amazing how the rules change in a pinch but with four other daughters to dower i didnt expect my father and brothers to run down the road to drag me back you went that very day asked ista startled the white grin widenedshe had healthy teeth too ista noted of course i figured if i had to go home and spin one more skein of yarn id scream and fall down in a fit besides my mother never liked my yarn anyway she said it was too lumpy ista could sympathize with that statement a reluctant answering smile lifted her lips my daughter is a great rider so all chalion has heard my lady lisss eyes brightened from valenda to taryoon in one night and dodging enemy troops the whileive never had such an adventure nor won such a prize at the end of it let us hope the wings of war will not brush valenda so close again where do you go next liss shrugged who knows ill ride back to my station to await the next pouch my dispatcher hands to me and go where it takes me swiftly if ser dy ferrej writes some reply or slowly to spare my horse if he does not he will not write tonight ista scarcely wanted to let her go but the girl looked disheveled and dirty from the road surely she would wish to wash and take refreshment attend on me again liss of labra the castle takes dinner in an hour or so wait upon me there and dine at my table the girls dark brows rose in brief surprise she bowcurtseyed again at your command royina the old provincaras high table was set exactly as it had been a thousandten thousandtimes before on days when no festival brought relief from the monotony granted it was comfortable in the small dining chamber of the newest building within the castle walls with fireplace and glazed windows the same small company too lady dy hueltar who was istas mothers aging relative and longtime companion ista her principal lady attendants solemn dy ferrej by tacit agreement the old provincaras chair still stood empty ista had not moved to claim the central seat and perhaps in some misplaced notion of her grief none had urged her to dy ferrej arrived escorting ferda and foix both looking very courtly and young the courier girl entered in their wake and made polite bows she had faced royina ista bravely enough alone but the atmosphere of staid age here was enough to melt the sinews of strong soldiers she took her seat stiffly and sat as if trying to make herself smaller though she eyed the two brothers with interest the aroma of horses was much fainter now although lady dy hueltar wrinkled her nose but one more place settingnot the old provincarasstill stood empty across from ista do we expect a guest ista inquired of dy ferrej one of the elderly peoples elderly friends perhaps ista dared not hope for anything more exotic dy ferrej cleared his throat and nodded at old lady dy hueltar her seamed face smiled i asked the temple of valenda to send us a suitable divine to be your spiritual conductor upon your pilgrimage royina if we are not to send to cardegoss for a courttrained scholar i thought we might request learned tovia of the mothers order she may be a lesser theologian but she is a most excellent physician and knows you of old such a relief to have someone familiar should we be taken with any female complaints upon the road or or if your old troubles should flare up and none could possibly be more proper to your sex and status a relief to whom divine tovia had been a bosom friend to the old provincara and to lady dy hueltar ista could quite imagine the trio enjoying a gentle jaunt in the spring sunshine together five gods had lady dy hueltar assumed she would be going along also ista suppressed an unworthy desire to scream just like liss in fear of being cocooned in her endless skeins of wool i knew you would be pleased lady dy hueltar murmured on i thought you might wish to begin discussing your holy itinerary with her over dinner she frowned its not like her to be late her frown vanished as a servant entered and said the divine is here my lady oh good show her in at once the servant opened his mouth as if to speak but then bowed and retreated the door swung wide again a puffing figure of totally unexpected familiarity entered and stopped stranded upon a wall of stares it was the fat young divine of the bastard that ista had met upon the road those two weeks or so ago his white robes were only somewhat cleaner now being free of loose detritus but mottled with permanent faint stains about the hem and front his beginning smile grew uncertain good evening gentle ladies and my lords i was told to attend here upon a certain lady dy hueltar something about a divine being wanted for a pilgrimage lady dy hueltar recovered her voice i am she but i had understood the temple was sending the mothers physician divine tovia who are you that had almost come out who are you ista felt but for lady dy hueltars grip on good address oh he bobbed a bow learned chivar dy cabon at your service he claimed a name of some rank at least he eyed ista and ser dy ferrej the recognition ista thought ran two ways as did the surprise where is learned tovia asked lady dy hueltar blankly i believe she has ridden out upon a medical call of some special difficulty at some distance from valenda his smile grew less certain still welcome learned dy cabon said ista pointedly dy ferrej woke to his duties indeed im the castle warder dy ferrej this is the dowager royina ista dy cabons eyes narrowed and he stared sharply at ista are you now he breathed dy ferrej ignoring or not hearing this introduced the dy gura brothers and the other ladies in order of rank and lastly and a bit reluctantly liss a chancellery courier dy cabon bowed to all with indiscriminate good cheer this is all wrongthere must be some mistake learned dy cabon lady dy hueltar went on with a beseeching sideways glance at ista it is the dowager royina herself who proposes to undertake a pilgrimage this season in petition of the gods for a grandson you are notthis is notwe do not knowis a divine of the bastards order and a man at that quite the most appropriate um person um she trailed off in mute appeal for someone anyone to extract her from this quagmire somewhere inside ista was beginning to smile she said smoothly mistake or no i feel certain that our dinner is ready to be served will you please grace our table this evening with your scholarship learned and lead us in the meals invocation to the gods he brightened vastly i should be most honored royina smiling and blinking he seated himself in the chair ista indicated and looked hopeful as the servant passed among them with the basin of lavenderscented water for washing hands he blessed the impending meal in unexceptionable terms and a good voice whatever he was he was no country rustic he tucked into the courses presented with an enthusiasm that would have warmed the provincaras cooks heart could he have witnessed it discouraged as he was by his long thrall to elderly indifferent appetites foix kept pace with him with no apparent effort are you of those cabons related to the present holy general dy yarrin of the daughters order lady dy hueltar inquired politely i believe i am some sort of third or fourth cousin to him lady the divine replied after swallowing his bite my father was ser odlin dy cabon both dy gura brothers stirred with interest oh said ista in surprise i believe i met him years ago at court in cardegoss our fat cabon as he was jovially dubbed by the roya but hed died as bravely as any thinner gentleman of the royas service at the disastrous battle of dalus she added after a moment you have the look of him the divine ducked his head in apparent pleasure i am not sorry for it some impulse of mischief prompted ista to ask because it was certain no one else present would and are you also a son of lady dy cabon the divines eye glinted in response over a forkful of roast alas no but my father took some joy in me nonetheless and settled a dower upon me at the temple when i came of the age for schooling for which ieventuallycame to thank him very much my calling did not come upon me as a lightning bolt to be sure but slowly as a tree grows dy cabons round face and divines robes made him look older than he was ista decided he could not be above thirty perhaps much less for the first time in a long while the conversation turned not on various peoples illnesses aches pains and digestive failures but widened to the whole of chalionibra the dy gura brothers had considerable witness to report of last years successful campaign by the marshal dy palliar to retake the mountain fortress of gotorget commanding the border of the hostile roknari princedoms to the north and young royseconsort bergons seasoning attendance there upon the field of battle ferda said foix here took a bad knock from a roknari war hammer during the final assault on the fortress and was much abed this wintera mess of broken ribs with inflammation of the lungs to follow chancellor dy cazaril took him up as a clerk while his bones finished knitting our cousin dy palliar thought a little light riding would help him regain his condition a faint blush colored foixs broad face and he ducked his head lisss gaze at him sharpened a trifle though whether imagining him with sword or with pen in hand ista could not tell lady dy hueltar did not fail to register her usual criticism of royina iselle for riding to the north to be near her husband and these stirring events even thoughor perhaps that was becauseshe had been brought safely to bed of a girl thereafter i do not think said ista dryly that iselle staying slugabed in cardegoss would have resulted in a boy however lady dy hueltar mumbled something ista was reminded of her own mothers sharp critique when she had borne iselle to ias those long years ago as if anything she might have done would have made it come out any differently as if when it had come out differently in her second confinement it was any better her brow wrinkled in old pain she looked up to intersect dy cabons sharp glance the divine swiftly turned the subject to lighter matters dy ferrej had the pleasure of trotting out an old tale or two for a new audience which ista could not begrudge him dy cabon told a warm joke albeit milder than many ista had heard over the royas table the courier girl laughed aloud caught a frown from lady dy hueltar and held a hand over her mouth please dont stop said ista to her no one has laughed like that in this household for weeks months years what might her pilgrimage be like if instead of dragging a lot of tired guardians out on a road that suited their old bones so ill she could travel with people who laughed young people not brought low by old sin and loss people who bounced people to whom dare she think it she was an elder to be respected and not a failed child to be corrected at your command royina not now lady ista you know you cant she said abruptly learned dy cabon i thank the temple for taking thought for me and i shall be pleased to have your spiritual guidance upon my journey you honor me royina dy cabon sitting bowed as deeply as he could over his belly when do we leave tomorrow said ista a chorus of objection rose around the table lists of persons and support not assembled ladiesinwaiting their maids their grooms of clothing gear of transport animals of dy baocias small army not yet arrived she almost added weakly or as soon as all can be arranged but then stiffened her resolve her eye fell on liss chewing and listening with detached fascination you are all correct ista raised her voice to override the babble which died in relief she went on i do not have youth or energy or courage or knowledge of how to make my way upon the road so i shall commandeer some i shall take the courier liss to be my ladyinwaiting and my groom in one and none more that shall save three dozen mules right there liss nearly spat out the bite she was chewing but shes only a courier gasped lady dy hueltar i assure you chancellor dy cazaril will not begrudge her to me couriers hold themselves ready to ride wherever they are ordered what say you liss liss eyes wide finished gulping and managed i think id make a better groom than waiting lady royina but i will try my best for you good none could ask more you are the dowager royina dy ferrej almost wailed you cannot go out on the roads with so little ceremony i plan a pilgrimage in humility dy ferrej not a march in pride still suppose i were not a royina suppose i were some simple widow of good family what servants what reasonable precautions would i take then travel incognito learned dy cabon caught the idea instantly while the rest were still gobbling in misdirected resistance that would certainly remove many distractions from your spiritual study royina i suppose such a woman would simply ask the temple to provide her with escort in the usual way and they would fill the request from the riders available fine that has been done for me already ferda can your men ride tomorrow the cacophony of protest was overridden by dy guras simple certainly as you command royina the shocked silence that followed was decidedly baffled and even possibly a little thoughtful if that was not too much to hope ista sat back a smile turning her lips i must take thought for a name she said at length neither dy chalion nor dy baocia will do unsimple as they are dy hueltar ista shuddered no she ran down a mental list of other minor relatives of the provincars of baocia dy ajelo would do the ajelo family had scarcely crossed her view and never once provided a ladyinwaiting to assist in istas keeping she bore them no ill will i shall still be ista i think its not so uncommon a name as to be remarked the divine cleared his throat we need to confer a little tonight then i do not know what route you desire of me a pilgrimage should have both a spiritual plan and in necessary support of it a material one and hers had neither and if she did not assert one one would surely be foisted upon her she said cautiously how have you led the pious before learned well that depends much upon the purposes of the pious i have some maps in my saddlebags that might supply some inspiration ill fetch them if you like ferda offered yes said the divine gratefully that would be most helpful ferda hurried out of the chamber outside the day drew toward sunset and the servants moved quietly about the room lighting the wall sconces foix leaned his elbows comfortably on the table smiled amiably at liss and found room for another slice of honeynut cake while they waited for his brothers return ferda strode back into the dining chamber in a very few minutes his hands full of folded papers here no here is baocia and the provinces to the west as far as ibra he spread a stained and travel worn paper out on the table between the divine and ista dy ferrej peered anxiously over dy cabons shoulder the divine frowned at the map for a few minutes then cleared his throat and looked across at ista we are taught that the route of a pilgrimage should serve its spiritual goal which may be simple or manifold but which will partake of at least one of five aims service supplication gratitude divination and atonement atonement apology to the gods dy lutez she could not help thinking the chill memory of that dark hour still clouded her heart on this bright evening yet who owed whom the apology for that disaster we were all in it together the gods and dy lutez and ias and i and if abasing herself on the altar of the gods was the cure for that old wound she had eaten dirt enough already for a dozen dy lutezes yet the scar still bled in the deep dark if pressed i once saw a man pray for mules foix remarked agreeably dy cabon blinked after a moment he asked did he get any yes excellent ones the gods ways are mysterious sometimes murmured dy cabon apparently digesting this ahem yoursroyinais a pilgrimage of supplication for a grandson as i understand it is it not he paused invitingly it is not but dy ferrej and lady dy hueltar both made noises of assent and ista let it pass dy cabon ran his finger over the intricately drawn chart thick with place names seamed with little rivers and decorated with rather more trees than actually stood on baocias high plains he pointed out this or that shrine devoted to the mother or the father within striking distance of valenda describing the merits of each ista forced herself to look at the map to the far south beyond the maps margins lay cardegoss and the great castle and fortress of the zangre of evil memory no to the east lay taryoon no west and north then she trailed her finger across the map toward the spine of the bastards teeth the high range that marked the long northsouth border of ibra so recently united with chalion in her daughters marriage bed north along the mountains edge some easy road this way dy cabons brow wrinkled as he squinted at the map im not just sure what about a days ride west of palma is a town where the daughters order has a modest hostel rather pleasant remarked ferda weve stayed there before dy cabon licked his lips hm i know of an inn near palma that we might reach before nightfall if we do not tarry on the road it has a most excellent table oh and a sacred well very old a minor holy place but as sera ista dy ajelo desires a pilgrimage in humility perhaps a small start will serve her best and the great shrines tend to be crowded this time of year then by all means learned let us avoid the crowds and seek humility and pray at this well or table as the case may be istas lips twitched i see no need to weigh out prayer by the grain as though it were dubious coin replied dy cabon cheerily encouraged by her fleeting smile let us do both and return abundance for abundance the divines thick fingers made calipers of themselves and stepped from valenda to palma to the spot ferda had tapped he hesitated then his hand turned once more a days ride from there if we arise early enough is casilchas sleepy little place but my order has a school there some of my old teachers are still there and it has a fine library considering the small size of the place for many teaching divines who have died have left it their books i grant a seminary of the bastard is not exactly exactly apropos to the purpose of this pilgrimage but i confess i should like to consult the library ista wondered a little dryly if the school also had a particularly fine cook she rested her chin upon her hand and studied the fat young man across from her whatever had possessed the temple of valenda to send him up to her anyway his halfaristocratic ancestry hardly yet experienced pilgrimage conductors usually had their charges spiritual battle plans all drawn out in advance there were doubtless books of devotional instruction on the topic perhaps that was what dy cabon wanted from the library a manual that would tell him how to go on perhaps he had slept through a few too many of those holy lectures in casilchas good said ista the daughters hospitality for the next two nights the bastards thereafter that would put her at least three full days ride from valenda a good start dy cabon looked extremely relieved excellent royina foix was mulling over the maps hed pulled out one of all chalion necessarily less detailed than the one dy cabon studied his finger traced the route from cardegoss north to gotorget the fortress guarded the end of a chain of rough if not especially high mountains that ran partway along the border between chalion and the roknari princedom of borasnen foixs brows knotted ista wondered what memories of pain the name of that fortress evoked in him youll want to avoid that region i think said dy ferrej watching foixs hand pause at gotorget indeed my lord i believe we should steer clear of all northcentral chalion it is still very unsettled from last years campaign and royina iselle and royse bergon are already starting to assemble forces there for the fall dy ferrejs brows climbed with interest do they think to strike for visping already foix shrugged letting his finger slide up to the north coast and the port city named im not sure if visping can be taken in a single campaign but it were good if it could cut the five princedoms in two gain a seaport for chalion that the ibran fleet might find refuge in dy cabon leaned over the table his belly pressing its edge and peered the princedom of jokona to the west would be next after borasnen then or would we strike toward brajar or both at once two fronts would be foolish and brajar is an uncertain ally jokonas new prince is young and untried first pinch jokona between chalion and ibrapinch it off then turn to the northeast foixs eyes narrowed and his pleasant mouth firmed contemplating this strategy will you join the campaign in the fall foix ista asked politely he nodded where the marshal dy palliar goes the dy gura brothers will surely follow as a master of horse ferda will likely be pressed into assembling cavalry mounts by midsummer and lest i miss him and start to pine hell find some hot dirty job for me never any lack of those ferda snickered foixs returning grin at his brother seemed entirely without resentment ista thought foixs analysis sound and had no doubt how hed come by it marshal dy palliar and royse bergon and royina iselle were none of them fools and chancellor dy cazaril had a deep wit indeed and not much love for the roknari coastal lords who had once sold him to slavery on the galleys visping was a prize worth playing for we shall steer west and away from the excitement then she said dy ferrej nodded approval very good royina said dy cabon his sigh was only a little wistful as he refolded ferdas maps and handed them back did he fear his fathers martial fate or envy it there was no telling the party broke off shortly thereafter the planning and complicated itinerarylisting and complaints from istas women went on and on they would never stop arguing ista decided but she could she would you cant solve problems by running away from them it was said and like the good child she had once been she had believed this but it wasnt true some problems could only be solved by running away from them when her lamenting ladies at last blew out the candles and left her to her rest her smile crept back chapter three ista spent the early morning sorting through her wardrobe with liss searching for clothing fit for the road and not merely a royina much that was old lingered in istas cupboards and chests but little that was plain any ornate or delicate gown that made liss wrinkle her nose in doubt went instantly into the discard pile ista did manage to assemble a riding costume of leggings split skirt tunic and vestcloak that showed not a scrap of mothers green finally they ruthlessly raided the wardrobes of istas ladies and maids to the latters scandal this resulted at the last in a neat pile of garmentspractical plain washable and above all few liss was clearly happier to be sent off to the stables to select the most suitable riding horse and baggage mule one baggage mule by midday istas feverish singlemindedness resulted in both women dressed for the road the horses saddled and the mule packed the dy gura brothers found them standing in the cobbled courtyard when they rode through the castle gate heading ten mounted men in the garb of the daughters order dy cabon following on his white mule the grooms held the royinas horse and ushered her to the mounting block liss leapt up lightly on her tall bay with no such assistance in the spring of her life ista had ridden much hunted all day and danced till the moon went down at the royas glittering court when shed first come there she too had been too long abed in this castle of age and grievous memory a little light duty to regain condition was just what was wanted learned dy cabon clambered from his mule long enough to stand up on the mounting block and intone a mercifully brief prayer and blessing upon the enterprise ista bowed her head but did not mouth the responses i want nothing of the gods ive had their gifts before fourteen people and eighteen animals just to get her on the road what about those pilgrims who somehow managed this with no more than a staff and a sack lady dy hueltar and all of istas ladies and maids trooped down to the courtyard not to wish her farewell it transpired but to weep pointedly at her in one last decidedly counterproductive bid to make her change her mind in the teeth of all evidence to the contrary lady dy hueltar wailed oh shes not seriousstop her for the mothers sake dy ferrej gritting her teeth ista let their cries bounce off her back like arrows glancing from chain mail dy cabons white mule led out the archway and down the road at a gentle amble but even so the voices fell behind at last the soft spring wind stirred istas hair she did not look back they reached the inn at palma by sunset barely it had been a very long time ista reflected as she was helped down from her horse since she had spent a whole day in the saddle hunting or traveling liss plainly bored with the pilgrimages placid pace jumped down off her animal as though shed spent the afternoon lounging on a couch foix had apparently worked through whatever stiffness lingered from his injuries earlier in the brothers journey even dy cabon didnt waddle as though he hurt when the divine offered her his arm ista took it gratefully dy cabon had sent one of the men riding ahead to bespeak beds and a meal for the party fortunately as it turned out for the inn was small another party of tinkers was being turned away as they arrived the place had once been a narrow fortified farmhouse now made more sprawling with an added wing the dy gura brothers and the divine were given one chamber to share ista and liss another and the rest of the guardsmen were assigned pallets in the stable loft although the mild night made this no discomfort the innkeeper and his wife had set up two tables near the sacred spring in a little grove behind the building and hung lanterns lavishly in the trees the thick moss and ferns the bluebells and the bloodroots with their starry white blooms the interlaced boughs and the gentle gurgle of the water running over the smooth stones made a more lovely dining chamber ista thought than she had sat in for many a year they all washed their hands in spring water brought in a copper basin and blessed by the divine and needing no other perfume the innkeepers wife was famous for her larderkeeping a pair of servants kept busy lugging out heavy trays and jugs good bread and cheese roast ducks mutton sausages dried fruit new herbs and spring greens eggs dark olives and olive oil from the north apple nut tarts new ale and cidersimple fare but very wholesome dy cabon made flattering inroads upon these offerings and even istas appetite numbed for months bestirred itself when she finally undressed and lay down beside liss in the clean little bed in the chamber under the eaves she fell asleep so quickly she barely remembered it next morning rising again as the early light fell through the halfopen casement window proved briefly awkward through sheer ingrained habit ista stood still for a time and waited to be dressed like a doll till she realized her new maidservant would require instruction at that point it became easier to sort out and draw on her garments herself though she did ask for help with some of the fastenings they snagged for a moment upon the problem of istas hair i dont know how to dress ladies hair liss confessed when ista handed her the brush and sat on a low bench she stared doubtfully at istas thick dun mane hanging to her waist ista had perhaps illadvisedly picked out her former attendants careful tight elaborate braiding before bed the hairs own curl had reasserted itself during the night and it was now beginning to snarl and perhaps growl and snap you do your own presumably what do you do with it well i put it in a braid what else i put it in two braids ista thought a moment do you do the horses oh yes my lady snail braids and dressed with ribbons and fringe knots with beads for the mothers day and for the sons day the fountain knots along the crest with feathers worked in and for today put it in one braid liss breathed relief yes my lady her hands were quick and clever much quicker than istas former attendants the results well they suited modest sera dy ajelo becomingly enough the whole party met in the grove for dawn prayers for this the first full day of istas pilgrimage dawn by courtesy anywaythe sun had been up for some hours before the inns guests the innkeeper his wife and all their children and the servants were also turned out for the ceremony as the visit of a divine of notable scholarship was evidently a rare event besides which ista thought more cynically there was the possibility that were he flatteringly enough received the divine might recommend other pilgrims to this decidedly minor holy attraction as this wellspring was sacred to the daughter dy cabon stood on the bank of the rivulet in the sundappled shade and commenced with a short springtime prayer from a small book of occasional devotions he carried in his saddlebag exactly why this well was sacred to the lady of spring was a little unclear ista found the innkeepers assertion that it was the true secret location of the miracle of the virgin and the water jar a trifle unconvincing as she knew of at least three other sites in chalion alone that claimed that legend but the beauty of the place was surely excuse enough for its holy reputation dy cabon his stained robes seeming almost white in this pure light pocketed his book and cleared his throat for the morning lesson since the tables behind them stood set and waiting for breakfast to be served when prayers were done ista was confident that the sermon would be succinct as this is the beginning of a spiritual journey i shall go back to the tale of beginnings we all learned in our childhoods the divine closed his eyes briefly as if marshaling memory here is the story as ordol writes it in his letters to the young royse dy brajar his eyes opened again and his voice took up a storytellers rhythm the world was first and the world was flame fluid and fearsome as the flame cooled matter formed and gained vast strength and endurance a great globe with fire at its heart from the fire at the heart of the world slowly grew the worldsoul but the eye cannot see itself not even the eye of the worldsoul so the worldsoul split in two that it might so perceive itself and so the father and the mother came into being and with that sweet perception for the first time love became possible in the heart of the worldsoul love was the first of the fruits that the realm of the spirit gifted back to the realm of matter that was its fountain and foundation but not the last for song was next then speech dy cabon speaking grinned briefly and drew another long breath and the father and the mother between them began to order the world that existence might not be instantly consumed again by fire and chaos and roiling destruction in their first love for each other they bore the daughter and the son and divided the seasons of the world among them each with its special and particular beauty each to its own lordship and stewardship and in the harmony and security of this new composition the matter of the world grew in boldness and complexity and from its strivings to create beauty plants and animals and men arose for love had come into the fiery heart of the world and matter sought to return gifts of spirit to the realm of spirit as lovers exchange tokens satisfaction flickered across dy cabons suety features and he swayed a trifle with his cadences as he became absorbed by his tale ista suspected they were getting to his favorite part but the fire at the heart of the world also held forces of destruction that could not be denied and from this chaos rose the demons who broke out and invaded the world and preyed upon the fragile new souls growing there as a mountain wolf preys upon the lambs of the valleys it was the season of great sorcerers the order of the world was disrupted and winter and spring and summer and fall upended one into another drought and flood ice and fires threatened the lives of men and of all the marvelous plants and artful creatures that matter infected by love had offered on the altar of the worldsoul then one day a powerful demon lord wise and wicked by the consumption of many souls of men came upon a man living alone in a tiny hermitage in a wood like a cat who thinks to toy with her prey he accepted the beggars hospitality and waited his chance to leap from the wornout body he presently possessed to the fresh new one for the man though clad in rags was beautiful his glance was like a sword thrust and his breath perfume but the demon lord was confounded when he accepted a little earthen bowl of wine and drank it in one gulp and prepared to pounce for the saint had divided his own soul and poured it out into the wine and given it to the demon of his own free will and so for the first time a demon gained a soul and all the beautiful and bitter gifts of a soul the demon lord fell to the floor of the woodland cell and howled with all the astonished woe of a child being born for he was born in that moment into the world of both matter and spirit and taking the hermits body that was his free gift and not stolen nor begrudged he fled through the woods in terror back to his terrible sorcerers palace and hid for many months he cowered there trapped in the horror of his self but slowly the greatsouled saint began to teach him the beauties of virtue the saint was a devotee of the mother and called down her grace to heal the demon of his sin for with the gift of free will had come the possibility of sin and the burning shame of it which tormented the demon as nothing had ever done before and between the lash of his sin and the lessons of the saint the demons soul began to grow in probity and power as a great sorcererpaladin with the mothers favor fluttering upon his mailed sleeve he began to move in the world of matter and fight the baleful soulless demons on the gods behalf in the places where they could not reach the greatsouled demon became the mothers champion and captain and she loved him without limit for his souls incandescent splendor and so began the great battle to clear the world of demons run rampant and restore the order of the seasons the other demons feared him and attempted to combine against him but could not for such cooperation was beyond their nature still their onslaught was terrible and the greatsouled demon beloved of the mother was slain on the final battlefield and so was born the last god the bastard love child of the goddess and the greatsouled demon some say he was born on the eve of the last battle fruit of a union upon her great couch some say the grieving mother gathered up the greatsouled demons shattered dear remains from the stricken field and mixed them with her blood and so made the bastard by her great art however so their son of all the gods was given agency over both spirit and matter for he inherited as servants the demons that his fathers great sacrifice had conquered and enslaved and so swept out of the world what is certainly a lie dy cabon continued in a suddenly more prosaic not to mention irate tone of voice is the quadrene heresy that the greatsouled demon took the mother by force and so engendered the bastard upon her against her great will a scurrilous and senseless and blasphemous lie ista wasnt sure if he was still paraphrasing ordol or if that was his own gloss he cleared his throat and finished more formally here ends the tale and tally of the advent of the five gods ista had heard various versions of the tally of the gods what seemed several hundred times since childhood but she had to admit dy cabons delivery of the old story had the eloquence and sincerity to make it seem almost new again granted most versions did not give the complex story of the bastard more space than the rest of the holy family put together but people had to be allowed their favorites despite herself she was moved dy cabon returned to ritual and called down the fivefold benison asking of each god the proper gifts leading the respondents in praise in return of the daughter growth and learning and love of the mother children health and healing of the son good comradeship hunting and harvest of the father children justice and an easy death in its due time and the bastard grant usdy cabons voice fallen into the soothing singsong of ceremony stumbled for the first time slowing in our direst need the smallest gifts the nail of the horseshoe the pin of the axle the feather at the pivot point the pebble at the mountains peak the kiss in despair the one right word in darkness understanding he blinked looking startled istas chin snapped up for an instant her spine seemed to freeze no no there is nothing here nothing here nothing here nothing do you hear me she forced her breath out slowly it was not the usual wording most prayers asked to be spared the fifth gods attention the master of all disasters out of season as he was the divine hastily signed himself touching forehead lip navel groin and heart hand spread wide upon his chest above his broad paunch and signed again in the air to call down blessing upon all assembled there the company released stirred and stretched some breaking into lowvoiced talk some strolling away to their days tasks dy cabon came toward ista rubbing his hands and smiling anxiously thank you learned ista said for that good beginning he bowed in relief at her approval my very great pleasure my lady he brightened still further as the inns servants hurried to bring out what promised to be a very hearty breakfast ista a little shamed by the excellence of his effort to have purloined the divine with false pretenses of a sham pilgrimage was heartened by the reflection that dy cabon was clearly enjoying his work the country west of palma was flat and barren with only a few trees clustering in the watercourses that broke up the long dull vistas grazing not crop farming was the main work of the thinly scattered old fortified farmsteads along the seldomused road boys and dogs tended sheep and cattle all dozing together in the distant patches of shade the warming afternoon seemed to hold a long silence that invited sleep not traveling but given their late start istas party pushed on through the soft and somnolent air when the road widened for a time ista found herself riding with dy cabons fine sturdy mule on one side and lisss rangy bay on the other as an antidote to dy cabons infectious yawns ista inquired of him tell me learned whatever happened to that little demon you were carrying when first we met liss whod been riding along with her feet out of the stirrups and her reins slack turned her head to listen oh all went well i gave it up to the archdivine of taryoon and we oversaw its disposition it is safely out of the world now i was actually returning to my home from there when i spent the night in valenda and well a jerk of his head at the string of riders trailing them indicated his unexpected new duty with the royina a demon you had a demon said liss in a tone of wonder not i corrected the divine fastidiously it was trapped in a ferret fortunately not a difficult animal to control compared to a wolf or a bull he grimaced or a man seeking to plunder the demons powers her face screwed up how do you send a demon out of the world dy cabon sighed give it to someone whos going she frowned at her horses ears for a moment then gave up the riddle what if the demon is not grown too strong the simplest way to return it to the gods is to give it into the keeping of a soul who is going to the gods who is dying he added to her blank look oh she said another pause so you slew the ferret it is alas not quite so easy as that a free demon whose mount is dying simply jumps to another you see an elemental escaped into the world of matter cannot exist without a being of matter to lend it intelligence and strength for by its nature it cannot create such order for itself it can only steal in the beginning it is mindless formless as innocently destructive as a wild animal at least until it learns more complicated sins from men it is constrained in turn by the power of the creature or person upon whom it battens a dislodged demon will always seek to leap to the strongest soul in its vicinity creature to larger creature animal to man man to greater man for it becomes what it eats in a sense dy cabon drew breath and seemed to look into some well of memory but when a divine of long experience is finally dying in his or her orders house the demon can be forced to jump to them if the demon is weak enough and the divine strong of heart and mind even in the last extremity well the matter solves itself he cleared his throat persons greatsouled and grown detached from the world and longing for their god for a demon can tempt a weaker person to sorcery with promises to extend life rare strength said ista after a moment had he just come from such an extraordinary deathbed scene it seemed so she did not wonder at his air of daunted humility dy cabon gave a wry shrug of acknowledgment yes i dont know if i will ever fortunately stray demons are rare except that except what liss prodded when no more of this rarified theological discourse seemed to be forthcoming dy cabons lips twisted the archdivine was most disturbed mine was the third such fugitive that has been captured this year in baocia alone how many do you usually catch asked liss not one a year in all of chalion or so it has been for many years the last great outbreak was in roya fonsas day iass father iselles grandfather dead these fifty years ista considered dy cabons words what if the demon is not weak enough dy cabon said ah indeed he was silent for a moment staring at his mules limp ears hanging out to either side of its head like oars that is why my order gives much thought and effort to removing them when they are still small the road narrowed then curving down to a small stone bridge over a greenish stream and dy cabon gave ista a polite salute and pushed his mule ahead chapter four the next days riding began early and ran long but slowly the barrens of baocia fell away behind them the country grew more rolling better watered and better wooded running up toward the mountains just visible on the western horizon it was still a bony land at heart the town wall of casilchas hugged a rocky outcrop above a stream running clear and chill with spring runoff from the distant heights gray and ochre stone rough or dressed formed both walls and buildings here and there enlivened with plaster dyed pink or pale green or with painted wooden doors or shutters rich red or blue or green in the angled light of the latespring afternoon one might drink this light like wine and grow intoxicated on color ista thought as their horses clopped down the narrow streets the towns temple fronted a small plaza paved with irregular slabs of granite fitted together like a puzzle opposite it in what had the look of some local aristocrats old mansion bequeathed to the order istas party found the bastards seminary a smaller hatch in the ironbound slabplanked double doors opened at dy cabons pounding and the porter came out he met the divines first greetings with discouraging headshaking dy cabon disappeared inside for a few minutes then both doors swung wide and grooms and dedicats scurried to assist the party with horses and baggage istas horse was led within three stories of ornate wooden balconies rose above a cobbled courtyard a whitegowned acolyte hurried up with a mounting block a senior divine bowed and offered humble welcome it was sera dy ajelos name he spoke but ista had no illusions it was ista dy chalion to whom he scraped dy cabon might have been less discreet than she wished but there was no doubt it won them better rooms eager servants and the best care for their tired mounts wash water was brought almost on their heels to the room where ista and liss were guided no rooms at the seminary were large ista suspected but theirs had space for a bed a truckle bed and a table and chairs with a balcony overlooking the town wall and the stream behind this main building meals for both women were brought soon thereafter on trays with hastily arranged pots of blue and white flowers for the season as well after supper ista took her handmaiden with ferda and foix for escort and strolled around the town in the fading light the two officerdedicats made a handsome pair in their blue tunics and gray cloaks swords carried with circumspection not swagger and not a few casilchas maidensand matronsheads turned as they passed lisss stride and height nearly matched that of the dy gura brothers a display of youth and health to make silks and jewels look like tawdry toys ista felt herself as splendidly attended as ever she had been at the royas court the temple was of the standard plan if of small scale four domed lobes one for each member of the holy family around an open court where the holy fire burned on its central hearth with the bastards tower freestanding behind his mothers court the walls were built of the native gray stone though the roof arches were finely carved wood with a small riot of brightly painted demons saints holy animals and plants appropriate to each god cavorting along the beams for lack of any better entertainment they all attended the evening services there ista was weary of the gods but she had to admit the singing was a pleasure the seminary contributed a whiterobed and enthusiastic choir the pious effect was only slightly spoiled by the choir leader peeking periodically at ista for her reaction ista sighed inwardly and made sure to smile and nod to assuage the womans anxiety three days of riding had tired both people and animals tomorrow both would rest here a little elusive ease seemed to have crept in to istas spiritwhether its source was sunlight exercise cheerful young company or distance from valenda she hardly knew but she was grateful for it she slid her body under the feather quilt finding the narrow bed more luxurious than many more ornate but less comfortable ones in royal castles and fell asleep before liss stopped rolling over in her truckle ista dreamed and knew she was dreaming she crossed a paved castle courtyard in a latespring or earlysummer noon a stonearched walk ran around the courts edge the fine alabaster pillars carved with a tracery of vines and flowers in the roknari style the sun shone down high and hot the shadows were black accent marks at her feet she climbedno floatedup the stone stairs at the end leading up over the arched walk to a wooden gallery and along it at the far end a room she passed softly into it without opening the carved door which seemed to part and close around her skin like water the room was dim and cool but a grid of light fell through the shutters onto the woven rugs making the muted colors briefly blaze in the room a bed on the bed a form ista drifted closer like a ghost the form was a man asleep or dead but very pale and still his long lean body was dressed in an undyed linen robe folded across his chest and bound at the waist with a linen belt on his left breast a patch of dark red blood seeped through the cloth despite the wiry length of his frame the bones of his face were almost delicate brow wide jaw fine chin somewhat pointed his skin was unmarred by scar or blemish but faint lines pressed across the forehead framed the lips fanned from the eyes his dark straight hair was brushed back from his forehead the hairline high receding it flowed down over the pillow to his shoulders like a river of night rippling with tiny gleams of moonlight from the silver threads his brows were arched winging nose straight lips parted istas ghostly hands unbound the belt folded back the linen robe the hair trailing down his chest was sparse until it thickened at his crotch the bird that nested there was fine and fair and ista smiled but the wound beneath his left breast gaped like a small dark mouth as she watched blood began to well from it she pressed her hands over the dark slit to staunch the flow but the red liquid oozed up between her white fingers a sudden flood washing across his chest spreading in a scarlet tide across the sheets his eyes flew open he saw her and he gasped ista woke shot up pressed her knuckles to her mouth to stifle her cry she expected to taste blood hot and sticky and was almost shocked not to her body was drenched in sweat her heart was hammering and she was panting as though she had been running the room was dark and cool but moonlight filtered through the shutter slats on her truckle liss muttered and turned over it had been one of those dreams the real ones there was no mistaking them ista clutched her hair opened her mouth in a rictus screamed silently breathed curse you whichever one of you this is curse you one and five get out of my head get out of my head liss made a little cat sound and mumbled sleepily lady you all right she sat up on her elbow blinking ista swallowed for control and cleared her tight throat just an odd dream go back to sleep liss liss grunted agreeably and rolled back over ista lay back clutching her feather coverlet to her despite her sweatdampened body was it starting again no no i wont have it she gasped and gulped and barely kept from breaking into sobs in a few minutes her breathing steadied who had that man been it was no one she had ever seen in her life she was certain she would know him instantly if she ever saw him again though the fine shape of his face felt burned into her mind like a brand and and the rest of him was he enemy friend warning chalionese ibran roknari highborn or low what did the sinister red tide of blood mean no good thing of that she was quite certain whatever you want from me i cant do it ive proved that before go away go away she lay trembling for a long time the moonlight had turned to gray predawn mist before she fell asleep again ista was awakened not by liss slipping out but by liss slipping back in she was embarrassed to discover her handmaiden had let her sleep through morning prayers rudeness both as a pilgrim however false and as a real guest you looked so tired liss excused herself when ista chided her you did not seem to sleep well last night indeed ista had to admit she was glad for the extra rest a breakfast was brought to her on a tray by a bowing acolyte also not usual for a pilgrim so laggard as to miss the mornings start after dressing and having her hair done up in a slightly more elaborate braid than usualnot looking too much like a horse she hopedshe walked with liss about the old mansion they fetched up in the nowsunny court sitting on a bench by the wall they watched the denizens of the school hurry past on their tasks students and teachers and servants another thing ista liked about liss she decided was that the girl didnt chatter she conversed pleasantly enough when spoken to the remainder of the time she fell without resentment into a restful silence ista felt a cool breath on her neck from the wall she leaned against one of this places ghosts it wove around her like a cat seeking a lap and she almost raised her hand to shoo it away but then the impression faded some sad spirit not taken up by the gods or refusing them or lost somehow new ghosts kept the form theyd had in life for a while often violent harsh outraged but in time they all came to this faded shapeless slow oblivion for such an old building the ghosts here seemed few and tranquil fortresseslike the zangrewere usually the worst ista was resigned to her lingering sensitivity as long as no such wasted souls took form before her inner eye seeing such a spirit would mean some god breathed too near that her second sight was leaking backand all that went with it ista considered the courtyard in her dream it was no place shed ever been before of that she was sure she was equally convinced it was a real place to avoid it to certainly avoid it all she had to do was crawl back to the castle at valenda and stay there till her body rotted around her no i will not go back the thought made her restless and she rose and prowled the school liss dutifully at her heels many acolytes or divines passing her on the balcony walks or in the corridors bowed and smiled by which she concluded dy cabons indiscretion had now been widely shared pretending to be sera dy ajelo was well enough having half a hundred total strangers assiduously pretend along with her felt oddly irritating they looked into a succession of small rooms crammed with books packed in shelves and piled on tables dy cabons desired library to istas surprise foix dy gura was curled up in a window seat with his nose in a volume he looked up blinked rose and made a little courtesy lady liss i did not know you read theology foix oh i read anything but its not all theology there are hundreds of other things some very odd they never throw anything away here theres a whole locked room where they keep the books on sorcery and demons and um the lewd books chained ista raised her brows that they may not be opened foixs grin flashed that they may not be carried off i think he held out the book in his hand there are more verse romances like this i could find you one liss staring around in wonder at what might have been more books in one place than shed ever seen in her life looked hopeful ista shook her head later perhaps dy cabon poked his head through the door and said ah lady good ive been seeking you he heaved his bulk within ista hadnt seen him since theyd arrived she realized not even at the evening services he looked fatigued gray and puffy under the eyes had he been up late in some forced study i requestbegsome private audience with you if i may liss looked up from where shed been peering over foixs shoulder should i leave you royina no the correct thing for a ladyinwaiting to do should her mistress wish private speech with some gentleman not of her immediate family is to place herself out of earshot but within sight or call ah liss nodded understanding ista would never have to repeat the instruction liss might be untutored but five gods what a joy it was to finally have an attendant with all her wits about her i could read to her in this chamber or the next foix immediately volunteered um dy cabon gestured to a table and chairs visible through an archway in the next room ista nodded and passed in before him foix and liss settled back into the cozy window seat more discussion of their holy itinerary was due she suspected and tedious letters to be written thereafter apprising dy ferrej of their planned route dy cabon held her chair then edged around the table to seat himself she could hear foixs voice begin to murmur in the next chamber too softly to make out the words from here but in the cadences of some strong striding narrative stanzas the divine tented his hands on the table before him stared at them for a moment then looked her in the face in a level tone he asked lady why are you really on this pilgrimage istas brows rose at this utterly blunt beginning she decided to return straight speech for straight speech it was rare enough in a royinas hearing and ought to be encouraged to escape my keepers and myself you have not and had not then any real intention to pray for a grandson ista grimaced not for all the gods in chalion would i insult iselle or my new granddaughter isara so i still remember how i was chided and shamed for bearing a daughter to ias these nineteen years ago the selfsame brilliant girl who is now the brightest hope the royacy of chalion has had in four generations she controlled her fierce tone which clearly had taken dy cabon aback should a grandson come in due time i shall of course be very pleased but i will not beg the gods for any favor he took this in nodded slowly yes i had come to suspect something of a sort it is i grant a trifle impious to use a pilgrimage so and abuse the good guards the daughters order lends me though im quite sure im not the first to make holiday at the gods expense my purse shall more than compensate the temple that does not concern me dy cabon waved away these pecuniary considerations lady i have read i have talked to my superiors i have taken thought i havewell never mind that now he drew a breath are you aware royinado you realizei have found reason to think you see that you may be extraordinarily spiritually gifted his gaze upon her face was deeply searching found reason where what garbled secret tales had the man heard ista sat back did not quite recoil i am afraid that is not so i believe you underestimate yourself seriously underestimate yourself this sort of thing is i admit rare in a woman of your rank but i have come to realize you are a very unusual woman but i believe that with prayer guidance meditation and instruction you might reach a pitch of spiritual sensitivity of fulfilled calling that well that most of us who wear our gods colors only dream about and long for these are not gifts to be lightly cast aside not lightly indeed with great violence how in five gods names had he come by this sudden delusion dy cabons eager face she realized was afire with the look of a man seized by a grand idea was he picturing himself as her proud spiritual mentor he would not be turned from his conviction that he was called to aid her to some life of holy service by any vague excuses on her part he would not be stopped by anything less than the whole truth her stomach sank no yes it was not after all as though she had not made full confession before to another godgripped man perhaps these things grew easier with practice you are mistaken understand learned i have walked down that road already to its bitterest end once i was a saint it was his turn to recoil in astonishment he gulped you were a vessel of the gods his face bunched up with consternation that explains something no it doesnt he grasped his hair briefly but let it go unravaged royina i do not understand how came you to be godtouched when was this miracle long long ago she sighed formerly this story was a state secret a state crime i suppose it is no longer whether it will in time become rumor or legend or dead and buried i know not in any case it is not to be shared not even with your superiors or if you seem to have cause to do so take your instruction first from the chancellor dy cazaril he knows all the truth of it they say he is very wise said dy cabon wideeyed now for once they say right she paused marshaling her thoughts her memories her words how old were you when roya iass great courtier lord arvol dy lutez was executed for treason dy lutez iass boyhood companion brother in arms greatest servant throughout his darkly troubled thirtyfiveyear reign powerful intelligent brave rich handsome courteous there seemed no end to the gifts that the godsand the royahad piled upon the glorious lord dy lutez ista had been eighteen when shed married ias ias and his right arm dy lutez had reached their fifties dy lutez had arranged the marriage the aging royas second for already there were worries about iass sole surviving son and heir orico why i was a young child he hesitated cleared his throat though i heard it talked about later in my life the rumor was he stopped abruptly the rumor you heard was that dy lutez had seduced me and died for it at my royal husbands hands yes she supplied coolly urn yes lady was itit wasnt no it was not true he breathed covert relief her lips twisted it was not me he loved in that way but ias dy lutez should have been a lay dedicat of your order i think instead of holy general of the sons in addition to bastards the occasional artist and other jetsam of the world the bastards order was the refuge of those to whom it was not given to conform to the fruitful relations between men and women overseen by the great four but to seek their own sex at this distance in time space and sin it was almost amusing to watch dy cabons face as he unraveled her polite description that must have been rather difficult for you as a young bride then yes she admitted now she held out her hand and opened it as if letting sand pass through her fingers it is beside the point far more difficult was my discovery that since the calamitous death of iass father roya fonsa a great and strange curse had been laid upon the royal house of chalion and that i had brought my children into it unknowing not told not warned dy cabons lips made an o i had prophetic dreams nightmares for a time i thought i was going mad for a time ias and dy lutez had left her in that terror alone uncomforted it had seemed then and still seemed now a greater betrayal than any trivial sweaty graspings under the sheets could ever be i prayed and prayed to the gods and my prayers were answered dy cabon i spoke to the mother facetoface as close as i am to you now she shivered still in memory of that overwhelming incandescence a great blessing he breathed in awe she shook her head a great woe upon the instruction of the gods as given to me wedy lutez and ias and iplanned a perilous ritual to break the curse to send it back to the gods from whom it had once been spilled but wei in my anxiety and fear made a mistake a great and willful mistake and dy lutez died in the midst of it as a direct result sorcery miracle call it what you will the ritual failed the gods withdrew from me ias in his panic put the treason rumor about to account for the death that bright star of his court his best beloved murdered buriedthen defamed which was all but to be murdered again for dy lutez had loved his high honor better than his life dy cabons brow wrinkled but was not this posthumous slander of lord dy lutez by your husband equally a slander of you lady ista faltered at this unconsidered view ias knew the truth what other opinion mattered that the world should think me falsely an adulteress seemed far less hideous than that it should know me truly a murderess but ias died of grief thereafter deserting me leaving me to wail in the ashes of the disaster mindfogged and accursed still how old were you asked dy cabon nineteen when it began twentytwo when it ended she frowned when had that begun to seem so you were very young for so great a burden he offered voicing almost her own thought her lips thinned in denial officers like ferda and foix are sent to fight and die at no greater age i was older then than iselle is now who bears the whole of the royacy of chalion upon her slim shoulders not just the womans half but not alone she has great courtiers and royseconsort bergon ias had dy lutez whom did you have lady ista fell silent she could not remember had she truly been so alone she shook her head drew breath another generation brought another man humbler and greater than dy lutez of deeper mind more equal to the task the curse was broken but not by me yet not before my son teidez died of it as wellof the curse of my failure to lift it when he was a child of betrayal by and of those who should have protected and guided him three years ago by the labor and sacrifice of others i was released from my long bondage into the silence of my life in valenda unbearable silence i am not old dy cabon waved his plump hands in protest indeed no my lady you are quite lovely still she made a sharp gesture cutting off his misconstrual my mother was forty when i was born her last child i am forty now in this illmade spring of her death onehalf my life lies behind me and half of that stolen from me by fonsas great curse onehalf lies before shall it hold only a long slow decay surely not lady she shrugged i have made this confession twice now perhaps some third occasion will release me the gods the gods may forgive much to a truly penitent heart her smile grew bitter as desert brine the gods may forgive ista all day long but if ista does not forgive ista the gods may go hang themselves his oh was very small but earnest faithful creature he had to try again but to turn away sodare i say it royinayou betray your gifts she leaned forward lowered her voice to a husky growl no learned you darent he sat back and was very quiet for several moments after that at length his face screwed up again then what of your pilgrimage royina she grimaced waved a hand pick a route to the bestlaid tables if you wish let us go anywhere so long as it does not return to valenda so long as it does not return to ista dy chalion you must go home eventually i would throw myself off a precipice first except that i would land in the arms of the gods whom i do not wish to see again that escape is blocked i must go on living and living and living she cut off her rising tones the world is ashes and the gods are a horror tell me learned what other place is there for me to go he shook his head eyes very wide now shed terrorized him and she was sorry for it she patted his hand contritely in truth these few days of travel have brought me more ease than the past three years of idling my flight from valenda may have begun as a spasm as a drowning man strikes upward to the air but i do believe i start to breathe learned this pilgrimage may be a medicine despite me i i five gods grant it may be so lady he signed himself she could tell by the way his hand hesitated at each holy point that it was not this time a gesture of mere ritual she was almost tempted to tell him about her dream but no it would just excite him all over again the poor young man had surely had enough for one day his jowls were quite pale i will take um more thought he assured her and scraped his chair back from the table his bow to her as he rose was not that of conductor to charge nor of courtier to patron he gave her the deep obeisance of piety to a living saint her hand shot out grabbed his hand halfway through its gesture of boundless respect no not now not then not ever again he swallowed shakily converted his farewell to a nervous bob and fled chapter five they lingered two more days in casilchas waiting out a slow spring rain wrapped in a hospitality that ista found increasingly uncomfortable she was invited to meals in the seminarys refectory not of scholarly austerity but near banquets in her near honor with senior divines and local notables of the town discreetly jostling for a place at her table they still addressed her as sera dy ajelo but she was forced to trade the new ease of her incognito for her old constrained court manners learned in too stern a school it seemed ever to be forgotten she was gracious she was attentive to her hosts she complimented and smiled and gritted her teeth and sent foix to inform the elusive dy cabon that he must finish his inquiries whatever they were immediately it was time to travel on the days that followed were much better a pleasant ramble through the blooming countryside from one minor shrine to another nearly the escape ista had hoped for from her pilgrimage moving steadily northwest they passed out of baocia into the neighboring province of tolnoxo long hours in the saddle were interspersed with invigorating tramps about places of historical or theological interest wells ruins groves shrines famous graves commanding heights formerly embattled fords the young men of the party searched the military sites for arrowheads sword shards and bones and argued over whether the blotches upon them were or were not heroic bloodstains dy cabon had acquired another book for his saddlebags library of the history and legends of the region from which he read improving paragraphs as opportunities presented despite the odd succession of humble inns and holy hostels quite unlike anything she had ever experienced as a royina or even as the youngest daughter of a provincar ista slept better than she had in her own bed for as long as she could remember the disturbing dream did not return to her secret relief dy cabons first few morning sermons after casilchas showed the results of his hasty researches being plainly cribbed from some volume of model lessons but the next few days brought more daring and original material heroic tales of chalionese and ibran saints and godtouched martyrs in the service of their chosen deities the divine made contorted connections between each days tale and the sites they were to view but ista was not deceived his stories of the famous miracles that men and women had performed as vessels of the gods powers made ferdas and foixs and even lisss eyes shine with a spirit of emulation but ista found the divines message on all its several levels entirely resistible he watched her anxiously for her responses she thanked him coolly he bowed and bit back disappointment but also fortunately the temptation to reopen the subject more directly a break in dy cabons oblique campaign occurred as they wound through the foothills of the western ranges and arrived at the town of vinyasca just in time for the midspring festival this feast day fell at the apogee of the season exactly midway between the daughters day and the mothers in vinyasca it was also tied to the renewal of the trade caravans over the snowy passes from ibra bringing new wine and oil dried fruit and fish and a hundred other delicacies of that milder land as well as exotic fare from even farther shores a fairground had been set up outside the town walls between the rocky river and a pine grove mouthwatering smoke rose up from roasting pits behind tents displaying handicrafts and produce of the areas maidens who competed for honors in the goddesss name liss shrugged at the tent of embroidery sewing and wool work dy cabon and foix returned disappointed from a reconnoiter of the tent of foodstuffs to report that it did not offer morsels to any but the judges food might be the focus but youthful energy could not be denied for all that it was a young womens festival young men vied for their gazes in a dozen contests of skill and daring istas guard kindling at the challenges begged for their commanders indulgence and dispersed to try their luck although ferda meticulously apportioned pairs in turn to be at her call at all times ferdas sternness eroded abruptly when he discovered the horse races having no one elses leave to beg he sought istas and she hid a smile and sent him off to ready his mount my courier horse said liss in a voice of longing could make all these country nags look like the plow horses they undoubtedly are im afraid the womens race was earlier said ista shed seen the winner led past horse and girl festooned with blueandwhite garlands surrounded by cheerful relatives that was for the young maidens said liss her voice tinged with scorn there are some older women getting ready for the longer onei saw them are you sure they were not just grooms or relatives or owners no for they were tying colors on their sleeves and they had the look of riders as liss did indeed she was doing her best to keep her face dignified but she was rising on her toes well said ista amused if foix at least will undertake not to abandon me foix smiling favored her with a loyal bow oh thank you my lady cried liss and was gone as though racing afoot back to the inns stable where they had stowed their mounts ista strolled about the makeshift grounds on foixs arm taking care to observe any contests in which her own men competed a contest to gallop with a javelin picking off small rings set up on posts was won by one of her guard a match that involved leaping from a horse to grapple a young steer to the ground was won by the steer all brought back their prizes for their officer foix to hold and therefore ista to notice she felt half courtly half maternal and commiserated the dusty limping steerwrestler with as many words as she spared to congratulate the luckier contestants she had accepted her guard troop at first as an unavoidable encumbrance and ignored them but over the days of her journey she had learned names faces life storiesmost very short they had begun to look less like blankfaced soldiers responsible for her and more like overgrown children she did not care for this oppressive shift in her perceptions she did not want to be responsible for them i had no luck with sons yet loyalty must run two ways or else become betrayal in the egg as the contenders assembled for the horse race foix found ista a spot on the slope overlooking the road above most of the rest of the eager crowd in a gallants gesture he spread his vestcloak carried over his arm in the warmth of the bright afternoon on the ground for ista to settle upon they had a fine view of the start and finish point which was a large stump by the roadside the course ran down the valley road for about two miles circled a stand of oak trees crowning a mound and returned by the same route some twenty or so horses and their riders milled about in the wide space on the road ferda dy gura on his shining black beast was shortening his stirrups and studying the others when liss trotted up on her leggy bay he turned to stare at her in surprise but no delight he apparently said something sharp for lisss face fell she looked up in a moment and returned a rather bittenout remark ferda leaned toward her and said something else longer she jerked her horse away flushing the angry color faded in a moment to be replaced by a thoughtful frown then a tight smile now what was that all about ista wondered aloud foix sitting at her feet smirked i believe my brother was seeking to display his prowess to liss not to compete with hers i fear he did not handle his surprise well he settled back on one elbow with an air of enjoyable interest that did not seem entirely due to the colorful excitement of the upcoming race so why arent you down there she asked him do your ribs still trouble you no lady but im no great rider his eyes narrowed with amusement ill choose my ground when i do with more wit he was not ista suspected referring to contests in a rural festival under the direction of a pair of shouting organizers the riders arranged themselves in an uneven jostling line across the road vinyascas town divine a blueandwhite sash wrapped around his waist stood on the stump and intoned a short blessing to dedicate the race to the goddess then held up a blue kerchief his hand dropped with yells from both riders and onlookers the horses plunged off at first the horses clashed for position in a heartstopping melee one rider fellbut by the time the leaders were partway to the turning point the line was spreading out lisss bay and ferdas black both ran near the front of the pack ista squinted anxiously into the distance lips parted breath coming faster when the racers appeared again around the mound of oaks the two shared a clear and widening lead istas party all broke into cheers halfway back along the road from the trees liss threw a glance over her shoulder at ferda and his laboring black then leaned forward low over her horses neck the rangy bay seemed to rise and float over the ground and the gap between them widened rapidly even ista found herself cheering then yes go ha liss was two dozen horse lengths ahead as she neared the stump but then suddenly she sat bolt upright her horses stride abruptly shortened in a few more yards the bay was nearly bouncing in place ferdas foamflecked black flashed past and liss eased her reins and let her mount canter demurely after him her animal looked as though it was ready to run another race just like this one and ista was reminded that a typical courier leg was fifteen or so miles the cries of the onlookers took on a decidedly bewildered tone the rest of the field pelted past the finish point and the crowd swirled down onto the road foix one arm wrapped around his knees as he rocked held his hand over his mouth and choked back sputtering noises ferda was standing in his stirrups astonished and red with exertion and fury he was nevertheless feted as the winner by the dubious locals who shot many looks over their shoulders at liss liss put her nose in the air and walked her horse past him toward the town and the waiting stables ferda looked as though he wanted to fling his blueandwhite garland on the ground in front of her in a rage but couldnt so insult the goddess or his hosts if this is a courtship said ista to foix might you not advise your brother on his ah method not for all the world said foix who had gained control of his breathing again little squeaks still leaked out now and then nor would he thank me if i did now mind you my lady i would throw myself between my brother and a roknari crossbow quarrel without hesitation in fact i have but there must be limits to fraternal selfsacrifice i think ista smiled dryly is that the way of it i see foix shrugged well who knows time must tell indeed it reminded ista quite of old court politics in miniature she must advise liss against creating untoward dissension in her little troop whether by accident or design foix she wasnt sure foix needed anyones advice foix scrambled to his feet eyes alight i must go congratulate my brother on his victory its not a moment to be missed he turned to help her up from the ground with a panache that would not have been out of place in cardegoss later in the afternoon when liss had returned to istas side foix found a wood chopping contest he tackled this humble but vigorous exercise with his shirt off before the ladies eyes he bore no serious scars on his muscular torso though his flesh was slightly mottled still ista noted she suspected his broadsword swing would be as handsome as his work with an ax but he was either not quite as recovered from his injuries as hed claimed or interestingly subtle for he came in a cheerful second he clapped the winner on the shoulder bought the man a congratulatory flagon of ale and departed whistling ista had no opportunity to speak alone with her handmaiden till midevening they withdrew after supper to the balcony of her inn room a choice chamber overlooking the town square in the paved space below a feast had given way to music and dancing illuminated by hundreds of beautiful pierced metal lanterns scattered around the square and hung from the trees in front of the temple shedding a lacy light it was not excessively rowdy yet for the young women were well chaperoned by their families later in the evening when the maidens had all gone in ista expected more serious drinking to commence ista settled in a chair brought out for her liss leaned on the wooden rail and watched the dancers wistfully so said ista after a time what had you and ferda to say to each other that so inflamed you both before your race oh liss grimaced turning half around stupid things he said it was unfair for me to enter because my courier horse was too fine and fit for this country competition as though his horse was not the finest cardegoss could yield and then he said it was not a proper contest for a womanwith half a dozen other women there a race in the name of the goddess the men in it only rode on their womens behalfhe entered in your honor a trifle inconsistent i grant you murmured ista he was odious well i showed him mm but you also showed him half right your horse did clearly overmatch the humble beasts of vinyasca so did his if i should not have entered for that reason neither should he ista smiled in silence and liss after a moment turned once more to watch the dancers in the country dances here men and women danced sometimes apart in handclasped circles and sometimes together in complicated patterns sung out above the music by a caller most were rather vigorous with a swirling of skirts and petticoats and rhythmic foot stamping ista tried to decide if this flurry between her two principal attendants was a problem or its opposite in truth she did not even know if her handmaiden so hastily snatched up into her service was a maiden the riding girls of the courier cadre presumably took care not to become pregnant lest they lose their livelihood but that did not necessarily mean they were sexually abstinent or innocent or ignorant quite the reverse since innocence based in ignorance was unfit to protect itself in iass court ista could not help having learned some things about how men and womenor other combinations of participantscould pleasure each other without risking the consequences of children ista didnt know how many of these secrets the riding girls passed around in their dormitories nor how much they were taught by the women who supervised them themselves former couriers looking out for their charges in any case as a farm girl involved in breeding animals liss was doubtless better informed of the basics than ista had been at a like age but emotions were as like to wreak havoc in a tightly confined court as physicalities ista was also unsure if either dy gura brother intended honorable courtship or merely seduction the social gap between landless minor aristocrat and landed yeomans child might tend to the latter but it was not impossibly wide for the former especially given a dowry though that seemed a dubious hope in lisss case but a very little time in lisss insouciant company had certainly brought both brothers to attention and no wonder the girl was beautiful and bright the young men were healthy and vigorous in all ista saw good reason not to rush to repair the breach lest she replace one problem with a much less tractable one still she probed so what do you think of the dy guras ferda was all right at first but lately hes grown priggish he feels his responsibilities keenly i think liss shrugged foix well foix is all right i suppose would foix be crushed to hear this tepid judgment perhaps not ista ventured a hint i trust no men of my guard have made offensive advances to you in order to testify to her ladys honor a handmaiden must herself be above reproach no they all seem to take their oaths to the goddess most seriously she sniffed or else ferda selected them for likeminded priggishness a merry smile brought a dimple to the side of her mouth the good divine now he wasted no time he propositioned me that first night in palma ista blinked in surprise ah she said cautiously one must remember that not everyone in the bastards order is of that urn preference she considered how to phrase her next question you need not endure affront regardless of any mans rank or calling in fact as my dependent you should not it is quite proper to complain to me if there is such a problem liss tossed her head i suppose i ought to have been insulted but he managed to be quite charming about it really he took his rejection in good part and went off to try the chambermaid i received no complaints liss snickered i dont think she had any when they came out of her room later she was giggling it made me wonder what id missed ista tried to set a good stern example by not laughing and failed oh dear liss grinned back and returned to gazing enviously at the dancers after a time ista couldnt bear it anymore and gave her leave to join the party liss looked delighted with the unexpected treat and startled ista a trifle by popping directly over the balcony to hang onehanded and drop onto the pavement she scampered off it felt odd to be alone ista drew a few slightly rude if not unamiable calls from passing men in the street which she didnt know how to handle and therefore ignored the men trod off more rudely and less amiably liss had exchanged such banter earlier with easy cheer and sent their drunken admirers on their way chuckling this is not my world yet she had ruled it once supposedly from a clouded distance in cardegoss ferda dy gura emerged onto the neighboring balcony found ista by herself glared a wouldbe serenader into slinking away and chided her albeit in the politest terms for dispensing with her attendant he vanished again only to exit the inn belowby the doorwayand plunge into the crowd to retrieve liss when they came in sight again they both had their fists clenched whatever hot exchange they were having however they muffled before they came back within istas hearing ista led the way to bed the festival continued noisily for some hours but did not keep her awake deep in the night she opened her dreaming eyes to find herself in the mysterious castle courtyard again this time the scene was darkthis very night what seemed the same waning moon that was passing over vinyasca gave a sickly inadequate light but the shadows were not impenetrable for a strange glow hung in the air like a rope made of white fire it ran across the court and up the stairs disappearing through the same heavy door at the end of the gallery istas dreamself scarcely dared to touch it though it drew her eyes she followed it again up the stairs along the boards through the door the bedchamber was darker than the courtyard shutters closed moonless but illuminated still the rope of fire seemed to be rising up from the heart of the man stretched on the bed the pale flames flickered all along his body as though he burned coiling from his chest flowing away and then ista wondered if she was looking at a rope or a conduit and where that conduit emptied out she glanced back along the floating line of light and was moved to grasp it let it tow her along to its destination as a cable might pull a drowning woman from the water her dreamhand reached gripped the line broke shattering under her fingers spattering away in bright ripples the man on the bed woke panted started halfup saw her stretched out a burning hand you he gasped lady help me in the gods name which god ista could not help thinking in a sort of tilted hysteria she dared not grasp that terrifying fiery hand for all that it reached for her who are you his wide eyes devoured the sight of her she speaks his voice cracked my lady i pray dont go her eyes snapped open in the dimness of the little inn chamber in vinyasca nearly the only sound was lisss slow regular breathing on her pallet across the room the festival dance had evidently ended the last drunken revelers departed for home or at least passed out in doorways along the route silently ista swung her feet out of bed and padded to the locked shutters to the balcony she eased up the latch and slipped out the only lights were a pair of wall lanterns burning low flanking the closed doors of the temple across the plaza she gazed up into the night sky at the waning moon she knew it for the same moon as in her vision the place the man were as real as she wherever they were so did the strange man dream this night of ista as ista dreamed of him what did his dark straining eyes see that made him reach out so desperately and was he as bewildered by her as she was by him his voice had been rich in timbre though scraped thin with pain or fear or exhaustion but he had spoken in the ibran tongue shared by ibra and chalion and brajar not in roknari or darthacanalbeit with a north chalionese accent tinged by roknari cadences i cannot help you whoever you are i cannot help pray to your god if you want rescue though i do not recommend it she fled the moonlight locked the shutter huddled back into her bed as soundlessly as she could careful not to wake liss she pulled her feather pillow over her head it blocked all vision except the very one she did not want to see burning in her minds eye when she woke again on the morrow all the events of the previous day would seem a more faded dream than this she clenched her hands in her sheets and waited for the light as liss was braiding istas hair soon after dawn the next morning there came a knock on their chamber door and foix dy guras voice my lady liss liss went to the door and opened it onto the gallery that ran around the inns interior well court foix fully dressed for the road gave her a nod adding a little bow to ista who came up behind lisss shoulder good morning my lady learned dy cabon sends his abject apologies but he cannot lead prayers this morning he is fallen very ill oh no said ista is it serious should we send someone to the temple to ask for a physician vinyasca was much smaller than valenda was the mothers order here large enough to support a physician of good learning foix rubbed his lips which kept trying to quirk up in a smile ah i think not quite yet my lady it may just be something he ate yesterday or er winesickness he was not drunk when i last saw him said ista doubtfully mm that was earlier later he went off with a party from the local temple and well they brought him back quite late not that one can diagnose with certainty through a closed door but his groans and noises sounded quite like winesickness to me horribly familiar brought back memories mercifully blurred memories but still liss smothered a laugh ista gave her a quelling frown and said very well tell your men to stand down and leave their horses to their hay we shall attend the morning service at the temple instead and decide whether to take to the road again later there is no hurry after all very good my lady foix gave her a nod and a little salute and turned away early services filled an hour although it seemed to ista that they were curtailed and not well attended the local divine was rather pale and wan himself afterward she and liss and foix idled about the quiet town the festival tents were being taken down and folded away they walked along the river over the racecourse and foix encouraged liss to give a blowbyblow account of her ride details of horses and riders that ista had scarcely registered liss explained that her remarkable burst of speed late in the race was partly illusory it had merely been that the other horses were starting to flag at that stage ista was pleased to note that her fivemile walk did not exhaust her as it had that day when shed fled the castle in valenda and she didnt think it was wholly due to wearing more suitable clothing and shoes learned dy cabon emerged from his room around noon his face the color of dough ista took one look at him canceled the days travel plans and sent him back to bed he crept away mumbling pitifully grateful thanks she was relieved to see he was not feverish foixs diagnosis of winesickness seemed sound confirmed when the divine slunk out again shamefaced in the evening and took a supper of toast and tea turning down with loathing an offer of watered wine by the next morning dy cabon seemed fully recovered although his sunrise sermon again reverted to a model from his book istas party took to the road while the air was yet cool fording the rocky river and climbing the hill road out of vinyasca heading north the country they rode through on the dry side of the mountains was sparsely wooded stands of pine and evergreen oak with scrub between gray rocks poking up through the yellow weeds the soil was far too poor for much farming except in patches and terrace gardens grubbed out and handtended and the thinly populated area around vinyasca soon gave way to utter wilderness the road led up and down one little valley looking much like the next sometimes old bridges or culverts not in the best repair crossed the streams tumbling down from the distant heights on their leftward side but more often their horses and mules had to pick their way across boulderstudded fords they stopped in the early afternoon to picnic by such a stream the water was this lands one rich gift clear and pure and cold the evenings goal was a reputed holy site tucked high in the hills the village birthplace of a saintly woman healer devotee of the mother whose miracles had all taken place far from here or else ista reflected as she rode along they would have been far more obscure the scampering golden rock gophers that popped up and chittered inhospitably as they passed would not have written them down and passed them around to attract foreign travelers in aftergenerations after the visit their route would descend to the easier roads in the chalionese plains and swing south again toward baocia and home she did not want to go back yet how long could she go on like this trailing these young men around the countryside on random roads they would be wanted soon for harsher services as the lords of chalion prepared for the autumn campaign in the north well then let us all dodge our duties a little longer the weather was mild the season was right the warm afternoon breathed a scent of mountain thyme and sage the smell of blood and sweat and iron would overtake them all soon enough the track widened curving around a wooded slope and then descending ferda and dy cabon rode ahead followed by one of the young guards and foix liss rode close behind ista and the rest trailed after ista felt it first as a wave of emotion hot confused menace pain and desperation a terrible shortness of breath a moment later her horse planted all four feet and came to an abrupt trembling halt its head came up sharply and it snorted from the shadows of the trees the bear charged its head was lowered its great shoulder crest stood up its bronze fur rippled like water in the slanting afternoon light it moved incredibly fast for such a bulky lowslung creature and its snarl split the air like a saw every horse and mule in the party tried to wheel and bolt the young guard ahead of ista pejar swung left as his panicked mount shied right and they parted company ista didnt see him hit the ground for her own horse reared then squealing too late she tried to shorten her reins grab mane her saddle pommel hit her hard in the stomach her saddle jerked away from under her and then the ground came up in a whirl knocking her wind half out dizzied she rolled to her feet missing her lunge for a flapping rein horses were galloping away in all directions their furious riders sawing at their reins in an effort to regain control pejars horse its saddle empty was far down the track already istas horse bucking and kicking in its wake the young man flat on the ground was staring up in terror as the drooling bear loomed over him was the animal mad to so attack ordinarily these mountain bears were elusive shy and this was no mother defending cubs but a large male its not a bear ornot only a bear gasping fascinated ista staggered nearer despite the initial impression of terrifying energy it wasnt a well bear either its fur now that she saw it more closely was mangy falling out in patches and despite its large frame its flesh was thin its legs trembled it stared up at ista as if as fascinated by her as she was by it it seemed to her as though its essential bearness was almost eaten away from the inside out the eyes that stared back at her had a red intelligence that owed nothing to any animal mind it has caught a demon and the demon has nearly devoured it and now the rider seeks another mount how dare you ista grated not even a humble bear deserved this you dont belong here demon go back to your accursed master their gazes locked she stepped closer the bear stepped back from the whitefaced boy another step another the beardemon lowered its head almost to the ground its eyes wide and whiteringed snuffling backing away in fear royina i come with a grunting cry foix appeared from the corner of istas vision vestcloak billowing swinging his broadsword in a mighty arc his lips were drawn back strong teeth clenched with the effort of his strike no foix ista screamed too late the heavy blade took the bears head in one blow and went on to bury itself in the soil beneath blood burst briefly from the creatures neck and the head rolled away over the ground one front paw spasmed the big furry body dropped in a heap ista seemed to see the demon with every sense but her eyes a palpable force a blood tinged fire a smell like hot metal it roared toward her then suddenly scrambled back in a sort of bestial terror it hesitated a desperate moment between foix and the boy on the ground then it flowed into foix foixs eyes widened what he said in a weirdly conversational tone then his eyes rolled back and he collapsed chapter six liss was the first to get control of her mount and gallop back she swung down off her bay breathless with confusion and alarm the groaning pejar pushed himself up to a sitting position and boggled at the beheaded bear his brow wrinkled in bewilderment at the sight of foix lying on the ground beside the carcass which still leaked hot blood sir the fall from her horse had shaken istas stomach but it was the concussion from the demons passage that reverberated in her bones her mind felt unnaturally distanced from her body she pulled off her vestcloak folded it and knelt to try to drag foixs heavy body around and pillow his head liss said lady waitwas he stunned when his horse threw him there may be broken bones did his horse throw him i didnt see that would explain why he had been first to reach the bear certainly no he was not hurt then he slew the beast mores the pity he slid right over the crupper onto his um backside i suppose there were no bones to break there liss wrapped one rein around her arm to hold her snorting backing horse and knelt to help poking her head up for an impressed glance at the evidence of carcass sword and distant head five gods what a blow she stared down at foix his face was the color of porridge whats the matter with him ferda rode up next took one look and vaulted from his horse not even bothering to keep a rein foix royina what has happened he knelt to run his hands over his brothers body searching for the injury obviously expecting to see bloody damage from some massive clawed swipe his brows knotted as he found none he started to try to turn foix over dy cabon labored up minus his mule gasping for breath ista grasped ferdas arm no your brother was not struck he chopped off the bears head then he just fell over confirmed pejar was the beast mad to attack like that panted dy cabon he bent over his belly to brace his hands on his knees and stare around as well not mad said ista in a flat voice demonridden dy cabons eyes widened searching her face are you sure royina entirely sure i felt it it felt me ferda rocked back on his heels looking dumfounded where did it dy cabons voice trailed off as he surveyed the shaken guard ista upright and in apparent possession of her wits foix lying as though bludgeoned it didnt go into him did it yes ista moistened her lips it was backing off i tried to stop him but all he saw was a mad bear i think seeming to menace me dy cabons lips repeated the word seeming his gaze upon her sharpened dy cabons manifest belief finally convinced the stunned ferda his face nearly crumpled in tears learned what will happen to foix that dependsdy cabon swallowedmuch on the nature of the demon in question it was bearish reported ista still in that same flat voice it may have consumed other creatures before the bear but it could not have ingested the nature or intelligence of a man yet it had no speech but now it possesses a very banquet of words and wits how quickly would it start its feast that will change muttered dy cabon echoing istas own thought he took a deep breath nothing will happen instantly he asserted more loudly ista did not quite like the toohearty tone of that foix can resist if he chooses an inexperienced demon needs time to grow to learn to dig in istas thought supplied to tap a souls strength to prepare for siege did it follow that an experienced demon fat with many souls of men could conquer in a breath still we should give it as little time as possible to as little time as possible a temple at one of the provincial seats will have the means the scholars to deal with this we must take him at once to the archdivine of taryoonno that would take a week he stared out over the hills toward the distant plains the provincial temple at maradi is closer ferda where are your maps we must find the speediest route the other guardsmen were riding up having captured the loose horses and mules one towed ferdas mount ferda rose to search his saddlebags but turned back quickly as foix stirred and groaned foixs eyes opened he stared up at the sky and the ring of faces hovering anxiously over him and his brows drew down in a wince oh he muttered ferda knelt by his head his hands opening and closing helplessly how do you feel he ventured at last foix blinked i feel very strange he made a clumsy gesture with one handit looked like a paw swipingand tried to roll over and stand up he ended up on all fours instead it took him two more tries to gain his feet dy cabon held one arm and ferda the other as he blinked again and moved his jaw back and forth a few times he reached his hand toward his mouth missed and tried again his fingers probed as if reassuring himself he felt a jaw and not a muzzle what happened for a long moment no one dared to answer he looked around at their horrorstricken stares with increasing dismay dy cabon finally said we think you have contracted a demon it was riding the bear when it attacked the bear was dying said ista even in her own ears her voice sounded oddly detached i tried to warn you its not true is it ferda asked begged this cannot be foixs face went still inward his eyes were fixed unseeing for half a dozen breaths oh he said again yes it is is that what what dy cabon tried to make his voice gentle but it came out edged with anxiety there is something in my head frightened all in a knot as though trying to hide in a cave hm it was becoming apparent that foix was not about to turn into a bear demon or anything else much but a bewildered young man just yet the seniors of the party supporting foix all went a short distance away and sat on the ground to consult the maps a couple of the guardsmen discussed the carcass in low voices and decided its diseased skin was not worth the peeling though they collected the teeth and claws for souvenirs then hauled it away off the road ferda sorted out his map of the region and smoothed it over a wide flat stone his finger traced a line i believe our most efficient route to maradi is to stay on this very track for another thirty miles or so to this village then turn and descend almost due east dy cabon glanced up toward the sun already fallen behind the wall of mountains to their west though the sky still glowed deep blue well not make it there before this night falls ista dared to touch the map with one white finger if we continue only a little well come to that crossroad up to the old saints village that we intended to visit weve already bespoken food and fodder and beds there and we could start again early and there would be strong walls between them and any more bears although not between them and the demona reflection she resolved to keep to herself ferda frowned six extra miles each way more if we mistake the track again just such a deceptive fork in the road had cost them an hour earlier in the day half a days travel lost we carry enough food and fodder for one nightwe can restock where we turn east he hesitated and said more cautiously that is if you are willing to endure the discomforts of a night in camp royina the weather looks to continue fair at least ista fell silent she misliked the scheme but misliked still more the hint that she would put her comfort above her loyal officers clear need split the party send the speediest riders on ahead with foix she misliked that idea as well i have no preference how do you feel about riding ferda asked his brother foix was sitting with his brow furrowed and an inward look like a man with a stomachache huh oh no worse than usual my rump hurts but that has nothing to do with with the other thing he was quiet a moment longer then added except indirectly ferda said in a voice of military decision let us push on as far and fast as we can tonight then a murmur of agreement ran around the little council squatting by the stone ista pressed her lips closed they put foix back up on his nervous horseit took two men to hold the beast and it sidled and snorted at first but then settled as they set out again dy cabon and ferda rode close to foix on either side protectively too late ista stared at their backs as they continued down the road such as it was her sense of the demons presence briefly so searing was muted again was it occluded by matter or perhaps deliberately hiding itself within its new fleshly lair or was it her deficiency she had suppressed her sensitivity for so long extending it again was like stretching a withered muscle it hurt lord dy cazaril claimed that the world of the spirit and the world of matter existed side by side like two sides of a coin or a wall the gods were not far away in some other space but in this very one continuously just around some strange corner of perception a presence as pervasive and invisible as sunlight on skin as though one stood naked and blindfolded in an unimaginable noon demons as well though they were more like thieves putting a hand through a window what occupied foixs space now if both brothers came up behind her would she know which was which without looking she closed her eyes to test her perceptions the creak of her saddle the plodding of the other mounts the faint crack as a hoof struck a stone the smell of her horse of her sweat of the cool breath of pines nothing more now and then she wondered what the demon saw when it looked at ista they made camp by another clear stream when there was barely enough light left to find firewood the men gathered plenty ista suspected she was not the only one worried about wildlife they also built her and liss a little bower of sorts with logs and branches floored with a hay of hastily cut yellow grasses it did not look especially bearproof to her foix rejected being treated as an invalid and insisted on gathering wood as well ista watched him discreetly and so she noticed did dy cabon foix heaved over one goodsized log only to find it rotten crawling with grubs he stared down at his find with a very odd look on his face learned he said quietly yes foix will i turn into a bear or into a madman who thinks hes a bear no neither said dy cabon firmly though whether truly ista suspected even he did not know that will wear off dy cabon spoke to reassure but did not seem to partake of the comfort himself because if the demon became less bear like it could only be because it was growing more foixlike good sighed foix his face screwed up because those look delicious he kicked the log back over again with rather more force than was necessary and went to look for a drier deadfall dy cabon lingered by ista lady five gods his plaintive tone of voice was just like foixs a moment ago she barely turned her soothing yes dy cabon into a sharper what lest he take her for mocking him about your dreams the godtouched ones you had so long ago not long ago enough what about them well how do you know when dreams are real how do you tell good prophecy from say bad fish there is nothing good about prophecy all i can tell you is they are unmistakable as if more real than memory not less her voice went harsh in sudden suspicion why do you ask he tapped his fingers nervously against the side of one broad hip i thought you might instruct me what the conductor conducted she tried to turn this off lightly though her stomach chilled the temple would disapprove i think not so lady what apprentice would not seek advice from a master if he could if he found himself with a commission far beyond his skills her eyes narrowed five godsand never had the oath seemed more aproposwhat dreams had come to him did a lean man lie in a sleep like death on a bed in a dark chamber she would not even hint of that secret vision what dreams have you been having i dreamed of you well so people do dream of those they know yes but this was before once before i ever saw you that first day out riding on the road near valenda perhaps were you ever in cardegoss as a child or elsewhere when ias and i made a progress your father or someone might have put you on his shoulder to see the royas procession he shook his head was ser dy ferrej with you then did you wear lilac and black ride a horse led by a groom down a country road were you forty sad and pale i think not royina he looked away briefly the ferrets demon knew you too what did it see that i did not i have no idea did you ask it before you dispatched it he grimaced and shook his head i did not know enough to ask then the next dreams came later more strongly what dreams learned it was almost a whisper i dreamed of that dinner in the castle in valenda of us out on the road with almost this company sometimes liss and ferda and foix were there sometimes others he looked down looked up confessed the temple in valenda never sent me to be your conductor they only sent me up to convey learned tovias apologies and to say that she would call on you as soon as she returned i stole your pilgrimage royina i thought the god was telling me to she opened her mouth to do no more than breathe out she made her voice very neutral letting her hands grasp the sapling she leaned against behind her back to still their trembling say on i prayed i drew us to casilchas so that i might consult my superiors you spoke to me the dreams ceased my superiors suggested i bestir myself to really be your spiritual conductor since i had gone so far already and lady i have tried she opened a hand to assuage his concern though she was not sure he could see it in the failing light so his peculiar convictions about her spiritual gifts back in casilchas had come from a more direct source than old gossip through the sparse trees the firelight was starting up from two pits dug in the sandy stream bank in cheery defiance of the gathering night the fires looked small at the feet of these great hills the bastards teeth the range was called for in the high passes they bit travelers but then the dreams started up again a few nights past new ones or a new one three times a road much like this country much like this his white sleeve waved in the shadows i am overtaken by a column of men roknari soldiers quadrene heretics they pull me from my mule they he stopped abruptly not all prophetic dreams come true or come true as first seen said ista cautiously his distress was very real it seemed to her and very deep no they could not be he grew almost eager for they slew me in a different cruel way each night his voice slowed in doubt they always started with the thumbs though and she and liss had laughed at his winesickness drowning dreams was he that didnt work shed tried it herself long ago in iass court you should have told me this much earlier there cannot be roknari here now they would have to cross two provinces to reach this place the whole country would be aroused his voice seemed to be trying to push back the darkness with reason that dream must belong to some other later future you cannot push back the darkness with reason you have to use fire where had that thought come from or no future some dreams are but warnings heed them and their menace empties out his voice went very small in the darkness i fear i have failed the gods and this is to be my punishment no said ista coldly the gods are more ruthless than that if they use you up in their works they have no more interest in you than a painter in a crusted and broken brush to be cast aside and replaced she hesitated if they still lash and drive you you may be sure it means they still want something from you something they havent got yet oh he said no louder she gripped the tree she wanted to pace could they get off this road it was farther back to vinyasca now than it was to go forward could they strike down this streambed to the plains she imagined waterfalls thorn tangles sudden rock faces over which it was impossible either to ride or lead their mounts they would think her mad to insist upon such a wild course she shivered you are right about the roknari though she said single spies or small groups in disguise might penetrate this far south unseen but nothing strong enough to overcome our wellarmed company in any case even foix is not out of the muster true he allowed ista bit her lip looking around to be quite sure the young man had gone out of earshot back to the camp what about foix learned for a moment i sawit was as if i saw the bears spirit it was more riddled and decayed than its body writhing in an agony of putrefaction will foix his danger is real but not imminent dy cabons voice firmed on this surer ground and his whiteclad bulk straightened what he has gained by accident some sinful or shortsighted or desperate men actually seek by design to capture a demon and feed it slowly on themselves in exchange for its aidso men turn sorcerers for a time quite a long time some of them if they are clever or careful who ends up in charge then he cleared his throat almost always the demon eventually but with this young elemental foix would be master at first if he made the attempt i do not mean to discuss this with him or plant the suggestion and i beg you will be careful too royina the more intertwined they become the harder they will be to separate he added lowly but where are they coming from what rip in hell is leaking them back into the world in such sudden numbers my order is called to be guardians upon that march as surely as troops of the sons or the daughters orders ride out in the sun armed with swords and shields against more material evil the fifth gods servants walk singly in the darkness armed with our wits he heaved a disconsolate sigh i could wish for a better weapon just now sleep will sharpen all our wits we must hope said ista perhaps the morning will bring some better counsel i pray it may be so royina he walked her back through the brush to her bower ista forbore to wish him pleasant dreams or any dreams at all the anxious ferda roused everyone at dawn except his brother only when breakfast was ready to be served did he squat beside that bedroll and carefully touch the heavy sleeping form upon the shoulder liss passing by ista lugging a saddle paused and watched this worried tenderness and her lips pinched with distress they wasted little time eating breaking camp and taking again to the stony winding track the irregular hills discouraged speed but ferda led at a steady pace that ate the miles nonetheless the morning and the road slowly fell behind them the company was largely silent pushing along lost in whoknewwhat sober reflections ista could not decide which development she liked least foixs acquisition or dy cabons dreams foixs beardemon might be mischance if chance it was dy cabons dreams were plain warnings perhaps deceptive to heed but perilous to ignore the concatenation of the uncanny beginning to swirl about ista set her neck hairs standing and her teeth on edge she felt a disturbing sense of having stepped into a pattern not yet perceived yes we turn for home at maradi her silent decision brought no relief the tension remained like a cable strained to snapping like the breathless pressure that had shot her out the postern gate and down the road in court mourning and silk slippers that morning in valenda i must move i cannot be still where why the hill country here was even drier than farther south though the streams still ran full from the spring melt above the gnarled pines grew smaller and more scattered and long bony washes almost devoid of vegetation became more frequent when they topped a rise dy cabon glanced back over their track he pulled his mule up abruptly whats that ista twisted in her saddle just coming over the distant crest of the descending ridge behind them was a riderno riders foix called ferda you have the better eyes ferda wheeled his horse and squinted in the bright light the sun was growing hotter climbing toward noon men on horses his expression grew grim armedi see chain mailspears their armor is in the roknari style bastards demfive gods those are the tabards of the princedom of jokona i can see the white birds on the green even from here they still looked like green blurs to ista though she squinted too she said uneasily what are they doing here in this peaceful land are they merchants guards leading a caravan emissaries ferda stood in his stirrups craned his neck soldiers all soldiers he glanced around at his little company and touched his sword hilt well so are we ah ferda said foix after a moment theyre still coming ista could see his lips move as he kept count rank on rank riding two or three abreast the interlopers poured over the lip of the hill istas own count had passed thirty when dy cabon whose face had gone the color of lard signed himself and looked across at her he had to cough before he could form words they seemed to catch on his dry lips royina i do not think we want to meet these men i am certain of it learned her heart was starting to pound the columns leaders had seen them too men pointed and yelled ferda dropped his arm and shouted back over his company ride on he led the way down the track at a brisk canter the baggage mules resisted being towed at this speed and slowed the men who had them in charge dy cabons more willing mule did better at first but it grunted with each stride at the jouncing weight it bore so did dy cabon when they reached the top of the next rise half a mile on they could see that the jokonan column had dispatched a squad of a double dozen riders out ahead galloping with the clear intent of overtaking istas party now it was a race and they were not fitted for it the baggage mules might be abandoned but what of the divines beast its nostrils were round and red its white hair was already starting to lather at its neck and shoulder and between its hind legs and despite dy cabons kicks and shouts it kept breaking from a canter into a bonejarring fast trot it shook dy cabon like a pudding his face went from scarlet to pale green and back again he looked close to vomiting from the exertion and terror if this was the raiding column it appearedand how in five gods names had it appeared from the south of them so unheraldedista might cry ransom for herself and the daughters men but a divine of the fifth god would be treated as heretic and defiledthey would indeed start by cutting off dy cabons thumbs and then his tongue and then his genitals after that depending on their time and ingenuity whatever ghastly death the quadrene soldiers could devise or urge each other on tohanging impalement something even worse three nights hed dreamed of this dy cabon had said each different ista wondered what death could possibly be more grotesque than impalement the country offered poor cover the trees were small and even if any overhung the road she wasnt sure they could boost the wheezing divine up one his white robes dirty as they were would shine like a beacon through the leaves theyd show up for half a mile through the scrub as would his mule but then they topped another rise temporarily out of sight of their pursuers and at the bottom of this wash she lashed her horse forward beside ferdas and shouted the divinehe must not be taken he looked back over his company and signed agreement exchange horses he cried doubtfully not good enough she shouted back she pointed ahead hide him in the culvert she slowed her horse letting the others pass her till dy cabons mule labored up foix and liss reined back with her dy cabon she cried did you ever dream about being pulled out of a culvert no lady he quavered back between jounces hide you in that one then till they all pass over you foixfoix was in hideous danger if taken too if the quadrenes should learn of his demon affliction they might well take him for a sorcerer and burn him alive did you dream of foix with you no foix can you stay with himhelp him keep both your heads down and dont come out no matter what foix glanced down the track at the cover she pointed to and seemed to understand the plan at once aye royina they scraped to a halt over the culvert the streamlet here did not fill it full though it would be a cramped wet uncomfortable crouch especially for dy cabons quivering bulk foix swung down threw his reins to pejar and caught the gasping divine as he half fell from his animal wrap this around you hide those white robes foix tossed his gray cloak around dy cabon hustling him off the road another guard began grimly towing dy cabons mule relieved of its great burden it broke again into a canter a canter wasnt going to be enough ista thought look after each other she cried in desperation the pair was already scrambling into the low mouth of the culvert and she could not tell if they heard her or not they started forward once again there was another here who must not be taken by the rough soldiery she thought liss she called the girl rode nearer istas horse was dark with sweat blowing lisss tall bay still cantered easily ride ahead royina i wont leave you fool girl listen ride ahead and carry warning to anyone you pass jokonan raiders are coming raise the countryside get help and send it back understanding dawned in her face aye royina ride like the wind dont look back liss face set saluted her and bent over her horses neck its stride lengthened the three or four galloping miles theyd covered so far were clearly but a warmup for it in moments the bay outpaced every horse in the party and started to draw ahead yes fly girl you dont even have to outride the jokonans as long as you can outride us as they topped the next rise where the road swung out around a bulge in the hill ista looked back there was no sign whatever of the divine or foix the first jokonan riders were galloping across the culvert without pausing or looking down intent on their quarry ahead the tightness in istas chest eased a little even as she gasped for breath at last her whirling brain began to take thought for herself if captured should she maintain her incognito what worth would a minor female cousin of the rich provincar of baocia seem to them would sera dy ajelos status be enough to buy safety for her men as well as her but the dowager royina of chalion royina iselles own mother was far too exciting a prize to let fall into the grubby hands of a pack of jokonan soldierbandits she glanced around at her grimly intent outriders i dont want these loyal young men to die for me i dont want any man to die for me ever again ferda galloped up beside her horse pointed back royina we must cut loose the mules she nodded understanding gulped for breath her legs ached from gripping the heaving sides of her mount dy cabons saddlebags they must be got rid ofhiddenall his books and papers will reveal him they might go back and search and mine as well i have letters in my own name his lips drew back in a grimace of understanding he stood in his stirrups and fell behind she turned in her saddle and scrabbled at the rawhide ties holding her bags behind her cantle happily liss had tied them intelligently the strong knots came loose at istas pull ferda again galloped up beside her now he had the divines heavy pair of bags over his pommel she glanced back the loosed baggage mules and dy cabons white beast were falling behind stumbling to a halt wandering gratefully from the road they were approaching a bridge over a strong freshet ferda held out his arm in demand and she swung her bags over to him he reared his horse atop the bridge and violently heaved first one set of bags then the other over the crumbling stone balustrade to the downstream side the bags floated away bumping on the rocks sinking slowly out of sight ista briefly regretted the divines books and their purses of moneybut not their damning correspondence and other signs of identity this prudence cost them still more of the implacably closing space between them and the jokonan leaders ista put her weight in her stirrups and concentrated on urging her flagging horse up the next rise perhaps turning aside to capture the baggage mules would slow their pursuers some of them the enemy had plenty of men to spare it seemed she had glimpsed the beginnings of their column she had yet to glimpse its end what they were seemed plain enough both sides had played these evil games of raid and reprisal across the borders here for generations the boundaries that the chalionese quintarians were slowly pushing back to the north in the disputed regions men grew up expecting to raid for a living as though it were some job of work sometimes the game was played by elaborate rules of etiquette with businesslike arrangements for ransoms mixed with bizarre contests of honor sometimes there were no rules and it was no game and honor dissolved in sweaty screaming bloody horrors how desperate were their pursuers they seemed to have dropped from the very sky they were a province and a half away from the borders of jokona hustling down an obscure hill road fresh troops circling to attack some target or worn ones running for home if they wore the princes tabards they at least were not a spontaneous gang of semibandit younger sons and ruffians out for what they could grab but men of greater discipline bent on some larger mission presumably atop the next rise her horse stumbling ista again gained a long view of the road ahead lisss rangy bay was well out in the distance still galloping istas heart caught plunging down the scrubby hillside toward liss pelted another dozen jokonan riders a scouting screen of cavalry sent before the main force clearly istas eye tried to guess angles distances speeds the jokonans descended as if to pluck liss from the road as a hawk snatches a squirrel from a tree branch liss had not seen them yet could not possibly hear ista if she screamed out a warning ferda rose in his stirrups a look of helpless horror on his face he whipped his mount but could beat no more speed out of the strained animal closer closer the raiders drewliss looked aside at last saw them surely even her greathearted horse must be reaching the lim its of its endurance she flashed past the leaders a crossbow glinted a quarrel sped through the air ferda yelled in anguish but the shot loosed at too great a range and from the back of a heaving horse went wide the patrol reached the road their officer gesticulated a pair of riders split off and rode in pursuit of liss the rest wheeled around and bunched to a halt across the road waiting ferda cursed looked back looked forward teeth gritting he threw back his cloak and touched his sword hilt he cast a worried look aside at ista obviously trying to think how to screen her if his dwindling company attempted to burst through the new blockade ista followed his glance back more and more riders were pouring over the ridge behind them seemingly without end once blood was drawn events would spin rapidly out of control death would cry for death ferda ista screamed it came out a croak there is no way we must halt surrender on terms no royina his face bunched in agony by my oath and honor no we will die to defend you you will better defend me alive with your wits and selfcontrol ferda except theyd left the best wits and selfcontrol in the party back along the road in a culvert she drew a long breath pinned a moral fear vaster than her physical terror by its neck to the ground pushed the words past her lips by my command we must halt ferda clenched his jaw but really it was hardly a decision anymore the main body of jokonans was almost on their heels squeezing them up against the line across the road ista could see half a dozen crossbows raised among the waiting riders from steadier platforms this time ferda flung up his hand we halt the spent horses of his company stumbled to a ragged stop men threw back cloaks reached for weapons do not draw ferda roared some cried aloud in dismay and protest some were redfaced with tears of frustration and hot strain but they obeyed they knew how the game was played too as well as ista and knew as well as she how it was violated the jokonans swords out and spears and bows at the ready crowded up on both sides of them and slowly closed in chapter seven ista stood in her stirrups wrapped her dry tongue around her rusty roknari i cry ransom and in ibran i am the sera dy ajelo and the provincar of baocia is my patron i pledge his ransom upon myself and upon all these men of mine all of them and repeated in roknari to be sure ransoms for all an officer rode forward from his men he was marked by a better grade of chain mail fine decorations in pressed gold leaf on the leather of bridle saddle and scabbard and a green silk baldric worked in goldandwhite thread with the flying pelicans of jokona his typical crinkled roknari bronzeblond hair was done up in crisscrossing rows of braids ending in a queue his eyes summed the chalionese numbers perhaps took in the garb and badges of the daughters order with a slight tinge of respect ista who had silently repudiated her prayers in her mind during all the weeks of her pilgrimage though shed moved her lips by rote in the responses prayed now in her hammering heart lady in this your season of strength cast a cloak of protection over these your loyal servants in passable ibran the officer cried throw down your weapons one last anguished hesitation then ferda shrugged back his vestcloak and pulled his baldric off over his head his scabbard and sword struck the dirt with a clank his belt knife succeeded them the men of his company followed suit with equal reluctance half a dozen crossbows and the pair of spears were lowered more carefully on the growing heap their lathered blowing horses stood quiescent as ferda and his men were made to dismount and sit on the ground a little way off surrounded by jokonans with drawn swords and cocked bows a soldier seized the bridle of istas horse and made motions to her to get down her legs almost gave way as her boots hit the ground her knees felt like custard she jerked back from his raised hand though she realized almost at once that hed only meant to grab her elbow to keep her from falling the officer approached and gave her a demisalute possibly meant to be reassuring chalionese noblewoman it was half a question her plain dress did not quite support her claimed status his eyes searched for and did not find jewelry rings brooches what are you doing here i have every right to be here ista lifted her chin you have interrupted my pilgrimage quintarian devilworshipper he spat ritually but to the side what do you pray for eh woman ista raised one brow peace she added and you will address me as sera he snorted but seemed convinced or at least grew less curious half a dozen men were starting to poke in the saddlebags with a spate of roknari too fast for ista to follow he strode among them and shoved them back she saw why as the rest of the column draggled up and a couple of men carrying the green pouches of royal clerks rode hastily forward followed by what were obviously the senior officers now the bags were all pulled off and looted in a much more systematic fashion with a running inventory the clerks were there to make sure that the prince of jokonas onefifth share was properly counted one of them walked about stylus busy upon his tablet noting the horses and their gear no question but that this was an official expedition of some kind and not some spontaneous banditry the officer reported to his seniors ista heard the word baocia twice one of the men rummaging through the saddlebags straightened up with a glad cry ista thought he might have found a purse but instead he waved ferdas maps he rushed over to his officers crying in roknari look my lords look charts of chalion now we are not lost ista blinked then she began to look around more carefully the mounts of the men whod overtaken them were every bit as lathered and exhausted as their own and ista remembering lisss remarks about horses flagging late in the race wondered if her party might not have out ridden them after all but for being trapped by the advance patrol the men looked hot worn filthy stubbled their fine roknari patternbraids were in disarray as if they had not been redone for days or even weeks the men riding up late looked worse many were bandaged or bruised or scabbed and most of them led extra horses with empty saddles sometimes three or four in a string not booty for most of the animals were decked in roknaristyle gear some might be remounts not all the baggage train that limped up behind them all was strangely scant if the baggage train marked the end of their company and there was no sign of foix or dy cabon among the prisoners ista permitted herself a shiver of hope even if the clerks counting horses counted men as well and noted the two empty saddles by the time they circled back to search foix would surely have moved the divine and himself to better cover if foix was as quietly sly on his feet as he was with his tongueif the beardemon had not put his mind in too much disarrayif the jokonans had not simply slain them and left their bodies by the roadside one thing was certain these jokonans were not men moving to some secret attack they were fleeing a defeat by every sign or some dreadfully costly victory running north for home she was glad for chalion but increasingly anxious for herself and ferda and his men tense exhausted strained men on the ragged edge of their endurance made worrisome captors the officer came back and directed her to sit by the roadside in the mottled shadow of a small bent tree some odd northern species with wide palmate leaves foixs bags yielded a purse of gold that cheered the princes clerks and the officers eyed her with a shade more respect or at least calculation they pulled apart the baggage from the captured mules as well ista turned her face away and declined to notice the soldiers raucously playing about with her clothing the officer inquired more closely into her relationship with the provincar of baocia and ista trotted out sera dy ajelos imaginary family tree he seemed anxious to ascertain that the wealthy provincar would actually deliver a ransom for her oh yes said ista distantly he will come in person i expect with ten thousand swordsmen at his back five thousand archers and the marshal dy palliars cavalry as well it occurred to her that if she did not want men to die for her shed gone about it in exactly the wrong way but no there might yet be chances to escape or be traded out at a tiny fraction of her real worth if her incognito held liss had liss made it away no soldiers had yet returned along the track dragging her resisting behind them nor as a limp corpse tossed over a saddle the officers argued over the maps while the men and animals rested in what shade could be found and the flies buzzed around them the ibranspeaking officer brought her water in a rather noisome skin bag and she hesitated licked dusty cracked lips and drank it was fairly fresh at least she indicated he should take it to ferda and his troop and he did at length she was put back up on her own horse with her hands lashed to the pommel the horse in turn roped with several others following the baggage train ferdas men were towed in a like line but farther forward surrounded by more armed soldiers the advance scouts were redeployed and the column started north once more ista stared around at her fellow prisoners tied to horses as she was they were oddly few in number some dozen debilitated men and women and no children at all another older woman rode near her jerked along in another string of tired horses her clothes though filthy were finely made and elaborately decoratedclearly no common woman but someone whose family might offer a rich ransom ista leaned toward her where do these soldiers come from besides jokona some roknari hell i think said the woman no that would be their destination murmured ista back a sour smile lifted one corner of the womans mouth good she was not shocked stupid then or at least not anymore i do pray so hourly they took me in the town of rauma in ibra ibra ista glanced leftward at the mountain range rising in the distance they must have scrambled out of ibra over some littleused pass and dropped down into chalion to cut north for home and the pursuit must have been fiery to drive them to such a desperate ploy no wonder they seemed to have fallen from the sky where in chalion are we the province of tolnoxo these raiders still have over a hundred miles to go to safety across the rest of tolnoxo and all of caribastos before they reach the border of jokona if they can she hesitated i have hopes that they have lost their secrecy i think some of my party escaped the womans eyes flared hot briefly good she added after a little they fell upon rauma at dawn by surprise it was well planned they must have swung wide around some dozen betterprepared towns closer to the border i had brought my daughters into town to make offerings at the daughters altar for my eldest waspray the goddess still isto be married the jokonans were more interested in booty than rapine and destruction at first they left the rest of the temple alone though they held all theyd caught there at swords point but then they delayed their withdrawal to pull down the bastards tower and to torment the poor divine who had it in her charge the woman grimaced they caught her still in her white robes there was no chance to hide her they slew her husband when he tried to defend her for a woman devoted to the fifth god the quadrenes would also start with the thumbs and tongue then rape most likely prolonged and vicious they burned her in her gods tower in the end the woman sighed it seemed almost a mercy by then but their blasphemy cost them all theyd gained for the march of raumas troops came upon them while they were still in the town the son give him strength for his sword arm he had no mercy upon them for the divine had been his half sister he had got her the benefice i suppose to keep her in comfort ista hissed sympathy through her teeth my daughters escaped in the chaos i think perhaps the mother heard my prayers for in my terror i did offer myself in exchange for them but i was thrown upon a horse and carried off by these raiders who broke and retreated for they could guess by my clothes and jewels i would profit them she bore no jewels now naturally their greed bought me some consideration although they used my maid hideously i think she is still alive though they abandoned all their lesser prisoners in the wilderness because they were slowing them on the climb if they all stayed together and did not panic they may have helped each other to rescue by now i hope i hope they carried the wounded ista nodded understanding she wondered what prince sordso of jokona could possibly be about permittingno dispatchingthis raid it seemed more a probe than the first wave of an invasion perhaps it had been intended merely to stir up north ibra tie down the old royas troops in a broad defense and so prevent them from being sent in support of chalion in the autumn campaign against visping if so the strategy had been a little too swiftly successful although these men might have been an intentional sacrifice without even knowing it the nottoobadly wounded also rode with the baggage train the severely wounded ista supposed had been left along the route to the dubious mercy of the columns recent victims one man caught istas eye he was an older officer very senior judging by his clothing and gear he bore no bandage or visible wound but he rode along tied to his saddle like a prisoner slackfaced and moaning his braids tumbled down his mumbled words were not intelligible even in roknari ista judged had he suffered a blow to the head perhaps his drooling disturbed her and his noises set her teeth on edge she was secretly relieved when the baggage train shuffled its order and he was led farther from her a few miles up the road they came upon the men whod been sent in pursuit of liss both riding one stumbling horse leading the second one lamed they were greeted with inventive roknari cursing and cuffs from their furious commander both ruined horses were turned loose and replaced with two of the many spares ista concealed a grim smile more consulting of ferdas maps followed and more scouts were dispatched the column lumbered on an hour later they came to the hamlet where istas party had planned to turn east and take the road to maradi it was wholly abandoned not a person to be found nor any animal but a few stray chickens cats and rabbits liss made it this far it seems ista thought with satisfaction the jokonans ransacked it quickly taking what food and fodder they could find argued about setting it afire made more debate over the maps and finally hastened north on the dwindling continuation of their road prudence and discipline still held if tenuously for they left the hamlet standing behind them with no rising column of black smoke visible for miles to mark their passing the sun fell behind the mountains dusk was thickening when the column turned off the easier but dangerously open road and began scrambling up what would in any other season have been a dry wash a stream gurgled down the middle of it now after a couple of miles they turned to the north again making their way through brush to an area denser with trees and cover ista wondered how futile an attempt at concealment it would prove theyd left enough hoof marks broken vegetation and dung in their wake that even she could have tracked them the jokonans made camp in a shaded dell lighting only a few fires and those just long enough to sear their stolen chickens but they had to give their horses time to eat their looted fodder and grain and regain strength the halfdozen women prisoners were put together given bedrolls no worse than the jokonans themselves usedprobably the same their food was also no worse than what their captors ate in any case it did not seem to be grilled cat ista wondered if she was sleeping in a dead mans bedding and what dreams it would bring her something useful would be a nice change it wasnt quite a prayer but no prophetic dreams and few of the usual kind came to her as she tossed dozing badly and waking with a start at odd noises or when one of the other women started sobbing in her blankets inadequately muffled one of the injured jokonans died in the night apparently from a fever brought on by his wounds his burial in the dawn was hasty and lacking in ceremony but the brother in his mercy took up his soul nonetheless ista thought or at least she felt no distraught ghost as she passed the sad shallow scraping in the soil her son teidez had died of an infected wound she watched for a moment when no jokonan eyes were on her and covertly made the quadrene sign of blessing toward the gravesite for whatever comfort it might bring to a dead boy lost in a foreign land the column did not return to the road but pushed on north through the hilly wilderness necessarily they went more slowly and she could feel her captors growing more tense with every passing hour the mountains to their left dwindled at some point toward evening they crossed the unmarked boundary into the province of caribastos the wilderness grew patchy forcing detours that swung wide and secretly around walled towns and villages streams grew fewer the jokonans stopped early to camp by such a brook and to rest their horses as a chalionese border province with the five princedoms caribastos was better armed its fortresses in better repair and its people more alert for the endemic warfare the jokonan column would likely try to cross it under the cover of darkness three more marches ista estimated the valuable captive women were again set aside under the trees brought food left alone until the ibranspeaking officer flanked by two of his seniors approached them in the level light of sunset he had some papers in his hand and an intent disturbed expression on his face he stopped before ista sitting on a log with her back to a tree she kept silence making him speak first greetings sera he gave the title an odd emphasis in his mouth without another word he handed her the papers it was a letter halffinished rumpled from a sojourn in a saddlebag the handwriting was foixs strong and square istas heart sank even before she read the salutation it was addressed to chancellor dy cazaril in cardegoss after a respectful and unmistakable listing of the great courtiers offices and ranks it began my dearest lord i continue my report as i may we have left casilchas behind and come at length to vinyasca there is to be a festival here tomorrow i was glad to be shut of casilchas learned dy cabon has no notion of proper secrecy or even discretion by the time he was done blundering about half the town knew full well that sera dy alejo was the dowager royina and came to court her which i think did not please her much upon further observation i am coming to agree with you royina ista is not mad in any usual sense though there are times when she makes me feel very strange and foolish as though she sees or senses or knows things i do not she still spends long periods in silence somewhere far off in her sad thoughts i do not know why i ever thought women chattered it would be some relief if she would talk more as for whether her pilgrimage is the result of some goddriven impulse as you feared after your long prayers in cardegoss i still cannot tell but then i rode beside towering miracles with you for weeks and never knew so that shows nothing the daughters festival should be a welcome diversion from my worries i will continue this tomorrow the next days date followed and the neat writing recommenced the festival went wellthere followed two paragraphs of droll description dy cabon has gone off to get very drunk he says it is to blot out bad dreams though i think it is more likely to induce them ferda is not best pleased with him but the divine has had closer to do with royina ista than any of us so perhaps he needs it at first i thought him a fat nervous idiot as i wrote you before but now i begin to wonder if the idiot may not be me i will write more on this head at our next stop which is to be some dire hamlet in the hills where some saint came from id be from there too if i had the choice i should be able to dispatch this letter securely from the daughters house in maradi if we turn that way i will try to suggest it i do not think we should venture any farther north and i have run out of things to read the letter broke off there with half a page left to fill foix had evidently been too shaken to add a report on the bear before the jokonans had overtaken them next day ista looked up one jokonan darkhaired and younger was watching her with a delighted avaricious smile the older shorter one who wore a green baldric more heavily encrusted with gold and who she thought was the expeditions commander or at any rate surviving senior officer frowned more thoughtfully she read wider strategic considerations in his eyes far more disturbing than mere greed the ibranspeaking officer looked apprehensive she made one more effort to clutch her torn incognito to her futile as it seemed she held out the paper in an indifferent hand what is this to me her translator took it back indeed royina he favored her with a bow in the roknari court style right hand sweeping down before him thumb tucked in the palm one part irony one part wariness the commander said in roknari so this is royina iselles infamous mad mother truly it seems so my lord the largesse of the gods has fallen upon us said the darkhaired one in a voice that vibrated with excitement he made the quadrene fourpoint sign of blessing touching forehead navel groin and heart his thumb carefully folded inward in one lucky blow all of our pains are repaid and our fortunes are made i thought they kept her locked up in a castle how is it they were so careless as to let her out to wander about on the roads like this said the commander her guard could not have anticipated us here we did not anticipate us here the darkhaired one said the commander frowned at the letter though it was plain he could not read more than one word in three of it without the help of his officer this spy of their chancellor babbles too carelessly of the gods it is impious and it worries you good ista thought it was hard to think of foix as a spy although her estimate of his subtlety and wits rose another notch for hed not let fall the least hint of his mandate to report upon her it made perfect sense in retrospect of course if he had been writing to anyone in the world but lord dy cazaril it would have offended ista deeply but all of chalion was in the chancellors chargeand her own debt to the man was as boundless as the sea the commander cleared his throat and continued to ista in heavily accented ibran you think you are godtouched mad queen ista sitting very still allowed her lips to curve up just a trifle enigmatic if you were godtouched you would not have to ask you would know the answer he jerked back eyes narrowing blasphemous quintarian she gave him her best impassive stare inquire of your god i promise you shall meet him soon his mark is on your brow and his arms are open to receive you the darkhaired one made a noise of inquiry the ibranspeaking officer translated her cool remark an arrow shot at random from istas point of view although it hardly needed communion with the gods to make that prophecy given the jokonan raiders precarious situation the commanders lips thinned still more but he made no further attempt to cross words with her he at least seemed to grasp how much more perilous his retreat had grown due to her presence here as a prisoner lisss escape had been a greater disaster than hed first guessed the women were moved up beside the commanders campsite and two extra guards were assigned to watch themto watch ista she had no doubt this put paid to any dream of slipping away into the woods in darkness in some moment of confusion or inattention the evening continued unsettled a jokonan soldier was dragged in and whipped for some infractionattempted desertion most likely the senior officers sat close together and debatedsometimes breaking into angry oaths too loud then quickly muffledabout whether to hold the column together for mutual defense or break up into small groups and finish the flight to jokona in better secrecy it wouldnt be long before some no longer waited for orders to break and run ista had spent part of the long ride earlier distracting her mind by counting the jokonan numbersthe sum had come to some ninetytwo men it would be interesting to count again when the light returned tomorrow the fewer their company the less defense staying together would become how long before the column was forced into splitting by default the jokonan commander had every reason internal and external to push on as quickly as possible and ista was not surprised when she was wakened at midnight and lashed to a horse again this time however she was moved up from the baggage train and put in hand of the ibranspeaking officer himself two other riders flanked them closely the column moved off in the darkness stumbling and cursing she had at first expected provincial troops from tolnoxo to come pelting up behind them on their toovisible trail but they had certainly crossed out of that district many miles back with every passing hour the odds shifted not attack from behind but ambush from the front grew likelier now it made a certain tactical senselet the jokonans expend their energy transporting themselves to a battlefield picked by their enemies and yet was it possible that liss had still maintained istas incognito only telling the authorities that a minor noblewoman on pilgrimage had been snapped up by these unwelcome transients ista could picture the provincar of tolnoxo holding back just long enough to let the fleeing jokonans become the problem of the provincar of caribastos dy cabon and foix would not have permitted any such laggard approach thoughhad they made it to safety were they still lost in the hills overcome or diverted by foixs demon elemental grown abruptly stronger in power wit and will as it feasted on that sharp mind led on by who knew what reports from their scouts the jokonans left the thin woods and took to a dark road putting several miles behind them at a fast trot it was close to dawn when they turned in to a halffilled riverbed the horses hooves crunching loudly through the gravel and sand if men had to speak they rode close and leaned toward each other ista licked dry lips stretching her aching back as much as she could with her hands tied in front of her she had been left a length of cord between her lashedtogether wrists and the saddle ring to which the rope was knotted and if she lifted her hands and bent she could just scratch her nose it had been too long since shed been permitted to drink or eat or piss and the insides of her knees were rubbed raw and what if the column evaded ambush altogether slipping over the border to jokona after all no question but that she would be handed over to prince sordso taken to his palace put up in comfort nay luxury with attendants many watchful attendants had she escaped one castle only to end up prisoner in anotherand worse made into a political lever against the few people she loved blackness gave way to grayness shadows to shapes to forms tinged with color as the starry sky paled in the predawn a low mist hung on the water and curled up over the flat banks and the horses stirred it like milk as they passed a little cliff carved out by the riverlet rose on their left the reddish colors of its layers just beginning to glow a rock plunked into the dark water that slid along at the cliffs feet her flanking guard snapped his head around at the sudden noise a thwacka crossbow bolt bloomed in his chest he barely cried out as he fell into the gravel a moment later she felt the shock of his death like a lightning strike across her senses dizzying her her horse was jerked abruptly into a trot into a canter all around her men began to cry out yell orders curse answering shouts and more arrows rained down from above five gods let the attack be swift ferda and his men were in the greatest immediate peril as the jokonans might be inspired to slay their most dangerous prisoners at once before turning on the new enemy another death and another slashed across her inner senses like white fire even as her outer senses were thrown into a whirl of motion she jerked her sore wrists back and forth in frustration against her bindings but the knots had been tied tight and had failed to work loose even through the long night ride kicking her feet free of the stirrups and heaving off to one side in some mad effort to dismount would break her wrists before it broke their lashings then she would merely be dragged a thundering of hooves shouts and screams rose from the front of the column some bellowing cavalry charge down the river valley met the jokonan van in a shock and clash of metal horses squealed and grunted and fell more shouts came from the rear the officer towing her yanked his reins up so sharply his horse reared he stared around in panic the commander galloped toward him out of the melee sword out shouting in roknari motioning some others to follow they swept up ista and her captor and broke to the side scrambling over the low bank there the leading swordsmen cut their way through some crossbowmen in unfamiliar gray tabards who were running toward the fight the halfdozen jokonans and ista burst past more riders and galloped wildly into the scrublands bordering the rivers trees istas head was pounding her vision blurred alternately darkened and whited out with the stunning impacts of the deaths so many souls in one place and moment violently uprooted from their bodies she dared not pass out and fallat this speed her hands might well be torn off all she could think was how unfair it had been to that poor soldier whod been whipped last night when his very commanders didnt hesitate to desert him she could see nothing but her horses neck stretched before her its ears laid back and the hard ground whipping by below her foolish frightened horse didnt even have to be pulled but raced the animal beside it until it threatened to become the leader and her captor the follower their course bent away to the right in a wide curve they slowed at last as they passed into a more rugged area low hillocks clad in scattered woods at last hiding them from the view of any pursuit was there any pursuit the commander finally took time to sheathe his sword he had not blooded it ista noted he led the way into the wilderness dodging and turning among the rocks and trees ista suspected he had no thought of choosing a route beyond confusing trackers and would shortly be confused himself again well he could probably find north and with so few followers to hide perhaps that was all he needed to know the woodlands thickened they climbed a rise descended a ravine ista tried to estimate how many miles theyd come from the point of attack five or six at least she considered her own danger as the horses picked their way slowly among the stones of the rivulet and she caught her breath again it was scarcely worse than before she did not fear rape or malicious torture though she would doubtless share whatever hardships the jokonans did in their hasty flight these officers had lost everythingtheir men their equipment their booty their honor even their way but if only they could present ista to him the prince of jokona would forgive their every disaster she was their hope of redemption they would not let her go for money or threat nor surrender her for life itself so death by design did not await her at their hands no but death by misadventure or overwrought bad judgment oh yes very possible it hardly seemed an improvement they wound down the ravine for over a mile it deepened and the sides grew steeper wooded and overhung but in the distance she could see a hazy paleness they rounded a turn to discover the ravine opening suddenly out onto a flat bright little river framed by the sides blocking the outlet stood a lone horseman istas breath caught in a chill or was that a thrill the horses charcoalgray sides were heaving and wet its nostrils round and red but it pawed the ground and shifted nervously its muscles bunching in readiness the man did not seem out of breath at all his dark reddish hair was unbraided cut short in the chalionese style and curled around his ears in tangled strands a shorttrimmed beard covered his jaw he wore chain mail heavy leather vambraces a gray tabard worked with gold over all the tabard was splashed with blood his eyes flicked as he counted up the odds narrowed glittered he swung his sword wide in salute the hand that tightened on the hilt was filthy and bloodcrusted for just a moment the most thoroughly fey smile ista had ever seen on a mans face glinted more brightly than the steel he clapped his heels to his horses sides and charged forward chapter eight in the face of this thundering conviction the exhausted jokonans hesitated a moment too long the attacking horseman passed between the first two before they had their own swords half drawn and left them both reeling from bloody slashes even as he bore down on the man towing ista the man cried out and dodged scrabbling for his weapon with a deep hiss and hum the horsemans heavy blade parted the taut lead line istas freed horse shied back the gray horse reared beside her the blade swung up was somehow transferred to a left hand no less capable than the right flashed around edge upward and snaked between istas hands and the saddle to which they were tied she scarcely had time to clench her fingers back out of the way before the razorhoned blade yanked up again parting her bindings and whipped past her face the horseman shot her a grin over his shoulder as sharp edged as his blade yelled and spurred his steed onward with a fierce gasp of satisfaction ista untangled her wrists from the hated cords and began to lean forward and grab for her reins her captor in turn wheeled his horse around barging into hers and nearly unseating her and beat her to the snatch he dragged the reins over her horses head get away get away she shrieked beating at his clutching arm with his own reins and his sword held awkwardly in his off hand he was unbalanced leaning far out in a moment of terrified inspiration she suddenly grabbed his sleeve instead braced in her stirrups and yanked as hard as she could the startled jokonan officer toppled out of his saddle and down to smack onto the stones of the rivulet she hoped her horse stepped on him as it danced aside but she couldnt be sure the smooth wet stones were coated with green algae slippery underfoot her mount heaved and jerked as it stumbled her reins now trailed in danger of being trampled under her horses front hooves she leaned past her pommel grabbed missed grabbed caught them let the dirty leather slide through her dirty fingers and came upright and in control of her own movement for the first time in days swords were clanging and scraping she looked around wildly one of the trailing soldiers was trying to beat their attacker back toward the others while the second rider maneuvered for position to strike at the swordless side the commander urged his horse closer to the melee but his left hand clumsily clutching his sword was clapped over his right arm blood welled between his fingers and ran down his sleeve making his reins slippery in his grasp another jokonan soldier who had been riding on the far side of the forward trio and so escaped the first onslaught had managed to get his crossbow unshipped from his saddle ties and was frantically winding it while his horse sidled and snorted a quarrel was clutched in his teeth he spat the lethal bolt into his hand slapped it into position and began to raise his bow for aim the target was moving but the range was very short ista bore no weapon she aimed her horse beating its sides with her spurless heels and drove it into an unwilling trot across the rivulet it bounded over the water and landed in a canter of sorts she yanked its head around and forced it to carom into the crossbowmans steed he cursed as the string twanged and his shot flew wide he swung the heavy crossbow backhanded at her head but missed as she ducked away the commander screamed in roknari over his shoulder at the crossbowman take the woman get her to prince sordso the gray horseman leaving both rear guardsmen unhorsed and bleeding pounded forward guiding his horse with his knees rising in his stirrups readying a powerful twohanded swing the luckless commanders last order was cut off abruptly together with his head ista had a flashing view of falling body spurting blood shying horse the glaring fire of an anguished soul ripped from its anchorage and the dizzied thought now do you believe my prophecies and even more dizzied do i gleaming sword and gray horse both swung around without pause to charge the crossbowman now frenziedly winding again the sword passed from right to left hand once more and its point dropped like a lance the momentum of horse and swordsman was monstrous and perfectly aligned the swords point smashed into the bowmans chest and pierced his chain mail unseating him and carrying him over his horses rump to pin his corpse to a tree behind him his buffeted horse fell and scrambled up flanks heaving as it plunged off for a moment the heavy sword was ripped from its deadly masters hand but he spun his horse around immediately lunged for the hilt and yanked it free again the dead jokonan slumped to the ground his blood watering the trees roots ista nearly fainted at the white whirl of screaming distraught souls swirling around her she clutched her pommel and forced herself to stay upright open eyes denying the second sight the worst gore now spread before her eyes was less terrifying than these unwanted visions how many had died the commander the crossbowman neither of the two rear guardsmen were going to stir again either one horse and rider were gone their exit marked by a trail of blood at the ravines mouth the translatorofficer his sword abandoned in the greenandred muck was scrambling up on a loose horse he jerked it around and galloped downstream without looking back not even breathing heavily blood dripping from his swords lowered tip the gray horseman frowned after him for a moment then turned and looked in concern at ista he nudged his horse toward hers my lady are you all right im uninjured she gasped back the ghostly visions were fading like the lingering dazzlement in eyes that had stared too directly at the sun good his grin flashed again exhilaratedbattledrunk his wits were clearly unimpaired by fear but also by anything resembling good sense sensible men didnt charge six desperate enemy soldiers by themselves we saw you carried off he continued we split up to quarter the woods for you i thought you must come out this way his face turned as he checked the ravines rim for any sign of further threatening motion his eyes narrowed in satisfaction at finding none he wiped his sword clean upon his befouled tabard raised it in a brief salute to her and sheathed it with a satisfied click may i know what lady i have the honor and pleasure of addressing i ista hesitated i am the sera dy ajelo cousin to the provincar of baocia hm his brows drew down im porifors he glanced toward the ravines bright mouth i must find my men ista flexed her hands she hardly dared touch her darkly lacerated wrists crusted bleeding and abraded and i mine but i have been tied to this fool of a horse since midnight last night without rest or food or water which first seemed cruel but now seems kind if you would cap your mornings heroism do me the kindness of guarding this animal and my modesty while i find a bush she glanced doubtfully up the ravine or a rock or whatever although i doubt my horse has any more desire to go another step than i do ah he said in a tone of amused enlightenment but of course sera he swung lightly off his warhorse and reached for her reins his smile faded at the sight of her wrists she dismounted like a sack of grain falling strong hands caught her they left smudged red prints upon her tunic he held her upright a moment to be sure she had control of her feet his smile vanished altogether as he looked her up and down there is a deal of blood on your skirts she followed his glance the folds of her split skirt were mottled with patches of blood dried and fresh at the knees that last gallop had flayed her raw skin to shreds saddle sores trivial hurts for all that they are mine his brows rose what do you call severe then she staggered away past the beheaded commander that his head tilted conceding the point she tottered beyond the bodies and up the ravine a short way to find some rocks with bushes she returned to find him kneeling by the streamlet he smiled and offered her something on a leaf she squinted and recognized it after a bewildered moment as a slice of strong tallow soap oh she breathed it was all she could do not to burst into tears she fell to her knees and washed her hands beneath a chill freshet that spurted over the rocks then more carefully her hurt wrists she drank then from her cupped hands handful after dripping handful he laid a small linenwrapped packet on a flat stone and opened it to reveal a pile of clean rags cut for bandages from his saddlebag presumably the jokonans had used up all such preparations of their own sera i fear that i must ask you to ride some distance farther better you should clean and pad your knees first eh oh yes my thanks sir she sat on a rock removed her boots for the first time in recent memory and carefully rolled up one skirt leg peeling it away from the crusted sores where it had stuck and dried he hovered cleaned hands opening to help but closed them again as she stoically carried on the soap next painful but relieving and revealing the deep scarlet abrasions oozed yellow fluid those will be a week healing he remarked probably as a horse soldier he had no doubt treated saddle sores before and diagnosed with authority he watched a moment more as if to be sure she was going to be all right stretched his fingers and rubbed his face then rose and went to turn over the bodies his examination was methodical and not for looting for he barely glanced at the rings or pins or purses the corpses yielded any papers he happened upon however he examined and folded carefully away in his tunic this poriforsor dy porifors he had not said if it was first name or lastwas an officer no question and one with a steady head some military vassal of the provincar of caribastos or trained up like such a battle lord foixs letter it appeared had either been left with the deserted column or gone with one of the escapees can you tell me sera what were the other prisoners in the jokonan train few the gods be thanked six women from ibra and seven men that the jokonans judged valuable enough to drag over the mountains with them and twelve no eleven guardsmen of the daughters order who had undertaken to convey my pilgrimage captured by the jokonan column these two days back only two days i have good hope that one of my guardsmen and some others from my party escaped back in tolnoxo when we were first overtaken you were the only lady of chalion among those taken his brow wrinkled further she nodded shortly and tried to think of something useful to say to this intent officer these raiders rode under the seal of prince sordso for they had tally officers accounting the princes fifth they came up through ibra and pillaged the town of rauma there then escaped over the passes when the march of rauma followed hotly the one you beheaded over thereshe nodded toward the sad corpsewas the senior though i do not believe he was the original commander as of yesterday their numbers were about ninetytwo though some may have deserted in the night before they ran afoul of your ambush tolnoxo he dusted his hands rose from the last corpse and strolled over to examine her progress she was just tying strips around the pad on her second knee his meticulous courtesy somehow made her more not less conscious of the fact that she was alone with a strange man no wonder you are now less than thirty miles from the border of jokona that column covered nearly a hundred miles these past two days they were pushing they were afraid she glanced around the scene iridescent green flies were beginning to gather an ugly buzzing in the damp shade not afraid enough to stay home in the first place unfortunately his lips twisted in a sour smile perhaps next time their fear will have improved he scratched his beard it was not the reddish dark of his hair but lighter shot with gray your first battle sera of this sort yes she tied off the last strip and yanked the knot tight thank you for jostling the fellow with the crossbow a timely blow that hed noticed five gods shed thought him fully occupied you are most welcome you keep your wits about you i see i know she glanced up at his surprised snort she said unsteadily if you are too kind to me i shall start to weep and then we shall be undone he looked a little taken aback but then nodded cruel lady to forbid me to be kind so it shall be we must ride now to a safer place to lie up swiftly and with care for i think yours were not the only stragglers and survivors i hope we may meet with some of my own first he frowned around ill send them back to collect these and their horses she glanced at the silent scene the bodies lay sprawled none of the weary horses had wandered far the shrieking visions had faded altogethershe did not say thank the godsbut the ravine still seemed to reverberate with woe she couldnt wait to escape it he helped her to her feet she nodded gratefully with every minute of rest her body seemed to be seizing up much more and she wouldnt be able to walk or ride or mount his attempt to give her a leg up failed when she gasped with pain then he simply took her about the waist and lifted her she wasnt a tall woman but neither was she the willowwhip shed been at eighteen unfairthe man had to be as old as she was but his strength was clearly unimpaired by whatever years had grayed his beard of course patrolling these marches he would be in constant training he swung up on his own tall horse with easy grace ista thought the beautiful darkdappled animal must be of the same breed as lisss leggy bay leanmuscled and bred to speed and endurance he led the way to the riverbed and turned upstream she could see his own horses prints in the gravel and sand coming down but reassuringly no others after a few minutes ride the prints turned toor rather fromthe thin woods lining the river the two of them continued on beside the flowing water her tired horses steps were short and stiff only the presence of the other horse she thought kept it moving just like me she studied her rescuer in this better light like his horse and sword the rest of his gear was of the finest quality but forbore gaudy jeweled studs or metallic inlay not a poor officer then but serious about his business to survive twenty years on this frontier as his beard and the weathering of his face suggested he must have a man had to be paying close attention to what he was doing that face drew her eyes not a boys face fresh and fullblooded like ferdas or foixs nor an aging mans face sagging like dy ferrejs but a face in the full strength of its maturity perfectly balanced on the apogee of its life pale though for all his obvious vigor perhaps the past winter in caribastos had been unusually dreary a stunning first impression was not the same thing as love at first sight but surely it was an invitation to consider the matter what of her and love after all at eighteen she had been lifted up by lord dy lutez into the bright easy poisoned triumph of her high marriage to roya ias it had spiraled down into the long dark fog of her widowhood and the curse blighting mind and heart both the entire center of her life was a blackened waste its long years not to be recovered nor replaced shed had neither the life nor the learning from it that other women her age could be assumed to possess for all the relentless idealism surrounding virginity fidelity and celibacyfor womenista had known plenty of ladies of rank in iass court who had taken lovers openly or in secret she had only the vaguest idea how theyd gone about it such carryingson hadnt happened in the dowager provincaras minor court in valenda of course the old lady had held neither tolerance for the nonsense nor indeed kept any such nonsensical young persons about her with the sole exception of her embarrassing mad daughter ista in istas two trips to cardegoss since the destruction of the curse in the old provincaras train for iselles coronation and to visit little isara last autumn she had fairly waded through courtiers to be sure but it had seemed to her that shed read not desire but merely avarice in their eyes theyd wanted the royinas favors not istas love not that ista felt love ista felt nothing on the whole she decided the past three days of numb terror excepted perhaps yet even that fear had seemed to lie on the other side of some sheet of glass in her mind stillshe glanced sidewayshe was a striking man for an hour yet she might still be modest ista dy ajelo who could dream of love with a handsome officer when the ride was done the dream would be over you are very silent lady ista cleared her throat my wits were wandering i am stupid with fatigue i expect they had not reached safety yet but when they did she imagined she would fall like a tree you must have been up all night as well preparing that most splendid reception he smiled at that but said only i have little need of sleep these days ill take some rest at noon his eyes returning her study disturbed her with their concentration he looked as though she presented some deep quandary or puzzle to him she looked away discomfited and so was first to spot the object floating down the stream a body she nodded toward it is this the same river my jokonan column was riding down then yes it curves around here he forced his horse out into the rippling water belly deep leaned over and grabbed the corpse by the arm to drag it sloshing up on the sand it was not clad in daughters blue ista saw with relief just another illfated young soldier who would grow no older now the officer grimaced down at it lead scout it appears im tempted to leave him to ride the river as courier down to jokona but there will doubtless be others more voluble to carry the news there always are he can be collected with the rest he abandoned the sodden thing and clucked his horse onward their column had to turn this way to avoid both the stronghold of oby and the screen of castle porifors which was originally designed to look south not north after all better they should have split up and crept past us in twos and threes theyd have lost some that way but not all they were too tempted by the shortest route and the surest if they knew the river went to jokona they seemed to have trouble with their directions i dont think this line of retreat was in their original plan his eye glinted with satisfaction my b best advisor always said it must be so in such a case he was right as usual we camped upon this river last night therefore and took our ease while the jokonans delivered themselves to us well except for our scouts who wore out a few horses keeping contact is it much farther to your camp i think this poor horse is almost done her animal seemed to stumble every five steps it is my own and i dont wish to lame it worse yes we could almost have tracked these jokonans just by the ruined horses they abandoned in their wake he shook his head in soldierly censure his own elegant mount for all its hard use that morning appeared superbly cared for a slight smile flitted across his face let us by all means relieve your horse he shifted his horse up to her side dropped his reins on its withers reached across plucked her from her saddle and balanced her sideways upon his lap ista choked back an undignified yelp of protest he did not follow up this startling move with any attempt to steal a kiss or other shameless familiarity but merely reached around her to take up his reins with one hand and catch up her horses reins to tow it along with the other leaving her to wind her arms around him for security gingerly she did so his cool strength was almost shocking in this proximity he did not reek of dried sweat as she had expectedshe had no doubt she stank worse herself just now the congealing blood stiffening in dark patches on his gray tabard had little odor as yet for all that a chill of death seemed to hang about him she rested in the curve of his arm away from the dampest stains intensely conscious of the weight of her thighs across his she had not relaxed in the circle of a mans arms for for as long as she could remember and she did not do so now limp exhaustion was not the same thing as relaxation he dropped his face to the top of her head it seemed to her that he inhaled the scent of her hair she trembled slightly he murmured in a voice of concern now im only being kind to your horse mind you ista snorted softly and felt his bodys tension slacken a trifle at the reassurance of her half laugh it was wonderful to imagine letting go ones guard if only for a moment to pretend that safety was something another could give as a gift it could only be for a few more moments he would certainly not have blocked his sword arm with her in this way if they werent nearly within sight of his camp but presumably as long as she pretended so would he so she clung and let herself be rocked along her eyelids drooping hoofbeats on gravel a shout she knew it was friends before she even looked up for no new tautness flowed into his easy embrace your dream is done time to wake up she sighed my lord cried a horseman one of a trio in gray tabards she saw through her eyelashes trotting down the rivers side in the sunny midmorning the mailclad soldiers broke into a canter and pulled up around them in a laughing mob you have her the speaker continued i might have known her rescuers voice was amused and possibly a trifle smug i should think you might she considered the heroic picture they presented atop the dappled warhorse and what a fine show it made for this lords men it would be gossiped about tonight in his troop no doubt and so a commander maintained his mystiqueshe did not begrudge him the calculation if calculation it was if as a man he had also obtained some bonus of pleasure from this courtly cuddle of her exhausted self well she could not begrudge that either the men vented a spate of brief reports of prisoners taken of the area secured of wounded treated or transported to the nearest town in carts of bodies counted were not done rounding up all who fled then said their commander though i begin to doubt the accuracy of our alarms from my lord dy tolnoxo we seem to have only ninety jokonans to account for not two hundred as he claimed youll find five more dead ones downstream one that i pulled from the stream about three miles down i think must have fallen when we first struck their van four more near the mouth of a ravine a mile or so farther where i caught up with them attempting to make off with this lady take some men and collect them and their horses and gear and put them with the rest to be listed he tossed the reins of istas horse to one of the men see carefully to this beastit belongs to the sera here bring its gear to my tent ill be found there for a little have any who were involved in delivering the captives from the baggage train report to me at once ill ride to inspect the wounded and prisoners in the afternoon ista roused herself to ask the soldier there were some men of the daughters order taken prisoner by the jokonansare they safe yes i saw several such how many she asked urgently i dont know exactly my ladythere are some in the camp he jerked his head upstream you shall be reunited with them in a moment and have all their accounts of the mornings business her rescuer soothed her he exchanged salutes with his men and they all departed in their several new directions whose are these excellent soldiers asked ista mine happily he replied ah my apologies i failed to introduce myself fully in all my haste arhys dy lutez march of porifors at your service sera castle porifors guards all the sharp point of chalion between jokona and ibra and its men are the honed edge of that blade five gods be thanked a somewhat easier task now that ibra is made all peaceful in the royina iselles arms she froze in his gentle grip dy lutez she repeated aghast are you any relation to he stiffened in turn his cheerful amiability cooled but his suddenly studied voice remained light the great chancellor and traitor arvol dy lutez my father he was not either of dy lutezs two principal heirs sons of the chancellors first marriage who had trailed after him at court in istas time the famous courtiers three acknowledged bastards had all been girls disposed to high and lucrative marriages long ago dy lutez had been twice a widower by the time ista had first met him his second wife already a decade dead this arhys must be a son of that second wife then the one whom dy lutez in the prime of his manhood had abandoned at her country estates so that he might go haring off after ias at court or in the field unimpeded a northern heiress yes ista recalled that much his voice went a little harsh does it startle you that a traitors son serves chalion well not at all she turned her eyes up to trace the bones of his face so close to her view arhys must take something in his fine chin and straight nose from his mother but the appalling energy of the man was all dy lutez he was a great man you have something of the look of him his brows shot up he turned his head around to look at her in an entirely new way a muffled eager urgency she had not realized how masked he was until it slipped truly you once met him to look at what had not you not to remember my mother had a painting but it was bad he frowned i was almost old enough to be brought to court at cardegoss when he died i was old enough but perhaps it was better so the eagerness cloaked itself settled back to its secret lair his brief smile was faintly embarrassed a mature man of forty pretending not to care for the grief of a young man of twenty ista took back her belief in her own numbness for this inadvertent flash of selfrevelation wrenched like a knife in her stomach they rounded a bend in the river to discover its inward curve lapping a meadow edged with woods the grass was trampled and littered with the detritus of a camp halfstruck dead campfires and scattered gear at distant horse lines strung between trees a few men saddled up mounts or tied baggage to mules men packed men sat a few men slept on blankets or on the bare ground some officers tents sheltered beneath a grove on the meadows far side a dozen men rushed dy lutez as soon as he came in view cheering shouting greetings and questions pelting him with news and demanding orders a familiar figure in blue ran stiffly in their wake ah ah she is spared ferda dy gura cried joyously we are spared he looked as though he had been dragged backward through thorn scrub for about a mile dirty exhausted and pale with fatigue but hale no bandages no blood limping no worse than his own saddle soreness and a few bruises might account for istas heart melted with relief royina he cried thank the gods one and five praise the daughter of spring i was sure the jokonans had snatched you away at the last ive all who can still ride out with the march of poriforss men searching for you our company ferdawere any hurt ista struggled upright a hand upon the marchs arm as ferda pushed his way up to the dappled horses shoulder he ran a hand through his sweatstiff hair one was hit in the thigh by a quarrel from the marchs men bad luck one had his leg broken when his horse fell on him i set two to tend them while we wait for the physicians to get free of the worse hurt fellows the rest are as well as might be me too now that my heart isnt being plowed through the dirt in terror for you arhys dy lutez had grown still as stone beneath her royina he echoed this is dowager royina ista ferda looked up grinning aye sir if you are her rescuer i shall kiss your hands and feet we were in agony when we counted the women captives and found her gone the march stared at ista as though she had transmuted into some startling creature of myth before his eyes perhaps i have which of the several versions of the death of his father at roya iass hands had he heard which lie did he believe true my apologies march said ista with a crispness she did not feel the sera dy ajelo was my chosen incognito for humilitys sake on my pilgrimage but for safetys sake thereafter not that it had worked but now i am delivered by your bravery i can dare to be ista dy chalion once more well he said after a moment dy tolnoxo wasnt wrong about everything after all what a surprise she glanced up through her lashes the mask was back now tied tight the march let her down very carefully into ferdas upreaching arms chapter nine ista clung to ferdas elbow as he escorted her across the trampled greensward and poured out an excited account of the dawns battle as witnessed from somewhat farther forward in the column she did not follow one sentence in three though she gathered he was greatly enamored of arhys dy lutezs warcraft the meadow wavered before her gaze her head seemed poorly attached and not always the same size her eyes throbbed and as for her legs ferda she interrupted gently yes royina i want a piece of bread and a bedroll this rough camp is no place for your repose any bread any bedroll there may be some women i can find for your attendants but they are not what you are used to your bedroll would do royina i if you do not give me a bedroll at once i am going to sit down on the ground right here and start to cry now this threat delivered in a dead level tone seemed to get through at last at least he stopped worrying about all the things he thought she ought to have that werent here and provided what she asked for which was he led her to the officers tents by the trees picked one apparently at random poked his head inside and ushered her within it was stuffy and warm and smelled of mildew strange men leather horses and oil for blades and mail there was a bedroll she lay down on it boots bloody skirts and all ferda returned in a few minutes with a piece of brown bread she held up one hand and gave a vague wave he pressed the morsel into it she gnawed it sleepily when the tents owner returned someone else could deal with him foix could have convinced him that this blatant theft was an honor to be devoutly treasured she had no doubt ferda might do almost as well she was worried about foix and dy cabon were they still afoot in the wilderness liss had clearly escaped and reached maradi but what had she done after that had they found each other yet and and she pulled open gluey eyes and stared upward points of light leaked through the tent fabrics rough weave winking as a faint breeze moved the leaves overhead her body felt beaten and her head ached a halfchewed morsel of bread lay where it had fallen from her hand afternoon by the evidence of the light and her bladder no later an apprehensive female voice whispered lady are you awake she groaned and rolled over to find that ferda or someone had found attendants for her after all two roughlooking camp followers and a clean woman in the mothers green of a medical acolyte awaited her wakening the acolyte it transpired had been conscripted from the nearest town by one of the marchs couriers they shortly proved to have more practical skills among them than the whole troop of highborn ladies back in valenda who had formerly plagued ista with their services fully half of her own clothes had been retrieved from the roknari spoils presumably by ferda or one of his men and set in a pile on the opposite bedroll abundant wash water toothsticks and astringent herb paste medications and new bandages a thorough brushing and replaiting of her feral hair nearly clean garmentswhen ista limped from the tent into the earlyevening light on the acolytes arm she felt if not royal at least womanly again the camp was quiet though not deserted small groups of men came and went on mysterious post battle errands no one it appeared wished to load her aboard another horse at once which saved her a fit of hysterics for which she had no stamina she could only be grateful some cleanedup if exhaustedlooking men of her guard now had their own campfire in the grove and had borrowed camp followers she was invited to a seat upon an upturned log hastily chopped into the form of a chair and thoughtfully padded with folded blankets upon this makeshift throne she idly watched a dinner being prepared for her company she dispatched the acolyte to offer her medical services to any of her men who might still have unattended hurts the woman returned hearteningly soon at length ferda appeared he too seemed to have snatched some sleep to istas relief although clearly not enough as aromatic smoke rose from the fire arhys dy lutez rode in accompanied by a dozen officers and guards he approached her and offered a bow that would not have been out of place in a nobles palace in cardegoss he inquired politely after her treatment accepting her assurances of its excellence rather doubtfully in cardegoss in the summer the court ladies frequently made picnics in the forest and pretended to rustic delights she told him it was quite fashionable to dine upon a tapestry spread under a grove much like this in weather equally fine minus the wounded men and strewn battle gear granted he smiled i hope we may soon do better by you i have a few matters to attend to here and reports to dispatch to my lord the provincar of caribastos but by tomorrow morning our road should be safe and clear of jokonan stragglers it is my desire and honor to welcome you to the hospitality of castle porifors until your hurts and weariness are healed and your men restored and then to lend you escort where you will her lips pursed considering this she felt the solicitous weight of his stare upon her is porifors the closest haven it is the strongest hold there are villages and towns that lie closer but their walls are lesser and they are frankly but humble places a half a days ride more for you no worse and that in easy stages i promise anda smile flickered across his lips a flash of charm and warmthi confess it is my home i should be pleased and proud to show it to you ista ignored her heart melting like wax in a candle flame yet taking up his society must lead to further speech with him which must lead to what ferda she noticed was watching her with fervent hope the young officerdedicat breathed an open sigh of satisfaction when she said thank you my lord we shall be pleased for the rest and refuge she added after a moment perhaps the lost members of our company may find us there if we tarry a time when you write to dy caribastos would you ask him to pass the word that we seek them anxiously and to speed them there ifwhenthey are found certainly royina ferda whispered to her and if you are lodged in a secure fortress then i can seek them too perhaps she murmured back let us reach it first at ferdas earnest invitation the march lingered by their fire as the sun went down and the camp followers thrown on their mettle by istas royal presence produced a surprisingly complex meal ista had not known that one could bake bread redolent with herbs garlic and onions in a pan over an open fire arhys refused the food saying he had already eaten but accepted a mug of watered wine or rather water tinted with a splash of wine he excused himself early ista could see the glow from the candles in his tent as he scribbled at whatever campaign desk his servants carried along on such forays receiving rolls of the dead and wounded and captured dispatching orders and reports and letters to be carried away in the dark by swift riders she saw one of the captured jokonan tally officers marched in for a long interview when she retired to her purloined tent again now cleared of its owners gear and strewn with scented herbs arhyss working lights still shone through his tent walls like a lantern in the long night their departure was delayed in the morning by matters of arhyss troop and delegations from the town where he had sent the jokonan prisoners which she could see annoyed him but at last the tents were folded a fresh horse of the marchs company was presented to her a pretty white gelding clad in her own saddle and trappings she had noted the young soldier who brought it to her riding it about the meadow earlier presumably to take its edge off and be certain it was suitable for a lady to ride a tired aging lady she would have preferred a staircase to board it but made do with the soldiers nervous leg up i hope he will do for you royina said the young man ducking his head i picked him out myself we miss our master of horse since he has fallen illmy lord tries to do two mens tasks but all will be easier when we return to porifors im sure it will it was a muchexpanded company that clambered out of the river valley and across the dry countryside forty horsemen in the gray tabards of porifors rode ahead mailclad and armed before ista and ferdas reduced troop a long train of baggage mules and servants followed after then another twenty men for rear guard they struck a track then turned north upon a greater road scouts came and went ahead and along the fringes to exchange brief but apparently reassuring reports with arhyss alert officers they settled down to a steady plod through the warm morning at length arhys won free of the plucking demands of his command long enough to drop back and ride by her side he saluted her with good cheer now that he had his little army headed in the preferred direction royina i trust you slept well and that this last ride is bearable yes ill do though i believe i would mutiny at a trot he chuckled none shall ask it of you then well rest a space at noon and come to porifors in time for a rather better dinner than i could offer you last night then we shall dine very well indeed i look forward to it the courtesies fell automatically from her lips but by the tension in his smile he wanted more than an exchange of pleasantries i feel i must apologize for not recognizing you yesterday he continued the courier from tolnoxo who brought warning of the column told us a wild tale that you were among the taken but all his reports were very garbled yet when i saw the jokonan officers hustling a woman away i thought they might be true after all then your alias confused me anew you owe me no apology i was overcautious as it proved not at all i never thought to meet you in the flesh i must say i am quite glad you did or i should have woken up someplace unpleasant in jokona this morning he smiled briefly and glanced across at ferda riding on istas other side as a contented audience to all this noble speech curiosity wrestled with dread in istas stomach and won she took the hint and waved ferda out of earshot my good dedicat leave us a little with a disappointed look he tightened his reins and dropped behind she and arhys were left riding together side by side pearlwhite horse and charcoalgray an elegant picture and as nice a balance between private and proper as could likely be obtained she felt a pang of loneliness for liss and wondered where the girl was now carrying on competently no doubt arhys regarded her through slightly lidded eyes as though he contemplated enigmas i should have known at once ive felt a gravity in your presence from the moment i first saw you and yet you did not look like what i thought bright ista should have been if this was the start of some suave dalliance she was too tired to deal with it if it was something else she was much too tired she finally managed how did you imagine me he waved vaguely taller eyes more blue hair more palehoneyed gold the court poets said court poets are paid to lie like fools but yes it was lighter in my youth the eyes are the same they see more clearly now perhaps i did not picture eyes the color of winter rain nor hair the shade of winter fields i wondered if your long grief brought you to this sad season no i was always a dull dab of a thing she tossed off he did not laugh it would have helped i grant you age has improved nothing but my wits and even they are suspect royinaif you can bear tocan you tell me something of my father alas i didnt think this interest was all for my raincolored weeping eyes what is there to say that all men do not know arvol dy lutez was good at all things to which he turned his hand sword horse music verse war government if his brilliance had any flaw it was in his very versatility which stole away the sustained effort that would she cut off her words but the thought flowed on dy lutezs many great starts she realized at this distance had not been matched by nearly as many great finishes fragrant in the flower green and cankered in the fruit yes i should have realized it then even then or i my girls judgment was too weak where was that of the gods who have no such excuse he was the delight of every eye that fell upon him except mine arhys stared down at his horses withers not dull he said after a moment i have seen more beautiful women but you anchor my eye i cannot explain it a suave courtier she decided would never commit the blunder of admitting the existence of women more lovely than his current auditor and would have gone on to explain himself at poetic length mere dalliance might be dismissed with a smile arhyss remarks were considerably more worrisome taken in earnest he continued i begin to understand why my father would risk his life for your love ista with regret forbore to scream lord arhys stop he glanced across at her startled then realized she did not mean halt his horse royina i see the romantic rumors penetrated all the way to caribastos but there is no lapse in his exquisite taste to explain away for arvol dy lutez was never my lover taken thoroughly aback he digested her words for a moment at last he offered cautiously i suppose youve no reason now to tell other than the truth i never told other than the truth the clapping iron tongues of rumor and slander were not mine i was silent mostly and any less at fault therefore hardly his forehead wrinkled as he worked this through did roya ias not believe your protestations of innocence ista rubbed her brow i see we must back up a little what have you imagined to be the truth of those fatal events all these years he frowned uneasily i believed i concluded my father was tortured to confess his fault in loving you and when to protect you or his honor he would not speak the inquisitors went too far in their duress and he died in accident there in the zangres dungeons the charges of peculation and secret dealings with the roya of brajar were got up to cloak iass guilt afterward a truth tacitly admitted by ias when the dy lutez legacy was not attaindered as real traitors estates are but let to flow to his heirs you are shrewd she remarked and about threequarters correct he lacked only the secret core of the events dy lutez was very nearly as brave as that indeed it is as good a tale as any and better than most his gaze flicked to her i have offended you lady my abject pardon she sought better control of her tone she desperately wanted him to know that she had not been his fathers lover and why what did it matter at this late hour his beliefs about dy lutez the father who as far as she could tell had ignored him utterly were noble and romantic and why should she take that hearts lone legacy from him now she studied his tall easy power from the corner of her eye well that question answered itself didnt it it was pointless to replace his bright lie with some other lie but to explain the truth in all its dark complexityand complicitycould hardly advance any secret romantic dream of hers perhaps when she knew him better she might dare to tell all what that his father was drowned by my word how well will i have to know him for that she took a long breath your father was not a traitor in bed or out of it he was as courageous and noble a man as ever served chalion it took a task beyond all human fortitude to break him failure at the sticking point failure wasnt treason even if the rubble it left in its wake was every bit as dire lady you bewilder me her nerve broke even as dy lutezs did aye it is a state secret and ias died before ever releasing me from my sworn silence i promised i would never tell a living soul i can say no more except to assure you that you need bear your fathers name with no shame oh he echoed his brows drawing down a state secret oh and the poor man accepted that dear gods she wanted to shriek gods why have you brought me here have i not been punished enough does this amuse you she spoke with a lightness she did not feel but enough of the dead past tell me of the breathing now tell me more about yourself a conversational gambit that should serve for the rest of their ride she would not have to bestir herself for more than an occasional noise of interest if he was like most courtiers she had known he shrugged theres not that much to tell i was born in this province and have lived here all my life i have ridden in its defense since boyhood my mother died when wewhen i was about twelve i was raised by her faithfulby other relatives and brought up to a soldiers trade by need porifors actually came to me through my mother confirmed to me by the provincar when i grew old enough to hold it my fathers great possessions went mostly to his elder family though a few estates here in caribastos came to me by the sheer logic of iti believe there was some trading among the executors but it was all over my head at the time he fell silent finished apparently his father brilliant raconteur as he had been could have held a table enthralled for an evening with no more encouragement than that he stared around squinting into the sharpedged northern light and added one codicil i love this land i would know every mile of it in the dark she followed his eye around the horizon the mountains had dwindled away altogether into a wide rolling country open to the bright sky it was warm enough for olive groves shining silvergreen largesse scattered here and there across the long slopes a few walled villages sat like lightgilded toys at the edges of sight in this peaceful day yokes of oxen plowed far valleys a tall wheel groaned in a watercourse its voice softened by distance lifting moisture to irrigate the garden plots and rows of vines embroidered upon the lower and more fertile ground along the heights the gray bones of the world poked through the thinner soil soaking in the sun like old men on a plaza bench i think you left some hard turns out of your tale too but that last remark had the weight and density of a truth too large to be denied how like a man to change from mask to mask like a player concealing all intention yet leave his heart out on the table carelessly unregarded for all to behold a scout rode up and greeted his commander with a deferential salute arhys rode aside for a moment to confer with him then blinked up at the sun and frowned royina i must attend to a few things i look forward to further pleasure in your company with a grave nod he excused himself from istas side ferda returned smiling in reasonably wellsuppressed curiosity in a few minutes some of the baggage mules and servants were sent trotting on ahead escorted by half a dozen armed outriders in a few more miles the road curved into a long shallow valley green and silver with trees and vines a walled village sheltered there by the little watercourse in the olive grove near the stream the servants were setting up a couple of tents starting a fire and assembling food lord arhys ista ferdas company and about a dozen guardsmen turned aside into the grove the rest of the baggage train and soldiers rode on without looking back ista smiled gratefully as ferda helped her down from her white horse the young soldier reappeared to whisk it away to be watered and cared for and another invited ista on ferdas arm to the shade of an ancient olive tree while her luncheon was prepared they had made her a seat with saddles rugs and folded blankets soft enough to ease even her tired limbs with his own hands lord arhys brought her a mug of watered wine then quaffed down another again more water than wine he wiped his mouth and handed off the mug to a hovering servant royina i must take a little rest my people should supply all your wants the other tent is for you should you wish to retire oh thank you this pleasant shade will do for now though they were both modest officers tents quick to pitch and fold his larger command tent had evidently been sent on with the baggage train he bowed and trod away to duck into his tent and disappear small wonder he seized the quiet hour if as ista suspected hed been up all night for two nights running his servant followed him in then reemerged a few minutes later to sit down crosslegged before the closed flap the acolyte her temporary handmaiden inquired into her needs which were few and disposed herself beside ista in the shade ista encouraged her to idle conversation learning much of local village life by the way the camp followers brought her food watched anxiously as she ate it and looked relieved and elated when she smiled and thanked them this village was too small to support a temple but learning that a shrine to the daughter herself stood in the village square by its fountain ferda and his remaining men went off after eating to give thanks there for their late deliverance ista bid them go with her goodwill feeling no need to find some special place to seek the gods they seemed to press on her in all places at all times equally someplace they were guaranteed to not be now that might be worth a pilgrimage she half dozed in the quiet bleached afternoon the acolyte curled up on the blankets by her side in frank sleep her snore was quite ladylike more like a loudly purring cat ista readjusted a blanket and leaned against the bark of the tree the gnarled bole must be five hundred years old had this village stood here that long it seemed so chalionese ibran a number of roknari principalities chalionese again its masters had passed over it like tides across a strand and yet still it remained and carried on for the first time in days ista could feel her body start to really relax in the safety of this calm hour in the continuity of centuries she allowed her eyes to close just for a little her thoughts grew formless drifting on the edge of dreams something about running about the castle of valenda or possibly the zangre and arguing about clothes that did not fit flying birds a chamber in a castle candlelit arhyss face crumpled in dismay his mouth opened in an o of shock his hands reaching out in horror as he stumbled forward he uttered a hoarse noise between a grunt and a cry rising to a wail of woe ista shot awake her breath drawing in the cry still seeming to ring in her ears she sat up and stared around her heart beating rapidly the acolyte slept on some men sat in the shade across the grove near the horse lines playing at a game of cards others slept no one else seemed to have heard the shocking sound no heads turned toward arhyss tent the servant was gone from his place before its entrance it was a dream wasnt it and yet it had too much density too much clarity it stood out from the mindwaverings that had preceded it like a stone in a stream she forced herself to lean back again but her ease did not return tight bands seemed to circle her chest constricting her breath very quietly she put out a hand and rose to her feet no one was watching her just now she slipped across the few yards of sunlight between her tree and the next and back into the shade she paused at the tent door if he was asleep what excuse would she give for waking him if awake and say dressing what reason for barging in upon his privacy i must know ista lifted the tent flap and stepped inside her eyes adjusting to the shadows the tents pale fabric thin enough that she could see the narrow shadows of the olive leaves moving on the roof glowed with the light outside which glinted also through half a hundred pinholes lord arhys lord arhys i her whisper died arhyss tunic and boots were folded on a blanket on the right he lay face up on a low camp cot on her left covered only with a light linen sheet his head near the door a thin braid of grayandblack cloth was bound about his upper arm next to the skin marking some private prayer to the father of winter his lids were closed gray he was unmoving flesh pale and translucent as wax leaking through the linen over his left breast a splotch of bright red burned istas breath stopped choking her scream she dropped to her knees beside the cot five gods he is assassinated but how no one had entered this tent since the servant had come out had the servant fatally betrayed his master was he some roknari spy her trembling hand flicked back the sheet the wound beneath his left breast gaped like a small dark mouth blood oozed slowly from it a dagger thrust perhaps angled up into the heart does he yet live she pressed her hand to that mouth and felt its sticky kiss upon her palm desperate for some thump or flutter to show his heart yet beat she couldnt tell dare she lay her ear to his chest a hideous flash of memory burned through her minds eye of her long lean dreamman and the red tide of blood welling up between her fingers in a flood she snatched her hand away i have seen this wound before she could feel her own pulse racing beating in her neck and face drumming in her ears her head felt stuffed with cotton batting it was the right wound she would swear to it exact in every detail but it was on the wrong man gods gods gods what is this terror even as she watched his lips parted his bare chest rose in a long inhalation starting from the edges the wound slowly pressed closed the dark slit paling tightening smoothing in a moment it was only a faint pink scar ringed by a drying dapple of maroon he exhaled in a light moan stirring ista scrambled to her feet her right hand clenching around its stickiness with a breathless stride she slipped through the tent flap and stood blinking in the afternoon her face felt bloodless the shaded grove seemed to spin before her eyes she walked quickly around to the back of the tent sheltering between it and the great thick olive bole out of view for a moment while she caught her breath she heard the cot creak movement on the other side of those opaque fabric walls a sigh she opened her right palm and stared down at the carmine smear across it i do not understand in another minute or two she felt she could walk again without stumbling breathe without screaming and hold her face still and closed she made her way back to her seat and plunked down the acolyte stirred and sat up royina oh is it time to ride on already i think so said ista her voice she was pleased to note came out without tremor or upward slide lord arhys arises i see he pushed the flap aside and stepped out he had to bend his head to do so he had his boots on again he straightened his fingers fastening the last frog of his tunic his unstained unpierced tunic he stretched and scratched his beard and smiled around the very picture of a man arising from a refreshing postluncheon nap except that he had eaten nothing his servant scurried back to help him pull tabard and sword baldric over his head the little man supplied a light gray linen vestcloak as well elaborately embroidered with gold thread on the margins and adjusted the hang to a pleasantly lordly swing about arhyss calves a lazyvoiced order or two sent his people to work making their cavalcade ready for the road once more the acolyte rose to gather her things and pack them away ferda passed by heading for the horse lines ista softly called him to her side she stared away in a deliberately uninflected voice she said to him ferda look into my right palm and tell me what you see he bent over her hand straightened blood my lady did you take an injury ill fetch the acolyte thank you i am unhurt i merely wished to know if you saw what i saw thats all carry on please she wiped her hand upon the blankets and extended her other arm for him to help her to her feet she added after a moment do not speak of this his lips pursed in puzzlement but he saluted and continued on his way the second portion of the ride was much shorter than ista had expected a mere five miles or so up over the next ridge and into a somewhat wider watercourse the road switched back and forth a few times angling down the steep slope then ran beside the little river arhys moved up and down along the column but fetched up toward the end by her side and ferdas look there he pointed ahead an expansive wave castle porifors another walled village much larger than the last nestled by the stream at the foot of a tall rocky outcrop along the outcrops crown commanding a long view of the valley an irregular array of rectangular walls loomed broken only sparingly by round towers the blank walls pierced by arrow slits and capped by crenellations were of finecut stone palest gold in the liquid light elaborate twining carvings running in bands of contrasting bright white stone around the walls marked it as the best roknari masonry work of a few generations back when porifors had been built to guard jokona from chalion and ibra arhyss upturned face held a strange expression for a moment drinking in the sight at once eager and tense longing and reluctant and for the briefest lidsqueezed flash weary beyond measure but he then turned to ista with a more open smile come royina were almost there more of the baggage train split off at the village and most of the soldiers arhys led his remaining troop and ferdas past those lesser walls and up a narrower road single file winding across the slope green bushes clung dizzily to the rocks with roots like grasping fingers the horses haunches bunched and flexed pushing them up the last breathless incline cries of greeting rang down from above echoing off the boulders had they been attackers arrows and stones would have fallen on their heads just as readily the cavalcade circled the walls and approached a drawbridge lowered over a sharp natural cleft in the rocks its downward plunge adding another twenty or so free feet to the walls height arhys now at the head of his troop waved and gave a great whoop then cantered his horse through the archway with a clatter like a drum roll ista followed at a saner pace to find herself in what seemed a sudden other world a garden gone amok the rectangular entry court was lined with big pots of blooming flowers and succulent shrubs one open wall was covered with an array of more pots secured in wroughtiron rings driven into the walls exploding with colorpurple white red blue searing pinkdripping with green vines trailing down over the pale severe stone a second wall boasted an espaliered apricot tree grown immense across it twining with an equally ancient almond both in bloom at the far end of the court an arcade of harmonious stone pillars held up a balcony a delicately carved staircase descended like a white alabaster waterfall into the court a tall young woman her face glowing with joy fairly flew down the stairs black hair was braided up from her temples framing her rosetinted ivory features but was freed to ripple like flowing silk over her shoulders light linens graced her slim body and a pale green silk robe with wide giltedged sleeves fluttered about her billowing like a sail as she descended arhys jumped from his dappled horse and flung his reins to a groom barely in time to open his arms to the impact of her frantic fragrant embrace my lord my lord five gods be praised you are come back safe the young soldier had appeared at istas horses head and stood ready to help her dismount but his head turned to mark this play with open if tolerantly amused envy in his eyes what an incredibly lovely young woman ista said i did not realize lord arhys had a daughter he managed to look back around to her and hurried to hold her stirrup oh my lords daughter does not live here royina she came about from her dismount upright on her feet as arhys strode up to her the young woman clinging to his arm royina ista said arhys breathless with pride and a long kiss may i have the pleasure and honor of presenting to you my wife cattilara dy lutez marchess of porifors the blackhaired young woman dipped in a curtsey of surpassing gracefulness dowager royina my household is honored beyond all deserving by your presence here i hope i may do everything possible to make your sojourn with my lord and myself a memorable delight five gods give you a good day lady of porifors ista choked im sure you shall chapter ten flanked by two smiling ladiesinwaiting the young marchess led ista through a cool dim archway under the balcony and into an inner court ferda and istas medical acolyte followed less certainly until gestured forward by lord arhys the courtyard was graced by a small marble pool in the shape of a star its water bright and more pots of succulents and flowers lady cattilara darted up the stairway to the secondfloor gallery and paused to wait staring in concern as the acolyte helped ista labor upward on her sore legs ferda hurried to lend his arm ista grimaced in mingled gratitude and annoyance their footsteps echoed on the boards toward a corner where a short tower loomed until lord arhys stopped abruptly catti no not these chambers surely lady cattilara paused outside the carved double doors her woman had been about to open and smiled back at arhys in uncertainty my lord they are the best rooms of the housewe cannot offer the dowager royina less arhys strode to her side lowered his voice and said through his teeth have some sense but they are swept and garnished for her no catti she stared up at him in dismay iim sorry my lord ill ill think of something else five gods please you do he snapped back exasperation leaking into face and voice with an effort he recovered an expression of bland welcome lady cattilara turned smiling stiffly royina ista wont you come to my rooms to rest and refresh yourself before dinner just this way she eased back past them and they all reversed direction toward a similar set of doors on the opposite end of the gallery ista found herself briefly next to arhys what is the problem with the chambers she asked the roof leaks he growled after a moment ista cast a look at the bright blue cloudless sky oh the men were excluded at these new doors shall i bring your things here then royina asked ferda ista glanced apprehensively at arhys yes for now he answered apparently finding this other if temporary lodging more acceptable come dy gura ill show you and your men to your quarters you will wish to see to your horses of course yes my lord thank you ferda gave ista a parting salute and followed arhys back down the stairs ista entered the chamber past the ladyinwaiting who had paused to hold the door open for her the woman smiled and bobbed a curtsey ista felt an immediate sense of ease from having come at last to what were obviously a womans private quarters a softened light filtered through elaborate lattices at the narrow windows on the far wall wall hangings and vases of cut flowers brightened the austere whitewashed angles a door closed gave interior access to some adjoining chamber and ista wondered if it was arhyss the walls were crowded with chests variously carved inlaid or ironbound cattilaras women whisked away piles of clothing and other evidences of disorder and set a featherstuffed cushion on one such trunk for ista to rest upon ista glanced through the lattices which gave a view onto the roof of another inner court and settled her aching body down gingerly what a pleasant room ista remarked to allay lady cattilaras obvious awkwardness at having her refuge so suddenly invaded cattilara smiled in gratitude my household is anxious to honor you at our table but i thought perhaps you would wish to wash and rest first yes indeed said ista fervently the acolyte ducked a curtsey at the castles chatelaine and said firmly and it please you lady the royina should have her dressings changed as well cattilara blinked you are injured my lord did not say in his letter some minor scrapes but yes wash and rest before all ista had no intention of neglecting her hurts her son teidez had died it was said of an unattended injury upon his leg scarcely worse than a scratch which had taken a febrile infection ista suspected complicating factors beyond the natural prayers the boy had certainly had poured upon him but they had gone unanswered lady cattilara cast off her moment of discomfort in a flurry of activity ordering her ladies and her maids to these practicalities tea and dried fruit and bread were offered basins and a hip bath trundled in and water carried up the acolyte and cattilaras women tended not only istas body but washed her hair as well by the time these welcome ablutions were concluded and ista rewrapped in borrowed robes her hostess was quite cheerful again under her direction the ladies carried in armloads of garments for istas inspection and cattilara opened her jewel cases my lord said you had lost all your belongings to the jokonans cattilara said breathlessly i beg you to accept whatever of mine may please you as my journey was intended as a pilgrimage i actually carried but little and so it was but little loss said ista the gods spared me my men all else may be repaired it sounded a terrible ordeal said cattilara she had gasped in consternation when the acolyte had uncovered the admittedly ugly lesions on istas knees the jokonans had it worse in the end thanks to your lord and his men cattilara glowed with pleasure at this oblique commendation of the march is he not fine i fell madly in love with him from the first moment i saw him riding into the gates of oby with my father one autumn day my father is the march of obythe greatest fortress in caribastos bar the provincars own seat istas lips quirked i grant you lord arhys on horseback makes a most striking first impression cattilara burbled on he looked so splendid but so sad his first wife had died in childbed oh years before when his little daughter liviana was born and it was said he did not look at other women after her i was but fourteen my father said i was too young and it was only a girls infatuation but i proved him wrong three years did i campaign with my father for my lords favor and i won such a prize indeed have you been wedded long almost four years now she smiled in pride children her face fell and the volume of her voice not yet well said ista in an effort to bridge this unexpected chasm of secret woe that flashed so plainly in the girls face you are indeed young let us see these garments istas heart sank contemplating cattilaras offerings the marchesss tastes ran to bright airy fluttering confections that doubtless flattered her tall slenderness exceedingly well ista suspected they would make her own short body look like a dwarf dragging a curtain her mouth sought less blunt excuses i am still in mourning for the recent death of my lady mother alas and my pilgrimage though most rudely interrupted by those jokonan raiders is far from concluded perhaps something in the colors proper to my grief the elder of cattilaras ladies glanced at ista and at the bright silks and seemed to correctly interpret this much rummaging in chests and some trips to other storage places produced at length some dresses and robes of sterner cut and muchlesstrailing hemlines in suitable black and lilac ista smiled and shook her head at the jewel case cattilara contemplated the choices therein and suddenly curtseyed and excused herself ista heard her steps outside on the gallery turn in again almost at once then through the wall a reverberation of voices cattilaras and a mans lord arhys had returned evidently his timbre and cadences were distinctive the light steps dashed back then slowed to a ladys dignity cattilara entered her lips curled up with satisfaction and held out her hand in it lay a rich silver mourning brooch set with amethysts and pearls my lord has not very many pieces inherited from his great father she said shyly but this is one of them hed be honored if you would choose to have it for those past times sake ista surprised by the sight vented a huff of a laugh indeed i know the piece lord dy lutez used to wear it in his hat upon occasion roya ias had given it to himone of the least of his many gifts which had run to half his royacy before it all had come crashing down cattilara gazed at her with eyes shining ista would swear in a muted romantic glow the marchess presumably shared her husbands heroic theories about his fathers fall ista was still not sure if arhys had believed her denial of a sexual involvement with a man whose reputation as a lover had been scarcely less famous than his reputation as a soldier or if hed merely acceded to her story for courtesys sake did he imagine her still in mourning for dy lutez for ias for lost love of whatever object the brooch was an ambiguous message if message it was arhyss flesh beneath her hand as she had touched that misplaced wound had been stiff and cool as wax and yet he had risen walked and rode talked kissed his wife laughed or growled as grumpily as any breathing husband might ista might have convinced herself by now that shed had a hallucination or a dream but for ferdas witness to the material reality of the blood on her palm ista wrapped her hand around the mystery of his intentions and said thank you and thank your lord for me cattilara looked immensely pleased with herself ista was laid down upon lady cattilaras bed with her stilldamp hair spread out on a linen towel under the guard of the acolyte on a stool across the chamber cattilara swept her ladies out before her and left her honored guest to rest until the evening meal was served probably ista thought to dash off and oversee its preparation in the quiet of the dim chamber exhaustion and the immense relief of clean skin and clothing lent ista a sensationillusionof having come to sanctuary at last her headache could just be a touch of fever from her sores and her nightmare ride despite the lingering hum of tension on the edge of her nerves her eyelids drooped at a cool breath on her cheek they opened again in irritation no surprise that this castle had ghostsall old fortresses didnor that they emerged to investigate a visitor she rolled onto her side a faint white blob floated in her vision as she stared dismayed and frowning two more slipped out of the walls and collected with it as if drawn to her warmth ancient spirits these formless and decayed to near oblivion merciful oblivion her lips drew back in a fierce frown be gone sundered she whispered i can do nothing for you a swipe of her hand scattered the shapes like fog and they dispersed from her inner sight no mirror would reflect these visions no companion share them royina the acolytes voice came in a dozy murmur nothing said ista i dream no dream that but her inner vision grown clear again undesired unwelcomed resented and yet she was come to a very murky place in this bright afternoon perhaps she was going to need such clarity the gods give no gifts without hooks embedded remembering her vivid disturbing dream from earlier ista hardly dared allow herself to drop off again she half dozed for the turning of a glass until cattilara and her ladies came to collect her again the senior ladyinwaiting dressed istas hair in what was obviously an accustomed style braided back from her face and falling loose behind on cattilara the fall made fascinating ripples ista suspected her own dun mop snarling at her nape had more the effect of a mat of scouring weed but a lavender linen shift with a black silk over robe pinned together beneath her breasts by the mourning brooch made a suitably dignified display display she was fairly certain would be her next task summers heat came early to this northern province the tables had been set up in the court and the meal timed for when the westering sun dropped below the roofline the advancing shadow sparing the diners the lights hammering the head table at the courts far end faced the star fountain and two other longer ones ran perpendicular to it ista found herself set at lord arhyss right hand with lady cattilara on her other side if arhys had been stunning in mail and leather splashed with blood he was devastating in a courtiers garb of gray touched with gold and splashed with verbena he smiled warmly istas heart turned over she gathered the shreds of her reserve and returned cooler greetings then forced herself to look away from him ferda was given an honored place beyond the marchess an elderly gentleman in the robes of a temple divine was seated one space over from lord arhyss left hand one of arhyss senior officers began to approach them but halted at the two fingers lord arhys held up above the empty seat nodded understanding and went to take a place at one of the lesser tables lady cattilara watching this leaned behind ista to murmur to her husband my lord with these honored guests surely tonight we should use the place arhyss eyes darkened tonight least of all then his brows bent at her in a scowl one finger touched his lips in warning cattilara settled back her mouth taut she twitched it back into a smile for istas sake and addressed a polite triviality to ferda ista was pleased to see the remainder of ferdas company refreshed and washed and lent clean clothes scattered along the other tables arhyss officers and cattilaras women and a few habitues in temple dress made up the rest important citizens from the town at the castles feet would doubtless be paraded before ista at ensuing meals the elderly divine shuffled to his feet and quavered the prayers of thanksgiving for the previous days victory and marvelous rescue of the royina of supplication for the healing of the wounded of blessing upon the meal about to be served he continued with some special if slightly vague reference to the steadfastness of ferda and his men in this the daughters season which ista could see gratified the officerdedicat and as ever we especially beg the mother with her season impending for the recovery of our lord dy arbanos he made a gesture of blessing over the empty chair at lord arhyss left hand and arhys nodded sighing under his breath a nearly wordless murmur of assent ran round the officers at the other tables and ista saw some bleak frowns as the servants began to pass among them with pitchers of wine and water and the first platters of food ista asked who is lord dy arbanos cattilara eyed arhys warily but he merely replied illvin dy arbanos my master of horse he has been unwell these two months i save his seat as you see his last remark had almost a mulish air he added after a long moment illvin is also my half brother ista sipped at her goblet of watered wine drawing family trees in her head another dy lutez bastard unacknowledged but the great courtier had made a point of claiming all his scattered progeny with regular prayers and offerings to the bastards tower for their protection perhaps this one had been got upon some woman already married then folded silently into her family by the acquiescence of her cuckolded husband the name suggested it silently yet not secretly if this dy arbanos had claimed a place of the march and had his claim honored it was a great tragedy cattilara began too great to darken this evenings celebration with growled arhys no gentle hint that cattilara fell silent then with obvious effort evolved some inconsequential chatter about her own family in oby remarks upon father and brothers and their clashes with the roknari stragglers along their border during last falls campaigns lord arhys ista noted took little upon his plate and that little merely pushed about with his fork you do not eat lord arhys ista ventured at last he followed her glance to his plate with a rather pained smile i am troubled with a touch of tertiary fever i find starving it to be the most effective treatment for me it will pass soon a group of musicians who had seated themselves in the gallery struck up a lively air and arhys though not cattilara took it for pretext enough to let the limping conversation pause shortly after he excused himself and went to consult with one of his officers ista eyed the empty seat beyond him its place fully set someone had laid a cut white rose across the plate in offering or prayer lord dy arbanos appears to be much missed in your company said ista to cattilara she glanced across the courtyard to locate her husband leaning over another table in conversation and safely out of earshot greatly missed truly we despair of his recovery but arhys will not hear it is very sad is he a much older man than the march no hes my lords younger brother by two years nearly the two have been inseparable most of their livesthe castle warder raised them together after the death of their mother my father says and made no distinction between them illvin has been master of horse here for arhys for as long as i can remember their mother istas mind ratcheted backward over the hypothesized family tree this illvin is not a son of the late chancellor dy lutez then oh no not at all said cattilara earnestly it was a great romance though ive always thought in its day it is said she glanced around blushed a little and lowered her voice leaning in toward ista the lady of porifors arhyss motherit is said when lord dy lutez left her to attend court she fell in love with her castle warder ser dy arbanos and he with her dy lutez hardly ever returned to porifors and the date for lord illvins birth well it just didnt work it was a very open secret i gather but ser dy arbanos did not acknowledge illvin until after their mother died poor lady and another reason for dy lutezs long neglect of his northern bride emerged but which was cause and which effect istas hand touched the brooch at her breast what a quandary this illvin must have posed for dy lutezs vanity and possessiveness had it been a gracious and forgiving gesture to yield him legally to his real father or a mere relief to slide the bastard boy off the crowded roll of dy lutezs heirs what illness befell him not exactly an illness a very unexpected tragedy or cruel accident made worse by all the guesses and uncertainly it was a great grief to my lord and shock to all of porifors oh but he returns to us lord arhys had straightened and was heading back to his high place the officer to whom he had been speaking rose gave him an acknowledging half salute and made his way out of the courtyard cattilara lowered her voice still further it disturbs my lord deeply to speak of it i will tell you all the tale of it privately later hm thank you said ista not knowing quite how to respond to all this mysterious evasion she knew what she wanted to ask next is lord illvin a long lean man with hair like a stream of frosted night dy arbanos the younger might after all be short or round as a barrel or bald or with hair of flaming red she could ask cattilara would say so and the knot in istas stomach could then relax the plates were cleared some soldiers under the direction of the officer arhys had dispatched brought in an array of boxes chests bags and assorted armloads of weapons and armor to lay in heaps before the high table the spoils of yesterday mornings battle ista realized lord arhys and lady cattilara went together to lift a small chest to istas place and open it before her istas head nearly jerked back at the reek of mortality and woe that rose from the mess of gauds piled within it was not she realized at once a stink she sensed with her nose it seemed she was to be the first inheritor of the jokonan disaster a select mound of rings and pins and bracelets of finer workmanship or obvious femininity gleamed in the fading light how much of it had been lately stolen from rauma how much intended for jokonan girls who would not see their suitors again she took a breath fixed a befitting smile of gratitude upon her face and mustered a few appropriate words commending arhys and his men on their courage and swift response to the raiders incursion raising her voice to carry her compliments to the far tables an especially fine sword was then presented to ferda to his obvious pleasure cattilara bestowed a few pieces upon her ladies arhys distributed the bulk to his officers with personal words or jokes and the residue was disposed to the divine for prayers in the town temple a young dedicat apparently the elderly divines personal prop took charge of it with thanks and blessings ista let her finger glide over the contents of her box it made her skin crawl she did not want this mortal legacy well there was a solution for that she started to pick out one ring for her brave handmaiden formed of tiny galloping gold horseswhere was liss by now but after a hesitant moment her hand drifted to a curved dagger with a jeweled hilt it had a certain elegant practicality that seemed more in the riding girls style with a sigh recalling that all her money was at the bottom of a river in tolnoxo she withdrew a few trinkets for vails as well she laid both ring and dagger aside and pushed the box down toward ferda ferda pick out the best piece for your absent brother and the four next best for our wounded and the men who were left with them something appropriate for dy cabon too each man of your company may then take what he likes the rest please see that it comes to the daughters order with my thanks certainly royina ferda smiled but then his smile faded he leaned closer across the marchesss empty seat i wanted to ask you now that you are indeed delivered to a place of safety and look to be secure here under the marchs protection for a time may i have your leave to go and search for foix and liss and the divine i do not know what this strange place is but i do not name it safety she could not say so aloud almost she wanted to order him to ready his men for her departure tomorrow tonight impractical impossible impolite the daughters men were nearly as exhausted as she was half their horses were still back on the road with poriforss grooms being brought along in slow stages you are as much in need of rest as any of us she temporized i will rest better when i know what has happened to them she had to allow the truth of that but the thought of being trapped here without her own escort sent a shiver of unease along her nerves she frowned in uncertainty as lady cattilara fluttered back to her place lord arhys also returned to lower himself into his chair with a covertly weary sigh ista asked after his letters of inquiry on her missing peoples behalf he listened in what seemed to ista especially grave sympathy to ferdas concern for his brother but opined that it was too early for a reply by tacit agreement no one mentioned the complication of the beardemon we know that liss at least found her way to the provincar of tolnoxo argued ista others might have given warning of the raiders but only she knew that i was among the taken and if she made it to safety she will surely have had the sense to ask for searchers for your brother and the good divine thats true ferdas lips wrinkled tugged between reassurance and worry if they listened to her if they gave her shelter the chancellerys courier stations will have given her refuge even if dy tolnoxo did not though if he did not reward her courage with a proper hospitalityand her pleas with all aidhe will certainly hear from me about it and from chancellor dy cazaril too i warrant by lord arhyss letters the world will shortly know where we have fetched up if our strays find their way to porifors while you are running about hunting for them ferda you will miss them all the same in any case you surely cannot intend to hare off in the dark tonight let us see what counselor messagestomorrow morning brings ferda had to agree to the sense of that a cool twilight was falling in the court the musicians concluded their offering but no dancing or masque was presented the men made sure that the last of the wine did not go to waste and final prayers and blessings were offered the divine doddered away on his dedicats arm trailed by his rustic temples people arhyss officers made slightly awed courtesies to the dowager royina seeming honored to be permitted to kneel and kiss her legendary hands but from the way they strode off afterward faces already intent upon anticipated tasks ista was reminded that this was a working fortress cattilara made to put a helpful hand under her elbow as she rose now i can take you to your rooms royina she said smiling she glanced briefly at arhys they are not so large but the roof is in better repair the food and the wine ista had to admit had combined to destroy any ambition of hers for further movement tonight thank you lady cattilara that would be good arhys formally kissed her hands good night ista was uncertain if his lips were cool or warm confused by the disturbing tingle their imprints left on her knuckles in any case they did not burn with fever though when he raised his clear gray eyes to hers she flushed trailed by the usual gaggle of women the marchess took her arm and strolled with her through another archway beneath the gallery and down a short arcade they turned again and went under another looming line of buildings to emerge in a small square courtyard the evening was still luminous but overhead the first star shone in the high blue vault a stonearched walk ran around the courts edge the fine alabaster pillars carved with a tracery of vines and flowers in the roknari style neither hot noon nor chill halfmoon midnight but still the same court as in istas dreams every detail identical unmistakable engraved on her memory as if with chisel and awl ista felt faint she could not decide if she felt surprised i think i should like to sit down she said in a thin voice now cattilara glanced startled at the trembling of istas hand on her arm obediently she guided ista to a bench one of several around the courtyards margin and sat down with her the timepolished marble beneath istas fingers was still warm from the heat of the day though the air was cooling growing soft she gripped the stone edge briefly then forced herself to sit straight and take a deep breath this place seemed an older part of the fortress it lacked the ubiquitous pots of flowers only the legacy of the roknari stonecutters kept it from being severe royina are you all right asked cattilara diffidently ista considered various lies or truths for that mattermy legs hurt i have the headache she settled on i will be if i rest a moment she considered the marchesss anxious profile you were going to tell me what struck down lord illvin with difficulty ista kept her eyes from turning toward that door in the far corner to the left of the stairs to the gallery cattilara hesitated frowning deeply it is not so much what as who we think istas brows climbed some evil attack that to be sure it was all very complicated she glanced up at her waiting women and waved them away leave us please you she watched them settle out of earshot on a bench at the courts far end then lowered her voice confidentially about three months ago the spring embassy came from jokona to arrange the trade of prisoners set ransoms obtain letters of safe passage for their merchants all the things such envoys do but this time with a most unexpected offering in their traina widowed sister of prince sordso of jokona an elder sister married twice before i gather to some dreadful rich old jokonan lords who did what old lords do i dont know if she refused to be sacrificed so again or if shed lost her value in that market with her age she was almost thirty though really she was still fairly attractive princess umerue it soon became clear that her entourage sought a marriage alliance with my lords brother if he proved to please her interesting said ista neutrally my lord thought it a good sign that it might be a way to secure jokonas acquiescence in the coming campaign against visping if illvin were willing and it was soon evident that illvinwell id never seen his head turned round like that by any woman for all he pretended otherwise his tongue was always quicker to bitter jest than to honeyed compliments if illvin was only a little younger than arhys had not lord illvinser dy arbanosbeen married before ser dy arbanos now yeshe inherited his fathers title almost ten years ago i think though there was not much else to go with it but no two times he was almost betrothed i think but the negotiations fell through his father had devoted him to the bastards order for a period in his youth for his education though he said he did not develop a calling but as time ran on people made assumptions i could see that always annoyed him ista recalled making similar assumptions about dy cabon and grimaced wryly still even if this princess umerue had grown seriously shopworn a union with a minor quintarian lord and a bastard to boot was a curiously reduced ambition for such a highborn quadrene her maternal grandfather was the golden general himself if ista recalled the old marriage alliances of the five princedoms aright did she plan to convert if the courtship proved successful in truth i am not sure illvin was so taken by her he might well have gone the other way himself they made a remarkable couple dark and goldenshe had this classic roknari skin the color of fresh honey and hair that nearly matched it it was very well it was all very plain which way things were going but there was one who was not happy cattilara drew a deep breath her eyes shadowed there was a jokonan courtier in the princesss train who was consumed with jealousy and resentment hed wanted her for himself i suppose and could not see why she was being bartered to an enemy instead lord pechmas rank and wealth were scarcely more than poor illvins though of course he had not illvins military reputation one nightne night she sent away her attendants and illvin visited her cattilara swallowed we think pechma must have seen and followed next morning illvin was nowhere to be found until her women entered her chambers and discovered the most dreadful scene they came and woke my lord and mearhys would not let me enter the chambers but it was saidher voice dropped still lowerlord illvin was found naked all tangled in her sheets senseless bleeding the princess had fallen dead near the window as though she had been struggling to escape or call for help with a poisoned roknari dagger lodged in her breast and lord pechma and his horse and gear and all the purse of the jokonan party that had been entrusted to him were gone from porifors oh said ista cattilara swallowed and knuckled her eyes my lords men and the princesss servants rode out together looking for the murderer but he was long fled the entourage became a cortege and took umerues body back to jokona illvin never awoke we are not sure if it was from some vile roknari poison on the dagger that pierced him or if he fell and hit his head or if he was struck some other dire blow but we are terribly afraid his mind is gone i think that horror grieves arhys more than even illvins death would have for he always set great store by his brothers wits and how was this received in jokona not well for all that they brought their evil with them the border has been very tense since which did you some good after all for all my lords men were in readiness to ride out when the provincar of tolnoxos courier galloped in no wonder lord arhys is on edge appalling events indeed leaking roofs indeed ista could only be grateful to arhyss short temper not to be lodged tonight in princess umerues death chamber she considered cattilaras horrific account lurid and agonizing yes but there was nothing uncanny about it no gods no visions no blazing white fires that yet did not burn no mortal red wounds that opened and closed like a man buttoning his tunic i would look upon this lord illvin she wanted to say can you take me in to view him and what excuse would she give for her morbid curiosity this dubious desire to enter a mans sickroom in any case she did not want to gawk at the high laid low what she really wanted was to mount a horsenoa cart and be carried far from here it had grown dark enough to drain the color from her sight cattilaras face was a fine pale blur it has been a very long day i grow weary ista climbed to her feet cattilara sprang to assist her up the stairs ista gritted her teeth let her left hand lie lightly on the young womans arm and pushed her way up with her right hand on the railing cattilaras ladies still conversing among themselves straggled after them as they reached the top the door at the far end swung open istas head snapped around a runty bowlegged man with a short grizzled beard emerged carrying a mess of dirty linens and a bucket with a closed lid seeing the women he set his burdens down outside the door and hastened forward lady catti he said in a gravelly voice ducking his head he needs more goats milk with more honey int not now goram with an irritated wrinkling of her nose cattilara waved him off ill come soon he ducked his head again but his eyes gleamed from under his thick brows as he peered across at ista curious or incurious she could hardly tell in these shadows but she felt his stare like a hand on her back as she turned right to follow cattilara into the suite of rooms waiting for her on the gallerys other end his footsteps clumped away she glanced back in time to see the door on the far end open and close once more an orange line of candlelight flaring narrowing and blinking out chapter eleven cattilaras ladies wrapped ista in a graceful gauzy nightdress and tucked her into a bed covered in the finest embroidered linens ista had them leave the candle in its glass vase burning on her table the women tiptoed out and shut the door to the outermost of the two chambers where the acolyte and a maid would sleep tonight within the royinas call ista sat up on a generous bank of pillows contemplating the wavering light and the darkness it drove back contemplating her options it was possible to resist sleep for days on end till the room swayed and strange formless hallucinations spurted across ones vision like sparks spitting from a fire shed tried that once when the gods had first troubled her dreams when shed feared she was going mad and ias had let her go on thinking so it had ended badly it was possible to drown ones wits and dreams in drink for a little while shed tried that too and it had worked even less well in the long run there was no refuge from the gods to be had in madness either quite the reverse she brooded about what might be lying on a bed not dissimilar to this if less delicately perfumed in that room on the other end of the gallery actually she rather thought she knew quite precisely how the bed and the rugs and the roomand its occupantappeared she didnt even need to look i never saw goram the groom before though although she supposed his existence was implied so you dragged me here whichever of you harries me but you cannot force me through that door nor can you open it yourselves you cannot lift so much as a leaf bending iron or my will is a task equally beyond your capacities they were at a stand she and the gods she could defy them all day long but not all night long eventually i must sleep and we all know it she sighed leaned over and blew out her candle the hot wax smell lingered in her nose and the dazzle of its light left a colored smear in her eyes as she rolled over and thumped her pillow into shape beneath her shoulder you cannot open that door and you cannot make me do it either send what dreams you will do your secondworst your worst you have done to me already her sleep at first was formless dreamless blank then she swam for a little in ordinary dreams their anxious absurdities melting one into another then she stepped into a room and all was changed the room was solid square its angles unyielding as any real place though not any place shed yet been not lord illvins chamber not her own it was bright afternoon outside by the light falling through the tracery of the shutters she knew it for a room in castle porifors by its style then she realized she had glimpsed it once before in a flash of candlelight lord arhys had cried out all was serene and empty now the chamber was clean and swept and unpeopled but for herselfno wait a door opened a familiar figure was briefly backlit by the hazy light falling into the flowerdecked court beyond it filled the door from side to side heaved its hips through let the door swing shut briefly her heart lifted in joy and relief to see learned dy cabon safe and well except it was not dy cabon or not dy cabon only he was fatter brighter whiter faintly androgynous did that flesh swell as if to contain the uncontainable his garments were spotless by that alone ista might have known the differenceand luminous as the moon above the creases of his smile cheerfully echoed by the curves of his chins the gods eyes glinted at her wider than skies deeper than sea chasms their complexity bent inward endlessly each layer a lamination of other layers repeated into infinity or the infinitesimal eyes that might simultaneously contemplate each person and living thing in the world inside and out with equal and unhurried attention my lord bastard ista did not speak his name aloud lest he mistake it for a prayer instead she said lightly arent i a little overmatched he bowed over his immense belly small yet strong i as you know cannot lift a leaf nor bend iron nor your will my ista i am not yours i speak in hope and anticipation as a suitor may his smile bunched his fat face tighter or with the trickery of a rat rats he observed sighing are low shy straightforward creatures very limited for trickery one wants a man or a woman trickery treachery truth triumph traps for bears she twitched at this possible reference to foix you want something the gods tongues can grow quite honeyed when they want something when i wanted somethingwhen i prayed on my face arms outflung in tears and abject terrorfor yearswhere were you then where were the gods the night teidez died the son of autumn dispatched many men in answer to your prayers sweet ista they turned aside upon their roads and did not arrive for he could not bend their wills nor their steps and so they scattered to the winds as leaves do his lips curved up in a smile more deathly serious than any scowl ista had ever seen now another prays in despair as dark as yours one as dear to me as teidez was to my brother of autumn and i have sentyou will you turn aside as teidezs deliverance did at the last with so few steps left to travel silence fell between them istas throat was clogged with rage and more complicated things a boiling mixture even she could not separate and name a stew of anguish she supposed she snarled through her teeth lord bastard you bastard he merely grinned maddeningly when the man arises who can make you laugh solemn ista angry ista iron ista then will your heart be healed you have not prayed for this its a guerdon even the gods cannot give you we are limited to such simples as redemption from your sins the last time i tried to follow the gods holy addled inadequate instructions i was betrayed into murder she raged but for you i wouldnt need redemption i dont want to be part of you if i thought i could pray for oblivion i would to be smudged blotted out erased like the sundered ghosts who die to death indeed and so escape the worlds woe what can the gods give me his brows twitched up in an expression of remarkably disingenuous goodwill why work sweet ista he stepped closer beneath his feet the boards creaked and groaned dangerously she almost retreated just for the fearful vision of the pair of them crashing through the floor into the chamber beneath he held his hands lightly above but not quite touching her shoulders she noticed with extreme annoyance that she was nude he leaned forward over his belly its equator bumping hers and murmured my mark is on your brow his lips brushed her forehead the spot burned like a brand he has given me back the gift of second sight direct unguided perception of the world of spirit his realm she remembered how the print of the mothers lips had seared her skin just like this in that longago waking vision that had led to such disastrous consequences you may press your gift on me but i need not open it i refuse it and defy you his eyes glinted with a brighter spark he let his fat hands drift down over her bare back and hugged her in tighter to his girth and bent again and kissed her on the mouth with an utterly smug lascivious relish her body flushed with an embarrassing arousal which only infuriated her more the dark infinities abruptly vanished from those eyes so close to hers that they crossed a merely human gaze grew wide then appalled learned dy cabon choked recovered his tongue and leapt backward like a startled steer royina he yelped forgive me i i i his gaze darted around the chamber flicked to her grew wider still and sought the ceiling the floor or the far walls i dont quite know where i am he was not now her dream she was quite certain of it she was his and he would remember it vividly when he awoke too wherever he was your god snapped ista has a vile sense of humor what he asked blankly he was here and i missed him his round face grew distraught if these were real dreams each the others where are you now asked ista urgently is foix with you what istas eyes sprang open she was lying on her back in the dark bedchamber tangled in her fine linen sheets and cattilaras translucent nightclothes quite alone she spat a foul word it was drawing toward midnight she guessed the fortress had fallen silent in the distance filtering through her window lattices the faint sawing of insects grated a night bird warbled a low liquid note a little dull moonlight seeped in rendering the room not quite pitchblack she wondered whose prayers could have drawn her here all sorts of persons prayed to the bastard as the god of last resort not just those of dubious parentage it could be anyone in porifors except she supposed a man whod never woken from an exsanguinated collapse if ever i find who has done this to me ill make them wish theyd never so much as recited a rhyme at bedtime a cautious creak and scuff of steps sounded on the stairs to the gallery ista fought her way clear of the sheets swung her bare feet onto the boards and padded silently to the window that gave onto the court she unbarred the wooden inner shutter and swung it back fortunately it did not squeak she pressed her face to the ornate iron lace of the outer grating and peered into the court the waning moon had not yet dropped below the roofline its sickly light angled onto the gallery istas darkadapted eyes could make out clearly the tall graceful form of lady cattilara in a pale robe unattended gliding along the balcony she paused at the door at the far end gently swung it open and slipped within am i to follow sneak and spy listen at windows peer in like a thief well i will not no matter how benighted curious you make me curse you by no force could the gods compel her to follow lady cattilara to her afflicted brotherinlaws bedchamber ista closed the shutter turned marched back to her bed burrowed under the covers lay awake listening after a few furious minutes she rose again she silently lifted a stool to the window and sat leaning her head against the iron lattice watching faint candlelight leaked through the gratings opposite at length it went out a little time more and the door half opened again just wide enough for a slim woman to twist through cattilara retraced her steps descended the stairs she did not appear to be carrying anything so she oversaw the sick mans care not beneath a chatelaines duties for a man so highborn an officer so essential a relative so close and apparently esteemed by her husband perhaps lord illvin was due some midnight medication some hopeful treatment that the physicians had ordered there were a dozen possible mundane harmless explanations well a handful one or two at least ista hissed through her teeth and returned to her bed it was a long galling time before she slept again for a woman who had still been flitting around the castle secretly at midnight lady cattilara appeared at istas chambers much too soon after dawn bursting with cheerful hospitality and the plan of dragging ista to the temple in the village for morning prayers of thanksgiving with an effort ista suppressed the twinging tension the young marchesss presence induced in her when ista arrived in the flowerdecked entry court to discover pejar holding a horse for her it was too late to beg off muscles still sore feeling altogether decrepit in anything but a thankful mood she let herself be loaded aboard pejar led her mount at a decorous pace lady cattilara walked ahead in the procession head high arms swinging freely and had breath to spare to sing a hymn with her ladies as they descended the treacherous twisting path the village of porifors tightly crowded behind its gates was clearly a towninwaiting for either more walls or a reign of peace in which walls might be dispensed with its temple likewise was small and old the altars of the four gods hardly more than arched niches off the central court the bastards tower one of those temporary outbuildings that had lasted beyond all expectation or desire nevertheless after the services the old divine was eager to show the dowager royina all of his temples little treasures ferda signed pejar to attend ista and excused himself claiming he would not be gone long istas lips twitched at his timing the treasures proved not so little after all as the temple was recipient of largesse from many of lord arhyss more successful raids and forays lord illvins name too came up often in the divines enthusiastic inventory indeed yes the crime that had laid him low was a terrible terrible event alas that the rural temple physicians here could do naught for him though there was still hope that wiser men imported from one of the greater cities in ibra or chalion might yet work wonders when the agents lord arhys had dispatched finally succeeded in getting one here the divine had run through his most interesting or lurid tales of provenance and had progressed to a detailed account of the building plans for a new temple pending peace and the march and marchesss patronage before ferda returned his face was grave he paused to kneel briefly in the niche of the lady of spring his eyes closing and his lips moving before coming to istas side excuse me learned ista ruthlessly overrode the divines monologue i must speak to my good officerdedicat they returned to the ladys niche what then asked ista quietly his voice was equally quiet the morning courier from lord dy caribastos has ridden in no news of foix or dy cabon or of liss i therefore ask your leave to take two of my men and search for them he glanced across in judicious admiration at lady cattilara who had taken over the task of listening politely to the divine you are clearly in the best of hands here it will only take a few days to ride up to maradi and backlord arhys undertakes to lend us some good fresh horses id expect to return before you are ready to travel again i mislike this i do not care to dispense with your support should some emergency arise if lord arhyss troops cannot protect you my handful could do no more said ferda he grimaced as we have proved i fear royina under ordinary circumstances i would defer to you without hesitation his voice grew lower still but then there is the matter of the bear dy cabon is better fit to deal with those complications than either of us if he lives said ferda heavily i am sure he does ista decided she didnt want to explain how she knew worse she could not likewise vouch for foix i know my brother he can be forceful and persuasive and tricky if the first does not serve if his will is not quite his own and yet is informed by all his wits im not sure dy cabon could handle him i can i have ways his face was lightened temporarily by a brief fraternal grin mm said ista persuasion it seemed ran in the family and then there is liss he said more vaguely what there was about liss he did not expand upon and ista mercifully forbore to prod him i do dearly wish she were back by my side that is so she added after a moment and dy cabon perhaps especially dy cabon whatever the god was about the bewildered young divine figured in it as well then may i have your leave royina dedicat pejar can serve all your needs in this minor court i am sure and he is eager enough to do so ista let the little flash of cardegoss arrogance pass without comment were porifors an ordinary rural court ferda would doubtless be correct do you mean to go now he ducked his head at once please you if there is any problem the sooner i arrive the better he added to her frowning silence and if there isnt then the sooner i may return she sucked on her lower lip in doubt and there is as you say the matter of the bear traps for bears the god had said ms accursed pet escaped no point in praying to the god for protection either if he could directly control his wild demons fled into the realm of matter he presumably would and not let his divine weakness depend upon human weakness very well she sighed go on then but return quickly he offered a strained smile who knows i may meet them coming down the road from tolnoxo and be back before nightfall he knelt and kissed her hand gratefully by the time she drew a second breath the flapping of his vestcloak had already vanished out the temples doors luncheon ista discovered to her dismay was to be a fete in the dowager royinas honor in the village square complete down to a choir of village children offering a selection of songs hymns and earnest and not especially rhythmic local dances lord arhys was not present the young marchess did the honors for the castle in a warm style obviously much approved by the proud and anxious parents more than once ista caught her looking at the littlest ones with open longing in her eyes when the urchins had stamped through their last erratic caper and ista had had her hands kissed by all and sundry she was loaded back aboard her horse and permitted to escape surreptitiously she wiped upon the animals mane the slimy offering left on her fingers by the waif with the cold she was by this time almost glad to see that horse almost dismounted again back in the floral entry court ista was just trying to decide whether she was annoyed or glad for lady cattilaras delicately worded suggestion that perhaps a lady of the royinas age would care for an afternoon nap when a whoop at the gate cried against its closing hallo castle porifors courier from castle oby ista spun on her heel at the familiar boisterous voice riding through the gate on a fat and lathered yellow nag was liss she wore her castleandleopard tabard and held up a leather pouch in the official style its wax seals bouncing on their strings her shirt beneath the tabard was as wet with sweat as the horse and her face flushed with sunburn her mouth went round as she gazed about at the pots of color and greenery liss ista cried in delight ha royina so you are here after all liss kicked loose her stirrups swung her off leg up over her horses neck and jumped down grinning she knelt courtierfashion at istas feet ista raised her by her hands it was all she could do not to hug her how came you here on this horsedid ferda find you well i came here on this horse of course great slug that it is ferda is ferda safe hallo pejar the sergeantdedicat at istas elbow grinned back broadly the daughter be thanked you made it if the tales i heard were true you all were in worse case than i ever was ista said anxiously ferda left here not three hours agoyou must have passed him on the road to tolnoxo surely lisss brow wrinkled i came in by the road from oby though oh but how came you to be atoh come come sit with me and tell me everything how i have missed your currying and grooming yes dearest royina but i must first hand off my letters since i am a courier again for today and see to this beast it isnt mine five gods be thanked it belongs to the courier station midway between here and oby i should be grateful for a bucket of water though ista motioned to pejar and he nodded and dashed off cattilara and her ladies drifted up the marchess smiled in inviting puzzlement at the courier girl and at ista royina this is my most loyal and brave royal handmaiden annaliss of labra liss make a curtsey to lady cattilara dy lutez marchess of porifors and likewise these ista went down the ranks of cattilaras ladies who goggled at the courier girl liss complied with a series of friendly little dips at the string of introductions pejar dashed up with a sloshing bucket liss grabbed it in passing and plunged her whole head in she came up for air with a sigh of relief and her soaked black braid swung droplets in an arc that nearly spattered cattilaras recoiling ladies ah thats better five gods but caribastos is a hot country in this season she allowed the bucket to continue to the horse giving its side a hearty pat pejar said eagerly as the horse shoved at him getting its nose in the water we were sure you must have warned that crossroads village but where you went after that we could not guess my good courier mount was done in by the time i reached there but my tabard and chancellery baton persuaded them to lend me another they had no soldiers fit to fight the jokonans so i left them to save themselves and rode east as fast as i could whip the poor blowing plow horse did the villagers escape harm they were all fled by the time we got there close to sunset said pejar ah good well right after that same sunset i reached a courier station on the main road to maradi and once id convinced them i wasnt raving they got the hunt up or so i thought i slept there and rode in to maradi the next morning at a saner pace only to find the provincar of tolnoxo just then leading his cavalry out the gates in pursuit as fast as the jokonans were moving i greatly feared he was already too late it did prove so agreed ista but a courier reached castle porifors in time for lord arhys to set an ambush along the line of the jokonan retreat yes that must have been one of the fellows who rode directly from my courier station five gods rain blessings on their wits one of them said he was native to this region id hoped he might know what he was about did you hear anything of foix and learned dy cabon asked ista urgently we never saw them again after we hid them in that culvert liss shook her head frowning i told of them at the courier station and i warned lord dy tolnoxos lieutenants when we passed to be on watch for them both i was not sure then if theyd been taken by the jokonans as you were or if they had got away or would follow the road forward or back or strike into the scrub or what so i went to the temple at maradi and found a senior divine of learned dy cabons order and told her of all our troubles and that our divine was likely out on the road and much in need of help and she undertook to send some dedicats to seek them that was well thought of ista said her voice warm with approval liss smiled gratefully it seemed little enough i waited a day at the chancellerys office in maradi but no word came back from lord dy tolnoxos column so i bethought me of a faster route south and volunteered to ride courier to oby i reckoned since it was the greater fortress you would most likely be rescued by its soldiers and brought there then i flewi dont think any courier has ridden that road faster than i did that day she shoved a strand of wet hair out of her sunburned face raking it back with her fingers all were still in suspense when i arrived at the fortress that night but my labors were repaid next morning when the letter came there from the march of porifors that you were all safely rescued obys lord and men had gone out on patrol for the jokonans too but they came riding back that afternoon my father is the march of oby observed cattilara an eager tinge leaking into her voice did you see him liss made her unique half bow half curtsey again he is in good health my lady i begged the boon from him of riding courier to porifors so i might most speedily rejoin the royina she held up her pouch he saw me off at dawn this morning i received this from his own hands there may be something in here for youah her eye brightened at the approach of poriforss castle warder an aging landless lordling who reminded ista much of ser dy ferrej except for being stringy instead of stout the groom goram followed in his wake the warder took the pouch in charge to lisss obvious relief and hastened away with it after directing the groom to assist with the couriers horse you must be exhausted said lady cattilara whose eyes had widened more than once during lisss account such a frightening ordeal oh but i love my task said liss cheerfully slapping her dirty tabard people give me fast horses and get out of my way istas lips twitched up at this reason enough for joy indeed but at least it appeared that she hadnt let ferda go off on a fools errand for all that he had missed liss on the road and that she could hope that by the time he reached maradi he would find his bearridden brother and his conductor safely in the temples charge there liss attempting to follow her horse as goram led it away made little excusing bows in all directions ista said smoothly when my handmaiden has seen to her mount she will be in need of a bath as i was and i pray you a loan of clothing as well her things were stolen by the jokonans along with mine actually lisss extremely scant wardrobe had mostly been in her saddlebags but ista judged that cattilaras ladies noses were in the air at more than the reek of horses and sweat from the lowborn highriding girl and fodder pray you dear royina liss called over her shoulder it shall be worthy of your great ride the fame of which shall reach cardegoss itself in my next letter ista promised so it is quick it may be anything you please liss was a long time in the stables but at last she presented herself at istas new quarters cattilaras ladies local petty lords daughters who had nearly fallen over themselves for the honor of serving the dowager royina were clearly less taken with the chore of serving liss but a bath liss had under istas firm eye in between snatching bites from the tray of bread olives cheese and dried fruit and sloshing down cup after cup of lukewarm herb tea her rank riding clothes were sent off with the servants to be properly washed cattilaras castoffs suited lisss height and age much better than they did istas even if they were a trifle too generously cut in the chest for the riding girl liss laughed in delight and awe waving about one trailing delicate sleeve and ista smiled at her pleasure with the unfamiliar richness one persons delight in liss was unalloyed the medical acolyte finally had someone to assume the care of istas hurts so that she might return to her neglected temple and family liss hadnt finished drying before the acolyte finished her tutelage turned over a supply of bandages and ointments gathered her things received a suitable vail from ista for her pains and scampered off for home dinner that afternoon was presented in a smaller chamber off the courtyard of the star fountain and proved to be an almost entirely female gathering under lady cattilaras dominion no chair was left ritually empty does lord arhys not dine tonight ista asked as she was seated at the marchesss right hand or ever i should think his tertiary fever would worry you not nearly as much as his military duties lady cattilara confided with a sigh he has taken some men on a patrol toward the northern border my heart will be in my mouth till he returns i am in agony inside with terror for him when he rides out though of course i smile and do not let him guess if anything ever happened to him i believe i would go mad oh she covered her gaffe with a sip of wine and held her cup up to ista in salute but you understand im sure i wish i could keep him by my side forever is not his superior military craft a part of hisadmittedly appallingattractiveness hobble him and you risk killing the very thing you admire in the attempt to preserve it oh no said lady cattilara seriously denying but not answering the objection ista noted i do make him write to me every day when he is gone if he forgot i should be quite cross with himher lips turned up and her eyes sparkled with laughterfor a whole hour at least but he doesnt forget anyway hes supposed to be back by nightfall ill watch for him on the road from the north tower and when i see his horse my heart will stop choking me and start beating a thousand times a minute instead her face softened in anticipation ista bit hard into a large mouthful of bread the food in any case was excellent lady cattilara or her castle cook at least did not attempt to ape the excesses or worse what they imagined to be the excesses of cardegoss court feasting but served simple fresh fare there did seem to be more sweets tonight which ista could not fault and which liss plainly relished consuming an enviable portion she was very quiet in this company in what seemed to ista unnecessary awe of her surroundings ista thought she would rather have heard lisss tales than the local gossip that filled the time when they had escaped the ladies and returned to the square stone court ista told her so and chided her for her shyness truly liss admitted i think its the dress i felt a great gawk next to those highborn girls i dont know how they manage all this fancy cloth im sure i shall trip over myself and tear something then let us walk about in the colonnade that i may stretch my scabs as the acolyte instructs and that you may practice swishing in silks to do me honor in this court and tell me more of your ride liss shortened her steps in a most ladylike fashion keeping to istas slow limp in the cool of the cloistered walkway ista primed her with questions about every aspect of her journey not that ista needed a catalogue of every hair fault virtue and quirk of every horse liss had ridden for the past several days but lisss voice was such welcome music it hardly mattered what it dwelt upon ista had less to report she found of her own ride certainly not details of the jokonan horseflesh which she had mainly experienced as a penance nor had she desire to recall green flies gathering to feed on thickening blood passing a pillar liss reached out to trail her fingers over the carved tracery it looks like stone brocade porifors is a far more beautiful castle than i was expecting is lord arhys dy lutez as great a sword master as the marchess was bragging yes in fact he slew four of the enemy who attempted to ride off with me two escaped she had not forgotten them she was almost glad in retrospect that the translator officer had been one of those fled she had spoken with him eye to eye a few too many times for her to imagine him as a cipher blurred into the faceless ranks of the fallen a feminine weakness that perhaps like refusing to eat any animal one had named as a pet was it true the march rode in with you upon his saddlebow yes said ista shortly lisss eyes crinkled with delight how splendid too bad hes so married eh is he really as handsome as his wife seems to think i cant say ista growled she added in reluctant fairness he is however quite handsome how fine to have such a lord at your feet though i am glad you have come to such a place after all this ista changed he wasnt exactly at my feet to i do not plan to linger here lisss brows rose the mothers acolyte said you could not ride far yet ought not perhaps not comfortably i could at need ista followed lisss admiring glance around the court shaded in the slanting light of the late day and tried to evolve a reason for her unease that did not involve bad dreams a rational sensible reason for a woman who was not mad in the least she rubbed at the itch on her forehead we are too close to jokona here i do not know what treaties of mutual aid presently exist between jokona and borasnen but everyone knows the port of visping is the prize of my royal daughters eye what is planned to happen in the fall will be no mere border raid and there was a terrible event here this spring that cant have helped relations with the prince of jokona in any way ista did not look toward that corner room you mean how poriforss master of horse was stabbed by that jokonan courtier goram told me of it while we were swabbing down that fat palomino odd fellowi think hes a little simple in the headbut he knows his trade she added here royina you are limping worse than my second horse sit rest she chose a shaded bench at the courts far end the one where cattilaras ladies had collected the previous evening and with an air of determined heedfulness settled ista upon it after a moment of silence she gave ista a sidelong look funny old man goram he wanted to know if a royina outranked a princess because a princess was the daughter of a prince but you were only the daughter of a provincar and that roya oricos widow sara was a dowager royina more recent than you i said a chalionese provincar was worth any roknari prince and besides you were the mother of the royina of all chalionibra herself and nobody else is that ista forced herself to smile royinas do not often come in his way i expect did your answers pacify him liss shrugged seemed to her frown deepened isnt it a strange thing for a man to lie stunned like that for months it was istas turn to shrug palsystrokes broken heads broken necks drownings it happens that way sometimes some recover though dont they i think those that recover start to do so sooner most struck down that way do not live long thereafter unless their care is extraordinary its a slow ugly death for a man or anyone better to go swiftly at the first if goram cares for lord illvin half as well as he cares for his horses perhaps that explains it ista became conscious that the runty man himself had emerged from the corner chamber and hunkered down behind the balustrade watching them after a time he rose came down the stairs and crossed the court as he neared his steps shortened his head drew in like a turtles and his hands gripped one another he stopped a little distance off bent his knees and ducked his head first to ista then to liss then back to ista again as if to make sure his eyes were the color of unpolished steel his stare from under those bushy brows was unblinking aye he said at last to a point halfway between the two women shes the one he was going on about no mistake he pursed his lips and his gaze suddenly fixed on liss did you ask her liss smiled crookedly hello goram well i was working up to it he wrapped his arms around himself rocking forward and back ask her then liss cocked her head why dont you she doesnt bite b n t he mumbled obscurely glowering at his booted feet you liss shrugged amused bafflement and turned to ista royina goram wishes you to come view his master ista sat back and was silent for a long withheld breath why she finally asked goram peered up at her then back down at his feet you were the one he was going on about surely said ista after another moment no man would wish to be seen in his sickbed by strangers thats all right goram pronounced he blinked and stared hard at her liss her eyes crinkling cupped her hand and whispered in istas ear he was more talkative in the stalls i think you frighten him articulate smooth persuasion ista thought she might resist in this odd tangle she could hardly find an end urgent eyes tongue of wood a silent pressure of expectation she could curse a god she could not curse a groom she glanced around the court neither midnight nor noon now no details matched her dreams her dream had held neither goram nor liss the time of day was all wrong maybe it was safe benign she drew a breath so then liss let us renew my pilgrimage party and go view another ruin liss helped her up her face alert with open curiosity ista climbed the stairs upon her arm slowly goram watched her anxiously his lips moving as if mentally boosting her up each step the women followed the groom to the end of the gallery he opened the door backed up bowed again ista hesitated then followed liss inside chapter twelve the room was lighter than shed seen it in her vision the shutters on the far wall open now to the blue sky beyond the effect was airy and gracious the chamber didnt smell like a sickroom no bunches of heavyscented herbs hanging from the rafters failing to mask an underlying tang of feces vomit sweat or despair just cool air wood wax and a faint not unpleasing aroma of masculine occupation not unpleasing at all ista forced her gaze to the bed and stood rooted the bed was made he rested atop the counterpane not like a man in a sickbed but like a man who had lain down for but a moment in the middle of a busy day or like a corpse laid out in best garb for his funeral long and lean exactly as in her dreams but dressed very differently not patient or sleeper but courtier a tan tunic embroidered with twining leaves was fastened up to his neck matching trousers were tucked into polished boots buckled up to his calves a maroon vestcloak spread beneath and beside him and a sheathed sword lay upon the neatly arranged folds its inlaid hilt beneath his slack left hand a seal ring gleamed on one finger his hair was not merely combed back from his high forehead but braided in neat cords up from each temple and over his crown the dark frosted length of it ended in a queue brought back over his right shoulder to rest upon his chest the tail of it beyond the maroon tie brushed out straight he was shaved and that recently a scent of lavender water tickled istas nostrils she became aware that goram was watching her with a painful intensity his hands flexing as they gripped each other all this silent beauty must be his work what must the man on the bed have been to receive such devotion from this lackey now when he had so plainly lost all power to punish or reward five gods gasped liss hes dead goram sniffed no hes not he dont rot but hes not breathing does too you can tell with the mirror see he sidled around the bed and picked up a tiny hand mirror from a nearby chest with a glower at the girl from under his bristling eyebrows he held it beneath lord illvins nostrils see liss bent nearer across the unmoving form and cast a wary glance downward thats your thumbprint is not well maybe liss straightened and backed away with a jerky gesture as if inviting ista to take her vacated place by the bedside and judge for herself ista drew nearer under gorams anxious eye trying to find something to say to the grizzled fellow you care for him well a tragedy that ser dy arbanos should have been hewn down like this aye he said he swallowed and added so go on lady i beg your pardon so kiss him for just a moment she pressed her teeth so hard together that her jaw twinged but there was no suppressed merriment in gorams seamed strained face no hint of japery i dont follow you he chewed on his lip it was a princess put him here i thought maybe you could wake him being a royina and all he added after a doubtful moment dowager royina he was deathly serious she saw to her dismay she said as gently as she could goram thats a childrens story we are not children here alas a slight choking noise made her glance aside lisss face was screwed up but she forbore to laugh five gods be thanked you could try it wouldnt hurt to try he was rocking again in his unease forward and back i fear it would do no good either no harm he repeated doggedly got to try something he must have spent several hours in the meticulous preparation of the scene of his master for her view what desperate hope could drive him to such bizarre lengths maybe he has dreams too the thought clotted her breath the memory of the bastards second kiss heated her face what if it had been not unholy jest but another giftone meant to be passed along might it be granted to her to perform a miracle of healing as agreeably as this so are the saints seduced by their gods her heart thumped in concealed excitement a life for a life and by the grace of the bastard my sin is lifted in a kind of fascination she bent forward the closely shaved skin of illvins jaw was stretched too thinly over the fine bones his lips were neutral in color a little parted upon pale square teeth neither warm nor cold as her lips pressed upon them she breathed into that mouth she remembered that the tongue was the organ held sacred to the bastard as womb for the mother male organs for the father heart for the brother and brain for the daughter because the tongue was the source of all lies the quadrene heretics falsely charged she dared secretly to trace those teeth touch the cool tip of his tongue with hers as the god had invaded her mouth in her dream her fingers spread hovering over his heart not quite venturing to touch to feel for a bandage wrapped around his chest beneath that decorated tunic his chest did not rise his dark eyes and she knew their color by heart already did not open in wonder he lay inert she swallowed a wail of disappointment concealed chagrin straightened found her voice lost somewhere as you see it does no good foolish hope and foolish failure eh said goram his eyes were narrowed sharp upon her he too looked disappointed but by no means crushed must be something else let me out of here this is too painful liss standing watching this play cast ista a look of mute apology a lecture on a handmaidens duties in screening the importunate the simple and the strange from her ladys presence seemed in order later but you are the one he was going on about repeated goram in an insistent tone recovering his audacity it seemed or perhaps the futility of her kiss had reduced his awe of her she was after all merely a dowager royina obviously insufficiently potent to breathe the near dead to life not tall hair curled all wild down your back gray eyes face all stillgrave he said you were grave he looked her up and down and gave a short nod as if satisfied with her graveness the very one who saidwho described me so to you demanded ista exasperated goram jerked his head toward the bed him when istas voice came out sharper than shed intended liss jumped gorams hands opened when he wakes up does he wake up i thoughtlady cattilara gave me to understandhe had never come out of his swoon after he was stabbed eh lady catti said goram and sniffed ista wasnt certain if he was making a comment or just clearing his nose but he dont stay awake see he comes up most every day for a while around noon we mainly try to get as much food into him as we can while he can swallow without choking he dont get enough hes wasting away you can see it lady catti she came up with a smart idea to put goats milk down his throat with a little leather tube and you can see that it helps but not enough hes too thin now every day his grip is less strong is he coherent when he wakes goram shrugged eh not an encouraging answer but if he waked at all why not now for her kiss or at any other time why just at the time that his brother slept his motionless sleep her mind shied from the thought goram added he does go on sometimes some would say he just raves liss said is it uncanny do you think some roknari sorcery ista flinched at the notion i wasnt going to ask it i wasnt going to suggest it i want nothing to do with the uncanny sorcery is illegal in the princedoms and the archipelago for more than just theological reasons it was scarcely encouraged in chalion either yet given opportunityand sufficient desperation criminality or hubrisa stray demon might present as much temptation to a quadrene as to a quintarian more since a quadrene who had contracted a demon risked dangerous accusations of heretical transgression if he sought assistance from his temple goram shrugged again lady catti she thinks its poison from that roknari dagger because the wound dont heal right i used to poison rats in the stablesnever saw any that worked like this lisss brows drew in as she studied the still form have you served him long going on three years as a groom groom sergeant messenger dogs body whatever tendant now the others theyre too spooked afraid to touch him im the only one who does it really right she cocked her head to one side her puzzled frown did not diminish why does he wear his hair in the roknari style though i must say it suits him he goes there went there as the marchs scout he was good enough to pass knows the tonguehis fathers mother was roknari for all she learned to sign the five he told me once footsteps sounded outside and he looked up in trepidation the door opened lady cattilaras voice said sharply goram what are you about i heard voicesoh i beg your pardon royina ista turned crossing her arms lady cattilara dipped in a curtsey though she shot a brief scowl at the groom she wore an apron over the fine dress shed appeared in at dinner and she was trailed by a maid bearing a covered pitcher her eyes widened a little as they passed over the courtly garb of the patient she breathed out through her nostrils an incensed huff goram hunched dropping his gaze and took refuge in a sudden renewal of his unintelligible mumble ista was moved by his hangdog look to try to spare him trouble you must excuse goram she said smoothly i asked him if i might view lord illvin because yes why to see if he resembled his brother no that was weak to see if he resembled my dreams worse i perceived lord arhys was most troubled by his plight ive decided to write to a certain highly experienced physician of my acquaintance in valenda learned tovia to see if she might have any advice in the case so i wished to be able to describe him and his symptoms very exactly she is a stickler for precision in her diagnoses that is extremely kind of you royina to offer your own physician said lady cattilara looking touched my husband is grieved indeed by his brothers tragedy if the master physicians we have sent for continue to prove unwilling to travel so farsuch adepts tend to be old we are findingwe should be most grateful for such aid she cast a doubtful glance at the maid with the pitcher do you think she would want to know how we feed him the goats milk im afraid the process is not very pretty sometimes he chokes it up the implications were clear sinister and repulsive given all the labor to which goram had gone to present his fallen master in the most dignified possible light ista had no heart to watch that long body stripped of its courtly adornment and subjected to indignities however necessary i expect learned tovia is well acquainted with all the tricks of nursing i do not think i need to mark it lady cattilara looked relieved with a carryon gesture to the maid and goram she ushered ista and liss back out onto the gallery and walked with them toward istas chambers twilight was gathering the courtyard was altogether in shadow though the highest clouds glowed peach against the deepening blue goram is a very dutiful man cattilara said apologetically to ista but im afraid hes more than a trifle simple though he is by far the best of lord illvins men who have undertaken to attend him they are too horrified i think goram had a rougher life before and is not squeamish i could not begin to manage illvin without him gorams tongue was simple but his hands were not in istas judgment for all that he seemed the exemplar of a lackwitted attendant he appears to have a rare loyalty to lord illvin no great wonder i believe he had been an officers servant in his younger days and been captured by the roknari during one of roya oricos illfated campaigns and sold as a slave to the quadrenes in any case illvin retrieved himon one of his trips to jokona i think it was i dont know if illvin simply bought him or what though it seems there was some unpleasant misadventure involved in it all goram has stayed by illvin since i suppose hes too old to go off and try to make his way elsewhere cattilaras gaze flicked up what did the poor fellow try to talk to you about lisss mouth opened istas hand nipped her arm before she could reply ista said im afraid hes not very lucid i had hoped he was an old retainer and could tell me about the brothers youth but it proved not to be the case cattilara smiled in bright sympathy when lord dy lutez was still alive and young you mean im afraid the chancellorwas he already roya iass chancellor way back then or just a rising courtierdidnt come much to porifors so youve explained said ista coolly she allowed cattilara to ease her and liss into their own chambers and escape back to her nursing supervision or whatever it was she did in illvins service ista wondered if there was anything lacing that goats milk in addition to the honey or what strange spices might be sprinkled on that food he bolted once a day after which he gabbled incoherently then slept the sun around unable to be roused a seductively rational consideration that one not a single dose of poison from a roknari dagger but an ongoing regimen from a source much closer to home it would account for the visible symptoms quite exactly she was sorry she had thought of it less disturbing than dreams of white fire though why did you pinch my arm liss demanded when the door had closed to stop your speech well i figured that why the marchess was not best pleased with her grooms forwardness i wished to save him a cuffing or at least sharp words oh liss frowned digesting this im sorry i let him trouble you he seemed harmless in the stables i liked how he handled the horse i never dreamed he would ask you for anything so foolish she added after a moment you were kind not to mock him or refuse his plea kindness had nothing to do with it he certainly went to great pains to make it as attractive a proposition as possible the merry glint returned to lisss eye in response to her wry tone thats so and yet it made it all seem sadder somehow ista could only nod agreement it eased istas heart to have lisss plain practical ministrations again readying her for bed liss bade her a cheerful good night and went off to sleep in the outer chamber within call she left the candle burning again at istas bidding and ista sat up on her pillows and meditated on the days new revelations her fingers drummed she felt as restless as when she had used to pace round and round the battlements at valenda castle till her feet blistered and the soles parted from her slippers and her attendants begged for mercy that had been an opiate for thought though not its aid for all that it seemed a string of accidents had brought her to porifors the bastard had claimed she was not here by chance the gods were parsimonious lord dy cazaril had once remarked to her and took their chances where they found them he had not pretended it was a positive feature godgnawed man that he was ista smiled in grim agreement how were prayers answered anyway for prayers were innumerable but miracles were rare the gods set others to their work it seemed for however vast a god might be it had only the width of one soul at a time to reach into the world of matter whether door window chink crack pinhole demons for all that they were supposedly legion were not vast possessing nothing like the infinite depth of those eyes but they seemed limited similarly except that they could chew away at the edges of their living apertures and so widen them over time so who here must she reproach for praying for her advent or perhaps not for her but just for help and sending her was but a nasty jape of the bastards she had absolved lord illvin when shed thought him senseless but if goram spoke truth he had periods of if not lucidity arousal after all and goram himself had certainly made supplication of her with the work of his hands if not words someone had laid that silent prayer of the white rose across illvins empty plate lady cattilara plainly ached with the pain of her longing for a child and her husband was not what he seemed either foolish beyond hope to send a middleaged former madwoman running down the roads of chalion to fetch up here and for what failed saint failed sorceress failed royina wife mother daughter failed well lover was not a role shed ever attempted less even than failure in her hierarchy of woe at first upon discovering lord arhyss relation to dy lutez shed guessed this for a tribunal on the gods parts for her old cold murder and sin confessed to dy cabon back in casilchas feared that she was slated to be dragged though all that stale guilt yet again fetch a bucket of water for the drowning woman but now it seemed her selfinvolved expectations were mockingly thwarted not herself but another was the center of the gods attentions her lips puffed on a bitter laugh and she was merely being what tempted to meddle tempted certainly the bastard had plainly primed her with that salacious kiss of his his questing tongue had sent a most cryptic message but that part of it she had received clearly body and mind what point to wake that sleeping appetite here now what point ever no dishes had been served up in tiny backwater valenda worth salivating over even if the curse had not paralyzed her as much below the waist as above it she was hardly to be faulted for failing her feminine duty to fall in love there she tried to imagine dy ferrej or any other gentleman of the provincaras entourage as an object of desire and snorted just as well anyway a modest lady always kept her eyes downcast she had been taught that rule by age eleven work the bastard had said not dalliance but what work healing enticing thought but if so it was not it appeared to be effected with a simple kiss perhaps shed just missed something on her first try something obvious or subtle or profound or obscene though she had little heart for a second attempt she briefly wished the god had been more explicit then took back the wish as ill phrased but as disastrous as the situation already was could even she make it worse perhaps she was here on the same principle as young physicians set to practice their experiments and new potions on the hopeless cases so that no blame attached to theirusually inevitablefailures the dying they do have at porifors a little practice piece this tightly contained domestic tragedy two brothers a barren wife one castle perhaps it was not beyond her scope not like the future of a royacy or the fate of the world not like the first time the gods had conscripted her into their service but why send me in answer to a prayer when you know perfectly well i cant do a thing without you it wasnt too hard to follow the logic of that one to its inevitable conclusion either unless i open to you you cannot lift a leaf unless you pour into me i cannot do what whether a sally port was a passage or a barrier depended not on the materials of which it was made but on its position the free will of the door as it were all doors opened in both directions she could not open the gate of herself a crack and peek out and expect to still hold the fortress but i cannot see she cursed the gods methodically in five couplets in ferocious parody of an old childhood bedtime prayer rolled over and wrapped her pillow over her head this isnt defiance this is shuffling if any god dabbled in her dreams ista did not remember it when her eyes opened in the night but regardless of the phantasms that troubled the mind the body still had to piss she sighed poked her feet out of bed and went to open the heavy wooden shutter to let in a little light near midnight she guessed by the misshapen moons silver sheen well past the full now but the night was chill and clear she rummaged under the bed for her chamber pot finished she eased the lid back on with a clink frowned at how loud the noise seemed in the stillness and pushed the pot back out of the way again she returned to the window intending to bar the shutters once more a shuffling of slippered feet sounded in the courtyard below then scuffed quickly up the stairs ista held her breath peering between the spirals of iron catti again all soft shimmering silks flowing over her body like water as she moved in the moonlight one would think the cursed girl would get cold she certainly wasnt carrying a pitcher of goats milk this time she wasnt even carrying a candle whether she clutched some smaller more perilous vial close to her chest or merely held her light robe closed ista could not tell she eased lord illvins door open in silence and slid within ista stood still at her window staring into the dark hands wrapped around the cold iron foliage all right you win i cant stand this any longer teeth grinding ista sorted through her clothes presently hung on the row of wall pegs drew down the black silk robe and shrugged it on over her pale nightdress she didnt wish to risk waking liss by blundering in the dark through the outer chamber to the door did her window even open she wasnt sure the iron rod holding the grating closed would move out of its stone groove at first but it came up with a tug the grating pushed outward she hoisted her hips up to the sill and swung her legs out her bare feet made less noise on the boards of the gallery than cattis slippers had as no orange glow had begun in the dark chamber opposite ista was unsurprised to find the inner shutters of illvins window open to the moonlight too but from istas vantage easing up to the edge of the sinuous iron vines that guarded the opening catti was scarcely more than a dark shape moving among darker shapes a scuff a breath the squeak of a floorboard softer than a mouses cry the spot on istas forehead ached like a dayold scalding i cant see a benighted thing i want to see inside the room fabric rustled ista swallowed or tried to and prayed istafashion or made a prayer of rage as some claimed to do of song or the work of their hands so long as it was from the heart the divines promised the gods would hear istas heart boiled over i have denied my eyes both inner and outer i am not child or virgin or modest wife fearing to offend no one owns my eyes now but me if i have not the stomach by now to look upon any sight in the world good or evil beautiful or vile when shall i it is far too late for innocence my only hope is the much more painful consolation of wisdom which can grow out of knowledge alone give me my true eyes i want to see i have to know lord bastard cursed be your name open my eyes the pain on her forehead flared then eased she saw a couple of the old ghosts first hovering in air not curiously for no spirits so faded and cold could hold so coherent an emotion but drawn as moths to a light cattis hand then impatiently swishing through the air driving them off as one might brush away annoying insects she sees them too ista set aside the implications of this for later reflection as her vision began to fill with that milky fire she had seen in her dream illvin was the source of it a flickering incandescence that ran the length of his body like spilled oil ignited by a brand catti was much darker solider but the details of her face body hands slowly took shape and certainty she was standing by the far side of illvins bed and the rope of white fire was running out through her twisting fingers ista turned her head just enough to follow it out the door crossing the court without question its liquid movement was away not toward the supine figure in the bed he was dressed again in the practical undyed linen robe though his hair was still neatly braided catti reached down plucked free the knot of the belt and laid each half open from shoulder to ankle he was naked beneath except for the pale white strip of a bandage encircling his chest just below the heart the hidden well from which that pale fire gushed and drained cattis face was chill still nearly expressionless she reached down to touch the bandage the white light seemed to wind around her dark fingers like wool of one thing ista was certain cattilara was not the gate for any god god light in all its hues was unmistakable to the inner eye and ista knew only one other root for such sorceries so where is the demon ista had not felt its malign presence before what she had mainly felt in cattilaras company was irritation enough to mask that deeper unease not entirely it seemed in retrospect even if ista had misperceived her recurring clotted tension around the marchess as base envy partly misperceived she corrected with grim honesty ista marshaled all the clarity of vision she could widening her inner eye to take in all the living light that rippled in unhappy disorder around the room not light darkness shadow floating under cattilaras breastbone a tight dark violet knot turned in on itself hiding if so not quite successfully like a cat in a sack that had forgotten to pull in its tail but which was the possessor which the possessed the term sorcerer applied confusingly to both spiritual states for all that the divines claimed they were theologically distinct from the outside there was little practical way to tell them apart i can tell it seems but then im looking from the other side cattilara rode this demon not the other way around it was her will that prevailed here her soul that was ascendant in that lovely body for the moment cattilara ran one fingernail down lord illvins torso from the hollow of his throat to his navel and beyond the fire seemed to intensify in its trail divert downward as if flowing through a new channel she eased herself onto the bed beside him leaned in and began to methodically caress his body from the shoulders downward from the ankles upward recentering the fountain of light over his groin her caresses grew more explicit the gray eyelids never flickered but other parts of illvins body began to respond to this focusing of attention alive he was on one level flesh if not mind visibly are they lovers then istas brows knotted for all the efficient expertise that was the most unloving touch ista had ever seen it sought to stimulate not gratify and took no satisfaction for itself if her hands had the privilege of tracing that ivory skin over whipcord muscle that darker velvet sensitivity they would not be rough abrupt clawed with tension her palms would be open drinking delight that is if she ever had the courage to touch anyone the passion here was anger not lust lord bastard your blessings are being wasted in that bed catti was whispering yes thats right come on the busy fingers worked its not fair not fair your seed is thick and yet my lords has turned to water what need have you for it what need have you for anything the hands slowed again her eyes glittered and her voice dropped still further we could ride him you know no one would ever know get a child all the same it would be half arhyss at least do it now while theres still time had that dark knot beneath her breastbone fluttered a little silence then her voice hissed i dont want secondbest he never liked me anyway all his stupid jokes i could never get there is no man for me but arhys there will never be any man for me but arhys always and forever the knot seemed to cringe inward again aye ista thought to it you are not the pregnancy she seeks ill warrant cattilaras hands opened framed taut aching flesh spinning a thread of white fire from its tip there that should hold for long enough she eased off the bed which creaked and flipped the robe almost closed again raised the sheet again very gently and lowered it to illvins chest her hand coursed just above the white line not touching it as she slipped around the foot of the bed ista ducked down in a crouch hiding her face and hair beneath her wide black sleeve the creak of the door opening and closing again the snick of a latch footsteps rising on tiptoe hurrying away ista peeked over the balustrade catti rippled away over the pavement below silks fluttering behind her as she ran following the continuous line of light light that cast neither shadow nor reflection she and it vanished under the arcade what is this sorcery cattilara ista shook her head in bewilderment i shall feed my starving eyes then perhaps when they are full enough they will teach me something and if not i shall still have snatched a crumb the hinges on the door to illvins chamber were very well oiled ista noticed the heavy carved door moved easily from here she could hear faint snores from the next chamber beyond an inner door goram or some like attendant sleeping within call should a miracle occur and illvin wake to call careful not to touch the floating line of light she eased her way around a chest and padded across the rugs to illvins bedside the opposite side from the one catti had taken she delicately lifted his sheet down opened his robe as catti had and studied him altogether ignoring the obvious for a moment she tried to study the swirling light to read some pattern or message in it the brightest was collected at his groin temporarily but nodes glimmered over navel lip and forehead as well as heart lip and forehead were extremely faint she was certain he was thinner than when she had seen him in her first dream cheeks more hollowed ribs she had not seen his ribs before but she could surely count them now she could mark the line of his pelvic bone beneath his skin her finger traced it paused he moved barely faint highly recognizable twitches of lust or perhaps the echoes of such movement coursing back through the trembling line of light like a wave returning from some farther shore minutes slipped by she could count her heartbeats she could count his they quickened for the first time his lips moved but only to emit a low groan a strain a shudder a brighter blaring of light then it was over the cold fire coursed chaotically over his body then recentered its wellspring over the dressing below his heart and pulsed on pumping out what his flesh went back to looking disturbingly dead so ista breathed isnt that curious wisdom or even knowledge eluded her still well some aspects of what she had just witnessed were very clear some werent softly she closed his robe tied its belt drew the sheet up as it had been studied the floating line of light she remembered her dream of it dare i she certainly wasnt getting anywhere just staring at it she reached forward arched her hand around it paused goram i salute you she hitched her hip up on the bed and leaned forward touched her lips to illvins then took a deeper caress from them closed her hand the light sputtered out his eyes sprang open he inhaled her breath she propped herself on one hand beside his head and gazed down into those eyes as dark as she remembered from her first visions his hand moved circled up behind her head gripped her hair oh thats a better dream voice dusky as old honey a soft northern roknaritinged accent richer by far than shed remembered from her own sleeping visions of him he kissed her in return cautiously at first then more confidentlynot so much in belief as dizzily dispensing with belief she opened her hand the light renewed itself spiraled up from him sped away with a sigh of anguish he faded again eyelids not quite meeting the gleam between his lashes was the more disturbing for being so motionless gently she closed them for him she was by no means sure what she had just done but the line of light had vanished along the whole of its length that she could see on its terminating end as well and if that was the case had it been anothers turn to swoon arhyss in cattis arms once between ignorance frenzied impatience and terror she had helped create a disaster the night arvol dy lutez had died in the dungeons of the zangre had been turbid with sorcery like this shot with searing visions like this but set in motion by an istanot like this the terror that now throbbed dully in her head she could do little about but endure in endurance if nothing else i am by now an expert impatience she could swallow like a physicians bitter draught ignorance she might advance upon like an army with banners or just a forlorn hope she could not say but ista was not ready to face another nights work like that one until she knew whether she was about to commit miracle or murder swiftly regretfully she rose from lord illvins bedside patted the sheet out straight drew her black robe about her and slipped away through the door she ran on tiptoe along the gallery lifted up the grating of her window and jerked herself back through slid the locking rod down closed and barred the inner shutters sat back in her bed and watched the crack in another moment the distant red glow from a candle wavered past and slippered feet padded swiftly down the gallery in a few minutes they returned the same wayslowly pensively in puzzlement whispered down the steps again i am ill suited to this murky task the bastard wasnt even her proper god ista had no doubt of her parentage nor of the objects of her clumsy stunted hopeless desires though a disaster out of season i surely am but however many better godly couriers had been dispatched she appeared to be the one who had actually arrived so one way or another she was determined to meet lord illvin awake tomorrow what was raving incoherence to others might prove plain as god light to a madwoman chapter thirteen the sun was barely over the horizon when lady cattilara bustled in ready to escort ista to the morning temple services with a ladies archery contest and a luncheon to follow this time ista had her excuses marshaled and ready im afraid i tried to do too much yesterday i was feverish and ill last night i mean to keep quietly to my chambers today and rest please do not think that i must be entertained every minute marchess lady cattilara lowered her voice to a confidential tone in truth the town of porifors has little diversion to offer we are the frontier here and as harsh and simple as the task we must perform but i have written to my fatheroby is the second town of caribastos after the provincars own seat i am sure my father would be deeply honored to receive you there in a manner more befitting your rank i am unfit to travel anywhere just yet but when i am oby would be a most welcome halt on my return journey marginally less exposed than porifors to the dangers of the border and rather more heavily manned ista could not help reflecting that is a decision for another day lady cattilara nodded sympathetic understanding but looked pleased at the royinas vaguely worded acceptance yes i would imagine you would be relieved to see me shuffled off elsewhere orsomething would ista studied her outwardly she seemed the same as ever all soft green silks and light linens over a body of yielding feminine promise inwardly ista glanced at liss hovering solicitously to finish dressing istas hair and wrap her in her outer garments a wholesome person had a soul congruent with the body spirit occluded by the matter that generated and nourished it and thus nearly as invisible to second sight as to the sight of the eyes in the present godtouched magnification of her sensitivity ista fancied she could perceive not intellect or emotion but the state of the soul itself lisss was bright rippling colorful with swirling energies and entirely centered the maid who waited to carry off the wash water had a quieter soul darkened with a smear of resentment but equally congruous with the rest of her cattilaras spirit was the darkest and densest roiling with strain and secret distress beneath its surface another boundary lurked darker and tighter still like a bead of red glass dropped in a glass of red wine the demon seemed much more tightly closed this morning than it had last night hiding from what from me ista realized the god scars upon her that were invisible to mortal eyes would surely shine like watch fires in the dusk to a demons peculiar perceptions but did the demon share all its observations with the mount it rode how long indeed had lady cattilara been infested by her passenger the dying bear had felt ragged as if its demon were some ravenous tumor spreading tendrils into every part of it consuming and replacing the bears soulstuff with itself whatever else cattilaras soul was it seemed still mostly her own did lord arhys return safely last night to your hearts ease ista inquired oh yes cattilaras smile grew warm and secret soon your prayers to the mother will change from supplication to thanksgiving ill warrant oh i hope it may it be so cattilara signed herself my lord has only a daughteralthough liviana is a pretty child rising nine years old lives with her maternal grandparentsbut i know he longs for a son if i might bear him one he would honor me above all women above perhaps the memory of his first wife do you compete with a dead woman girl the blurred light of retrospective could lend a perfection hard for breathing flesh to match despite herself ista was moved to pity i remember this awkward period of waitingthe monthly disappointmentsmy mother used to write me severe letters full of advice on my diet as if it were my fault that my womb did not fill cattilaras face livened with eager interest how unjust roya ias was quite an old manmuch older than arhys she hesitated curiously then asked in a shyer voice did you do anything special to get iselle ista grimaced in remembered aggravation every ladyinwaiting in the zangre whether theyd ever borne a child or not had a dozen country remedies to press upon me cattilara inquired with unexpected wryness did they offer any to ias a fresh young bride seemed tonic enough for him at first iass oddly diffident early lustfulness had faded over time and with his otherwise wellconcealed disappointment at a girl childs birth age and the curse more than accounted for the rest of his problems ista suspected that rather than swallowing noxious potions he had taken to adding a private detour for stimulation by his lover before he visited her chamber if she had continued infertile might lord dy lutez have persuaded ias to cut out the middle step and admit him directly to her bed how long before the relentless expectation would have pressured ista to compliance righteous indignation at such blandishment burned all the hotter when it concealed real temptation for arvol dy lutez had been a striking man that part at least of cattilaras strange rage at her brotherinlaw illvin presented no block to istas understanding whatsoever ista blinked as a solution to the knotty problem of having cattilara and her demonunderfoot at illvins noontime awakening occurred to her an ugly ploy but effective she added smoothly for myself the last thing i tried before i became pregnant with teidez was the poultice of fingerlily flowers that remedy was the contribution of lady dy varas old nurse as i recall lady dy vara swore by it shed had six children by then cattilaras gaze grew suddenly intent fingerlilies i dont believe i know that flower does it grow here in the north i dont know i thought i saw some growing near the meadow where lord arhys had his camp the other day liss would recognize the plant im sure behind cattilaras shoulder lisss brows flew up in protest ista raised two fingers to command her silence ista went on the old nurse had it that they must be gathered by the supplicant herself barefoot at high noon when the sun is most fecund cut with a silver knife while praying to the mother the petals wrapped in a band of cheeseclothor silk for a ladyand worn about the waist until she next lies with her husband what was the wording of the prayer asked lady cattilara nothing special so long as it was sincere this worked for you how can one be sure in fact shed never quacked herself with any of the suggestions shed been pelted with by her wellwishers except for prayer and we all know how well that worked in the end ista mentally composed her next lure but was cut short by her fish leaping into her net royina since there is to be no ladies fete this noon might i borrow your handmaiden liss to assist me in locating some of these wonderful blooms certainly marchess ista smiled i shall rest and write letters i will see you are brought luncheon cattilara promised and curtseyed herself out to go look for a silver knife and a silk scarf ista guessed royina liss hissed when the marchesss steps had receded down the outside stairs i dont know anything about this flower youre talking about actually its a short green shoot that has little flowers dangling in a row called mothers bells but it hardly matters what i wish of you is that you get the marchess as far away from porifors as you can persuade her to ride by noon let her pick any flower that isnt poisonous now there was another temptation ista recalled childhood encounters with blisterivy and stinging nettle and smiled grimly but whatever was going on with cattilara was deathly serious and no pretext for japery no matter how the girl set istas teeth on edge mark if she becomes suddenly anxious to return or otherwise behaves or speaks oddly delay her as long as you reasonably may however you can liss frowned her brow wrinkling why ista hesitated when the stationmaster hands you a sealed pouch do you peek inside no royina said liss indignantly i need you to be my courier in this liss blinked oh she executed her bowcurtsey the exercise will do the marchess no harm though it would be well also if you are subtle in your misdirection and take care not to offend her that the demon dared not show itself before ista did not guarantee that it dared not show itself at all ista had no idea of its powers and limits yet baffled but obliging liss undertook the charge ista ate a light breakfast in her room opened the shutters to the morning light and settled down with borrowed pens and paper first was a short sharp note to the provincar of tolnoxo none too delicately conveying istas displeasure with his casual treatment of her courier and his failure more speedily to produce the lost foix and learned dy cabon and a demand of better assistance to ferda a more candid letter to the archdivine of maradi pleading for the temples aid in searching for the afflicted foix and his companion liss had found her way to porifors speedily enough what dire delay could be keeping the pair of them ista subdued her pentup anxiety by penning a letter to chancellor dy cazaril in cardegoss commending liss and ferda and foix and their company for their recent courage and loyalty then a bland missive to valenda assuring all of her safety neglecting to mention any of the unpleasant details of her recent adventures a somewhat less bland but equally reassuring note to iselle and bergon asserting that she was safe but desiring conveyance she glanced through the iron grille toward the opposite gallery and set the last one aside unfinished not so sure she desired conveyance just yet after a time spent thoughtfully tapping her cheek with the feather of her quill she reopened and added a postscript to the letter to lord dy cazaril my other sight has returned there is a difficult situation here at length a page appeared to collect liss for her noon expedition with the marchess sometime after that a maid arrived with a luncheon for ista on a tray accompanied by a gentlewoman of the marchesss retinue evidently detailed to keep ista company ista bade the maid set the tray on the table and leave her and ruthlessly dismissed the disappointed ladyinwaiting as well as soon as their footsteps had faded outside ista slipped through the outer chamber and out the door the sun she noted grimly shone down high and hot into the stone court making black accent marks of the shadows at the opposite end of the gallery she knocked on lord illvins carved door it swung open gorams rusty voice began now did you have that fool of a cook stew the meat softer today then died away royina he gulped and ducked his head but did not invite her inside good afternoon goram ista lifted her hand and pressed the door wide he gave way helplessly looking frightened the room was dim and cool but a grid of light fell through the shutters onto the woven rugs making the muted colors briefly blaze istas eye summed the semblances with her first dream vision but dismissed them abruptly from her attention when her second sight took in goram his soul was bizarre in appearance unlike any other that she had yet seen it reminded her of nothing so much as a tattered cloth that had been splashed with vitriol or eaten away by moths until it hung together only by a few strained strings she thought of the ragged bear but goram clearly was not presently demoninfested nor was he dying he isnt well though isnt quite right she had to wrench her perception back to his gnarled physical surface i wish to speak with your master when he wakes she told him he um dont always talk sos you can make out anything thats all right the grooms head drew in upon his shoulders in the turtle hunch again lady catti she wouldnt like it did she chide you yesterday after i left and how fiercely he nodded looking at his feet well shes busy now she has ridden out from the castle you need not tell her i was here when the servant brings lord illvins tray take it and send him away and no one will know oh he seemed to digest her words a moment then nodded and shuffled backward allowing her entry lord illvin lay upon the bed in his linen robe his hair unbraided and brushed back as she had first seen it in her dream motionless as death but not stripped of soulstuff yet neither was his soul centered and congruent like lisss or even like tattered gorams it was as though it were being forcibly pulled out from his heart to stream away in that nowfamiliar line of white fire the barest tint of it remained within the confines of his actual body ista took a seat on a chest by the wall to illvins right and studied that silent profile will he wake soon most likely carry on as you usually do then goram nodded nervously and pulled a stool and a small table up to the opposite side of the bed he jumped up at a knock on the door ista leaned back out of view as he accepted a heavy tray covered with a linen towel and sent its bearer off the manservant sounded relieved to be so dismissed goram settled down on his stool his hands gripping each other and stared at lord illvin silence settled thickly over the room the line of white fire gradually thinned drew down to the merest faint thread illvins body seemed to refill his soulstuff deeply dense to istas second sight but churning in complex agitation illvins lips parted abruptly his breath drew in then huffed out his eyes opened to stare wildly at the ceiling he jerked suddenly upright his hands covering his face goram goram panic edged his voice here mlord said goram anxiously ah there yare illvins speech was slurred his shoulders slumped his rubbed his face dropped his hands to the coverlet stared at his feet the grooves deepening on his high brow i had that desperate dream again last night the shining woman five gods but it was vivid this time i touched her hair goram looked across at ista illvins head turned to follow his glance his dark eyes widened you who are you do i dream still no not this time she hesitated my name is ista i am here for a reason but i do not know what it is his lips puffed on a painful laugh ah me too goram hastened to arrange his pillows he fell back into them as if this little effort had already exhausted him goram followed up immediately with a bite of stewed meat on a spoon redolent with herbs and garlic heres meat mlord eat eat quickly illvin took it in evidently before he thought to resist he gulped it down and waved the following bite away he turned his head toward ista again you dont shine in the dark now did i dream you yes oh his brows knotted in bewilderment how do you know he failed to duck the insistent spoon and was perforce silenced again lord illvin what do you remember about the night you were stabbed in princess umerues chambers stabbed me i was not his hand felt beneath his robe for the bandage around his torso curse you goram why do you keep winding this benighted rag around me i have told you i have told you he clawed it away pulled it loose flung it down on the foot of the bed the skin of his chest was unmarked ista stood came to the bedside and turned the white cloth over the dressing pad was soaked with a dull redbrown bloodstain she angled it toward his gaze raising her brows he frowned fiercely and shook his head i have no wound i have no fever i do not vomit why do i sleep so much i grow so weak i totter like a newborn calf i cannot think ive gods please not a palsystroke drooling and crippled his voice sharpened in alarm arhys i saw arhys fall at my feet bloodwhere is my brother gorams voice went exaggeratedly soothing now mlord now the march is fine ive told you that fifty times i see him every day why doesnt he come to see me now the slurred tongue was querulous edging on a whine like an overtired child he does youre asleep dont fret you so the harried goram glowered briefly at ista here eat meat arhys was in umerues chamber that night too already the tale began to diverge from cattilaras tidy version did lord pechma stab you ista asked illvin blinked in confusion he gulped down the latest bite goram inserted and said pechma that feckless fool is he still here at porifors what has pechma to do with any of this ista said patiently was lord pechma there at all where in princess umerues chamber no why should he be the golden bitch treated him like a slave same as the rest doubledealing double istas voice sharpened golden bitch umerue mother and daughter but she was cruelly beautiful sometimes but when she forgot to look at me she was plain as when i saw her before in jokona but when her amber eyes were on me i would have played her slave no not played been but she turned her eyes on poor arhys all women do well yes she saw him she wanted him she took him as easily as picking up a up a something i figured it out i followed she had him down on the bed she had her mouth on his meat said goram and shoved in another bite an exotic woman a virile man a midnight visit a spurned suitor the roles the same but the actors altered from cattilaras version not pechma but illvin the murderous intruder on some intimate scene it hung together it was not hard to imagine that umerue sent to woo illvin for the sake of some alliance with jokona might for either personal or political reasons switch targets to his elder and more powerful brother cattilara was an impediment to such a design true but she was just the sort of bump in the road that subtle poisons were designed to smooth away what was harder to imagine was any such seductress getting past cattilara to lord arhys in the first place cattilara plainly regarded ista in the light of an elderly aunt albeit one with a deliciously tragic romantic history but nevertheless the marchess had made clear her claim on arhys in every possible way before istas eyes was her fierce possessiveness just habitor the result of a recent fright the new tale had a weight of likelihood the despised bastard half disenfranchised already having a beautiful princess dangled before his eyes only to have her suddenly snatched away by an elder brother who had it all including a beautiful wife with no need of more the rich stealing from the poor reason aplenty to attempt fratricide in a jealous rage lesser men committed like acts everywhere quadrene or quintarian of every race and in every clime so illvin attacking his brother and his paramour in a fit of jealousy knifing the bitchprincess having the weapon wrested from him and knifed in turn by the horrified arhys and left for dead in the sheets wait illvin carefully stripped naked his strangely unbloodied clothes neatly piled on a chair the knife transferred back to umerues body and then left for dead ista revised this her nose wrinkled in doubt lord pechma and his horse somehow got rid of too concealment didnt seem arhyss style butsuppose he feared a war of reprisal from the prince of jokona for the death of his beautifulor plainsister reason enough to steel himself to perform the rearrangements to cast the blame upon the fled jokonan courtier or murdered and buried jokonan courtier as the case might be arhys certainly had the strength and nerve for such an act the misdirection would also have served to conceal arhyss infidelity from his sleeping wife arhyss public prayers and concern for his fallen brother more misdirection or the fruit of guilt another nicely tidy tale it only failed to account for the advent of cattilaras demon and one mortal wound seeming to be shared between two brothers and the fact that cattilara seemed to know more about what was going on than arhys did and istas dreams and the rope of fire and the visitation of a god and i believe said lord illvin in a thin voice that i am going mad well said ista dryly do you desire an experienced conductor on that road if so i am your woman he squinted at her in utter bewilderment from her dream in the tent she remembered arhyss wail of woe in a candlelit chamber but was that an image from the past or an image from the future she had no doubt that the man before her was capable of clever and subtle lies when he had his wits about him it was equally clear that his wits had gone away on the road as beggar boys just now he might babble or rave or hallucinate but he did not lie so how many different ways might three people kill two of each other with one knife ista rubbed her forehead goram bobbed an unhappy bow at her lady please he must get a chance to eat and piss no dont let her go illvins arm shot out fell back weakly she nodded at the anxious groom i will go out for a little not far ill come back soon she added to the agitated illvin i promise she let herself out onto the gallery and leaned against the wall with her arms crossed she studied the floating line of light reduced to a faint thread but still unbroken so illvin never saw his brother to speak with arhys never saw illvin awake since that night the two had never had a chance to compare their experiences or whatever fragments they each remembered of their experiences lady cattilara however saw both spoke to both told whatever tales she pleased to both let us see if we can change that condition ista waited a while for goram to finish attending to his masters more intimate needs to get him back to bed to hastily stuff whatever foods made soft for a sick man down his gullet that time permitted the rope was beginning to thicken slightly then noticeably she reached out and delicately pinched thumb and forefinger around it in an o lord bastard guide me as you will or in your case whim she willed the rope to shorten running back through her palm like spun wool more than just sight had been included in the bastards gift it seemed for the manipulation seemed effortless at first she mimed drawing it in hand over hand but soon discovered she could simply bid it to flow she kept her eye on the arcade opposite where the passage came through from the next court lord arhys strode through onto the sunsplashed stones he wore light clothing suited to the hot afternoon his gray linen vestcloak with the gold trim swinging about his calves he was clean his beard newtrimmed he yawned hugely glanced up in concern at the corner room saw her leaning on the balustrade and gave her a courtiers bow just wake from a nap did you and i know exactly how late you were up last night with difficulty ista tore her gaze from his elegant surface his soul was gray strangely pale off center as if it lagged a little after him and left a trail of smoke ah yes now i see ista stood up straight and moved toward the stairs to meet him climbing up they came facetoface with her standing two steps above the tread upon which his booted feet paused arhys waited politely smiling at her in puzzlement royina she took that strong chin in her hand shivering at the tactile brush of his beard on her palm leaned forward and kissed him on the mouth his eyes widened and he made a surprised muffled noise but he did not retreat she tasted his mouth cool as water and as flavorless she drew back sadly so that didnt work either his lips twisted up in a confused enchantingly crooked grin and he cocked his eyebrows at her as if to say what is this lady as if women kissed him spontaneously on staircases every day and he considered it uncivil to dodge lord arhys said ista how long have you been dead chapter fourteen arhyss smile grew fixed and wary he regarded ista with startled concern as if he feared the mad royina was having a relapse right in front of him and as her inadvertent host he would be held responsible madamyou jest an invitation to recant a clear suggestion please dont do this my kisses are not usually so scorned i have seldom felt further from jest in my life he laughed uneasily i admit my fevers have been a trouble to me this season but i assure you i am far from the grave you have no fever you dont even sweat your skin is the same temperature as the air if it were not so beastly hot in this climate more people would have noticed by now he continued to stare at her with the same perplexed expression five gods he really does not know her heart sagged i think she said carefully that you need to talk with your brother he grimaced in pain would that i could i pray for it daily but he does not wake from his poisoned wound yes he does each noon when you have your little nap your only sleep of the day has your wife not told you this she goes almost every day to oversee his care and sometimes at night as well although its not exactly his care that concerns her then i expect royina i assure you it is not so spoke with him come with me the disbelieving tilt of his mouth did not change but when she turned and mounted the stairs again he followed they entered illvins wellkept chamber goram sitting watching his charge saw lord arhys and shot to his feet offering him his jerky awkward bow and a servile mutter that might have been mlord arhyss gaze swept down the still form in the bed his lips thinned in disappointment it is all the same ista said lord arhys sit down i shall stand royina his frown upon her was growing less and less amused suit yourself the rope of white fire between the two was short and thick now that she knew to look for it she could feel the demons presence in it as well a faint violet glow like a channel that underlay everything it ran three ways but only one link flowed with soulstuff she wrapped her hand about the bond running between the two men squeezing it down to half its breadth the constrained white fire backwashed into illvins body lord arhyss knees gave way and he collapsed in a heap goram help the march to a chair ista instructed hold she silently commanded her invisible ligature and it did she walked up by illvins bedside studying the nodes of light go up she commanded them silently and made to push them with her hands concentrate them at the forehead and the mouth as cattilara had at that other theological point the light pooled as she willed stay there she cocked her head and studied the effect yes i think goram hurried to drag the chair made of polished interlaced curves of wood out from the wall to illvins bedside he hauled the startledlooking arhys up by the shoulders and sat him in it arhys closed his mouth rubbing at his face with a suddenly weak and shaking hand grown numb was he she ruthlessly stole gorams stool and set it at the end of the bed settling herself where she could best watch both brothers faces illvins eyes opened he took a breath and worked his jaw weakly he began to push himself up on one elbow until his gaze took in his brother sitting at his right hand gaping at him arhys his voice rang with joy his sudden smile transformed his face ista rocked back blinking at the engaging man so revealed goram bustled to shove pillows behind his back he struggled up further openmouthed with wonder ah ah you are alive i did not believe themthey would never meet my eyes i thought they lied to spare meyou are saved i am saved five gods we are all saved he collapsed back wheezing and grinning burst into shocking tears for five breaths then regained control of his gasping arhys stared like a stunned ox the slur was gone from illvins voice now ista noted with relief though his lower limbs lay nearly paralyzed she prayed that his wits would be likewise clarified in a level tone that she was far from feeling she asked why did you believe your brother to be dead ye gods what was i to think i felt that cursed knife go into the hilt or i never survived a battle at some other poor bastards expense i could feel the push and give against my hand when it pierced the heart i almost vomited five gods please not fratricide i didnt want this to be fratricide she kept her voice steady despite the shaking in her belly how did you come to this pass tell me everything tell me from the beginning she took him off to her chambers he added to arhys i was in a panic because cattilara had heard it from that meddling maidservant and was determined to go up after you i was sure she was unnatural by then which she said ista princess umerue yes the glittering golden girl arhyshis grin returned notably twistedif you would please stop falling over backward every time some aspiring seductress blows a kiss at you it would be a great comfort to your relatives arhys his eyes crinkling with a delight that mirrored illvins bent his head in a sheepish look i swear i do nothing to encourage them that ill grant is perfectly true illvin assured ista as an aside not that its any consolation to the rest of us watching the women flock past us without a glance in order to hang on him reminds me of a kitchen boy feeding his hens its not my doing they throw themselves at me he glanced at ista and added dryly on staircases even you could duck suggested illvin sweetly try it sometime i do blast you youve a highly flattering view of my ripening years if you imagine cattilara leaves me any spare interest in dalliance these days ista wasnt quite sure how this statement squared with his actions on their first ride but perhaps he was as charming to all rescued ladies if only to divert them from weeping fits with regret ista cut across theirobviously practiced as well as obviously hugely relievedbanter no doubt the god had sent her into this painful maze baiting her with equal parts of curiosity and secret obligation but she had no desire to linger in it then why did you go to princess umerues chambers if you did arhys hesitated the levity draining from his face he rubbed his forehead and then his jaw and hands i dont quite know it seemed like a good idea at the time illvin said cattilara would have it that the princess had slipped you a love potion and you were not in control of yourself for all my impatience with her fancies i hoped that it might be so because the alternative was much worse what that id fallen in love with umerue no that wasnt what i was thinking istas gaze upon him sharpened what were you thinking illvins face grew introspective grave because shed had the same effect on me at first then she saw arhys and forgot me dropped me to earth like a sack of bran and my wits came back to me i finally remembered where id seen her before except that it wasnt quite herarhys do you recall my little trip down to jokona about three years ago when i went disguised as a horse dealer the time i brought back goram and the ground plan of castle hamavik yes i bought some stock from the lord of hamavik paid too much which made him happy and loquacious and inclined to take me for a fool he treated me to dinner at his seaside villa by which i might have guessed how much hed skinned me if i hadnt known already he showed off all his best possessions to me including briefly his wife a princess of jokona granddaughter of the golden general himself he told me as if she were a pretty bit of blood stock hed done a sharp trade for which i gather he must have for the regent dowager joen is not reputed to spend her children cheaply five gods but he was a repulsive old goat golden she was but she was the saddest silent mouse of a woman id ever seen drab fearful and she didnt speak more than six words of lbran not the same princess then said arhys the prince of jokona has a pack of sisters you mistook one for another perhaps umerues tongue was bold and witty yes she made bilingual puns yet unless she has a twin sister of the same name id swear her for the same woman illvin sighed then his brow wrinkled catti went ripping up to the princesss chambers in a fury and i went charging after her i was afraid ofi knew not what but i thought if nothing else i might somehow warn you and prevent a scene my faithful flank man this went beyond the bounds of duty i thought you were going to owe me and i meant to collect too i begged catti to at least let me go in first but she ducked under my elbow our tumbling entry could not have been more ill timed speaking of bold tongues dead men ista noted couldnt blush but they could at least look shamefaced even i couldnt blame catti for going into a frenzy illvin continued but if that over decorated dagger had been sitting at the bottom of that pile of gear instead of atop it i might have grabbed her quicker she went straight for the princess screaming wanted to cut her face off for understandable reasons i remember that part said arhys slowly as if unsure it comes back you pushed the golden slut out of the way i seized cattis knife hand and between us we might have saved the moment if you hadnt tripped lunging out of bed were you in such a whirl of lust that you couldnt wait to undress if id had such an opportunitynever mind but the best swordsman in caribastos hobbled by his own trousers five gods arhys catti wouldnt have had the strength to drive that big blade home if she had been trying for you if you hadnt toppled into us with your ankles twisted up his indignation faded and his excited voice slowed i felt the blade go in i was sure wed done you among us all it wasnt cattis fault arhys said hastily oh the look of woe upon her faceit was like being stabbed again no wonder she after that after that i dont remember you fell at my feet the fool girl yanked the blade back out of youi shouted no catti too late though im not sure if leaving it in would have staunched anything the way you spurted i was trying to get one hand pressed to your wound and hang on to cattis sleeve with the other but she twisted right out of her over robe umerue was shrieking climbing back over the bed to try to get to youi wasnt sure why catti plunged the knife straight into her stomach umerue grabbed the hilt then looked up and gave me the saddest look and said oh in this lost little voice like like her voice when first i ever saw her his voice faded further she just said oh cattis face took on a very strange air and after that i dont remember he sank back on his pillows why cant i istas hands were trembling she hid them in her skirt what do you remember next after that lord illvin she asked waking up here with my head buzzing dizzy and sick and then waking up here again and again and again and again andsomething must have happened to me was i hit from behind cattilara said pechma stabbed you said arhys he cleared his throat and umerue but he wasnt there did he come in after us and besides i am notillvins hand went to his chest beneath the sober linen and came away smeared carmineow stabbed what was pechma like asked ista doggedly he was umerues clerk said arhys he had a disastrous taste in clothing and was the butt of her retinues jokestheres always one such feckless fellow when cattilara told me he had attacked illvin i said it was impossible she said it had better be possible or wed have a war with prince sordso before the body was carted home and that no one among the jokonans would stand up for pechma and indeed she proved right about that she also said to be patient that illvin would recover i was beginning to doubt but now i see it is so ista said youve eaten no food for over two months yet you didnt wonder illvin glanced up from his smeared hand to stare at arhys startled his eyes narrowing i ate i just couldnt keep it all down arhys shrugged i seem to get enough but hes going to be all right now said illvin slowly isnt he ista hesitated no hes not her gaze traveled to the silent auditor of all this half crouched by the far wall goram what did you think of princess umerue the noise he made in his throat sounded like a dog growling she was bad that one how could you tell his face wrinkled when she looked at me i was cold afraid i stayed out of her sight ista considered his ravaged soulstuff i imagine you would i would like to think that goram helped bring me back to my senses said illvin ruefully but im afraid that was just the effect of umerues inattention ista studied goram briefly his soulscars were a distraction in this reckoning she decided they were an old injury old and dark if as she was beginning to suspect hed once been demongnawed it was well before this time which left umerue was a sorceress ista stated a brief fierce grin flashed across illvins face i guessed it he hesitated how do you know and after another moment who are you i have seen her lost demon ista decided not to say just yet she desperately wished dy cabon were here now with the theological training to unravel this tangle illvin was staring at her more warily of a sudden worriedbut not she thought disbelieving they say you were seminarytrained in your youth lord illvin you cant have forgotten it all i was told by a learned divine of the bastards own order that if a demons mount dies and the departing soul has not the strength left to drag it back to the gods it jumps to another the sorceress died and the demon is in neither of you i assure you whos left arhys was looking sick for a walking corpse this ought to have been an improvement ista thought but it wasnt catti has it he whispered he wasnt arguing with her about this one she noticed ista nodded approval feeling absurdly like some tutor commending a pupil for getting his sums right yes catti has it now and her bidding is for it to keep you alive well animate in as far as its powers may be forced to work that way arhyss mouth opened closed he said at last but those things are dangerous they consume people alivesorcerers lose their souls to them catti she must be treatedi must summon the temple theologians to cast it out of her hold a moment arhys said illvin sounding strained i think we need to think this through a thumping sounded on the gallery outside running feet two pairs the door was yanked open cattilara barefoot in disarrayed riding dress her hair windwild tumbled through gasping liss followed nearly as out of breath arhys cattilara cried and flung herself upon him five gods five gods what has that woman done to you sorry royina liss muttered to istas ear we were in the middle of this field when she suddenly cried that there was something wrong with her lord ran for her horse and galloped off there was no diverting her with anything short of a crossbow bolt sh its all right ista quelled a twinge of nausea at her trick on catti effective though it had been wellsufficient wait by goram but do not speak or interrupt no matter how strange what you hear may sound liss dipped dutifully and went to lean on the wall by the groom who nodded welcome she cocked her head dubiously at lady cattilara sobbing in lord arhyss enfeebled grip cattilara grasped his hand in turn tested its weakness and turned her tearstained face up to her husbands what has she done to you she demanded what have you done to me catti he asked gently in turn he glanced at his brother to both of us cattilara looked around glaring at ista and at illvin you tricked me arhys whatever they say they he illvins brows went up now theres a comprehensive indictment he murmured ista tried to ignore the distracting surfaces for a moment the demon was as tightly closed as ista had yet seen it dense and shiny as if all other routes blocked it was trying to flee inside itself it seemed to tremble as if in terror why what does it think i can do to it more what does it know that i dont ista frowned in mystification catti arhys stroked her wild hair patting it smooth absorbing her sobs on his shoulder its time to tell the truth sh now look at me he took her chin turned it to his face smiled into her wet eyes with a look that would have made istas heart she thought melt and run down into her shoes it had an even less useful effect on the hysterical catti she slithered out of his weak grip and crouched at his feet weeping on his knees like a lost child her only clear words a repeated no no illvin rolled his eyes ceiling ward and rubbed at his forehead in exasperation with an equally weak swipe he looked as though he would gladly trade what was left of his soul at this moment for escape from the room he glanced up to meet istas commiserating gaze she held up two fingers wait yes yes arhys murmured to his wife his hand on her head gave it a soft little shake from side to side i command all here at porifors all its lives are in my hands i have to know all yes good arhys muttered illvin stand up to her for once ista pressed her hand to her mouth for arhys was speaking yes better that this should come from him she will not resist him or at least not as much what happened after you stabbed the sorceress arhys asked how did you capture her demon catti sniffled swallowed choked and coughed in a rough voice she answered it just came to me i didnt do anything it was either me or illvin and it was more afraid of illvin a grim little smile fleeted across her face it promised me anything if i would flee away but there was only one thing i wanted i wanted you back i made it put you back it still wants to escape but ill never let it never will against will the demon ista suspected was experienced strong with the consumption of more than one life but on certain narrow issues cattilara was more willful more than willful obsessed if the demon had mistaken catti for a more tractable mount than illvin it had been in for an interesting surprise for all her exasperation with catti ista felt a certain dark satisfaction at the thought of the demons dismay you do realize ista said that the demon is stealing life from illvin to keep arhys moving cattis head jerked up its only fair he stabbed arhys let him pay hold hard said illvin it wasnt just me in that botchup if you hadnt grabbed my hand it wouldnt have happened no nor if arhys hadnt tripped or if umerue had dodged the other way or or any of a hundred other things but we all did and it did his mouth set in a flat line yes said ista slowly four persons combined to effect an outcome desired i daresay by none i am not so sure about the fifth party present its true said illvin that demons thrive on misfortune and disorder it is their nature and the magic they lend partakes of that nature or so the divines always taught me he turned against his pillows and studied his sisterinlaw uneasily well this demon was sent here said cattilara on purpose it was supposed to seduce illvin or arhys or both and take castle porifors from within for the prince of jokona i stopped that from happening as much as any soldier pushing back a scaling ladder in a siege she tossed her hair and glowered as if daring anyone to criticize this achievement illvins lips pursed in a look of sudden enlightenment arhyss brows drew down in dismay and lord pechma prompted ista oh pechma was easy the demon knew all about him cattilara sniffed disdain all i had to do after id arranged illvin and walked arhys back to our bed was find pechma and accuse him and convince him he would be hanged out of hand in the morning if he didnt run away he did the rest himself hes probably still running the young woman had spent a busy night ista reflected the artistic malice of illvins naked arrangement took her aback a little revenge perhaps upon a man whod remained steadfastly undazzled by his brothers choice of bride so none of this is arhyss fault catti continued passionately why should he be the only one to suffer she turned her angry face to ista so youwhatever you have done to bind him to this chairyou let him up ista touched her lips very many people suffer who are not at fault she said its not a new condition in the world i willas you say releasearhys in a while but all must speak freely first the temple tells us that demons work their wonders at a terrible cost just how long do you imagine you can keep this one going cattilaras jaw set i dont know as long as i breathe and have will because if the demon magic stops arhys dies if that is indeed the alternative illvin put in suddenly perhaps this turn and turnabout is no bad thing i can stand to share half say suppose half of each day should be arhyss and half mine and then he need not be a fratricide or even onequarter of a fratricide the rising hope was writ plain in his face cattilara brightened at the unexpected offer of alliance and she looked up at illvin with new speculation ista hesitated shaken in her certainties uncertainties her bleak thought corrected i think she said this cannot work or cannot work for very long however starved it is the demon must be slowly consuming catti or it should have faded by now or been unable to maintain its spell learned dy cabon told me that the demon always turns the tables on its mount given enough time so arhys is saved i will take the risk said cattilara arhys drew a sharp breath of protest and shook his head seems almost worthwhile to me muttered illvin darkly but its not a risk its a certainty and arhys dies the same and cattilara is destroyed but when how long thats the question cattilara argued all sorts of other things could happen before then yes and i can tell you some of them said ista illvin i am sure studied the theology of death magic in the bastards seminary i had a closer acquaintance with it once arhys isnt alive now the demon captured his severed spirit and returned it to haunt his own body a familiar congenial abode i suspect in some ways but he is cut off from the support of his god and his spirit is equally torn from the nourishment of matter he cannot maintain life except by what is plundered from illvin nor increase it nor engender it cattilara flinched hunching her shoulders in protest ista felt her way further into the dark consequences so his fate must be the fate of the lost spirits slowly to fade to blur to grow unmindful of himself the world his memorieshis loves and hatesto forget it is a sort of senility i have seen the blind ghosts drifting it is a quiet damnation and mercifulfor them less merciful for a man still in his body i think you mean hell lose his wits said illvin aghast thats not so good said arhys i have not so many to spare as you he attempted to smile at his brother the attempt failed miserably ista bit her lip and forged on i have a guess why the demon gives illvin so little time barely enoughno not even enoughto eat why their shares are so very uneven i think when illvin is awake the demon loses ground maintaining arhyss body for every hour of waking life given to illvin the dead body decays a little more in time the rot shall start to be evident to the senses of others it was evident to her heightened sensitivity already now that she knew how to look i do not love my new education is that the fate you desire for your handsome husband lady cattilara a senile mind trapped in a decomposing body cattilaras lips moved no no but she did not speak she hid her face against arhyss knees gods why did you give this vile task to me ista spoke on relentlessly illvin is dying too being slowly drained of more life than he can replace but if illvin dies arhys will stop as well both their mothers sons lost together not her wish i can assure you which end will come first in this evil race i cannot guess but that is the ultimate arithmetic of demon magic two lives traded for one then that one subtracted leaving for all your pains nothing do i have my tally theologically correct lord illvin yes he whispered he swallowed and found his voice demon magicthe divines sayinvariably engenders more chaos than it ever produces order the cost is always higher than the prize some who dabble in demons try to spread the cost to others and keep the prize for themselves it seldom works for long although it is said that some very wise and subtle theologians temple sorcerers can use the demon magic according to its nature and not against it and yet effect good i never quite understood that part ista was very unsure about her next move but it seemed the logical progression she had a profound mistrust of logic it was quite as possible to reason ones way step by slow step into a mire of deep sin as it was to fall into it headlong i have now heard depositions from all concerned here except one i think this demon has acquired the gift of speech one wonders from whom if it can make bilingual puns but anyway i would speak with it lady cattilara can you let it come up for a time no she frowned at istas look and added its not me thats the problem it tries to get away it will try to run off with my body if it can hm said ista she didnt greatly trust cattilara but this assertion could well be true tie her to the chair liss suggested laconically from her place by the wall ista looked over her shoulder at the girl liss raised her eyebrows and shrugged she kept a detached posture but her eyes were wide and fascinated as if she were watching a play and wanted to hear the next act you dont understand said cattilara it wont want to go back in afterward i will undertake to hold it said ista illvin frowned curiously at her how i dont think you can said cattilara it does or it would not fear me so i think oh cattilaras face screwed up in thought i think said arhys slowly this prisoners interrogation could be a most important one it touches on the defense of porifors will you dare it dear cattifor me she sniffed frowned set her teeth i know you have the courage he added watching her ohvery well she made a face and climbed to her feet but i dont think this is going to work the young marchess watched with dismay as goram with lisss assistance dragged the halfparalyzed arhys out of the chair to sit on the floor propped up against the side of the bed cattilara cooperated though plopping down in his vacated spot and laying her hands out on the wooden arms goram hastened to produce makeshift ties from illvins stock of belts and sashes use the cloths arhys advised anxiously so they will not cut into her skin ista glanced at the scabs circling her own wrists like bracelets tie my ankles too cattilara insisted tighter goram was overcautious under the marchs worried eye but liss finally achieved knots that cattilara approved the ties seemed more bundles than bindings by the time liss finished ista moved her stool over to face cattilara very conscious of arhyss strong limp body laid out by her skirts go ahead then lady cattilara release the demon let it up cattilaras eyes closed ista half closed hers trying to see those inner boundaries with her inner eye it was not so much a case of letting it seemed as driving come out you cattilara muttered sounding like a boy poking a badger out of its hole with a stick up a surge of invisible violet lightista summoned all her sensitivity on the surface cattilaras expression changed the stiff anxiety giving way briefly to a languid smile her tongue ran over her lips lasciviously she grimaced as if stretching the muscles of her face in unaccustomed directions the violet tinge flowed throughout her body to the fingertips her breath drew in her eyes snapped open widening in terror at the sight of ista spare us shining one she shrieked everyone in the room flinched at the sharp cry she began to rock and yank at her bindings let us up untie us we command you let us go let us go she stopped and hung panting then a sly look flashed in her face she sank back closed her eyes opened them again returning to that stiff blinking anxiety as you see its useless the stupid thing wont come out even for me let me up the violet tint ista noted still filled cattilaras body from edge to edge she waved back liss who had started forward with a disappointed look on her face no the creature lies its still right there oh liss returned to the wall cattilaras face changed again dissolving into rage let us go you blockheads you have no idea what you have brought down on porifors she bucked and jerked with terrifying strength rocking the chair flee flee we must flee all flee go while you can she is coming she is coming let us go let us go cattilaras voice rose and broke in a wordless scream the chair began to topple goram caught it and held it as it thumped and scraped the frenzied struggles did not diminish though cattilara grew scarlet with the effort and her breath pumped in frightening rasps was the demon desperate enough to seek its escape through cattilaras death if it could arrange it yes ista decided she could well picture it breaking its mounts neck by running madly against a wall or flinging her headfirst over a balcony threatening pain to cattilaras body was obviously useless even if arhys would well hed have no choice but to sit still for it but it was clearly a futile tactic very well ista sighed come back up lady cattilara the violet tide seemed to slosh back and forth within the confines of cattilaras spasming body the tint receded but then flooded back cattilara unable to regain control ista hadnt expected this oh no and i promised her i would hold it stay said ista i was sent by the god to cut this knot release arhys and i will release you would it believe her more important would the threat jolt catti into ascendancy again the demoncatti froze in its fight staring through wide eyes the soulstuff in the conduit gushed back toward illvin abruptly the horrified expression drained from arhyss face to be replaced withnothing at all a slack pale stillness he toppled over on his side like a rag doll falling like a corpse collapsing poriforss brilliant champion turned to a carcass a mass of dubious meat it would take two men to drag away but his spirit was not uprooted in the white fire ista had seen in the dying before his ghost merely drifted apart shifting from the locus of his body but scarcely otherwise changed a shock of horror raced through ista five gods he is sundered already his god cannot reach him what have i done mmmmmm put him back cattilara raged up to full control of her body like an unleashed mastiff taking down a bull by its nose the violet light snapped closed into a tight defensive ball the channels reappeared the fire flowed again arhyss breath drew in with a jerk he blinked and opened his jaw to stretch his face and pushed himself back into a sitting position looking half stunned ista sat shaken the ploy had worked on cattilara as her impulse had guessed but had revealed something she scarcely understood no more ploys i have not the stomach for them cattilara hung wheezing in her bindings staring malignantly at ista you you horrid old bitch you tricked me i tricked the demon too are you sorry she signed to goram and liss and they began cautiously unwinding the marchesss restraints illvin who had been peeking worriedly over the side of his bed at his brother leaned back again and stared in disquiet at ista how are you doing this lady are you perchance a sorceress too are we to trade one demon enemy for a stronger one no said ista my unwelcome gifts stem from another source ask cattis pet it knows better than i do i suspect if possession of or by a demon made one a sorcerer and the hosting of a god made one a saint what ambiguous hybrid did one become in the hands of the demongod godtouched thenyou claim he asked neither believing nor disbelieving yet but watchful to my everlasting sorrow how came this about some suffering bastard prayed to a god too busy to attend to him and he delegated the task to me or so he feigned illvin sank down in his sheets oh he said very quietly as her meaning sank in after a moment he added i would speak more with you on this in some um less busy hour ill see what i may do arhys moved his nearly nerveless hand to caress his wifes ankle catti this cant go on but love what shall we do she rocked her head to favor ista with a heartbroken glare you cannot take him now its too soon i will not give him up now she rubbed at the red marks on her arms as her ties fell away hes already had more time than is given to many men ista chided her he accepted the risks of his soldiers calling long ago when you bound yourself to him in marriage you accepted them too but what of his sundering death of the body was grief enough the slow decay of the ghosts souls who had refused the gods was a selfdestruction but arhys had not chosen this exile it had been imposed upon him not his souls suicide but its murder ista temporized but no it need not be today in hasty disarray there is a little time yet enough to put his affairs in order while he can still command his wits if he does not tarry enough to write or speak his farewells not much more than that i think she considered illvins dangerously emaciated fragility this tangle is far worse than i first guessed and even second sight does not yet see a way out arhys shoved himself upright you speak sense madam i should call the temples notary to mereview my will its not fair cattilara lashed out again illvin slew you and now hell gain all your possessions illvins head jerked back i am not destitute i do not desire the dy lutez properties to avoid that taint i would gladly give up any expectations will them to my niece or to the templeor to her even a twist of his lips indicated his brothers wife he hesitated except for porifors arhys smiled staring down at his boots good boy we do not yield porifors hold to that and you shall serve me still even when my grave has swallowed all vows cattilara burst into tears ista levered her exhausted body upright from her stool she felt as though she had been beaten with sticks lord illvin your brother must borrow of you for a little longer are you ready eh he grunted without enthusiasm do what you must he glanced up at her and added with suppressed urgency you will come again yes yes she moved her hand released her ligature illvin sank back arhys rolled to his feet a picture of strength again ah he enfolded the weeping cattilara in his arms and led her out murmuring comforting endearments yes ista thought bitterly you caught herill bet you didnt even try to dodgeyou deal with her and he would she felt sure what less would one expect from a man with soap in his saddlebags her temples were throbbing liss im going to go lie down now i have a headache oh liss came promptly to her side offering her arm in support as a ladyinwaiting she had her limits but ista had to allow she was one of the best courtiers shed ever encountered would you like me to bathe your forehead in lavender water i saw a lady do that once thank you that would be lovely she glanced back at lord illvin lying silently emptied of life and wit again take care of him goram he bobbed a bow gave her a look of inarticulate frustration and abruptly dropped to his knees and kissed the hem of her skirt blest one he mumbled free him free us all ista swallowed aggravation produced an unfelt smile for him extracted her skirt from his grip and let liss usher her out chapter fifteen a pall was cast over porifors that evening the castles master and mistress withdrew into private conclave and all the planned entertainments were abruptly canceled ista could only be relieved to be left in her chambers toward sunset liss reported a few of arhyss key officers were called to him and exited much later looking very grim ista hoped the march had mustered the wit to leave the original story of umerues death intact and devise some other tale to cover his impendingor was that retroactivelethal illness but given that the truth implicated the marchess for the jokonan princesss murder ista couldnt picture cattilara rushing to nor arhys permitting public confession istas dreams were untroubled that night by gods or visions although made unpleasant enough by murky erratic nightmares involving either disastrous travel on brokendown or dying horses or confused wandering through crumbling architecturally bizarre castles for the repair of which she was somehow responsible she woke poorly rested and waited impatiently for noon she sent liss to help goram and warn him of her visit then watched for the meal tray to be brought up it was handed in at lord illvins door by the maid shortly afterward liss emerged and strolled across the gallery to istas chambers goram will signal by opening the door when hes ready liss reported she was subdued still unsettled by yesterdays evil wonders and increasingly worried for foix for all that ista had assured her that he must be in the hands of the archdivine of maradi by now liss had been more consoled by istas pointing out that lady cattilara had hosted a more powerful demon than foixs for over two months without visible deterioration ista only wished her own heart could share in the reassurance she ladled out at last the carved door on the gallery opposite swung open and liss escorted ista across illvin was sitting up in bed dressed in tunic and trousers hair brushed back and tied at his nape royina he said and bowed his head he looked both wary and shocked goram or liss or both had presumably finally informed him of istas rank and identity in the little time since he had returned to consciousness im sorry i swear i prayed for help not for you his speech was slurred again ista was reminded that while shed had a day to digest the developments illvin had only been granted an hour she sighed went to his bedside and stole the white fire from the lower half of his body to reinforce the upper he blinked and gulped its not thati didnt mean to insult his words trailed off in embarrassed confusion not slurred now just mumbled he attempted to shift his legs failed and eyed them with misgiving i suspect she said that royina is not the capacity in which i was called here the gods do not measure rank as we do a royina and a chambermaid likely look much the same from their perspective you must admit though chambermaids are more numerous she smiled bleakly i seem to have a calling it is not by my choice the gods appear attracted to me like flies to blood he waved one weakened hand in protest at this metaphor i confess i have never thought of the gods as flies neither have i really she remembered staring into those dark infinities but dwelling on their real nature hurts my reason i suppose saps my nerve perhaps the gods know what they are about how did you know what i dreamed i saw you three times when i waked in my dreaming twice you shone with an uncanny light i dreamed those dreams too even the third one yes no dream that but she was abashed by that rash kiss though after cattilaras performance it had seemed such a small selfindulgence he cleared his throat my apologies royina what for ah he glanced at her lips and away nothing she tried not to think about the taste of his reviving mouth goram dragged the somewhat battered chair to illvins bedside for her and put out the stool at the beds foot for liss before retreating to stand at a hunched sort of attention by the far wall ista and illvin were left staring at one another in equal she was sure bafflement supposing he began again that you are not here by chance but by the prayers of wellhe cleared his throat in embarrassment someoneit must be to solve this tangle yes say rather uncover it its solution eludes me i thought you had agency over cattis demon will you not banish it i dont know how she admitted uneasily the bastard has given me my second sightgiven me back i should say my second sight for this is not the first time the gods have troubled me but the god gave me no instructions unless they are contained in another man i saw in my dreams and vice versa upon consideration was dy cabons appearance on the heels of the bastards mysterious second kiss some sort of intimation of just that the god sent me a spiritual conductor learned dy cabon and i dearly desire his counsel in this before i proceed he has studied something i believe about how demons are properly dispatched back to their master im certain he is meant to be here but i have lost him on the road and i fear for his safety she hesitated im not in haste in this matter i see no merit in releasing arhys from his body only to doom him to the damnation of a lost ghost he grew still a ghost are you sure i saw it when the spell was interrupted here yesterday nothing happened and it should have there is a white roaring when the doors of a soul are opened by death to the gods it is a huge event damnation is but a silence a slow freezing she rubbed her tired eyes and moreeven if i knew how he might find his way to his god i am by no means sure that arhys can convince his wife to release him yet if he does not persuade her who else could not me i fear and even if she would let him go the demon she has contracted seems skilled and powerful if she no longer is sustained by the overmastering will to keep arhys seemingalive if she collapses into griefshe will be very vulnerable to it he vented a hm of deepening doubt has she much strength of character in your observation he frowned i would not have said so before this lovely girl adores arhys but id swear that if she held up a lighted candle beside one pretty ear i could blow it out through the other arhys doesnt seem to mind he smiled wryly although if such beauty had worshipped me so ardently my opinion of her wits might well have risen higher upon the swelling of my head or whatever too yetshe resisted the cloud of umerues sorcery and i did not i suspect umerue underestimated her and thats another thing said ista how could a princess of jokona a devout quadrene come by a demon in the first place and keep it concealed or otherwise evade accusation they burn sorcerers there though how the quadrene divines keep the demon from jumping to another through the flames i dont know they must do something to tie it to its mount before dispatching them both yes they do it involves much ceremony and prayer an ugly business worse it doesnt always work he hesitated catti said the sorceress was sent by whom the prince her brother assuming she had been dumped back into his household by her last late husbands heirs i believe she was yes but its hard to picture sordso the sot dabbling in demons for the sake of jokona sordso the sot is that what the men of caribastos call the young prince thats what everybody calls him on both sides of the border he chose to spend the hiatus between his fathers death and the end of his mothers regency not in studying statecraft or warfare but in wine parties and versifying hes actually quite a pretty poet in a selfconsciously melancholy sort of vein judging by the samples ive heard we all hoped he would pursue the calling which looked to be more rewarding for him than a princes trade he grinned briefly my lord dy caribastos would be glad to give him a pension and a palace and take the burdens of government off his narrow shoulders it seems the prince is not so inattentive now it was he who sent the raiding party into ibra which fled east from rauma over the mountains and so encountered me they had tally officers to account the princes fifth did liss tell you of this only in brief he nodded to the riding girl who nodded back in confirmation he paused his dark brows drawing down rauma strange why rauma i guessed that it was to encourage the fox of ibra to keep his troops at home come the fall campaign instead of sending them in support of his son against visping mm could be rauma just seems very deep in ibran territory to strike at so bad lines of retreat as the raiders apparently found lord arhys mentioned that by his reckoning of the three hundred men who left jokona only three returned illvin whistled good for arhys costly diversion for sordso except that they came very close to paying for all by carrying me off with them but that could not have been part of their original plan they didnt even carry maps of chalion i know the march of rauma of old i can imagine he would give the jokonans a hot welcome he used to be one of our better enemies till we all became inlaws with ibra your daughters marriage took a great deal of pressure off poriforss western flank for which i do thank her royina royse bergon is a dear boy not that ista could help approving of anyone so plainly smitten with her daughter as iselles young ibran husband his father the roya is a bit of a cactus though dry spiny will make your fingers bleed well hes our cactus now indeed ista sat back with a troubled sigh the news of thisat least the news that a highborn lady of jokonas court harbored a demon and attempted to suborn a chalionese fortress by sorceryshould not be suppressed i should write a warning to archdivine mendenal at cardegoss and to chancellor dy cazaril at least that would be well he conceded reluctantly for all that i am gravely embarrassed by how closely umerue came to succeeding and yetit wasnt the archdivine of cardegoss who was dragged by chance and his hair here to the hind end of chalion it was you a more unlikely answer to my prayers i can scarcely imagine his mouth twisted up in puzzlement as he squinted at her did you pray to the bastard in your coherent moments say waking rather than coherent it all seems a fog tillyesterday yesterday just now yes i prayed desperately it was the only course left to me by then i couldnt even form the right words aloud just howling in my heart to my god whom i had abandonedi havent been much for prayer since i became a man if hed said boot off boy you wanted to be on your own now eat what you cooked i should have thought him within his rights he added more slowly why you unless this tangle has some older roots still with my brothers father and cardegoss court politics his shrewd guess discomfited her i have an old dry knot of guilt still left to be undone with the late lord dy lutez yes but it has nothing to do with arhys and no arvol was not my lover illvin looked taken aback at her vehemence i did not say so lady she let out her breath no you didnt its lady cattilara who thinks the old slander is a romantic tale five gods spare me arhys just wants to take me for some spiritual stepmother i think he surprised her by snorting he would his fondly exasperated headshake scarcely enlightened her as to how to interpret this cryptic remark she said a little tartly until i heard you two speaking with each other i had half decided you were the jealous murderer the despised bastard brother denied father title property pushed over the edge by this last loss his dry half laugh did not sound in the least offended i have encountered that delusion once or twice before the truth is exactly the reverse i had a father all my life or at any rate all of his arhys hada dream my father undertook the raising of us both in all practical matters and he tried to do well by arhys but it was always with that little extra mindful effort to me his love flowed without hindrance but arhys was never jealous or resentful because you see someday it would all be made right someday his fine father would call him to court when he was big enough when he was good enough a good enough swordsman horseman officer the great lord dy lutez would place him at his right hand present him to his glittering retinue and say to all his powerful friends see this is my son is he not well arhys would never wear his best things he kept them packed for the journey for when the call came he was ready to leave on an hours notice then lord dy lutez died and the dream stayed a dream ista shook her head in sorrow in all the five years i knew him arvol dy lutez scarcely mentioned arhys he never spoke of you if he had not died in the dungeons of the zangre that night that summons still might never have come i think i wondered in retrospect i pray you dont tell arhys that i am not sure yet what i must tell him although i have my fears whatever it was it was clear she had best not put it off too long me i had a live man for a father illvin went on cranky betimeshow we fought when i was younger i am so glad he lived long enough for us to be grown men together we cared for him here at porifors after his palsystrokealbeit not too long i think he wished to be gone to look for our mother by then for a few times we found him out searching for her his rich voice tightened twenty years dead she was his life was so lightly held at the last his death in the fathers season seemed no sorrow i held his hand at the end it felt very cool and dry almost transparent five gods how did i get on to this subject you will have me leaking next he was leaking now she thought but he steadfastly ignored the suspect sheen in his eyes and politely she did too thus my experience of bastardy he hesitated eyed her do youyou who say you have seen them facetofacebelieve the gods bring us back to those we loved when our spirits rise i do not know she said surprised into honesty was he thinking forward to arhys as well as back to the elder ser dy arbanos in this moment perhaps ive never loved anyone enough to know i think it is not a fools hope hm she looked away from his face feeling an intruder upon that wistful inward frown her eye fell on goram rocking and clenching his hands again outwardly a grizzled aging menial inwardly stripped plundered burnedout like some village ravaged by retreating troops how came you by goram ista asked illvin and where i was reconnoitering in jokona as is my habit whenever i have a spare week i collect castle and town plans for a pastime the brief smile that flitted across his mouth implied that he collected rather more than this but he went on having ridden down to hamavik in the guise of a horse dealer and having accumulated rather more stock than id intended i found myself in need of an extra groom as a roknari merchant i buy out chalionese prisoners whenever i have a chance the men with no family have little hope of ransom goram less than most as hed plainly lost most of his wits and memory id diagnose a knock to the head in his last battle though theres no scar so it might have been some other ill treatment or fever or both it was clear no one else in the market wanted him that day so i drove a better bargain than id expected as it proved the smile flickered again when we reached porifors and i freed him he asked to stay in my service as he no longer was sure where his home lay by the wall goram nodded endorsement to the tale ista drew breath are you aware that he is demongnawed illvin jolted upright no goram looked equally dumfounded lisss head jerked around and she stared at the groom in wonder illvins eyes narrowed in rapid thought how do you know this royina i can see it i can see his soulstuff its all in rags and tatters illvin blinked sank back after a moment he said more cautiously can you see mine yes to me it appears as an attenuated white fire streaming out of your heart to your brother his soul is gray as a ghosts beginning to decompose and blur it is in his body but it is not attached to his body it justloats there lisss is bright and colorful but very centered very solid and tight within the matter that generates it liss evidently deciding she had been complimented smiled cheerfully after a reflective silence illvin said that must be very distracting for you yes she said shortly he cleared his throat are you saying then that goram was a sorcerer goram shook his head in horrified denial im not ever so lady what can you remember goram ista asked his seamed face worked i know i marched with oricos army i remember the royas tents all redandgold silk shining in the light i remember marching as a prisoner with chains on working some field work hot in the sun who were your roknari masters he shook his head dont remember them much ships were you ever on ships dont think so horses yes there were horses illvin put in weve talked before about what he could remember when i was trying to find out his family because he must have been a prisoner for several years if it was from the time the prince of borasnen first attempted the fortress of gotorget two years before it fell i think from some things goram has said that must have been the campaign he was in but he doesnt remember his captivity either much that was why i thought his brains might have been baked by a fever perhaps just before he came my way goram can you remember what has happened to you since lord illvin ransomed you asked ista oh aye that dont hurt can you remember anything at all from just before lord illvin bought you out goram shook his head there was a dark place i liked it because it was cool stank though wits and memories eaten out the demon jumped and yetnot dead mused ista abandoning a live mount is not easy for a demon i gather from dy cabon they get all tangled together somehow killing the person forces the demon out like umerue or like the quadrene burnings dont burn me cried goram he shrank down smaller almost crouching and stared in dismay at his own chest no one will burn you illvin said firmly not in chalion in any case and now there is no need because she says the demon is gone all gone right he shot ista a compelling glare very gone and most of goram with it it seemed she wondered if he had been a servant beforeor something more hamavik murmured illvin how suggestive both goram and princess umerue were there at the same time could this damage of gorams have any relation to umerues demon it made an enticing sort of connection and yet cattis demon didnt feel as if it had been dining on soldiers it felt im not sure how to put this too womanly i suppose we can try to get information out of it again i dont think the way it carried on here yesterday was any more usual for a demon than for a person or sorcerers would be far more conspicuous liss ista noted was looking most disturbed was she seeing a future foix in gorams slack timid bewildered face where was the boy ista wasnt desperate enough to pray yet considering her feelings about prayer but she thought she might become so if this hideous uncertainty went on much longer ista continued learned dy cabon told me that demons were very rare usuallybut not these past few years that the temple had not seen an outbreak like this since roya fonsas day fifty years gone i cannot imagine what rip in the bastards hell can be leaking them back into the world in such numbers but thats what i am beginning to picture fonsas day illvins words were starting to slur strange your time is almost up ista said eyeing the thickening white rope with disfavor i can portion you some more you said arhys would start to rot though illvin objected muzzily high summer cant have bits of him falling off into his soup can we now his voice was fading he roused himself in a spasm of despair no there must be another way have to find another way ladycome again yes she said on the reassurance he released his grip on the edge of his counterpane and slid down his face emptied once more into waxen stillness ista kept to her chambers again that day waiting impatiently for the sun to run its course and rise again she penned her new letters to cardegoss and when the sun dropped paced the stone courtyard until even liss abandoned her side and sat on a bench to watch her circulate by the following midmorning she was reduced to mentally composing another sharp letter to the provincar of tolnoxo though the first could barely have arrived yet let alone been acted upon rapid footsteps sounded on the stairs outside ista looked up from nibbling on her quill feather to see lisss braid flash past beyond the grille she thumped through to istas chamber and stuck her head in the door royina she said breathlessly something is happening lord arhys has ridden out with a party of armed menim going to the north tower to try to see what i can ista rose so hastily she nearly knocked over her chair ill go with you they climbed the winding stone staircase to this vantage behind a hastening crossbowman in poriforss grayandgold tabard all three went to the northeast edge and peered over the crenellations on this side of the castle opposite the drop to the river the land rolled away more level with the ridge a road pale with dry dust wound east through the arid sunny countryside thats the road from oby panted liss a pair of horsemen were galloping down it details blurred by the distance but even from here ista could see that one rider was thick and the other much thicker the thicker one wore some brown garment over flashes of white the stiff gait of a horse attempting to canter under learned dy cabons jouncing weight was distinctive at least to istas experienced eye a little way beyond them galloped a dozen other men an escort no green tabards of jokona here under the frowning brow of porifors itself ista gasped the pursuing soldiers were closing on the lead pair with a scuff of slippers and a flutter of silks lady cattilara emerged onto the tower top and ran to look over she stood on tiptoe and leaned her pale bosom heaving arhys five gods oh the father of winter protect you ista followed her gaze below porifors arhys on his dappled gray led a troop of mounted men headlong up the road the lesser horses were hard pressed to keep up with the grays reaching strides and liss muttered approval of its groundeating action cattilaras lips parted on her panting and her eyes grew wide and anxious she vented a little moan what murmured ista to her you cant be afraid of his being killed after all cattilara shot her a sulky look hunched one shoulder and returned her stare to the road dy cabons overburdened horse was laboring falling behind the other horsemanyes it was certainly foix dy gurapulled up his own mount and motioned the divine onward foixs horse capered on the road fighting his reins foix held the beast short with his left hand grasped his sword hilt and rose in his stirrups to glare at his pursuers no foix ista thought helplessly foix was a strong swordsman but unsubtle without lord arhyss brilliant speed he might do for one or two of his enemies maybe three who would not rise again but then the rest would overwhelm him he had not yet seen the rescue riders approaching out of his sight in a long hollow he would throw himself away to save the divine without need his right hand rose again from his hilt fingers clenching and stretching his arm went out tensely a faint violet light seemed to flicker from his palm and cattilaras breath drew in sharply in astonishment liss did not react was oblivious to this light ista realized the first horse in the approaching pack stumbled and fell headlong spilling its rider two others fell atop it before they could pull up several horses reared or shied and tried to bolt to the sides foix jerked his mount around and began galloping after dy cabon so foix still has his pet bear and it seems hes taught it to dance istas lips pursed in worry at the implications but other worries were more immediate past the rise and dip in the road dy cabon met arhys the divines lathered brown horse staggered to a halt and stood spreadlegged the dappled gray reared beside it gesticulations pointings arhys flung his hand in the air and his troop reined up around him more handwaving and quietly called orders blurred by the breeze to unintelligibility at istas apprehensive height and distance swords were drawn bows cocked lances leveled and the troop spread out and began to move up behind the brow of the road dy cabons failing horse stumbled on at a walk toward porifors but he twisted his bulk in the saddle to watch over his shoulder as foix crested the hill foix recoiled briefly at the sight of the armed troop but an open handed wave from arhys and a wilder armcircling from dy cabon beyond apparently reassured him he lashed his horse onward spoke briefly with arhys turned and drew his sword a breathless pause ista could hear her blood thudding in her ears and foolishly some bird warbling in the brush a bright liquid indifferent trill just as if this were some morning of peace and ease arhys raised his sword high and swung it down sharply in signal and his troop thundered forward the men from porifors crested the rise and fell upon the jokonan troop too fast for the leaders to turn and retreat the horsemen in both vans were instantly engaged the jokonans at the rear yanked their horses around as hard as they could and spurred away but not faster than at least a couple of crossbow bolts a rider in a green tabard toppled and fell from his saddle the range from here was too great for the bowman sharing istas vantage on the tower to waste his quarrels in the fray and he swore in frustration at his impotence then glanced at the royina and mumbled an apology ista waved him full royal dispensation gripped the hot gritty stone and leaned squinting into the light arhyss sword danced in the sun a glittering blur his dappled gray was crowded up in the middle of a pack of kicking squealing horses a jokonan soldier who had managed to get his lance unshipped whipped it up over his own mounts head and jammed it awkwardly backhanded across the haunches of the mount of the man who presently engaged arhyss sword arhys jerked away cattilara screamed as the lance wrenched back again spattering blood my lord is struck cried the bowman leaning out as tensely as the women ohno his sword arm rises five gods be thanked the horsemen disengaged the jokonan swordsman reeling in his saddle the spearman saw an opening and galloped through to pursue his retreating comrades bending low over his mounts neck a crossbow bolt whizzed over his head to encourage him on his way curse it that spear point had found a mark in arhyss shoulder ista had seen the shock of the contact shove the jokonans hand back almost ripping the shaft from his grip yet arhyss sword swung unhindered her breath drew in sharply and she whirled away and started for the stairs liss attend me but royina dont you want to see how it comes out attend me not waiting to see if the girl followed ista yanked up her lilac skirts and shuffled down the tight dark stone curve of the tower stairs she almost fell in her haste then hugged the outer wall and the wider tread but did not slow out the door across another courtyard under the archway into the stone court up the stairs her feet thumped across the gallery she tugged open illvins carved door goram was crouched by lord illvins right side groaning in fear illvins linen tunic was yanked open and halfdown the groom glanced over his shoulder at her entry and cried lady help his hands she saw as she neared were pressed to illvins shoulder and gory with blood the tunic sleeve was soaked in scarlet ista tore around the room until she found a cloth that might be folded into a pad bundled it clean side outward and offered it goram snatched his hands away just long enough to grab it and stuff it against the jagged wound in illvins shoulder i didnt i didnt cried goram to her his eye rolling whiterimmed it just happened yes goram i know its all right ista soothed him youre doing well almost she was tempted to squeeze the rope of white fire shut again returning the ugly gash to its rightful owner but now was clearly not a good moment to drop arhys senseless from his saddle illvins closed gray eyelids did not move or flutter or pinch in pain at least in his unfeeling state he might be freely tended washed with brine jabbed with sewing needles so ista wondered dizzily if the demon permitted him to wake this noon would the needle punctures still be there when the wound they held closed fled back to his brother the door swung open liss at last liss run at once and find some woman used to tending wounds the mothers craft must have much practice herehave her bring her soap and salves and needles and a servant to carry water as well what why she trod closer in curiosity lord illvin is badly cut at this point liss saw the blood and she gasped yes royina buthow could you saw the spear thrust oh her eyes grew very wide indeed and she turned and ran goram peeked quickly under the pad and clapped it tight again ista hung over his shoulder the puncture was not so deep as she had feared already the sluggish flow of blood was diminishing good goram keep pressing aye lady ista waited shifting from foot to foot until voices sounded again from the gallery outside liss opened the door for a woman in an apron bearing a basket and ushered her in a male servant followed lord illvin ista began and glanced at goram fell out of bed and struck his shoulder on what istas invention failed her she passed rapidly on tend to him and bind him help goram clean up speak of this to no one but me lord arhys or lady cattilara those of the rescue party from porifors who hadnt chased after the jokonans might be escorting their new guests through the gates just about now ista guessed she strode for the door liss attend me chapter sixteen ista hurried under the archway into the entry court in time to see the flushed and gasping learned dy cabon sag from his horse into the arms of one of lord arhyss men the soldier helped the divine totter a few steps to collapse in the narrow shade of the wall by the almond tree he held a worried hand to dy cabons face and spoke to a servant who hurried away dy cabon struggled out of his semiconcealing brown vestcloak letting it fall around him to the petalstrewn pavement foix looking almost equally hot and harried jumped from his horse threw down the reins and strode to the divines side curse it foix dy cabon wheezed staring up at him i told you to stop playing with that thing fine foix snarled back ride back and lie down by the side of the road for jokonan dog meat if you dont like it the pack could feast for a month the servant arrived and at the soldiers gesture upended a bucket of water slowly over dy cabon soaking his dirty white robes dy cabon did not recoil or protest but just sat limply raising his chin and opening his mouth foix nodded in gratitude and took a tin cup of water that another servant proffered from a second bucket gulped it down then scooped up a second and third and repeated the performance with a fretful grimace he ladled up another cupful squatted by dy cabons side and held it to the divines lips dy cabon lifted a shaking hand to it guzzling noisily the soldier gave ista a respectful salute as she approached and murmured to her very close to the heatstroke that one its a bad sign when a man that big stops sweating but dont worry royina well get him right around foixs head swiveled royina he cried five gods be thanked i kiss your hands i kiss your feet he pushed another cup of water into dy cabons grip and lunged over to one knee before her skirts grasping her hands and planting a hot kiss on the back of each ah he pressed them to his sweaty forehead in a less formal but entirely sincere addition he did not rise immediately but swung one leg around and sat crosslegged and wheezing allowing his broad shoulders for just this moment of safety to slump he grinned up at liss flanking ista so you made it here too might have known she grinned back yes you might been chasing after your dust since maradi the fastest horses were always already taken for some reason her smile stretched to a cheery smirk he squinted pretty dress quite a change she drew back a little selfconsciously its only loaned at a clacking of hooves foix looked up and scrambled to his feet lord arhys flanked by another mounted soldier trotted through the gate on his dappled gray swung down and flung his reins to a groom so royina arhys turned to her his smile flickering i think your lost ones are returned to you foix bobbed him a bow only by virtue of your succor sir i had not time to introduce myself out there foix dy gura at your service even if i had not met your brother your sword and your enemies were recommendation enough arhys dy lutez porifors is mine i shall welcome you in better style hereafter but i must first see to my scouts those jokonans should not have been on that roadwe took two prisoners alive so i mean to find out how they came so close unseen he cast ista a glum glance now do i doubly miss illvinhis command of the roknari tongue is better than any others here arhys gave a wave to dedicat pejar dashing into the entry court with his tunic half fastened and his sword belt askew to greet his restored officer here is one of your own men to show you how to go on he called to a servant see that these two have everything they need till my return whatever pejar or the royina ask the servant gave him an acknowledging half bow arhyss gaze was wary sweeping past dy cabon still sitting bedraggled on the pavement the divine made an exhausted hand motion a truncated blessing promising greater courtesies later arhys turned for his horse again but paused as ista grasped him by the sleeve she reached upward and touched his tunic torn and bloody on the right shoulder felt through the rip and ran her fingers over his cool unbroken skin she turned her hand over before him to silently display the dark carmine smear at your earliest spare moment march i suggest you come inspect your brothers wound your brothers new wound his lips parted in dismay he met her level gaze and winced i see ride carefully till then wear your mail we were in haste he fingered the rip his frown deepening indeed he gave her a grim nod and swung up again on his sidling horse motioning to his mounted man to follow he cantered out foix glanced around and back to pejar worry in his eyes is ferda here is he well well sir but gone looking for you pejar replied hes probably reached maradi by now i expect hell make the circle and turn up back here in a few days swearing at the waste of horseshoes foix grimaced i trust he wont take the same road we did wasnt what the march of oby led me to expect at all why are you not now in the temple hospital at maradi ista wanted to ask but decided to wait foixs soul was as vigorous and centered as lisss but it appeared to her inner eye that a bearshaped shadow lurked in his gut it seemed to sense her scrutiny for it curled tighter as if attempting to hibernate she motioned the hovering servant to her side see that these men are speedily refreshed especially the divine and lodged in rooms near me yes royina she added to foix we must speak ofeverything as soon as we may have pejar direct you to me in the stone court as soon as you are both recovered yes he said eagerly we must hear all your tale lord arhyss ambush was the talk of oby yesterday ista sighed so much of dire import has happened since then i had nearly forgot it his brows climbed oh well hasten to your side then he bowed and turned away to assist the servant in coaxing dy cabon back to his feet foix seemed very practiced at it as if hauling the fat man up and forcing him to move had become second nature of late dy cabons grumbles were equally perfunctory the damp divine did not so much drip as steam but he seemed to be gaining relief from his initial distress cattilaras light tread echoed in the archway the men looked around despite his overheated debility dy cabon smiled in a cattilarasmitten fashion foix blinked and went rather still where is my lord cattilara demanded in anxiety he has ridden back out with his scouts ista said it seems that spear thrust we saw found another target cattilaras eyes widened her head turned toward the stone court yes said ista he is being cared for now however oh good cattilaras sigh of relief was premature in istas judgment the girl had not yet thought it through but she likely would lord arhys will return by noonno doubt cattilaras lips pinched at her briefly ista went on lady cattilara dy lutez marchess of porifors may i introduce to you my spiritual conductor learned chivar dy cabon and foix dy gura officerdedicat of the daughters order you have met his captain and brother ferda oh yes cattilara managed a distracted curtsey welcome to porifors she paused returning foixs uncertain look for a moment they stood as stiffly as two strange cats just sighting each other the two demon shadows within them were so tightly closed in istas presence it was hard to guess their reaction to this proximity but it did not seem one of joyous greeting liss observing foixs lack of the more usual male response to the lovely marchess brightened slightly ista gestured to the waiting servant and added with deliberate emphasis lord arhys detailed this man to see to their needs the divine is dangerously fatigued from the heat and should have care at once oh yes agreed cattilara rather vaguely pray continue i shall welcome you all more properly later she dipped a curtsey foix produced a bow and she fluttered away up the staircase foix and dy cabon followed the servant and pejar through the archway presumably to where the daughters men were quartered seized with unease ista watched cattilara depart she was suddenly reminded from lord dy cazarils testimony that there were slower ways for demons to slay their mounts tumors for example might one be started already she tried to read for it in cattilaras soulstuff some black blot of disorder and decay the girl roiled so it was hard to be sure ista could imagine the consequencesthe passionate cattilara mad with hope insisting that the symptoms were her longedfor pregnancy jealously guarding a belly that swelled apace not with life but with death ista shivered illvin speaks truth we must find a better way and soon less than an hour passed before the two strays returned to ista in the stone court they both looked much revived having evidently undergone some roughandready bath involving sloshing buckets and drains wet hair combed in dry clothes that if not exactly clean were less sweatstained they managed some ragged semblance of a courtly style in her honor ista gestured the divine to a stone bench in the arcades shade and sat by his side foix and liss settled themselves at her feet liss spent a moment plucking her unaccustomed skirts into a more graceful arrangement royina tell us of the battle foix began eagerly your brother had a better view get his account when he returns i would hear your tale first what happened after we abandoned you on the road i would not say abandoned objected dy cabon say saved rather your hiding place worked or else the god heard the prayers from my heart and bowels i didnt dare even whisper aloud foix snorted agreement aye that was an ugly hour crouching in that cold waterseems more attractive in retrospectlistening to the jokonans thump by overhead we finally crawled out of the culvert and took to the brush trying to stay out of sight of the road but follow after you that was a scramble it was past dark by the time we reached the village at the crossroads and the poor villagers were just starting to creep back to their homes a good bit poorer after the jokonan locusts had passed through but it could have been much worse theyd evidently thought liss a madwoman at first but by that time they were praising her as a saint sent from the daughter herself liss grinned i no doubt sounded a madwoman when i first rode in shrieking thanks be for my chancellery tabard im glad they listened i didnt wait to see so we learned the divine was done in by then you werent much better muttered dy cabon so we took their charity for the night never ceases to amaze me when people with so little share their bit with strangers five gods rain blessings upon em for theyd just had their allotment of bad luck for a year at least i talked them into loaning a mule to the divine though they sent a boy along to be sure it got back again and we started for maradi in the morning following liss id have preferred to chase you royina but not unequipped as we were i wanted an army the goddess must have heard me for we found one a few hours later coming up the road the provincar of tolnoxo loaned us mounts and you can believe i jumped to join his troop would have saved steps to let them come to us back at the village for we passed through there again in the afternoonreturned their mule at least which made its owner happy he glanced at dy cabon i probably should have sent dy cabon on to the temple at maradihe might have caught up with lissbut he refused to be parted from me dy cabon growled reluctant agreement under his breath i wasted two miserable days in dy tolnoxos baggage train the parts of me that meet a saddle were pounded to bruises by then but even i could see we were following too slowly yes despite all my howling foix grimaced the tolnoxans gave up at the border claiming the jokonan column would break up into a dozen parts and scatter and that only the men of caribastos who knew their own country had a chance of netting them i said we only needed to follow one part dy tolnoxo gave me leave to take my horse and try it and i almost did just to defy him should have i might have caught up in time for lord arhyss welcoming fete but the divine was mad to get me back to maradi for all the good that proved to be in the end and i was worried about liss so i let myself be persuaded not mad dy cabon denied justly worried i saw those flies foix huffed in exasperation will you leave off about those accursed flies they were no ones beloved pets there were a million more in the manure pile they came from there is no shortage of flies in tolnoxo no need to ration em thats not the point and you know it flies said liss bewildered dy cabon turned to her in eager and irate explication it was after we left dy tolnoxos troop and came at last to the temple house in maradi the next morning i came into foixs chamber and found him drilling a dozen flies lisss nose wrinkled ick wouldnt they squash nonotthey were marching around in a parade array back and forth across the tabletop in little ranks file flies murmured foix irrepressibly he was experimenting with his demon thats what said dy cabon after i told him to leave the thing strictly alone they were only flies foixs embarrassed grin twisted granted they did better than some recruits ive tried to train you were starting to dabble in sorcery the divine scowled and you havent stopped what did you do to make that jokonans horse stumble nothing counter to nature i understood your lecture perfectly wellyour god knows youve repeated it often enough you cant claim that turmoil and disorder didnt freely flow from the demonwhat a splendid pileup no nor that it didnt result in good if your orders sorcerers can do it why cant i they are properly supervised and instructed five gods know you are certainly supervising and instructing me or at least spying and badgering comes to much the same thing i suspect foix hunched anyway he returned to his narrative they told us in maradi that liss had ridden to the fortress of oby in caribastos thinking it the likeliest place to find the royina or if not the royina someone fit to pursue her so we followed as fast as i could make dy cabon ride we arrived two days after liss had left but we heard the royina was rescued and safe at porifors so took a day to rest the divines bruised saddle parts and yours muttered dy cabon and followed on to porifors foix raised his voice over this on a road that the march of oby told us was perfectly safe and impossible to miss the second part of his assurance proved true daughters tears i thought the jokonans had come back for a rematch and we were going to lose the race this time within sight of our refuge dy cabon rubbed his forehead in a weary worried gesture ista wondered if his mornings dangerous parching had left him with a lingering headache i am very concerned about foixs demon said ista i as well said dy cabon i thought the temple could treat him but it is not to be the bastards order has lost the saint of rauma who said ista the divine of the god in raumait is a town in ibra not far from the border mountainsshe was the living agent of the god for the miracle ofdo you remember that ferret royina and what i told you about it yes for weak elementals that have taken up residence in animals to force the demon into the dying divine who will return it to the god it is sufficient to slay the animal in his or her presence thus the end of that ferret said ista poor thing said liss it is so dy cabon admitted hard on the innocent beast but what will you the occurrences are normally quite rare he took a breath the quadrenes use a related system to rid themselves of sorcerers a cure worse than the disease but once in a great while a saint may come along who is gifted by the god with the trick of it the trick of what said ista with a patience she did not feel the trick of extracting the demon from a human mount and returning it to the god and yet leaving the person alive and with the soul and wits intact or nearly so if it goes well and what is the trick of it he shrugged i dont know istas voice grew edged did you sleep through all your classes in that seminary back in casilchas dy cabon you are supposed to be my spiritual conductor i swear you could not conduct a quill from one side of a page to the other its not a trick he said harried its a miracle you cannot pull miracles out of a book by rote ista clenched her teeth both infuriated and ashamed yes she said lowly i know she sat back so what happened to the saint murdered by that same troop of jokonan raiders who overtook us on the road in tolnoxo ah breathed ista that divine i heard of her the march of raumas bastard half sister i was told by one of the women captives raped tortured and burned alive in the rubble of the bastards tower thus do the gods reward their servants is she said dy cabon in a tone of interest i mean was she liss put in indignantly what blasphemy to slay a saint lord arhys said that of the three hundred men who left jokona no more than three returned alive now we see why what waste the divine signed himself but if it is so she was surely avenged i would be considerably more impressed with your god dy cabon said ista through her teeth if he could have arranged one lifes worth of simple protection in advance rather than three hundred lives worth of gaudy vengeance afterward she drew a long difficult breath my second sight has returned his head swiveled and his arrested gaze flashed to her face how did this come about and when ista snorted you were there or nearly so i doubt you have forgot that dream his overheated pink flushed redder then paled whatever he was trying to say he could not get it out he choked and tried again that was real ista touched her forehead he kissed me on the brow here as once his mother did and laid an unwelcome burden thereupon i told you things of dire import have been happening here that is the least of them did you hear any rumor at oby of the murder of princess umerue by a jealous courtier of hers some two or three months ago here at porifors and the stabbing of ser illvin dy arbanos oh yes said foix it was the next greatest gossip there after your rescue lord dy oby said he was most sorry to hear about lord illvin and that lord arhys must miss him greatly he knew the brothers of old he said from long before he became lord arhyss fatherinlaw and said they always steered together up and down this corner of caribastos for going on twenty years like a mans right and left hands on his reins well that was not the true story of the crime foix looked interested if skeptical dy cabon looked interested and extremely worried i have been three days sorting through the lies and misdirections umerue may have been a princess once but by the time she came here she was a demoneaten sorceress sent i was told and this part i believe to suborn porifors and deliver it to someone in or near the court of jokona the effect this might have on the coming visping campaign especially if the treachery was not revealed until the most critical possible moment i leave to your military imagination foix foix nodded slowly the first part he had no trouble following obviously what was to come in a secret scrambling fight both umerue and lord arhys were slain dy cabon blinked royina dont you mean lord illvin we just met lord arhys just so the demon jumped to arhyss wifea mistake from its point of view it appears because she promptly seized control of it and forced it to stuff arhyss severed soul back into his own body stealing strength from his younger brother illvin to keep his corpse moving all the same some distorted species of death magici will ask you learned to expound the theology of it at your earliest convenience and then the marchess feigned it was illvin injured and the princess killed by the princesss jokonan clerk whom she terrified into fleeing so thats what i felt when i saw her whispered foix sounding much enlightened another demon i witnessed everyones testimony avowed liss loyally its all true we even questioned the demon though that wasnt much use when lord arhys was struck in the fight this morning by that jokonan lancer the cut appeared on lord illvins body it was dreadfully uncanny she added reflectively bled like a stuck pig too well so he wouldthey do stick pigs with lances i think ista glanced at the sun and measured the shortening shadows in the stone courtyard in a while you will speak with all concerned and bear witness as well but dy cabon listen i do not know why your god has brought me to this house of woe i do not know what or who can be saved out of this ghastly tangle i do know that at some point one way or another that demon has to be driven out of lady cattilara it is wild to escape with her body by preference but it will kill her in order to fly in anothers if it gains the chance arhys is beginning to deteriorate body and i fear mind as well worsei suspect his soul may already be sundered lord illvin is dying slowly being drained by this sorcery of more life than his body can replace when he dies his brother ends and cattilara i believe will be swallowed by her demon she stopped drew breath looked around at the shocked faces staring back at her not one she realized with a chill was staring at her as though she had gone mad they were all staring at her as though she was going to tell them what to do next booted footsteps echoed in the archway ista looked up to see lord arhys enter observe her and her little court and approach he stopped and gave her a bow then stood taken rather aback by the staggered searching looks he was collecting from his new guests lord arhys istas nod acknowledged the bow i have been apprising my escorts acting captain and my spiritual conductor of the true state of affairs here at porifors it is necessary that they know that they may guard and advise me to best effect i see he forced a grimace into an unfelt smile he paused a moment as if considering what to say for himselfapologize for being dead perhapsthen apparently defeated by the quandary passed on to more immediate affairs my scouts are dispatched but not yet returned our prisoners were not very cooperative but it appears their patrol was the screen of some larger force given the task of cutting communications on the road between porifors and oby and that the attack on dy gura and the divine was premature in some fashion that we were unable to extract from them for all the howls we squeezed out we are taking precautionstopping our cisterns warning the town sending riders to alert outlying areas to be on guard i have heard nothing of such a jokonan force from my own men along the border but i have been much distracted from my duties these past few days ista pursed her lips on a worried exhalation an attack from jokona why now he shrugged a delayed reprisal for the death of their princess we had expected one before this or a muchlessdelayed attempt to regain a great prize lately lost his gaze on her was grave despite the heat ista shivered i would not chose to bring down such trouble on any host least of all you perhaps i should remove to oby run away a beguilingly sensible cowardice that leave this castle leave this tangle leave these anguished and benighted souls to sink under the accumulating weight of their misjudgments misery and love she could run away she could perhaps he gave her an ambiguous nod but only if we can be sure we have secured the road or else we would just be delivering you into jokonan hands a gift already unwrapped i must ride out this afternooni cant stop now you must see that he added with peculiar earnestness you must not stop me now since i know not how she sighed you are safe from that chance for the moment other chances i cannot speak for i shall be forced to take my rest shortly illvin must be allowed to eat especially now she said alarmed i do not wish otherwise but i would see his new wound first ah that would be wise i think as he seemed to expect her company she rose and followed him up the stairs her people trailing in unconcealed curiosity the entry of so many persons alarmed goram whom ista tried to reassure with a few soft words he seemed more consoled by lisss kindly pat on his shoulder at the marchs direction he unwrapped illvins new bandage arhyss inspection was brief experienced and grim foix and dy cabon peered with diffident interest at the bloody tear in arhyss tunic as he bent over his silent brother when the march turned away they crowded up to the bedside to get a whispered account from liss arhyss hand clenched and unclenched on his sword hilt he murmured to ista standing with him a little apart i confess i was not altogether sorry to find those jokonan soldiers out on my road this morning i think some part of me was starting to hope for a better death less gnominious than the first less shameful to my fathers honor i see there is a problem with this plan yes said ista i feel as though i am lost in some dark and evil maze and cannot find my way out yes said ista but no longer alone in the labyrinth at least his smile flickered he squeezed her hand indeed my good company grows apace since the gods guided you here that is a greater comfort than i had expected the meal tray arrived lord arhys excused himself ista trusted he would find the safe harbor of his bed before his midday collapse overtook him she ushered her own people out again to give goram time to do his necessary work but she directed dy cabon to stay assist and observe leaning on the gallery railing she watched lord arhys stride out of sight below trailing the subtle smoke of his eroding soul she rubbed her palm still tingling where he had gripped it i could run away no one else here can but i could if i chose to chapter seventeen foix disquiet in his eyes leaned his elbows on the balustrade by istas side to watch arhys exit remarkable man he observed if that jokonan sorceresss purpose was to remove porifors from the strategic map paralyze its strength as a fortress she may have achieved some success even in her failure to have crippled such a commander or worse than crippled the daughter forbid liss came over to rest against the rail on istas other side listening and frowning in worry what did you sense of that demon when you met lady cattilara in the forecourt ista asked foix he shrugged nothing very clearly i felt prickly uneasy you did not see it riding within her soul like a shadow no royina he hesitated can you yes he cleared his throat ah can you see mine absently his hand rubbed his belly yes it looks like the shadow of a bear hiding in a cave does it speak to you not exactly well a little not in words but i can sense it if i sit quietly and pay attention it is much calmer and happier than it was at first tamer he managed a lopsided grin i have been training it to do some tricks when the divine does not harass me yes i saw the one on the road very clever of you both but very dangerous do you have any sense of what it was or where it was before it found you a bear wandering in the wild a bird before that i think for neither the bear nor i could ever have viewed the mountains from above and i now seem to have such a memory confused but i do not think i dreamed it swallowing huge insects ugh except that they werent ugh ugh before that i dont know i think it does not remember being newborn any more than i remember being a mewling infant it had existence but not wits as such ista straightened stretching her aching back when we return to lord illvins chamber study his attendant goram i believe he once held a demon as you now do the groom was a sorcerer ha well why not if a demon can lodge in a bear why not in a simpleton i do not think he was always a simpleton i suspect he may have once been a cavalry officer of roya oricos army before he was taken prisoner and enslaved unransomed study goram closely foix he may be your mirror oh said foix and shrank a little lisss frown deepened at length the carved door opened and goram gestured them all back inside the sheets had been changed the bloodied linen robe whisked away and illvin dressed for company in his tunic and trousers his hair tied back ista was obscurely grateful that he was made so presentable before her companions goram fetched the chair for her and with little bobbing bows seated her by illvins bedside dy cabon reported to ista in an awed whisper i watched the wounds close up just now extraordinary lord illvin gingerly rubbed his right shoulder and smiled across at ista i seem to have missed a busy morning royina except not quite learned dy cabon has been telling me of his alarming ride i am glad your lost company is returned to you i hope your heart is eased much eased dy cabon took the stool at the foot of the bed a precarious perch for his bulk ista introduced foix and gave a short blunt precis of his encounter with the bear by way of preamble to describing his performance on the road goram hovered anxiously on the beds other side putting bites to illvins mouth while he listened illvin frowning fended off a piece of bread and said that such a raiding party should come so close to porifors indicates either a young jokonan hothead swaggering for show or something moving behind what say our scouts dispatched not yet returned said ista lord arhys prepares he tells us and has sent out warnings to the countryside good illvin eased back against his pillows five gods help me the days flit past me like hours i would be out there riding now she added i told your brother to wear his mail ah he said yes his mouth set his left hand going again to probe his elusively wounded shoulder he stared down at his feet absorbed in whoknewwhat reflections ista wondered if his mind circled as dizzily as her own she drew a long breath goram he paused in his spooning lady were you ever in rauma he blinked in bewilderment dont know the place its a town in ibra he shook his head we were at war with ibra before werent we i know i was in hamavik he offered as if in compensation lord illvin found me there your soul shows demon scars dreadful ones and yet if you had been a sorcerer during your captivity commanding the resources of a demon you ought to have been able to escape or otherwise improve your lot goram looked daunted as though being chastised for some lapse ista opened a palm to soothe him and continued there are too many demons about as if some great outbreak had occurred the divine told me is that not so learned dy cabon rubbed his chins its surely beginning to appear so has the temple mapped the sightings are they coming from one place or from every place at once a thoughtful look came over his suety face i have not heard from every place but of the reports i have heard there do seem to have been more toward the north yes hm ista stretched her tight shoulders again lord illvin dy cabon has also told me that the divine of the bastard in rauma was a saint of his order gifted with the ability to draw demons from their mounts and return them somehow miraculously to the god the jokonan raiders slew her illvin breathed out through pursed lips thats an unfortunate loss just now yes else he would have hauled foix straight to her and not come here instead but now im wondering if it may have been more than a mischance when i was captive riding in the jokonan columns baggage train i saw a strange sight a highranking officer perhaps the commander himself rode along tied to his saddle like a prisoner or a fainting wounded man his face was slack he could not control his drooling and he mumbled without words or sometimes cried out as if in fear or wept i thought perhaps a head blow had destroyed his reason but he bore no bandages or bloodstains whatsoever i now wonder if id had my second sight thenwhat great gouges i might have seen within his soul illvin blinked at the disturbing wordpicture his wits leapt ahead to the conclusion ista had not yet stated aloud might he have been another sorcerer in the service of jokona do you think commanding that column perhaps what if the saint of rauma did not die without a fight or wholly in vain what if it was she whod ripped his demonic powers out by the roots even as she fell to common violence at the start of a campaign do we not burn the enemys crops fill their wells deny them their resources i think a saint who could banish demons at will would be a powerful resource against an enemy who commanded perhaps more such sorcerers maybe more than those two why rauma you asked me yesterday what if the saints murder which we took for an incidental evil of the raid was instead its main purpose but demons do not readily work together objected dy cabon one sorcerer high in the jokonan court could do much damage were he of evil bent well or of loyal bent he conceded fairly to jokona that is but to call up or command a legion of demonsthat is the vocation of the bastard alone unimaginable hubris in a man and doubly so for a quadrene also such a perilous concentration of demons would generate chaos all around it war gathers on these borders said ista a greater concentration of chaos i can hardly imagine she rubbed her forehead lord illvin you have studied the court of jokona i suspect tell me something of it what are prince sordsos principal advisors and commanders like he eyed her with shrewd interest its mostly still the cadre of older men he inherited from his father his first chancellor was his paternal uncle though hes lately died the present general of jokona has served for years sordsos own friends and boon companions are a much younger lot but he hasnt had a chance to put any into positions of power too soon to tell if any of them will prove fitted for war or government though they seem to run largely to rich mens sons with too little chance or drive to learn their own trades arhys and i have speculated which will move up when the old men finally start to die off oh and his mother princess joendowager princess joen she was sordsos regent along with his uncle and the general until he came of age i wanted to probe down that way when she took the reins a few years ago but arhys was seized with a fit of deference for her sex and sad widowhood and anyway in the midst of what proved to be roya oricos final illness and death we feared cardegoss might not be able to rescue us from our mistakes or worse might fail to support a victory tell me more of joen said ista slowly did you ever meet her if umerue had held to her initial plan she would have become your motherinlaw daunting thought it is a measure of umerues powers that such a drawback never troubled my mind ive never met joen facetoface she is some ten or fifteen years older than i am and had more or less disappeared into the womens quarters by the time i was old enough to notice the politics of the princedom i will say she was the most continually pregnant princess in recent jokonan historycertainly did her duty by her husband though she was not entirely fortunate in her children for all her efforts out of a dozen or so only three sons and two of those died young some miscarriages and stillbirths too i think seven girls lived to marrysordso has family alliances all over the five princedoms oh and she takes her descent from the golden general most seriously makes up for the disappointments of her husband and son i supposeor maybe it creates them i dont know the golden general the lion of roknar for a time back in roya fonsas reign the brilliant quadrene leader had looked to unite the five princedoms for the first time in centuries and roll like a tide over the weak quintarian royacies but he had died untimely at the age of thirty destroyed by aging roya fonsa in a work of death magic during a night of towering selfimmolation the rite that killed both leaders had saved chalion from the roknari threat but also spilled the curse that would haunt fonsas heirs down to istas day and beyond the golden general had left only renewed political disorder in the princedoms for legacy and a few young children joen the least and youngest no surprise that she might grow up regarding him as a lost hero but if joen could not follow in her great fathers striding steps barred by her sex from war and politics might she have at least sought to recreate him in a son all those pregnancies ista who had experienced two did not underestimate their brutal drain on a womans body and energy ista frowned i was thinking about what cattis demon said she is coming it cried as if this were some dire event i had taken it to refer to me for i believe my godtouched state is a consternation to demons buti wasnt coming i was already there so that makes no sense really not that much of what it had to say made sense illvin remarked thoughtfully if someone in the court of jokona is indeed dipping into sorcery for the purpose of moving against chalion i must say it is not going all that well for him both his demonagents sad umerue and the columns commanderwere lost in the first two trials of their prowess if your guess is good perhaps said ista yet not without advancing jokonan goals the saint of rauma is dead and porifors is much distracted he glanced up sharply at this arhys still leads usdoes he not for the moment its clear his reserves are drawing down illvin reminded took another bite of bread and dutifully chewed his face screwed up in thought he swallowed and said it occurs to me that we do have one here who must know all the inward plans if such exist of whoever in sordsos court is behind this the demon itself we should question it again more firmly he added after a reflective moment it might be better if arhys were not present this time i quite see your point here perhaps tomorrow if it may be arranged not sure if catti will agree without arhys persuading her she must be made to said ista i will have to leave that part to you with some relief if ista read him right she said but were these losses all of jokonas sorcerers or two of many if all the elementals that have lately been found in chalion are lost or escaped from the same source how many more were captured as intended and how perhaps these two were sacrificed as a commander with many men would send some into a breach knowing he will bear losses but counting the gain to himself worth the cost but not if he has few men unless he is very desperate she tapped her fingers on her chair arm no it cannot be joen she would not put a demon into her own daughter she glanced at goram unless she were terribly ignorant of their nature and effects and in that case i can hardly see how she could control one sorcerer let alone many illvin cast her an odd look you love your own daughter very much i take it who would not istas smile softened she is the bright star of chalion beyond my hope and my deserving for i could do little enough for her during my dark times hm he smiled curiously at her and yet you said youd never loved anyone enough to guess at heavens hope she made a little excusing gesture i think the gods may give us children to teach us what true love really is that we may be fitted for their company at the last a lesson for those of us whose hearts are too dull and inert to learn any other way inert or merely the rope of white fire was beginning to attenuate his hand fell back weakly to his coverlet goram glanced with dismay at the amount of food still left on the tray ista watched illvin sink back his eyes closing and clenched her teeth with frustration she wanted that mind in her service against this conundrum but arhyss body seemed equally needed today she wished it were winter that she might steal another hour for illvin but it was too beastly hot to let the march start to rot come again shining ista he breathed with a fading sigh bring catti gone it was like watching him die every day she did not desire the practice ista turned aside at the stairs down to the stone court learned please attend upon me we must talk and i royina said liss hopefully you may make yourself comfortable within call taking the hint liss strolled away to a bench on the courts far end after an uncertain moment foix followed after her looking not displeased they put their heads together the moment they sat down ista led dy cabon back to the bench in the cloister walks shade and gestured him to a seat he settled himself with a tired grunt the days of riding and anxiety had told on him his stained white robes hung loosely and his belt was cinched in a few new notches ista remembering the gods immense girth and overflowing abundance in dy cabons dreamborrowed body could not on the whole regard this shrinking as an improvement she sat beside him and began you say you witnessed the banishing of an elemental when the ferrets rider was discharged from the world how exactly was it accomplished what did you see he shrugged his thick shoulders there was not a great deal to see with my poor eyes the archdivine of taryoon led me into the presence of the divine who had volunteered for the task a very elderly woman she was frail as paper in the temple hospital bed she seemed threefourths detached from the world already there is so much to delight us in the world of matterto tire of it seems ungrateful to me but she told me shed had all the pain she could eat and would pass from this banquet to a better one she genuinely desired her god as a weary sojourner desires his own bed ista said a man i know who had a mystic vision under the most extraordinary circumstances once told me he saw the dying souls rising up like flowers in the goddesss garden but he was a devotee of the lady of spring i think each god may have some different metaphor fine animals for the son of autumn i have heard strong men and beautiful women for the father and the mother for the bastardwhat he takes us as we are i hope hm but no dy cabon continued there were no special tricks or even prayers the divine said she did not need them as she was the one doing the dying i didnt argue i asked her what it was like dying she gave me such a look out of the corner of her eye and told me pretty tartly that when she found out shed be sure to let me know the archdivine signed me to cut the ferrets throat then which i did into a basin the old woman sighed and snorted as if at some other foolish remark like mine which we could not hear and then she stopped it took her only a moment to pass from life to death but it was unmistakable not a sleep an emptying out and that was that except for the cleaning up after that is not especially helpful sighed ista it was what i saw i suspect she saw more but i can scarcely imagine what in my dreamthe dream you entered intothe god kissed me twice the first time on the browshe touched the spotas his mother once did and so i recognized it as the gift of second sight of seeing the world of spirit directly as the gods do for i had received it so before but then he kissed me a second time oninmy mouth more deeply and disturbingly learned tell me what was the meaning of that second kiss you must knowyou were right there he gulped and blushed royina i cannot guess the mouth is the bastards own theological sign and signifier upon our bodies as the thumbs are upon our hands did he give you no other clues but me she shook her head the next day goram with some very confused notion about a royinaeven if only a dowager royinabeing able to undo what a princess had done invited me in to kiss his master and for an elated moment i thought id solved the riddlethat it was to be a kiss of life as in the childrens story but it didnt work nor on lord arhys when i attempted him later i did not take the trial further afield fortunately for my reputation in this castle the kiss was clearly something else some other gift or burden ista drew breath i face a threeway knot two parts may be loosed together if i could find some way to banish cattilaras demon illvin would be freed and the marchess saved but what hope may be found for arhys i saw his soul learned he is surely sundered or my inner eyes are blind it would be bad enough to complete his death and lose him to his god it would be worse to secure his damnation and lose him to nothingness i um know that some souls suffering especially disrupted deaths have lingered for a few days to be helped on their way by the prayers and ceremonies of their funerals slipped through the doors of their deaths before they quite shut might the rites of the temple help him find his way to his god then it was a bizarre image would arhys walk to his own funeral lie down on his bier he grimaced three months seems very late choice is the trial of all who are trapped in time and that choice is the last one time imposes if his moment for decision still lingered through some habit of the body could your second sight tell yes said ista lowly it can but i want another answer i do not like this one i had hopes of that kiss but it failed he scratched his nose in puzzlement you said the god spoke to you what did he say that i was sent here in answer to prayers illvins among others probably the bastard dared me by my own sons godneglected death not to turn aside she frowned fiercely in memory and dy cabon edged a little back from her i asked him what the gods having taken teidez could give me that i would trade spit for he answered work his blandishments were all decorated about with annoying endear merits that would have bought a human suitor a short trip to the nearest mud puddle by the hands of my servants his kiss on my brow burned like a brand his kiss on my mouthshe hesitated went on doggedlyaroused me like a lover which i most certainly am not dy cabon edged farther back smiling in anxious placation and made little agreeingdenying motions his hands like flippers indeed not royina no one could mistake you for such she glowered at him then went on then he disappeared leaving you holding the sack so to speak if this was prophecy it bodes you ill learned he signed himself right right um if the first kiss was a spiritual gift so ought the second to be yes i quite see that yes but he didnt say what it was bastard one of his little jokes it seems dy cabon glanced up as if trying to decide if that were prayer or expletive guessed correctly and took a breath marshaling his thoughts all right but he did say he said work if it sounds like a joke it was probably quite serious he added more cautiously it seems you are made saint again will or nil oh i can still nil she scowled thats what we all are you know hybrids of both matter and spirit the gods agents in the world of matter to which they have no other entree doorways he knocks on my door demanding entry he probes with his tongue like a lover mimicking above what is desired below nothing so simple as a lover he yet he desires that i open myself and surrender as if to one and let me tell you i despise his choice of metaphors dy cabon flippered frantically at her again it made her want to bite him you are a very fortress of a woman it is true she stifled a growl ashamed to have let her rage with his god spill over onto his humble head if you dont know the other half of the riddle why were you put there royina i know not he hesitated maybe we should all sleep on it he cringed at her blistering look and tried again i will endeavor to think do at the other end of the courtyard foix and liss were now sitting closer together foix held lisss hand which she did not draw back and spoke earnestly over it she was listening to him in istas jaundiced view with entirely too credulous an expression on her face ista rose abruptly and called her to attend she had to call twice to summon her notice the girl scrambled up hastily but her smile lingered like perfume in the air lady cattilara in some desperate attempt to sustain her role of chatelaine before her new guests held a dinner that afternoon in the same chamber where she and her ladies had entertained ista on the second night arhys was again out a very few of his officers attended clearly more to make a convenient hasty meal than to play courtier cattilara had seated foix as far from herself at the high table as she could given his claim to istas side as her present guard captain despite the distance it seemed to ista that the two remained highly aware of each other throughout the strained meal aware but plainly not attracted learned dy cabon nervous nevertheless led the prayers with admirable discretion keeping his pleas for godly blessings safely vague the conversations that commenced as the food was passed limped along the divine took refuge from them in industrious chewing he did not neglect to listen however ista noted with approval ista found one of arhyss senior officers on her right hand buffering liss and foix down at the end he was polite undaunted by her rank but preoccupied after a few pragmatic exchanges about the food and wine he abruptly said to her my lord has told us that he is very ill had you heard yes i am aware we have discussed it indeed i had marked that he was pale and not eating or sleeping well but i had not expected if he is that ill should he not be made to rest he glanced across at cattilara as if considering a potential alliance against his forceful commander for arhyss good rest will bring no cure for what he has said ista i fear his riding about in this weather may worsen his sickness i dont see how it can cattilara on istas left glowered at her i did not know you for a physician royina he let his tone trail off invitingly im not alas quite the reverse murmured cattilara resentfully the officer blinked uncertainly but finally mustered the perception to veer from a subject so clearly unpalatable to the marchess brigands from the princedoms do not normally ride so close to porifors i assure you royina but we chewed them well enough this morning i think they will be discouraged from new attempts they were rather more than brigands i thought said ista troops or so their tabards proclaimed though i suppose real brigands wouldnt hesitate to so disguise themselves has sordso the sot roused himself to some more military posture than heretofore or do you think someone else in his court may be probing your defenses i should never have thought it of sordso but indeed since the unfortunate death of his sister umerue i have heard that a great change has come over him we shall have to find him another nickname if this keeps on oh thus encouraged he turned eagerly to a safer court gossip than his own it is said that he has bestirred himself about his army which he never did before and given up drinking and dismissed all his boon companions and quite abruptly he has married to an heiress of borsasnen and taken two official concubines as well which the roknari name as wives so as to avoid the stigma of bastardy there which he had not troubled to before for all one hears that his advisors had long urged him to wed he sounds quite a reformed soul not to mention energized though perhaps the new wives will prove the cure for that we rather hope this extreme virtue will not last his poetry was not bad it would be a shame to lose it he grinned briefly istas brows rose this sounds not at all as lord illvin described the man but i suppose illvin has not had much chance to follow developments in jokona or indeed anywhere else in the past few months his head jerked around illvin describeddoes he speak now did he speak to you royina oh that is hopeful news ista glanced back at cattilara listening with her jaw clamped shut he has brief periods of lucidity i have spoken with him almost daily since i came here there is no doubt that his wits are intact but he remains very weak i think he is by no means out of danger yet she returned cattilaras glower stillstillwe feared his wits were gone for good when he did not awaken they were as great a loss to porifors as arhyss sword arm would be he caught the marchesss scowl and covered his confusion in a bite and another the ordeal of dinner was not dragged out with more than a perfunctory musical interlude to istas relief dy cabon went to his room for some muchneeded rest and foix accompanied arhyss officer to see what help his little troop might lend to porifors in exchange for their board and if istas estimation of foix held true to decant from the man most of the pertinent defensive information about the fortress and its denizens foixs next letter to cardegoss was likely to be very informative she wondered if hed yet confessed his new pet to chancellor dy cazaril or if that gap might be smoothly concealed in the very abundance of his tidings chapter eighteen liss was brushing out istas hair before bed a task the girl seemed to enjoyista suspected it brought back happy memories of the stableswhen a diffident knock sounded at the door of the outer chamber liss went to answer it and returned a moment later its one of lord arhyss pages he says his lord waits below and would beg a word with you istas brows went up at this hour very well tell him i will be down directly liss went to convey the message and ista slipped out of her wrapper and back into the lavender linen shift and black silk over robe her hand hesitated over the mourning brooch lying on the table then fastened the soft black fabric beneath her breasts with it as before inadvertently appropriate garb for arhyss presence she reflected with liss carrying a candle in a glass vase to light their steps she went out on the gallery lord arhys stood at the foot of the stairs holding a torch aloft looking up intently he still wore his sword and boots as if just returned from riding out ista was glad to see a coat of mail beneath his grayandgold tabard the night air was soft and still from the days heat and the flame gave a steady light cast down over his pale features royina i would speak with you apart ista gestured toward the bench at the courtyards far end and he nodded wait here ista said quietly to liss and the girl nodded and plunked down at the top of the steps ista descended and paced across the pavement at arhyss side he handed his torch to his page but the boy could not reach the bracket high on a carved pillar and arhys smiled briefly and took it back to set therein he dismissed the page to keep liss company ista and he settled themselves on either end of the stone slab still not wholly cooled from its days baking the starry depths of the sky bounded above by the roofs rectangle seemed to swallow the golden glow of lisss candle and the torch and give back nothing arhyss face was a gilded shadow against the deeper shadows but his eyes gleamed a busy day your restored companions and their jokonan tailpiece have brought us he began two of my patrols to the south and the west have returned with nothing to report two have not yet come back and they concern me he hesitated cattilara did not greet my return she is angry with me i think for riding out on your duties she will surely forgive you she will not forgive my dying i am become her enemy in this as well as her prize have you now she still thinks she can get you back or at least prevent you from going she does not i think perceive the wasting effect of this delay upon you being blinded by the surfaces of things if she sees the disintegrating ghosts at all i do not think she understands the nature of their damnation damnation he breathed is that what my state is that explains much theologically i do believe that is precisely what it is although perhaps learned dy cabon could refine the term i do not know the scholars language but i have seen the thing itself you are cut off from the nourishment of matter but blocked from the sustenance of your god and yet not by your own will as the true and mercifully sundered spirits are by anothers interference this is wrong he stretched and clenched his hands it cant go on i dont even bother to pretend to eat now i drink only sips my hands and face and feet are growing numb just within the past ten days ive noticed it faintly at first but its getting worse that does not sound good she agreed she hesitated have you prayed his hand went to his left sleeve and ista remembered the blackandgray prayer cord bound secretly there need for the gods comes and goes in a mans life cattilara longed for a child i made my obeisances but if the father of winter ever heard me he gave me no sign i was never the sort to receive portents or to delude myself that i had silence was always my portion in return for my prayers but of late it seems to me the silence has grown emptier royinahis gaze sparking out of the shadows seemed to pierce herhow much longer do i have she was about to say i dont know but the evasion smacked of cowardice no mothers physician could answer him with any better knowledge than hers what do i know she studied him with both outer and inner sights of ghosts i have seen many but more old than new they accumulate you see most still hold the form of life of their bodies for some two or three months after death but drained of color and of caring they slowly erode by a year after second sight can usually no longer distinguish human features though they still have the form of a body by several years old they are a white blur then a fainter blur then gone but the time varies greatly i suspect depending on the strength of character the person had to begin with and the stresses of their dwindling existence arhys was unique in her experience the demands upon his spirit would be huge for a living man how could his starveling desolate ghost sustain them the greatsouled give greatly from their abundance but even they must come to the end of themselves without the upholding hands of her mind shied from completing the thought she reined it round their god so what is my appearance now almost wholly colorless she added reluctantly you are beginning to blur about the extremities he rubbed his face with an exploring hand and murmured ah much comes clear he sat silent for a little then tapped his knee you once told me you had promised ias not to speak of my fathers true fate to any living soul urn well here am i before you now royina i would know ista was surprised into a snort you are a most excellent lawyer for a dead man this counterthrust would be a very good sharp point if it werent that id lied to you in the first place ias never asked me for any such promise he was scarcely speaking to me by then the tale i told you was but a shield to hide my cravenness craven is not how id describe you lady one learns better than to hand ones choices to fear with age with every wound and scar one learns then i ask the truth of you now as my bier gift more desirable to me than flowers ah she let out her breath in a long sigh yes her fingers traced over the smooth cool amethysts and silver filigree of the brooch beneath her breast dy lutez wore it in his hat he wore it there on his last day i do recall this will be but the third time in my life to make this confession third time pays for all they say what do they know she snorted again more softly i think not still my auditors have been of the best as befits my rank and crime a living saint an honest divine the dead mans dead son so she had told it over in her mind enough times it needed no further rehearsal she straightened her back and began all men know that iass father roya fonsa in despair at the loss of his sons and his royacy before the onslaught of the golden generals alliance slew his enemy by a rite of death magic giving up his own life in the balance that is history yes fewer men know that the rite spilled a residue a subtle curse afflicting fonsas heirs and all their works first ias then his son orico teidez iselle oricos barren wife sara and me she breathed and me iass was not noted as a fortunate reign for chalion he conceded warily nor oricos ias the unlucky orico the impotent the nicknames given by the vulgar do not touch the half of it ias knew of his curse knew its origin and its nature though he did not tell even orico until he lay on his deathbed but he shared the knowledge with arvol dy lutez his companion from boyhood marshal chancellor right arm possibly as orico did later with his own favorites ias was trying to use arvol as a tongs by which to handle the affairs of chalion without spilling his evil geas upon them not that the ploy worked but it suited arvol dy lutezs ambitions and huge energies well enough and his arrogance i grant your father did love ias in his way ias worshipped him and was utterly dependent upon his judgment arvol even selected me for him arhys pulled on his closetrimmed beard the rumor i have heard bruited by the envious that they were ah more intimate than boon companions i take to be political slander no she said simply they were lovers for years as all cardegoss knew but did not speak of outside the capital walls my own mother told me just before i wed so i would not step into it unawares i thought her callous then now i think her wise and worried looking back i think it also was an offer to let me back out though i missed that implication entirely at the time yet for all her candid warnings which i found later lord dy lutez had insisted she give meto prevent trouble for him mostly i suspect though also for iasi did not understand what it meant how could ia romantic virgin overwhelmed by what seemed a great victory on the field of love to be chosen as bride by the roya himself i nodded and agreed anxious to seem sophisticated and sensible oh he said very quietly so if ever you thought your mother untrue to her vows to take illvins father to her bed be assured she was not the first dy lutez to break them i suspect her mother was less shrewd and honest than mine preparing her for her high marriage or less informed his brows climbed in reflection that accounts for much that i did not understand as a boy i thought my father had cast her off in anger and humiliation and that was why he never came here i never thought that she had cast him off oh im quite sure that lord dy lutez was thoroughly offended by her defection ista said no matter how justified his pride would keep him from returning but his sense of justice to give him credit likely also kept him from pursuing any vengeance or perhaps it was shame i can hope she added dryly in any case he still had her property to add to his vast holdings for compensation of his wounds he eyed her you thought him greedy no man accumulates all that he did by chance yet i would not call it greed exactly for he scarcely knew all he held and a greedy man numbers each coin what would you call it then istas brows pinched in consolation she tried at last his possessions were a magic mirror to reflect him the size he wished to be that he said after a moment is a fearsome judgment royina she bent her head in an acknowledging nod he was a very complex man she drew breath began again arvol and ias did not betray me by concealing their love they betrayed me by concealing the curse i entered into marriage with ias unaware of my danger or the danger to my childrentobe the visions started when i became pregnant with iselle the gods trying to break in upon me i thought i was going mad and ias and dy lutez let me go on thinking that for two years he jerked a little at the sudden fierceness in her voice that seems most unkind that was cowardice and contempt for my wits and spine they mired me in the consequences of their secret then refused to trust me with its cause i was a mere girl you see unfit to bear such a burden though not unfit to bear iass children into that darkness except the gods did not seem to regard me as unfit for it was me they came to not ias not dy lutez me her lips twisted i wonderin retrospecthow put out arvol was by that he would have been the sole shining hero to save ias if he could it was his accustomed role and indeed for a while it did appear that the gods had assigned it to him at lastdo even the gods grow impatient with our obtuseness the mother of summer herself appeared to me not in dream but in waking vision i was prostratedi had not yet learned to be suspicious of the gods she told me that the curse might be broken and carried out of the world by a man who would lay down his life three times for the blighted house of chalion being young and frenzied with anxiety for my babies i took her words too literally and concluded that she meant me to devise a perilous rite to accomplish this paradox perilous indeed and um his brow wrinkled paradoxical i told all to ias and arvol and we took counsel together arvol afflicted by our weeping volunteered to attempt the heros role we hit upon drowning as the method for men were known to come back from that death sometimes and it does not disfigure arvol studied it collected tales investigated victims both lost and saved in a cavern beneath the zangre we set up the cask the ropes the winch the altars to all the gods arvol let himself be stripped bound lowered upside down until his struggles ceased until the light of his soul went out to my inner eye he began to speak she held up her hand to block the misunderstanding no not yet we drew him outpressed the water from his throat pounded on his heart cried out our prayers until he choked and breathed again and i could see the crack in the curse we had planned the ritual three nights in succession on the second night all went the same until his hair brushed the surface of the water and he gasped out to stop he could not bear it he cried i was trying to assassinate him for jealousys sake ias hesitated i was shaken sick in my stomachbut i let reason compel me it was arvols own chosen method it had worked once i wailed for fear for my children and for the frustration of coming so close to miss saving them by a handbreadth for rage at his slander and for raising my hopes so high upon his pride then dashing them so low upon his frailty she added simply id believed in his account of himself you see in the night in some hollow below the castle walls insects sang a thin high keening it was the only sound arhys had forgotten to breathe his body perhaps was losing the habit she wondered how long it would take him to notice when we drew him out the second time he was dead indeed and not all our tears and prayers regrets and recriminations and oh there were many of those last brought him back again ias half decided later that arvols accusation of jealousy was true half the time i agreed myself the fault was iass for weakness and mine for impatience and unwisdom for if ias had stood against me i would have yielded or if i had listened to my heart and not my head and allowed arvol more time who is to say that after another day or week or month he might have recovered his nerve ill never know now the gods forsook me the curse remained unbroken worse in its effects than ever until another generation threw up another man more fitted to lift it from the world she drew breath and that is how i came to murder your father if you really want to know he was silent for a long time remembered to inhale and said lady i think this is not a confession this is an indictment she rocked back of arvol yes she said slowly that too if he had never volunteered id have thought no less of him if he had died on the first attempt well i would have thought the task beyond any man or my design mistaken but to demonstrate the true possibility and then fail shattered my heart it was not i came later to learn death by rote that the gods required one cannot force anothers soul to grow wide enough to admit a god to the world but that dilation not the mere dying was what was wanted arvol dy lutez was a great man but not quite great enough he stared into the darkness the torch had almost burned out though at the top of the stairs lisss candle still glowed she sat with her chin propped in her hands eyelids drooping the page had fallen asleep curled up against her skirts if my father had lived he said at last do you think he would ever have called me to his side if he had wrenched open his soul wide enough to succeed i think it would thereafter have been more than wide enough to encompass you those who have admitted a god do not shrink back to their former size in my experience if he had never made the attempt well he was never quite small enough to turn aside from hazard either so i do not know mm it was a little noise but contained a cache of pain nonetheless he glanced up at the sky reading the clock of the stars royina i keep you from your bed but not the reverse in the long lonely watches of his unsleeping nights what did he now think about she took the hint nonetheless and rose he stood with her his war gear creaking he took her hand half bowed briefly pressed his cool forehead against its back royina i do thank you for these garlands of truth i know they cost you dear they are dry and bitter thorns i wish i could give you some better bier gift with all my cracking heart i do wish it i do not desire any softer wreath liss seeing them pace once more across the court prodded the page awake and came to the foot of the stairs to receive ista back from arhyss arm arhys saluted them solemnly and turned away his sleepy page pattering after the echoes of his receding footfalls in the archway sounded like muffled drums in istas ears it was long before ista slept in the gray of dawn she seemed to hear thumping and low voices in the distance but her exhaustion drew her back down into her pillow she fell into an evil dream where she sat at a high table with lady cattilara the marchess glowing faintly violet plied her guest with food until istas belly strained and drowned her wits in drink until ista lay back in her chair unable to rise for the paralysis in her limbs only a much louder thumping at the door to the outer chamber roused her from this bizarre dream imprisonment she exhaled in relief to find herself in her own bed her body normally proportioned and mobile again if feeling anything but well rested by the bright lines seeping through her shutters it was broad day lisss steps sounded then voices foixs deep and urgent dy cabons sharp and excited ista had already swung out of bed and pulled her black robe about herself when the door between the chambers opened and liss poked her head in royina something very strange has happened ista pushed past her foix was dressed for the day in blue tunic trousers boots and sword his face flushed with exertion dy cabons white under tunic was on askew its front buttons mismatched with their buttonholes his feet yet bare royina foix ducked his head did you see or hear anything at lord illvins chambers or on the gallery along about dawn your room is closer than ours nomaybe i fell back to sleep she grimaced in memory of the unpleasant dream i was very tired was there something lady cattilara came at dawn with some servants and carried off lord illvin on a pallet to take him down to the temple to pray over and consult with the temple physicians she said the temple physicians should come up to attend upon him in porifors i would think said ista disturbed did lord arhys go with them the march is nowhere to be found this morning i first learned of all this when one of his officers asked me if id seen him i last saw arhys last night he came to speak with me down in the courtyard around midnight liss was there the girl nodded she had evidently wakened before istashe was dressed and had a tray with morning tea and fresh bread sitting ready on a tablebut not much before for this all seemed news to her as well well foix continued i felt strangely uneasyprobably left over from the bad dreams id had last night which really made me wonder about the castle food but anyway i made an excuse to walk down to the temple to see what was happening lady cattilara had never come there i asked around i finally discovered that she had commandeered a supply wagon and a team of dray horses from the garrisons stable down there no one knew what had been loaded aboard but the wagon with goram driving and one of the servants sitting beside him was seen leaving the town gate at least an hour ago on the road south istas breath drew in has she or arhys been seen since no royina then she has stolen them away taken arhys and abducted illvin to maintain him foixs gaze upon her sharpened this is the marchesss doing do you think not lord arhyss lord arhys would never abandon porifors and his post not for all his wifes weeping said ista with certainty being a strongerminded man than las but then a dy lutez always was but her demon wanted to flee you told us said dy cabon suppose it has gained the upper hand then why take the baggage asked liss logically lady cattilaras body and her jewel case and one fast horse would serve it better foix eyed her with a flash of respect not i think the upper hand said ista slowly but suppose her demon had persuaded her that both their goals could be better served by flight she would have all its cooperation then she desires her husbands life restored or at least his strange half death continued indefinitely said foix how is that served by heaving him and poor lord illvin into a wagon and driving off er said dy cabon all the faces in the room turned toward him what said ista sharply ah um im wondering if something i might have said lady cattilara came to me last evening after dinner for spiritual guidance i thought we talked about this dire knot poor chick her tears glittered down like little jewels of sorrow across her cheeks ista rolled her eyes no doubt and then i tried to counsel as well as console to bring her to some sense of what a theological danger she had placed her husband in as well as the physical danger inflicted upon his brother and her own souls peril i said more demon magic was no cure nothing but a miracle could alter the inevitable course of events she asked me where were miracles to be had for all the world as if they came from some holy emporium i said only saints could channel them to us from the gods she asked where were saints to be found i said all sorts of strange and unexpected places both high and low i said i thought you royina were the saint into whose hands this tangle had been given for unraveling she said um well some wild and unconsidered thingsshe seems to think you are her enemy i assured her that could not be so she suggested any other saint in the world would be better suited for the task and asked me to send for one as though saints were physicians to be obtained from the temple by draft well some saints are physicians but its not like i suggested that she wasnt likely to get any other answer from the gods most people dont even get one im afraid she is not very interested in the subtler truths of theology she wants a rite by rote said ista as i did once a merchants bargain pay the coin get the goods she just cant find the peddler he shrugged i fear it is so so now she has taken her quick and her dead and gone on pilgrimage to look for a miracle to order the roads here are very unsafe as we found yesterday said foix in a voice of worry lord arhys would surely not permit his wife to go out on them now no matter what her hope do you think he had a choice is there one pallet in that wagon or twothe brothers lying side by side like bundles of cordwood the demon could help her to itthe dual inactivity would likely be a relief to it dy cabon scratched his head she has a better right to seek healing for lord arhys than any other person he is her husband illvin isnt said ista shortly and what arhys needs goes beyond healing they must be brought back foix muster your troop and their horses liss wrap my knees for riding i dont want to tear open these scabs dy cabon said royina you should not be out on the road either i agree with you but foix has not the authority to command cattilaras servants against her own wishes and someone must handle her demon i think i might do that royina said foix he glanced warily at dy cabon can you simultaneously handle a screaming weeping distraught woman ah he said contemplating this unpalatable vision can you i think so in fact i think im looking forward to it i would urn appreciate that royina good warn arhyss officers hm her eyes narrowed i suspect arhys would not want this tale bruited about dy cabon if were not back inhow long foix two hours they had four horses hitched and an hours starttwo or three hours if were not back in three hours tell arhyss senior officers what we have done and have them send men after us ista turned to foix hurry well meet you in the forecourt as soon as the horses are saddled he saluted her and was gone liss was already stripping out of her fine dress and kicking off her slippers ista pushed the protesting dy cabon out the door but i should ride with you royina cried the divine and foix should not be left unguided no i need you here and if foixs dancing bear requires a collar i am better fitted to supply it and youre too fat and you ride too slow lisss unsympathetic voice floated through the window accompanied by a thump of boots being lined up dy cabon reddened ista rested her hand on his shoulder this is a dry country and culverts are hard to come by you will be one less terror for my heart to worry about safe in here his color deepened but he bowed in unhappy obedience nonetheless ista shut the door on him and hurried to don her riding clothes chapter nineteen in the forecourt ista was startled by the horse liss led out for her tall shimmering white with a soft gray nose mane and tail like silk bannersferda would have waxed poetic the stall stains were carefully washed off its coat with only a few faint yellow traces that reminded her inescapably of the blotches on dy cabons white robes it snuffled and nudged at her big dark eyes liquid and amiable whats this ista asked as liss led it to the mounting block they tell me his name is feather short for featherwits i asked for the besttrained horse in the stable for you and they begged me to take him out because since lord illvin fell sick hes done little but laze in his stall and eat and get fat is this lord illvins own mount then asked ista throwing a leg over the broad back the horse stood perfectly still for her as she disposed her padded knees gingerly against its sides and found her stirrups surely it isnt a warhorse no he has another stallion for thateviltempered scarred red brute that no one else will go near liss threw herself up on her courier palomino which sidled uncooperatively and seemed inclined to buck but settled under her stern hand its savaged any number of grooms they showed me their injuries very impressive foixs hand rose and fell and he and pejar on their mounts led the way out the gate followed by liss and ista and then the half dozen remaining men of the daughters company they sorted themselves into single file to descend the narrow switchback road past the village beyond its walls they turned onto the road from tolnoxo that ista had arrived down so many crowded days ago foix set a brisk but not killing pace walking up slopes trotting down cantering on the flat featherwit seemed a slander for the horse was so responsive to istas lightest command of rein or heel that it seemed she had only to think her desire its trot was a long smooth ripple its canter like being rocked along in a sedan chair she was relieved by its gentleness for it seemed a long way to the hard ground from her perch lord illvin would need a tall horse certainly riding through a moist wooded area by the river they stirred up a plague of large buzzing horseflies ista grimaced and slapped at the ones she could reach as they settled hungrily on feathers silky sides they crunched disgustingly leaving blood streaks on her palm lisss palomino bucked and squealed foix glanced back over his shoulder only ista saw the little violet flicker from his hand but the ugly flies lifted from lisss mount since they then collected on istas this seemed little improvement but the cavalcade broke into the sunlight and left the flies behind before she could complain they made the long climb up the valleys steeper side and stopped to water the horses at the village with the olive grove some five miles out from porifors this shade was mercifully free of bloodsucking insects pejar went off to inquire of the villagers for word of the wagon they pursued ista found herself standing and stretching next to foix in the shadow of a huge olive bole as the sweaty horses gulped from the stream still playing with flies she inquired softly i saw that trick no more please or i shall report you to the divine he blushed it was a good deed besides i wanted to please liss hm she hesitated take my advice and do not use magic to court her most especially do not yield to the temptation to use it directly to induce her favor by his embarrassed grin he knew precisely what she impliedand this wasnt the first time the notion of some sort of aphrodisiac spell had crossed his mind mm istas voice dropped further for if you do and she finds out it will destroy her trust not only in you but in her own mind she would never again be sure if a thought or a feeling were truly her own she would be constantly halting secondguessing turning about inside her head madness lies down that road it would be less crippling and more loving if you should take a war hammer and break both her legs his smile had grown fixed as you command royina i do not speak as your royina i do not even speak as one godtouched i speak as a woman who has walked to the end of that road and returns to report the hazards if you still possess half the wits you started withand if it is indeed love you seek and not just your gratificationyou will listen as a man his little bow this time was visibly more thoughtful his smirk wiped clean pejar came back with the news that a wagon and team had indeed stopped at the grove earlier lingering in the shade long enough to unhitch and water both pairs of horses the wagon had left again not half an hour before foix grimaced satisfaction and cut their own rest short another four miles of trotting brought them to the top of a long rise they at last saw their quarry rumbling down the road small in the distance the wagons canvas top painted with the sigil of poriforss garrison bright in the sunlight foix waved his troop onward they had largely closed the gap before someone from the wagon spotted them the invisible driver whipped up the team but the lumbering dray horses burdened by the load they towed were no match for the pursuers faster mounts men of foixs company galloped up on either side of the noisily bouncing vehicle to lean over and seize the lead pairs reins as she in turn urged her horse up and around ista could hear cattilaras voice crying out in protest the wagon slowed to a halt cattilara dressed in an elegant traveling costume of gray and gold was crouched on the drivers box berating a terrified goram who hunched down with his eyes nearly shut clutching his teams reins in clenched and shaking hands ista narrowed her eyes against the light of the world and tried to extend her inner vision to its fullest sensitivity to directly perceive not spirits hidden in matter but spirits alone was this how the gods saw the world cattilaras demon was not to istas relief expanded and dominant but curled in on itself within her again another male servant one of cattilaras younger ladies and arhyss page cowered together in the wagons back two nearly extinguished forms lay side by side within with the blockage of istas corporeal vision by the canvas and wood it became almost easier to see what she was actually looking for a wispy line of white fire sluggishly drifting from one body to another at a level of perception even below that a net of violet light running three ways the spellchannel she tightened her fingers and feather stopped and stood in a placid obedience she let the reins fall to his withers and stretched her hands letting her spirit follow along with her body and then for the first time flow beyond her body bastard help me curse you she did not did not dare try to break the underlying lines of the demons spell yet but she set her ligatures and summoned soulfire the white line from illvin to arhys blazed up like a thatch catching alight in a distant dark arhyss deep voice sounded from within irritable as a man waking from sleep what is this illvin cattilaras screaming abuse abruptly stopped her head drew in and she shrank in her seat panting she glowered at ista movement sounded within the wagon a creak boot steps on the floorboards arhys poked his head out and stared around bastards hell where are we a glance at the familiar landscape evidently answered the question to his satisfaction for he turned his frown on his weeping wife cattilara what have you done on the wagons other side the tensed foix breathed relief and sent a small salute of thanks in istas direction the mauve flicker waiting in his palm died away cattilara turned in her seat and threw her arms around her husbands thighs in wild supplication goram ducked out of her way my lord my lord no order these people away tell goram to drive on we must escape she is evil she wants to encompass your death automatically he patted her hair his rolling eye fell on ista watching grimly royina what is this what is the last thing you remember lord arhys his brows drew in cattilara sent me an urgent message to attend upon her at the garrisons stable yard i walked in and found this wagon standing at the ready there thennothing after that his frown deepened your wife took it into her head to carry you off and seek healing for you elsewhere than porifors to what extent she was encouraged in this by her demon i know not but it certainly assisted her in it illvin was brought along principally i suppose as your commissary arhys winced desert my post desert porifors now cattilara flinched at the iron in his voice her collapse in tears before him failed for once to have any softening effect when he turned her face up to his ista could see the tension in the tendons of his hands standing out like cords beneath his pale skin cattilara think this desertion dishonors my trust and my sworn oaths to the provincar of caribastos to the royina iselle and royseconsort bergonto my own men it is impossible it is not impossible suppose you were sick of oh any other illness someone else would have to take over then all the same you are ill another officer must take your post for now the only one i would trust to take over at a moments notice in this present uncertainty is illvin he hesitated would be illvin he corrected himself no no no she fairly beat on him with her fists in a paroxysm of frustration and rage ista studied the pulsating lines of light can i do this she wasnt sure well i am sure that i can try so she folded her fleshly hands quietly in her lap and reached again with her spirit hands again leaving the demons underlying channels undisturbed she tightened the ligature between illvin and arhys nearly to closure arhys fell to his knees his lips parted in shock if you want him upright and moving said ista to cattilara you must keep him so yourself now no more stealing no screamed cattilara as arhys half collapsed across her goram grabbed at him to keep his heavy body from toppling from the seat cattilara stared down at arhyss pale confused face in horrified denial the fire of her soul roiled up from her body and collected at her heart yes ista thought you can do it girl then with a wail and a white rush cattilara fainted away the disorderly fire burst from her heart splashing irregularly in the spellbanks ista extended a transparent hand again the flow steadied settled not too swift lest it drain its reservoirs altogether nor too slow lest it fail its purpose just there her inner eye rechecked the lines a tiny trickle of life still flowed from illvin just enough to maintain contact she dared not touch the demons subtle net not that she was at all sure she could break it even if she tried arhys blinked flexed his jaw shakily stood up one hand braced on gorams shoulder oh thank you muttered foix into the blessed silence i used to carry on not unlike that from time to time in my first grief murmured ista across to him in uncomfortable reminiscence why in five gods names did no one ever smother me and put themselves out of my misery i may never know a rasping voice from within the wagon said bastards demons now what a flash of relief crossed arhyss features illvin out here a padding of bare feet illvin wearing only his linen robe and looking much like a man wakened too early after a night of too much revelry stumbled out and stood blinking into the bright morning one lean hand grasping the canvas frame for balance his eye fell on ista and his face lit witless he cried in delight this odd greeting ista concluded belatedly was actually addressed to his horse who flicked its ears and snuffed flaring its gray nostrils and almost but not quite moved from the spot on which its rider had bade it stand royina illvin continued giving her a nod i trust feathersforwits here has gone well for you five gods did no one think to cut his feed he is a most perfect gentleman ista assured him i find him very shapely illvin looked down at catti now slumped over against gorams shrinking shoulder whats this is she all right for the moment ista assured both him and arhys who was eyeing his wife even more uncertainly i ah required that she change chairs with you for a little while i did not know you could do that said illvin cautiously neither did i till i tried it a moment ago the demons spell is unbroken just reapportioned arhys his face rigid with his discomfiture nevertheless knelt and gathered cattilara up in his arms illvin felt his right shoulder and frowned his frown deepened as his glance took in a slow red leak starting on cattilaras shoulder he leaned aside for his burdened brother to duck back into the wagon ista handed her reins to liss and scrambled from her saddle across to the wagon seat illvin extended a hand to swing her safely aboard we must talk she told him he nodded in heartfelt agreement goram he added his groom looked up with open relief in his face get this wagon turned around and headed back to porifors yes my lord said goram happily ista ducked after arhys and illvin as foix began calling instructions to his men to help back and turn the team arhys laid cattilara her head lolling down on the pallet he had just vacated it was dim and musty under the canvas after the bright light outside but istas eyes quickly adjusted the other servant cattilaras woman and the page squatted fearfully at the back of the wagon among three or four small trunks it seemed modest provision for the journey though the marchesss jewel case no doubt reposed somewhere within the baggage arhys sent the manservant and the woman forward to sit with goram his page roundeyed with worry settled near him he gave the boy a reassuring ruffle of the hair arhys sat crosslegged by his wifes head illvin handed ista down onto the pallet opposite she felt her scabs crack under their pads as she folded her knees illvin started to settle crosslegged next to her realized the inadequacy of his narrow robe for that position and sat instead on his knees arhys glowered down at his wife i cant believe shed think i would desert porifors i dont imagine she did said ista hence this deceit she hesitated its a hard thing when all your life rides on the decisions of others and you can do nothing to affect the outcome the wagon finished its turn and started off at a walking pace the team would be tired enough by the time theyd retraced the ten or so miles to the castle arhys touched cattilaras shoulder now showing a dark red stain from the slow ooze beneath this wont do it must till we get back to porifors said illvin uneasily he stretched his arms and hands and hitched his shoulders as if settling back into a body grown unused to him he tested his own grip and frowned i can only hope the garrison hasnt fallen into an uproar over my disappearance said arhys as soon as we arrive said ista we must make another attempt to question cattilaras demon it must know what is afoot in jokona and most of all who dispatched it she repeated to illvin the officers tale of the sudden reform of sordso the sot how very strange mused illvin sordso never showed any sign of such family feeling before butwill we be able to question the creature royina asked arhys still staring down at cattilara we had little enough luck the last time ista shook her head in equal doubt i did not have learned dy cabons advice before nor the assistance of foix dy gura we may be able to set one demon upon the other to some good effect or to some effect i shall take counsel of the divine when we return i would take counsel of my brother while i can said arhys i would take counsel of some food said illvin is there any in this wagon arhys bade his page search the boy emerged from rooting among the supplies with a loaf of bread a sack of leathery dried apricots and a skin of water illvin settled and began conscientiously gnawing while arhys detailed the reports from poriforss scouts we are missing news from the north road altogether illvin observed as arhys wound up his rapid account i mislike this yes i am most troubled for the two parties that have not yet returned or sent any courier i was about to send another patrol after them when my morning duties were so unexpectedly interrupted arhys glanced in exasperation at his unconscious wife or possibly go myself i beg you will not said illvin rubbing his shoulder well no perhaps that would not be wise under the circumstances his gaze upon cattilara grew if possible more worried she looked terribly defenseless curled up on her side without the underlying strain of subterfuge in her face her striking natural beauty reasserted itself he glanced up and managed a brief smile for istas sake do not be alarmed royina even if some unseen force approaches from that direction there is little they can do against porifors the walls are stout the garrison loyal the approaches for siege engines difficult in the extreme and the fortress stands upon solid rock it cannot be undermined support from oby would arrive before our assailants had time to finish making camp if oby is not itself attacked at the same time muttered illvin arhys glanced away i have spoken at length with the temple notary in the past few days and placed my will in writing under his care the castle warder has charge of all my other papers i have appointed you my executor and joint guardian of little liviana arhys said illvin his voice drawn with doubt i would point out that there is no guarantee that i will get out of this alive either his brother nodded livianas grandfather becomes her sole sponsor in that case and guardian of all her dy lutez properties in all eventsgiven the lack of any child between catti and mei mean to return cattilara with her jointure to the guardianship of lord dy oby cattilara would care as little for my rule as i would care to exert it said illvin thank you from us both arhys nodded in wry understanding if youifif you cannot undertake it in livianas name poriforss military command must revert to the provincar of caribastos to be assigned to a man he judges able to carry out its tasks i have written him to warn him well only that i am ill and that he may wish to look about him just in case you take care of every duty no matter how distasteful illvin smiled bleakly you have always sought to take a fathers care of us all is there any doubt which god waits to take you up but let him wait a little longer i say he glanced aside at ista but no god awaits him ista thought thats what sundered means arhys shrugged the days gnaw at me as rats gnaw a corpse i can feel it now more and more i have already overstayed most grievously royina his eyes upon her were uncomfortably penetrating can you release me is that why you were tumbled down here ista hesitated i scarcely know what i can do and what i cannot if i am meant to channel miracles that one would not be my first choice yet it is the nature of miracles that their human conduit may not choose them except to cry them yes or no it is only demon sorcery that we may bend to our own wills no one bends a god and yet said illvin thoughtfully the bastard is half a demon himself they say i think his nature is not wholly as the rest of his familys perhaps his miracles are not either ista frowned in confusion i dont know he seemed just as much beyond me in my dream as his mother did in my vision of her nigh on twenty years ago in any case i have only tried to rearrange the strength that flows among you three i have not tried to break the bindings beneath or force the demon to do so against its mistresss will though it is clear enough that it would abandon all and fly if it could try now said arhys both ista and illvin made simultaneous noises of protest and glanced at each other because if you cannot do this i must also know said arhys patiently butthere is no way to test it but to do it and then i would not know how to undo it i did not suggest that you then seek to undo it i would fear to leave you damned more than i am now ista looked away discomfited she read a souldeep exhaustion in his face as if he grew hourly less loath to end his travails even into the dwindling silence of nothingness butwhat if this is not the task i was sent for what if i am wrong in my reasoningagain i should have been ecstatic if it had been given me to heal you i do not wish to murder another dy lutez you did once yes but not by sorcery by drowning the method would not work on you you havent taken a breath in the last fifteen minutes oh yes he looked embarrassed and made an effort to inhale illvins eyes had grown wide what tale is this ista glanced at him gritted her teeth and said arvol dy lutez did not die in the zangre under questioning ias and i drowned him by mistake in the course of an attempt among the three of us to call down a miracle for chalions sake the treason accusation was entirely false well that was certainly getting more succinct with practice illvins mouth hung open for a moment longer he finally said ah i always did think that treason charge was oddly handled the rite failed because arvols courage failed she stopped then blurted out and yet i might have saved the hour even at the last if i could have called down a miracle of healing even as he lay drowned dead at our feet the mother the very goddess of remedy stood at my right hand just around some corner of perception if my soul had not been so knotted with rage and fear and grief that there was no room in it for any god to enter three prior confessions had all evaded this codicil she realized she glanced aside again at illvin or if i had loved him instead of hated him or ifi dont know illvin cleared his throat most people fail to work miracles most of the time such a dereliction scarcely needs accounting for mine does i was called she brooded as the wagon creaked along now i am called again but what for she glanced up at arhys i wonder how our lives would have been different if your father had brought you to court maybe we put the wrong dy lutez in that barrel now there was a vision what was he like at twenty illvin oh quite as he is now illvin responded not as polished or practiced perhaps not as broad in the shoulder a smile of memory flickered over his mouth not as levelheaded not as dead growled arhys frowning at his hands which he was stretching and clenching again testing for numbness for increasing numbness when i was young and beautiful at court in cardegoss when arhys had not yet been married even once when all things were still possible might she then have taken a dy lutez as a lover after all and made the false slander true and yet fonsas dark curse had blighted all budding hopes in that courtto what horrors might it have bent that sweet dream to what disasters drawn arhyss youthful brilliance would it be true or false comfort to suggest to arhys that arvol had kept him away for his own safety she suppressed a shudder it was still too late arhys blinked at her missing the implications but illvin grunted a pained laugh imagine youd met him before youd married ias then as long as youre spinning mighthavebeens he advised dryly he cast her an odd look all my mighthavebeens come out the same either way the wagon bumped and rocked marking a turn off the road ista peeked out to discover that they had returned to the walled village and were stopping in the olive grove again to water the horses the sun had climbed to noon and the day was growing very hot ista clambered down for a moment to stretch her halfhealed legs and get a drink liss still had lord illvins white horse in tow watering it at the stream illvin looked out longingly at it then abruptly disappeared back inside the wagon voices came from behind the canvas some sort of argument involving illvin goram and the manservant illvin emerged a few minutes later smiling in satisfaction wearing his grooms leather trousers and the manservants boots below his light linen robe the trousers were cinched in around his waist and barely reached his calves but the boots made up the difference illvin reclaimed his horse and grinned as he mounted it appreciation for a body up and moving at will through the bright world again was plain in his face perhaps the more keenly felt for the fragility of the stolen moment he let liss help lengthen his stirrups spoke a word of thanks settled in his saddle and gave ista a cheery salute goram ista was relieved to see now wore a pair of illfitting linen trousers evidently borrowed from the wagons scanty store though the hapless manservant was left barefoot the daughters men helped roll up the wagons canvas sides partway as the heat of the day was making the suffocating stuffiness a greater trial than the dust of the road not ista conceded that lord arhys was likely to notice either one they started off again foix disposed four of his men before and two behind the lumbering wagon and illvin and liss rode along at either side within easy speaking distance a few miles from the village they topped the rise swung right along the slope and began their drop into the broad valley that porifors guarded they rounded a stand of trees abruptly foix flung up a hand their little party ground to a halt illvin rose in his stirrups his eyes widening ista and arhys scrambled to the front of the wagon and looked out arhyss lips drew back and his teeth clenched though only istas breath drew in harsh as a rasp down her dry throat turning onto the road just ahead of them from some crosscountry push was a large column of cavalry the white pelicans of jokona glowed on their seagreen tabards their armor glinted their spearpoints winked in the light in a long line stitched like jewels across a courtiers cloak in the descending folds of the land chapter twenty a low moan broke from gorams lips as he crouched gray with fear over his teams reins get back get back arhys hissed to the manservant and cattilaras woman shoving them behind him to stumble and crouch in the bed of the wagon his hand clapped down on gorams shoulder drive on drive through them if we can he stood up and signaled to foix sitting his skittering horse and staring frantically forward and back go on foix gave him a salute drew his sword and wheeled his horse around the forward four men from the daughters order drew their weapons and fell in to either side of him preparing to clear the way for the wagon behind them it was not possible to see how much of the jokonan column had already debouched onto the curving road ahead though the number still to come strung back through the brush on the valleys steep side to their left seemed to go on and on goram whipped up his team the wagon groaned and began to rumble forward the jokonans nearest them looked over their shoulders to see what was bearing down on them from behind shouts the ring of weapons being drawn the squeals of horses jerked around and spurred forward arhys grabbed ista by the upper arm and hustled her back to relative cover in the wagons center the wagon bed bumped and rocked and ista dropped to her knees before she was pitched onto them illvins parade horse trotted beside the wagon breaking into its rocking canter as the dray horses picked up speed illvin leaned over and shouted arhys i need a weapon his empty hand extended in demand toward his brother who looked frantically around illvin glanced ahead quickly with a curse arhys snatched up the only pointed object in view a pitchfork that had been fastened along the wagon beds inner wall he swung it out to illvin who glared at his brother in extreme exasperation but grabbed it anyway sweeping it around prongs forward i was thinking of a sword sorry said arhys drawing his its taken i need a horse his head swiveled to liss cantering along the opposite side no arhys illvin shouted over the rumbling of the wagon the quickening hoofbeats and the yells rising ahead stay back have some sense he pointed to the unconscious cattilara arhyss head jerked back and he drew breath through his teeth not for air but for anguish as he realized just whose body must now bear his battle risks stay by the royina ah here comes my sword illvin clapped his borrowed boots to his white horses sides the beasts broad haunches bunched and it sprang forward with a startling bound illvins linen bed robe flapped open on his bare torso and fluttered in his wake his tiedback hair streamed out behind him ista clutched the side boards and stared out openmouthed wrong horse wrong weapon wrong armorhalf naked qualified as wrong armor did it notyelling like a madman illvin wrapped his right arm around the pitchfork and pointed it like a lance at the jokonan soldier bearing down upon him sword upraised at the last moment at some hidden pressure from illvins knee the heavy white horse swerved caroming into the jokonans mount the pitchfork tines slid up on either side of the enemys descending sword wrist a twist a yank a snatch and illvin was riding onward with the hilt clutched in his other hand while the jokonan tumbled from his saddle and was half trampled by the horses of foixs two rear guards galloping after them illvin gave a whoop of triumph and brandished the sword but with a thoughtful glance at the humble tool gripped under his other arm also hung on to the pitchfork although their noisy charge succeeded in driving the jokonans immediately ahead of them off the road and scattering them to the sides the enemy cavalrymen formed up rapidly again behind and began to give chase there seemed nothing aboard to throw at them but four trunks and some hard bread crusts though arhyss page groped frantically through the gear for some better missiles cattilaras woman clutched her mistresss flaccid body and wailed galloping along on the wagons right liss had drawn her new dagger but it seemed an inequitable match for the mounted mens swords arhys lunged over and dragged ista back to the center then waited tensely swaying on one knee sword unsheathed ready to dart to whatever side an enemy first tried to climb through the white horse shimmered by heading to the rear with a sun glitter a sword spun into the wagon and clanged on the floorboards arhys kicked it over to the barefoot manservant who snatched it up gratefully and took up a guard position on the wagons end a few minutes later the white horse overtook them at a gallop on the other side and illvin leaned in to toss yet another sword aboard his grin flashed past like a streak of light as he brandished the pitchfork and hurtled onward once more from the drivers box goram cried out arhys plunged forward ista could see only the back of arhyss legs as he braced himself and swung at some unseen assailant riding alongside he moved with power speed and utmost sureness but the white line of soulfire pouring out of cattilara and into him seemed to have doubled in speed and density too fast thought ista frantically she cannot sustain this rate for long it will empty her the wagon rumbled around a tight curve ista slid across the rough boards on hands and knees collecting splinters in her palms tumbling into cattilara on her pallet the waiting girls tearstreaked face was mottled red and white with heat and terror beyond liss one of the men of the daughters order fell back along the roadside bleeding and toppling from his saddle his horse limping and slowing ista tried to spin around and mark his fate but she was bounced again as a wheel smacked through a pothole and by the time she found her balance and looked up again he was lost to her view a galloping jokonan was poking his sword rather clumsily through the space between the wagons side and the halfrolledup canvas top and being parried equally clumsily by arhyss page fighting from his knees with illvins captured sword louder cries and curses came from ahead in two languages a flash of redviolet demon light seared across istas inner vision as she crouched staring downward a scream of tortured metal sounded from beneath the wagon the wagon wobbled then jerked down on the left rear side the three women slithered across the wagon bed in a heap even ista yelped she heard the snap of the rear axle then the back end dropped altogether and began dragging with a cry the manservant fell out arhys slid back in from the drivers box barely avoiding spearing the weeping waiting woman on the point of his blade arhys stared around wildly liss he called here the palomino had held to its position on the wagons right side and was now slowing with them more cries rose from up ahead along with crashing noises and a scream of a horse the lurching wagon slewed off the crown of the road and grated to a tilted stop arhys dropped his sword and snatched up his wifes limp body heaving her out and across into startled lisss arms take her take her ride if you can on to porifors yes yes ista endorsed this foixs horse flashed into istas view sliding to a rearing halt ista pointed downward foix did your demon do that no royina he leaned over his pommel to stare in at her his eyes were very wide the bear shadow was not curled tight within him but on its seemingfeet its head swinging dizzily from side to side royina lisss hoarse voice called uncertainly as she struggled to get a better grip on her limp load yes take cattilara and ride or all are lost together foix go with her get them through royina i cant go istas scream nearly burst her lungs both horses wheeled away foixs sword swinging past shed a spatter of dark wet drops cries scraping metal the twang of a crossbow and the thunk of a heavy blade biting fleshwhoseechoed back to istas ears but the dual echo of their horses hooves dwindled in the distance without slowing or diverting ista climbed forward to grab the rear edge of the drivers seat and peek over dropped across the road in front of them was a large palanquin with green cloth hangings and gold trim one of the foremost dray horses plunged and kicked its front legs tangled with the palanquins rear boards and braces the splintered wood had ripped its skin the other lead horse was down in its traces bleeding and making dreadful noises a dozen bearers in heavily embroidered green uniforms were scattered about shouting and screaming the ones who could still walk trying to help their injured comrades three of them tried to control the rearing horse and drag a moaning fourth man out from under the wreckage they had descended perhaps half the height of the slope to the river bottom where the road made its last turn for porifors if not for this ghastly obstruction ista realized they might well have burst through the front of the column though whether they could have outdistanced the enemy thereafter was an open question goram sat frozen his hands in the air ista followed his frightened gaze to a jokonan soldier standing in the road with a cocked crossbow trained upon the groom another and another ran up until the wagon was surrounded by a dozen tense men their fingers tight and sometimes trembling on the release catches a jokonan soldier sidled up cautiously and pulled goram down off his box goram stumbled onto the road and stood with his arms wrapped tightly around his torso sniveling uncontrollably the soldier returned to grab at ista and manhandle her down she went unresisting the better to keep to her feet arhys emerged upon the box and stood a moment sword out but held still his jaw tightened as his gaze swept over the bowmen one corner of his mouth turned up in a weird smile as it apparently crossed his mind just how little those gleaming quarrels might affect him should he choose to leap in an attack to the consternationtruncated consternationof his enemies but the smile grew sour and his teeth set as he followed out the rest of the inevitable consequences very slowly he lowered the tip of his blade a crossbowman motioned him to throw down his weapon arhyss eyes coolly considered the quarrels aimed at ista and he did so the blade clanged on the gravel a jokonan snatched it up and arhys stepped deliberately down off the box for just a moment longer the jokonan soldiery forboreor fearedto seize him two more greenuniformed bearers assisted a small shakenlooking woman clad in dark green silks out from under the drunkenly angled canopy of the palanquin istas breath drew in her inner vision revealed a soul the like of which ista had never seen before it roiled and boiled with violent colors in the confines of the womans body but darkened toward the center till ista seemed to be looking down a black well at midnight black yet not empty faint colored lines radiated out from the bottomless pit in all directions a tangled web that writhed and pulsed and knotted ista had to forcibly blink away the overpowering second sight in order to take in the surface of the woman on the outside the woman was a bizarre mix of delicately decorated and aged and drab she was only a little taller than ista herself dull graybrown curling hair was braided up in an interlaced roknari court style bound with strings of glittering jewels in the shapes of tiny flowers her face was sallow and lined without paint or powder her dress was manylayered embroidered with thread of gold and brilliant silks picturing interlocking birds the body it covered was slight with slack breasts and sagging belly her mouth was pursed and angry her pale blue eyes when they turned at last on ista burned seared a young officer on a nervously capering horse rode near he pulled it to a halt and swung down beside the woman abandoning his reins which were snatched up at once by a soldier hurrying to assist him the officer stared at ista as if transfixed his high rank was signaled more by the gold and jewels decorating his horses gear than by elaborations on his own clothing but he bore a goldtrimmed green sash across his chest decorated with a string of flying white pelicans high cheekbones graced a handsome sensitive face and the hair braided tightly to his scalp was bright crinkled gold in the blazing noon his soul was lost in an intense violet haze that extended to the margins of his body they have a sorcerer the origin of the flash of chaotic power that had popped the wagons axle pins and burst the rear wheels off seemed revealed to istas inner eye for the color in his body still pulsed and shivered as if in some aching reaction or echo yet even as she stared across at him the demon light seemed to shrink in on itself retreating the page and the waiting woman clinging to each other were prodded out of the back of the wagon at swords point and made to stand near arhys the marchs eyes flicked to them half closed as if in some attempt at reassurance and returned to the old woman and the officer illvin and the daughters men had all disappeared from sight scattered captured slain ista grew conscious of her plain riding costume stripped of decoration or marks of rank of her flushed face and sweat and dirt toofamiliar calculations raced through her mind might she pass for a waiting lady or a servant conceal from her captors the value of their prize effect some escape from their inattention or would they just throw her to their troops for a cheap tidbit to be tormented and discarded like that unfortunate maidservant of the rich woman from rauma the sorcererofficers eye took in goram and widened briefly then narrowed in thought or even recognition thought but not confusion he sees gorams ravaged soul yet it does not surprise him his eyes traveled on to arhys and his lips parted in true astonishment mother she shines with a terrible light and her guardian is a dead man he said in roknari to the woman at his side his stare at ista intensified grew fearful as if he wondered if she were performing arhyss appalling marvel of revivification as if he imagined she concealed some further bodyguard of walking corpses about to erupt from the dirt of the road beneath their feet this must be the dowager princess joen herself ista realized with a shock and prince sordso the erect slender young man looked anything but a sot right now and yetwas it sordso in that alert body the demon light seemed utterly ascendant he took a step backward the woman grabbed his arm her fingers pinching fiercely she bears a god we are undone he cried in rising terror she does no such thing the woman hissed in his ear those are nothing but smears she has barely enough capacity to channel a little sight her soul is choked with scars and disruption she is afraid of you that much was surely true istas mouth was dry her head pounding she seemed to float on a rocking sea of panic the womans blue eyes narrowed flared with triumph sordso look at her this is ista herself just as she was described half the prize we came for delivered into our hands this is a gift from the gods themselves she hurts to look upon no she is nothing you can take her ill show you take her now the clawed grip shook the young mans arm undo her one of the coiling strings of light writhing from her dark belly seemed to brighten blaze its distal end ista saw terminated in sordsos body like some obscene umbilicus the young man moistened his lips the violet light returned to the margins of his body and intensified he raised a hand using the dense habits of matter to direct a force that had nothing to do with matter at all a purple glare boiled off his palm and wound around ista like a coiling snake her knees went first buckling beneath her dropping her into the dust her cracked scabs split open altogether and she could feel the blood trickle and soak slick beneath the battered sweatstained loosening bandages her spine seemed to unhook itself bone from bone and she bent forward helplessly hideous knots of spasming pain began beneath each shoulder blade almost her bowels seemed loosened as well if that was not just by her own horror she had a glimpse of arhyss bearded lips parting of his eyes darkening with dismay as she sank down before all assembled here for no cause that fleshly eyes could see her hands went out to catch herself then her arms grew limp as well her head grew heavier still and she was barely able to turn it aside so that her soft cheek and not her slackening mouth smeared into the sharpedged gravel and the dirt you see so will all chalion and ibra bow before us joens voice dripped with satisfaction ista could see her green silk slippers peeping from beneath her skirts and sordsos polished boots the boots shifted uneasily in some dizzied distance ista could hear gorams low choked liquid sobbing blessedly the injured horses screams had stopped perhaps some merciful man had cut its throat perhaps some merciful man will cut mine i admit princess joens voice went on above istas head i do not understand the dead man the slippered footsteps shuffled through the gravel approaching arhys ista found herself unable to even moan she could barely blink a drop spun from one eyelash to plop into the dust before her nose from the slope above echoed sudden shouts istas head was turned the wrong way looking out over the brim of the road into the valley beyond around and behind her mens booted feet suddenly scuffled she heard a crossbow twang and caught her breath in fear for arhys hoofbeats many hoofbeats pounding scrambling sliding down from the ridge above a lunatic whoop in a suddenly dearly familiar voice sordso gasped his boots crunched across the gravel grunting he swung those green slippers up out of sight the boots staggered past istas face nearby hooves scraped ista managed to turn her head a little more the princes horse with joen in her elaborate dress clinging awkwardly to its saddle was being towed forward at a sudden trot by a running bearer who shot a look of fear over his shoulder upslope a thump sounded the invisible weight like a huge hand pressing ista to the earth lessened the rasp of sordsos sword being drawn from its scabbard sliced across her hearing and she flinched and at last jerked her head around the other way some crossbowman had been careless enough to take his eyes off arhys for a moment and the march was now locked in struggle with him several nearby bowmen had fired upward and were frantically recocking arhys yanked a dagger from the sheath of the man he wrestled and flung him aside just in time to parry sordsos thrust the thrust of steel that is a violet light collected in sordsos palm he shoved it forward the searing purple line passed through arhyss body without effect to bury itself in the soil beyond sordso yipped with surprise and scrambled frantically backward as a riposte from the dagger nearly swept his sword from his grip the scramble became a run what seemed a very avalanche of horses overwhelmed them the jokonan bowmen were knocked aside ridden down swords clanged and spears thrust fiercely wielded by yelling men in grayandgold tabards in front of istas face a set of hooves that seemed the size of dinner plates suddenly materialized and danced three long equine legs were silkwhite the fourth soaked scarlet with blood got you that horse you were wanting illvins voice wouldbe laconic but for its gasping sounded from above beyond the dinner plates another set of hooves crunched and slid and more sharply five gods is she hurt ensorcelled i think arhys gasped back he knelt beside ista gathered her up in cool unliving welcome hands heaved to his feet and boosted her upward still farther into his brothers arms she landed with a limp grunt stomach down across illvins lap illvin cursed and grabbed a thigh through her skirt to hold her there he bellowed over his shoulder to someone not arhys get goram theyre reforming shouted arhys go the loud slap of his hand across the white horses rump was scarcely needed to speed them on their way the animal was already pirouetting they plunged down slope away from the road the source of the terrifying gore was revealed before istas bouncing nose as an ugly cut across feathers right shoulder bleeding freely the ground swept past dizzily the horse hesitated its body bunching illvin leaned far back in his saddle his clutch on her leg tightening to a vise abruptly they were sliding straight down the steep hillside in a spray of dirt and stones the horses front legs braced it seemed nearly to squat on its broad haunches behind illvin whooped again whipping bushes slapped and scratched istas face the least loss of balance and they would all three be tumbling heads over tails together bones shattering and guts smashed the endless slide terminated not in disaster but in a wild splash across poriforss little river other horses were galloping up around them now illvin released his death grip on her thigh and gave her buttocks a distracted reassuring pat ista found her control of her body returning and she spat out a mixture of bloody river water and dirt what had happened to the sorcerer prince his attention had been diverted altogether from her evidently for the moment along with control unfortunately came sensation i think im about to vomit she mumbled into the horses redlathered shoulder for a blissful instant they came to a halt illvin bent and wrapped his long arms around her and heaved her upright and over to sit across his lap weakly she wrapped her arms around that bony sweatslick torso itself laboring for breath his bed robe had been lost somewhere along the route along with the pitchfork his mouth was bloodied his streaked dark hair was a wild tangle across his face his live body was hot with exertion but he bore no serious wounds her testing hands reassured her his own shaking hand rose to her face gently wiping at whatever ungodly mixture of horse blood sweat and dirt smeared it dear is royina are you hurt no thats all from your poor horse she assured him guessing it was the blood that alarmed him i am a little shaken a little ah his brows arched and his lips grew less thin curling up once more i think i am going to have bruises on my stomach from that ride oh his hand across her belly gave it an awkward little rub indeed i am sorry dont apologize what happened to your mouth she reached up with one finger to touch the lacerated edge spear butt ouch better than a spear point trust me they started forward once more he glanced over his shoulder they were on a minor road hardly more than a track that ran along the opposite side of the river from the main one other graytabarded soldiers now rode all around them this is a bad time to linger outofdoors that jokonan column we overtook is one of three closing in on the castle just at the moment the scouts say no siege engines sighted in their baggage trains yet though can you hang on to me if we canter certainly ista sat up straighter and brushed hair out of her mouth she wasnt quite sure whose she felt his legs tighten beneath her and the white horse broke without transition into its long rocking gait where did you find the troop she gasped clinging harder to his slippery skin against the jouncing you sent them to me thank you very much are you a seeress as well i met them coming down the road even as i was galloping back to porifors to raise them ah dy cabon had carried out his orders then a little early but ista was not inclined to chide him for it only prudence rewarded for a change did you see liss and cattilara and foix we tried to send them on yes they passed through us as we were making for the ridge to flank the jokonan column they should be safe within the walls by now he twisted to glance back over his shoulder but he did not kick his horse to greater speed by which ista concluded that they had for the moment shaken off their pursuit the great horses stride was shortening its bellowsbreath growing more strained illvin eased back in the saddle and allowed it to drop to a slow lope what happened up there on the road he asked what struck you to the ground sorcery truly truly sordso the sot is now sordso the sorcerer it seems how he came by his demon i know not but i agree with youhis dead sisters old demon must know if we must face sordso in battle does demon magic have a range do you know never mind ill ask dy cabon i wonder if foix knows by experiment i wouldnt put it past him three sorcerers foix reported at least said illvin or so he thought he perceived among the jokonan officers what istas eyes widened she thought of the tangle of strange lines emanating like a nest of snakes from dowager princess joens belly one had held its jaws clamped into sordso no question then there may be more than three a dozen twenty you saw more sorcerers i saw something something very uncanny he twisted again to look over his shoulder what do you see now ista asked not arhys yet blast the man he always has to be the last one out alithe last one out ive told him such bravado has no place in a responsible commander it works on the boys though i admit it does bastards hell it works on me and i know better ah he turned again a grim smile of temporary relief tweaking up one corner of his bleeding mouth he let his mount slow to a walk and frowned the horse was distinctly limping now but castle porifors loomed up almost overhead a few last stragglers were streaming into the town gates from the country round about the refugees shouting sounded strained but not panicked arhys trotted up beside them on a jokonan horse presumably obtained by illvin from the same convenient store as his sword collection his whitefaced page sat up behind bravely not crying istas inner eye checked the line of pale soulfire pouring into the marchs heart clearly catti still lived wherever she was the flow was reduced from its earlier terrifying rush but still very heavy goram ista was glad to see clung on behind another soldier and cattilaras distraught young woman behind a third of the barefoot manservant she saw no sign arhys saluted his brother with a casual wave as casually returned his eyes upon ista were grave and worried time to go in said illvin suggestively youll get no argument from me returned arhys good their tired horses clambered up the switchback road to the castle gate and into the forecourt liss bounded to receive ista as illvin lowered her to the ground foix followed to offer her his arm she leaned on it thankfully as the alternative was to fall down in a heap royina let us take you to your chamber he began where did you take lady cattilara laid down in her bedchamber with her women to take care of her good foix find dy cabon and attend upon me there now i must look to our defenses said arhys ill join you as soon as i can if i can illvin illvin looked up from instructing a groom in the care of his injured horse arhyss gaze flicked briefly toward the inner court where his and his wifes chambers lay do what you must oh aye illvin grimaced and turned to follow ista the wild excitement that had sustained him through the clash on the road was passing off he limped like his horse stiff and weary as they passed under the archway to the fountain court chapter twentyone cattilaras chamber had much the same air of feminine refuge as when ista had entered it on her first day at porifors now however the marchesss women were upset rather than welcoming either anxious and outraged or frightened and guilty depending on whether they had been privy to the escape plan they stared at the royinas present bloody breathless tightlipped disarray with horror ista ruthlessly dismissed them all though with orders for wash water drinks and food for lord illvinand for the rest of her party who had all tumbled out onto the road a lifetime ago this morning with no more breakfast than a swallow of tea and bread or less illvin went to cattilaras basin and wrung out a wet towel he glanced at ista and politely handed it to her first the red grime she rubbed off her face was startling nor was all of the blood from the horse she realized as she dabbed gingerly at her scratches illvin rinsed and wrung out the cloth again and rubbed down his own bloody face and dirtstreaked torso and accepted a cup of drinking water from liss draining it in a gulp he then trod over to istas side to stare at cattilara laid down on her bed still in her traveling dress the right sleeve had been removed and a compress bound about the ambiguous wound in her shoulder she was lovely as a sleeping child unmarred but for a smudge on her cheek on her it looked an elegant decoration but illvins finger uneasily traced the new sunken quality around her eyes surely her body is too slight to support arhyss as well as her own and he ought to know ista glanced at illvins hollow cheeks and ridged ribs for weeks or months no for hours or days i think it is her turn and i know who porifors can least spare right now illvin grimaced and glanced over his shoulder at the opening door foix escorted an anxious dy cabon within five gods be thanked you are saved royina the divine said in heartfelt tones the lady cattilara as well i thank you too learned said ista for abiding by my instructions he regarded the marchesss silent form with alarm she was not injured was she no she is not hurt ista added reluctantly yet but i have induced her to lend her own souls strength to arhys for a time in place of lord illvin now we must somehow compel her demon to speak i dont know if it was master or servant to princess umerue but i am certain it was witness tomore a product ofdowager princess joens demonic machinations illvin was right yesterday it has to know what she was doing because it was part of what she was doing although it seems to have escaped her leash upon reflection an encouraging realization joens control is evidently not inviolable dy cabon gazed at her in blank alarm and ista realized belatedly that this must seem gibberish to him illvins high brow wrinkled in nearly equal puzzlement he said cautiously you said joen seemed more uncanny than sordso how so haltingly ista tried to describe her inner vision of the dowager princess glimpsed so briefly and terrifyingly beside her wrecked palanquin and of the demonridden prince sordso of how sordsos demon fire had seemed to unknit her very bones demons have always cringed before me up till now though i do not know why i did not know i was so vulnerable to them she glanced uneasily at foix this array you describe is very strange mused dy cabon rubbing his chins one demon battening on one soul is the rule there is no room for more and demons do not usually tolerate each other even in the same general vicinity let alone in the same body i do not know what force could harness them all together like that apart from the god himself ista bit her lip in thought what joen contained did not look like what sordso contained sordso seemed possessed of a common demon like cattilaras or foixs except ascendant instead of subordinatelike cattis when she let it up for questioning before and we could barely force it back down again it was the demon not her son who was answering to joen dy cabons face bunched in distaste as he took this in ista glanced at foix standing behind him and looking even less pleased he was as sweatsoaked and grimed from the mornings work as any of them but he at least seemed to have escaped any bloody wound foix he jerked royina can you help me i wish to push cattilaras soulfire down into her body and the demon light up into her head that it may speak and answer and yet not seize her without allowing it to break the net by which it sustains arhys this not being a convenient moment to drop poriforss commander down dead more dead are you just waiting till lord arhys is ready then royina to release his soul asked foix curiously ista shook her head i dont know if that is my task or even if i could if i tried i fear to leave him a ghost irrevocably cut off from the gods yet he hangs by a thread now waiting till we are ready more like muttered illvin foix frowned down at cattilara royina i stand prepared at your command to do anything i can but i dont understand what you want of me i see no fires no lights do you i did not at first my sensitivity was but a confused wash of feelings chills intuitions and dreams ista stretched her fingers closed her fist then the god opened my eyes to his realm whatever the reality may be my inner eye now sees it as patterns of light and shadow color and line some lights hang like a net some flow like a powerful stream foix shook his head in bewilderment then how did you work the flies and the stumbling horse asked ista patiently do you not perceive anything perhaps by some other metaphor do you hear instead or touch ihe shruggedi just wished them nowilled them i pictured the events clearly in my mind and commanded the demon and they just happened it felt odd though ista bit her finger studying him then on impulse stepped in front of him bend your head she commanded looking surprised he did so she grasped his tunic and pulled him down yet farther lord bastard let your gift be shared or not curse your eyes she pressed her lips to foixs sweaty brow ah yes the bear whined in pain briefly a deep violet light seemed to flare in foixs widening eyes she released him and stepped back he staggered upright a barely perceptible white fire faded on his brow oh he touched the spot and stared around the room at all his company openmouthed this is what you see all the time yes how is it that you do not fall down when you try to walk one grows used to it the inner eye learns just as the outer ones do to sort out the unusual and ignore the rest there is seeing without observing and then there is attending i need you to attend with me to cattilara now dy cabons mouth pursed in awe and alarm his hands rubbed one another uncertainly royina this is potentially very bad for him so are the several hundred jokonan soldiers moving in around castle porifors learned i leave it to your reason to decide which danger is more pressing just now foix can you see she turned back to find him staring down at his own belly in a sort of horrified fascination foix attend he gulped and looked up urn yes royina he squinted at her can you see yourself no just as well maybe you have these odd little sputtering flashes flaring off your bodyall sharp edges i can see why the demons cringe she took him by the hand and led him firmly to cattilaras bedside look now can you see the light of the demon all knotted in her torso and the white fire that streams from her heart to her husbands foixs hand hesitantly traced the white line proof enough of his perceptions now look beneath that stream to its channel that the demon maintains he glanced along the line of white fire then to the trickle still leading from lord illvin and back to cattilara royina isnt it coming out rather fast yes so we havent a lot of time come see what you can do as before she made passes with her hands over cattilaras body then for curiositys sake dropped her hands to her sides and just willed it was easier to make the white fire obey using the habits of dense matter but her material hands were actually not necessary to the task she found cattilaras soulfire collected at her heart pouring outward as before ista made no attempt to interfere with the rate that arhys was drawing on it at least while it continued she knew he was still functional wherever he was now foix try to drive her demon to her head looking very uncertain foix moved around the bed and grasped cattilaras bare feet the light within him flared ista seemed to hear the bear growl menacingly within cattilara the violet demon light fled upward istas inner eye checked for the continued maintenance of arhyss lifenet and she tried setting a ligature around cattilaras neck it worked for the soulfire as before but for the demon evidently it did because cattilaras eyes suddenly opened glittering with a sharpness alien to the marchess the very shape of her face seemed to change as the underlying muscles altered their tension fools she gasped out we told you to flee and now it is too late she is come upon you we shall all be taken back weeping in vain her voice was breathy and disrupted for the pumping of the bodys lungs was not coordinated with the mouths speech she said ista princess joen the demon tried to nod found it could not and lowered cattilaras eyelashes in assent instead illvin quietly brought a chair to the beds other side and settled himself in it leaning forward on one elbow eyes intent liss withdrew uneasily to seat herself on a chest by the far wall i saw joen standing in the road said ista from a black pit in her belly seemed to swarm a dozen or more snakes of light at the end of every snake is there a sorcerer yes whispered the demon that is how she harnessed us all to her will all to her will alone how it hurt one such band of light ended in prince sordso are you saying this woman placed a demon in her own son unexpectedly the demon vented a bitter laugh the shape it gave cattilaras face seemed to shift again at last it cried in roknari he would be the last to go she always favored her sons we daughters were useless disappointments the golden general could not live again in us to be sure at best we were bargaining counters at worst drudgesor fodder that is umerues voice whispered illvin in grim dismay not as she came to us in porifors but as i glimpsed her once before back in hamavik from where is joen collecting these elementals asked ista the demons voice shifted again back to the ibran tongue stolen from hell of course how dy cabon asked he hung over foixs shoulder at the foot of the bed eyes wide the demon managed to indicate a shrug with a lift of cattis eyebrows the old demon did the trick for her we were filched from hell all mindless and confused chained to her leashes fed and trained up fed how asked illvin his voice growing apprehensive on souls it is part of how she manages so many she farms them out to feed on other souls than her own at first animals servants slaves prisoners then as joen learned the subtleties of it on others purposetaken for their knowledge or gifts she would place us in their bodies till we had eaten up the things she wanted us to know then yank us out again until we grew fit to become riders upon her best sorcererslaves fit even to mate with a princess if she were a sufficiently scorned princess goram said illvin urgently was my groom goram such a one made demon fodder him oh yes he was a chalionese captain of horse we think never any food of ours though she gave us a finch first and then the little servant girl then that chalionese scholar the tutor she let us eat him all up as he was only to be executed for following the ways of the bastard anyway and then the jokonan courtesan she got along better with the tutor than we would have expected being similarly fascinated by men joen despised her for the very expertise she sought to steal so let her go alive and witless to find her fate in the streets dy cabon and illvin looked equally sick foix had hardly any expression at all dy cabon said you mean princess joen somehow pulls demons from their mounts while the mounts still live separates them from the victim souls as the saint of rauma did the demons lips curved up in an unpleasant smile exactly the reverse for joen the purpose was binding not separation when wed fed enough she pulled us out tearing the souls apart taking what she desired for us leaving the rest as waste a process equally painful to both parties we can assure you though it helped keep us offbalance and servile we suppose ista was uncertain why the demon had suddenly grown so forthcoming but she determined to press on while its mood lasted the old demon she repeated what is this ah joens legacy said the demon it spoke now ista thought in the scholars voice precise and dry its ibran of a pure native accent from somewhere in central chalion not at all like cattilaras softer northern speech nor did the young marchess speak in quite such rounded periods shall we tell you all the tale of it the enemies of our enemy are no friends to us and yet why not we know what awaits us why shouldnt you fools this last was delivered in an oddly dispassionate tone it waited for the body to supply it with breath again and continued in the days of the golden generals glory men swarmed in from the archipelago seeking advancement in his court and spoils on his battlefields among them was an old old sorcerer who had long plied his demon magic in the islands among the quadrenes passing among them subtly and uncaught his demon was older still dozens of lives old the chaos and disorder of the promised war attracted them like perfume it was a vast mistake for the lion of roknar was beloved of the father himself and possessed many godgifts among them the inner sight the old sorcerer was perceived accused convicted and burned in its immense accumulated craft the ancient demon jumped from its dying mount and evaded the quadrene divines precautions yet it could not jump so far as to reach safety so it chose for its new mount a person whom the golden general would not burnhis threeyearold daughter joen princess joen has been a sorceress all these years cried dy cabon in astonishment not quite the demon smiled briefly bitterly with cattilaras lips the golden general was wild with rage and grief he turned to his god in prayer and yet another gift was granted to him the father gave it to him to encapsulate the demon to put it to sleep within the little girl it was the lions intention then when chalion was conquered to secretly seize and bring back a saint of the bastard if any such could be found to excise the demon safely from his daughter according to the forbidden quintarian rites and then he rode off to his war but by roya fonsas great work of sacrifice the lion of roknar died before he could accomplish his aims or return the disunited princedoms settled into another generation of border war with the quintarian royacies and the sealed demon waited for its mounts death that it might be released again into the world of men for fifty years it waited then some three years past something happened the capsule broke open releasing the demon into joen but not into the malleable child the demon had chosen into the harsh determined embittered and embattled woman how asked dy cabon yes said illvin why hold fifty years then fail unless it was set so i know how said ista her mind burning with cold satisfaction i believe i could name the very day and hour i will tell you in a moment but hush let it go on then what the demons eyes narrowed at her in something like respect joen was in a desperate quandary then she was coregent for prince sordso with her two closest enemies the general of jokona and her late husbands brother sordso was a surly young sot who hated them all the general and his uncle were conspiring to seize sordso and put his uncle on the throne of jokona in his place ah said illvin in a disconsolate tone that was when id wanted to strike at jokona what excellent timing it might have been just as their palace coup began oh well joen was frantic said the demon she believedor convinced herselfthat the old demon was a legacy from her great father given to her in secret to rise up in just such an unhappy hour and save his grandson from traitors so she kept it in secret and began learning from it the old demon was pleased to have such an apt pupil and taught her everything thinking it would soon turn the tables and mount her it underestimated the iron strength of her will tempered through four decades of swallowed rage it became even more her slave yes whispered ista i follow that joens coregents were her first enemies to earn her attention easy because so intimate we suppose the uncle well he died quietly the general underwent a subtler fate and soon became joens fondest supporter in all things joen is a quadrene if fallen into blasphemy by their lights said dy cabon his face knotting with consternation but a bad quadrene is not the same thing as a good quintarian she cant possess the correct theological background to handle any elemental safely let alone a troop of them indeed breathed ista not the demoncatti continued her leashed demons soon became more to her than salvation for sordso they became her joy at last at last she could exert her will and force a compliance that smiled as it hurried to obey her family was not last but first to fall to her binding except for sordso the demons voice and language changed again she took me when i refused to be wed to a quintarian bastard lord and her eyes shone with triumph as she did so all all to do exactly as she said always down to the smallest detail except for sordso her golden cub oh it cheers my heart even in this living death to know that she finally took my brother sordso cattisumerueslips drew back in a fierce grin i warned him not to defy her did he listen of course not hah cattilara said you were sent to suborn porifors said ista to the demon hence i suppose the inclusion of the courtesan illvins expression across the bed from her was a study in surmise a complicated amalgam of memory regret and horror ista wondered if these halfdigested souls would all run together into one mind in timeor would they always be a little separate was it illvin or arhys whom your mother instructed you to bind to yourself ista asked or both the umeruelips smile softened lord illvin he seemed pretty enough at first but then we saw arhys why settle for secondbest for secondincommand and all that complicated plot of usurpation and revolt to follow when we might so simply and pleasantly take porifors from the top down it added in ibran lord arhys yes and arhys yes mm and sighing in no identifiable tongue ah it seems it was unanimous murmured illvin dryly the servant girl the princess the courtesan and i doubt not the scholar too all up in smoke at the first sight of him i wonder if that bird was female as well if so it would probably have flown to his finger and so joens plot was put in disarray by an altogether older sorcery than demon magic his brow wrinkled half in amusement half in pain fortunately for me all pain now for a moment his deep underlying exhaustion floated very near his surface as if the pull of the whole world bowed his back then his dark eyes glittered and he straightened so how was this master demon released from its long prison you said you knew royina i guess at least it was the timingdo you not see it three years ago on the daughters day the golden generals death curse was pulled from chalion and from my house all his spilled perverted godgifts swept up and taken back by the gods through their chosen saint and if all was retrieved that dayit must have included the power of the encapsulation illvin met dy cabons eyes the divine gave a reflective nod ista mused i wonder if arvol and ias and i had succeeded in breaking the curse twenty years ago would joen have been granted her demon two decades sooner and which of them would have been ascendant then dy cabon stared down at cattilara with an expression of arrested theological curiosity i wonder if the actions of this same roknari master sorcerer would account for the outbreak of elementals that chalion suffered in fonsas day he shook off the distractions of historical theory as it perhaps occurred to him that the outbreak they faced now was suddenly all too present and practical why is the creature telling us all this ista wondered to create fear and disorder among her little company to spread its own distress she glanced around at foixs stolidity dy cabons thoughtfulness illvins shrewd concentration if that was the plan it wasnt working maybe it had simply stolen enough humanity by now to enjoy complaining to an attentive audience maybe with all hope of flight lost at some last gasp and despite its preferred solitary nature it sought allies the door opened startled ista snapped around lord arhys entered and gave her a respectful nod she was glad to see he was mailclad again he at least would not be overheated by his armor he was followed by maids with trays a welcome sight and goram considerably recovered with a pile of illvins clothing and war gear istas party seized on the contents of the trays without ceremony arhys strode to the bedside and stared down at his wife his face bleak the demon looked back but said nothing ista hoped that wasnt cattilaras longing leaking into in its eyes then she wondered if her own eyes had looked like that resting on him is she awake arhys flexed his hand in puzzlement how then do i cattilara sleeps ista told him we gave her demon access to her mouth that it might speak which it has whats arrived out there arhys demanded illvin he alternated downing bites of meat wrapped in bread and swallowing gulps of cold tea with being dressed by his groom about fifteen hundred jokonan soldiers my scouts estimate five hundred in each column my two scouts who made it back that is since the ring of besiegers is now closed around porifors i despair of the other dozen i have never lost so many scouts before siege engines illvin asked around a mouthful of bread thrusting a leg into a boot of his own held by the kneeling goram the lost manservants boots were tossed aside dead mans shoes no telling now none reported supply wagons yes but no more huh arhys glanced at ista she did not know what expression was on her face but he attempted reassurance porifors has withstood sieges before royina the town walls are secured as welli have two hundred men of my own down there and half the townsmen are former garrison soldiers there are tunnels between us to shift reinforcements what was it illvin fifteen years ago that the fox of ibra sent up an assault of three thousands we held them for half a month till dy caribastos and dy tolnoxothe present provincars fatherrelieved us i dont think its siege engines that jokona sends against us now said illvin i think its sorcerers he supplied his brother with a blunt synopsis of the demons testimony as he spoke goram pale but resolute expertly combed back his hair and bound it in a tight knot at his nape then shook out his mail coat ready to don if this madwoman joen truly drags a dozen or more sorcerers on leashes illvin concluded ducking into his mail you may be sure she means to let them slip against us if not for revenge for her lost daughter then for a blow against chalion to turn the whole line of attack that marshal dy palliar plans against borasnen an early strike and hard and if successful to be followed by a sweep into northcentral chalion before iselle and bergons forces are properly mustered thats the way id do it if i were the jokonans i mean if i were only mad and not stupid arhys grinned briefly i can scarcely guess what sordsos staff officers are like at present cooperative said ista blackly of one mind illvin grimaced and at gorams silent tap held out a forearm for the groom to buckle on his vambrace arhys ista continued urgently despite your strange state you have no inner sight correct nothing like what you describe no royina if anything my sight seems less than before not blurred or dimmed but drained of color except that now i see better at night almost the same as in the day so you did not see did not perceive the strike that prince sordso made upon you when you clashed on the road no what did you see that deep light that marks demon magic to my inner eye a searing bolt of something or anyway it was clear that sordso thought it was going to be a searing bolt of something but it passed through you harmlessly as though you werent even there they both looked to dy cabon who opened his plump hands in uncertainty in a sense he isnt there not as live souls are nor even as demons are the true sundered ghosts are divorced from all realities the world of matter and the world of spirit both is he then immune to sorcery began ista and yet it is sorcery that sustains him now learned i do not understand i will give it thought a tangled mess of violet lines of light abruptly appeared throughout the room flared and vanished foix jumped a moment later so did everyone else as vessels of tea or wine or wash water tipped or cracked or shattered illvins clay cup cleaved in his hand as he was lifting it to his lips and he danced backward to avoid the splash down his grayandgold tabard joens sorcerers are now in place it seems said ista flatly foix swung around in wideeyed dismay within him his bear shadow was on its feet snarling what was the purpose of that a warning if they can do that why not burst our bellies or our skulls and have it over with dy cabon raised a shaking hand free demons cannot slay directly the bastards own death demon does said ista i have seen it do so that is a very special case free demons those escaped into the realm of matter well they might try to slay directly butdeath opens a soul to the gods whether the soul chooses to advance through that door at that moment or not is a matter of will but in that instant it opens both ways and the demon is vulnerable to recapture and so they jump away when their mount is slain said foix yes but using magic to slay also creates a link between sorcerer and victim the effort and the backwash are supposed to be very hard on the sorcerer as well he paused thoughtfully of course if a sorcerer uses magic to stampede your horse over a cliff or any other indirect method of accomplishing your death the risk does not apply a panting soldier in a grayandgold tabard burst through the door lord arhys there is a jokonan herald at the gate demanding parley arhys drew in his breath between his teeth warning indeed notice well they have all my attention now illvin foix learned dy cabonroyinawill you attend upon me i want your sight and your counsel but stay back below the battlement out of view as much as you may yes ista paused to release her ligature from cattilaras neck and be certain the demon would remain quiescent foix watched silently taking up station at istas shoulder as if to guard her liss had not been named in arhyss roll but she rose anyway arms crossed and shoulders tucked as if trying to make herself small and unnoticed illvin striding for the door in arhyss wake suddenly stopped and swore the cisterns arhyss head swiveled the two looked at each other illvin clapped his brother on the shoulder ill check and meet you above the gate hurry illvin arhys motioned all within to follow him out illvin turned aside on the gallery and ran chapter twentytwo they crossed the court of the flowers and climbed the inner stairs after arhys above the gate a projecting parapet thrust out arhys shouldered past his archers spread out along the sentrywalk mounted to the top of the battlement and stood spreadlegged staring down ista peeked out between the toothed stones to the right where the road turned away toward oby she could see the jokonans settling into camp in a grove of walnut trees just out of bowshot or catapult range tents were being set up and horse lines arranged on the far side of the grove some especially large tents of green cloth were rising at the hands of servants some wearing the uniforms of the palanquin bearers to the left down in the valley along the river another column was pouring in threatening the town walls at its rear some soldiers were already driving a few plundered sheep and cattle into the arms of their camp followers dinner on the hoof beyond the countryside looked deceptively peacefulemptied out ista hoped only one or two barns or distant outbuildings seemed to be on fire presumably sites of some temporary desperate resistance the enemy had notor not yetfired the fields and crops did they anticipate being in secure possession of them by harvest time the third column presumably was taking up position behind the castle along the ridge the drawbridge was up the castle gates closed on the other side of the deep dry cleft that fronted the wall the jokonan parley officer stood bareheaded the blue pennant of his office hung limply from the javelin in his hand in the afternoon heat he was flanked by two tense guards seagreen tabards over their mail as the parley officer turned his face upward istas breath drew in he was the same translator she had met in the raiding column retreating from rauma so was his new duty a reward or a punishment he did not notice her half concealed in the embrasure but it was quite clear by the alarmed widening of his eyes that he recognized arhys as the swordwielding madman who had nearly taken his head off in that ravine arhyss stony expression gave no clue if the recognition was returned the jokonan moistened his lips cleared his throat i come under the flag of parley from prince sordso to castle porifors he began in loud clear ibran he gripped the shaft of his blue pennant as a man might clutch a shield and ground the butt a little harder into the dry soil by his boot it was considered very bad form to shoot a messenger likely to be coldly criticized by an officers peers and commanders later rather too belated a consolation from the messengers point of view to be sure these are the demands of the prince of jokona doesnt it worry you quadrene arhys overrode him in a carrying drawl that your prince has become a demonridden sorcerer as a pious man shouldnt you be burning him rather than obeying him the guards did not react and ista wondered if they had been chosen for their lack of ibran by the grimace that flashed over the parley officers face he might have felt that his enemy had a point but he returned sharply they say you are a man dead three months does it not worry your troops to be following a walking corpse not notably said arhys he ignored the slight murmur of his archers clustered behind him the looks they exchanged covered a range of expressions from disbelief to alarm to revelation plus one fellow who vented an impressed ooh i can see how it might pose a problem for you how after all can you kill me even a sorcerer must find it a troublesome paradox with a visible effort the parley officer wrenched himself back to his script these are the terms of the prince of jokona you will surrender the dowager royina ista at once as hostage for your cooperation all officers and soldiers of the garrison will lay down their arms and march out your gate in surrender do this and your lives will be spared to be corralled as demon fodder perchance muttered dy cabon crouched looking through an embrasure farther down the walkway a rather more merciful fate ista couldnt help reflecting than what a divine of the bastard caught in such a conflict might normally expect from overexcited quadrene troops come come jokonan would you trouble me to spit upon you asked arhys pray save your spit lord arhys i hear such liquids will be hard to come by in there soon lord illvin had climbed up behind the parapet in time to hear this exchange and smiled sourly he cast a quick look out over istas head taking in the enemys arrangements in a sweeping pass arhys glanced down at him illvin leaned his shoulders against the wall below his brothers feet and gazed back out over the forecourt in a voice pitched not to carry to the jokonans he reported they got both cisterns leaking like sieves i have men bailing with every intact vessel they can find and trying to line the tanks with canvas to slow the outflow but its not good right arhys murmured back he raised his voice again to the parley officer we refuse of course the parley officer looked up with grim satisfaction at what was obviously the expected answer prince sordso and dowager princess joen are merciful beyond your deserving they will give you one day to reconsider your stance i will come again tomorrow to hear your new answer unless you send to us firstof course with a bow he began to back away inadequately covered by his two guardsmen he retreated quite a distance before he dared to turn his back not just the expected answer the desired outcome apparently what happens next asked dy cabon in worry an assault will they really wait a day i wouldnt trust them to said arhys jumping down onto the walk again an assault yes said ista but not i think by their troops i would wager anything you please that joen wishes to play with her new toys porifors is her very first chance to test her array of sorcerers in open war if the results satisfy her a purple line though only one this time flashed across istas inner vision most of the stretched bowstrings along the sentry walk snapped at once twanging a couple of men yelped from the sting of the recoiling cords an exception was a cocked crossbow that let loose its quarrel shot into the thigh of the man standing next to its bearer the man screamed and fell backward off the walk to smack onto the stones of the court and lie still his horrified comrade gaped at his bow flung it from himself as though it burned his hand and hurried after his fallen mate another darker flash crackled past now what muttered foix uneasily staring up and down the line of appalled archers some already fishing in their belts for replacement strings found them shredding in their hands a few moments later across the rooftops of the castles inner courts a plume of smoke billowed into the air fire in the stable said illvin his laconic voice at odds with his sudden lunge forward foix i want you please he sped away down the stairs long legs taking them three at a time now it begins in earnest thought ista her stomach clenching lisss eyes were huge royina may i go with them she gasped yes go ista released her she bolted away every competent hand would be needed and then there is me she took herself down off the wall at least arhys running past her called lady will you look to cattilara of course a task of sorts or maybe arhys a prudent commander merely wanted to get all the useless deadwood stored in one safe place ista found cattilaras ladies in hysterics when she had finished with them their noise was at least muted to wellsuppressed hysterics cattilara lay unchanged except for an already visible shrinking of the soft flesh of her face tightening across her bones the demon light was knotted tensely within her making no attemptyetto fight for ascendance ista blew out her breath in unease but made sure that the soulfire continued to pour out toward arhys without impediment through the endless afternoon ista made frequent forays from the marchesss chambers to check the effect of the various ripples of sorcery light that scraped through her perceptions only that first great assault on the water supply seemed fully coordinated after that the attack broke into a disorder mirrored by its effects people fell and broke bones the horses saved from the burning stable block let loose in the star court knocked down a gallery in their squealing and plunging a wasp nest fell with it and three men died screaming choking and convulsing from the stings more men were knocked about and injured by the stingmaddened horses other smaller fires started in other courts the little remaining water dwindled rapidly most of the stored meat no matter how preserved was found to be starting to rot and stink bread and fruit grew green mold that seemed to spread even as one watched weevil larvae burgeoned in the flour supply leather straps and fiber ropes rotted and came apart in peoples hands pottery cracked boards broke mail and swords began to rust with the speed of a maidens blush any men with histories of tertiary fever began violent relapses cattilaras pleasant dining hall was soon filled with men on pallets moaning burning shivering and hallucinating dy cabon was pressed into service to help tend the sick and unbelievably soon the dying by evening the faces of the soldiers and servants that ista passed had gone beyond edgy and frightened to a pale deadened bewildered shock at sunset ista climbed the north tower the highest to take stock liss stinking with smoke and limping from being stepped on by frantic hooves mounted slowly after her a man in a grayandgold tabard clumped up behind to drop an armload of stones onto a growing pile by the battlement exchange uneasy grunts with two comrades whose unstrung warped bows were flung aside into a corner then turn and clump back down the winding stairs in the level light of the westering sun the unpeopled countryside appeared weirdly beautiful and serene in the grove of walnut trees the jokonans wellordered camp seemed to be enjoying a feast the only smokes were thin aromatic trails rising from cooking fires little clusters of horsemen rode about patrolling delivering messagesout for an evening jaunt for all ista could tell all abroad wore seagreen tabards the town behind its walls in the valley also sent up plumes of smoke but ugly and black with better access to water than the castle crowning the hill the townsmen had kept most of their blazes from spreading out of control so far but the few tiny figures ista could see moving fearfully through its streets and alleys were stiff with fatigue the men behind its walls crouched or sat barely moving or lay as if in exhausted naps or dead leaden boot steps scuffed on the stone stairs and ista looked around to see lord illvin emerge onto the tower platform carrying a small greasy cloth sack even the flushed light of sunset failed to make his face look anything but filthy and pale soot and sweat had melted together to be rubbed in odd streaks by whatever swipe of his hand had dashed the grime from his eyes he had abandoned chain mail and scorched tabard hours ago and his plain linen shirt dotted with small black spark holes was half stuck to his torso ah he said in a voice that sounded as though it came from the bottom of a mine shaft there you are she nodded greetings he came to her shoulder and together they stared down into the disaster of porifors behind its deceptively blank and solid outer walls the whole stable block was burnedout blackened timbers were strewn across it and messes of broken roof tiles spilled over them like blood temporarily no other smoke was rising but one corner of the kitchen block was also blackened and fallen in the star court was a messone gallery knocked down the fountain empty and choked with filth horses were tethered along one side their backs looked odd and lozengeshaped from this high angle of view what people who could be seen scuttled about bent and anxious have you seen learned dy cabon lately ista asked illvin he nodded still holding up in the sickrooms we have pallets strewn through three chambers now half a dozen fellows just came down with dysentery with no wash water left it wont even take demons to spread that all over the fortress bastards hell at this rate sordso will be able to take porifors by assault tomorrow with six ponies a rope ladder and a quadrene temple childrens choir his teeth gritted white against his blackened face oh he held out the sack would you like some baked horsemeat its not rotted yet ista eyed it dubiously i dont know is it feather no happily not right now thank you you should keep up your strength five gods know when well eat again he dug out a chunk and dutifully munched it liss he held out the bag to her no thank you she echoed ista thinly failing to take his own advice he passed the bag on to the former archers now stonethrowers who accepted it with murmured thanks and somewhat less revulsion a crack sounded as another timber in the stable block gave way and fell in a cloud of soot illvin returned to the inner side of the tower to stare down into the debacle again that was one day less bastards tears what will we be reduced to in one week ista leaned on the sunwarmed stone with arms that shook past prayer i have brought this down upon you all she said in a low voice i am sorry his brows flicked up he rested on one elbow beside her looking across at her im not so sure you can claim that honor lady the situation here was well along this road before you ever arrived in our midst if your presence had not baited the jokonans into attack now you may be sure they would have struck within another month or so against a fortress with both of its most experienced commanders dead and rotted or worse and none even to explain the horrors pouring down out of nowhere upon it ista rubbed her aching brow so were actually not sure if i make any difference except this way i hand myself as hostage and pawn to joen perhaps she stared down at the patterned paving stones far below her there are other ways to avoid becoming a hostage he followed her gaze and his eyes narrowed in a penetrating frown he reached out with two fingers and gently turned her chin toward him you made a difference to me he said any woman who can wake a man from a sleep of death with a kiss deserves a second glance i think ista snorted bitterly i didnt wake you with a kiss i only disrupted and redirected the flow of your soulfire as i did later with cattilara the kiss was just selfindulgence a little smile curved his lips i thought you said it was a dream uh oh so she had his lips curved up farther maddeningly she said a stupid impulse then come i thought it was a brilliant impulse you underestimate yourself lady ista flushed i am afraid i have no talent forshe swalloweddalliance when i was young i was too stupid now im old i am too drab too stupid then too mad then too drab then too late im just not the sort really he turned around leaned against the battlement and took up her hand with an air of great curiosity one sooty finger began to trace the dirtstreaked lines within her palm i wonder why not they say i am a man of wit i should be able to figure it out with a little study map the ground plan of castle ista mark the defenses find the weaknesses firmly she took her hand back all right a deal of study lord illvin this is not the time or place for this truly im so tired i could hardly stand up nor climb to my feet either there was a short silence his lips peeled back on a flash of teeth ha i saw your mouth twitch then it did not it did now helplessly as she was reminded of the bird in its nest oh bettershe smirks i do not poets speak of hope in ladies smiles but give me a smirk any day i say somehow his thumb was massaging her palm again tracing the subtle muscles of her hand it felt wonderful she wished he would rub her shoulders her feet her neck her everythingthathurt and everything hurt i thought you said arhys was the great seducer in the family she tried to muster the energy to take her hand back again and failed not at all hes never seduced a woman in his life they leapt on him from ambush all by themselves not without cause i grant you he smiled briefly there is this about being the sparring partner of the best swordsman in caribastos i always lost but if ever i meet the third best swordsman in caribastos hes going to be in very deep trouble arhys was always better at all things we turned our hands to but there is one thing that i am quite certain i can do that he cannot it was the fault of the hand massage it lulled her she said unthinkingly what fall in love with you sweet ista she jerked back she had heard that endearment before but not on those lips dont call me that bitter ista his brows climbed cranky ista cross illtempered cantankerous ista she snorted he relaxed and his lips quirked again well i can no doubt learn to adjust my vocabulary lord illvin be serious certainly he said at once as you command royina he bowed slightly i am old enough to have many regrets ive made my share of mistakes somehe grimacedhideous indeed as you well know but it was the little easy thingsthe kisses i did not give and the love i did not speak because there was no time no placeand then no chance surprisingly sharp sorrows those are for their size i think all our chances grow narrow tonight so i shall reduce my regrets however briefby one at least he leaned closer fascinated she did not retreat somehow that long arm had found its way around her aching shoulders he folded her in he was quite tall she reflected if she didnt bend her head back she was going to end up with her nose squashed to his breastbone she looked up his lips tasted of soot and salt sweat and the longest day of her life well and horsemeat but at least it was fresh horsemeat his dark eyes glittered between narrowed lids as her arms found their way around that ridged torso and pressed him inward what was it she had snarled to dy cabonmimicking above what is desired below some minutes latertoo many too fewhe lifted his head again and set her a little from him as though to look upon her without having to cross his eyes his slight smile was altogether drained of irony now though not of satisfaction she blinked and stepped back liss sitting crosslegged against the parapet on the opposite side of the platform was staring up with her mouth open the two soldiers werent even pretending to be watching jokonans their riveted expressions were of men contemplating a daunting feat they had no desire to emulate such as swallowing fire or being the first to charge up a scaling ladder time illvin murmured is where you take it it will not linger for you that is so whispered ista she had to give his dalliance this much credit the stones seemed suddenly a much less attractive solution to her plight that had been his intent she had no doubt a dark violet splash of light sparked past her inner vision and istas head turned to follow it from somewhere below an outraged cry rang out she sighed too wearied to pursue the mystery i dont even want to look illvins head too had turned at the cry by his lack of further craning he also shared her surfeit of horrors but then he looked back at her his eyes narrowing you looked around before we heard anything he noted yes i see the sorcerous attacks as flashes of light in my inner vision like little bolts of lightning flying from source to target or like streaking firearrows i cant tell what their effect will be just by seeing them though they all look much the same can you tell sorcerers from ordinary men just by looking i cant oh yes both cattilaras demon and foixs appear to me as shapes of shadow and light within the boundaries of their own souls which since they are both living persons are bounded by their bodies foixs demon still retains the shape of a bear arhyss ragged soul trails him as though it struggles to keep up how far away can you tell if a person is a sorcerer she shrugged as far as my eye can see i suppose no farther than that for my inner eye sees spirit shapes right through matter if i pay attention and concentrate and perhaps close my outer eyes to reduce the confusion tents walls bodies all are transparent to the gods and to godsight what about a sorcerers sight i am not sure foix seemed not to have much before i shared mine but his elemental is an inexperienced one huh he stood a moment looking increasingly abstracted come over here he took her hand and towed her to the western side of the tower overlooking the walnut grove do you suppose that you could give an exact tally of joens sorcerers if you tried in her camp from here ista blinked i dont know i could try the trees feet were now wading in gray shadow though their very tops still glowed golden green in the last of the light campfires twinkled through the leaves and a suggestion of the pale squares of many tents mens voices carried enough to be heard up on the battlements although not well enough to make out what they said in the roknari tongue on the far side of the grove the cluster of big green tents gaudy with pennants began to glow like verdant lanterns from the lamps being set within them ista took a long breath to try to compose her mind she extended her perceptions closing her eyes if she could sense joen or sordso from here could they sense her and if joen could sense her she took another breath banished the frightening thought and determinedly uncurled her soul once more upwards of five hundred faint soullights moved like fireflies among the trees the jokonan soldiers and camp followers busy about their ordinary tasks a smattering of souls glowed with a stronger much more violent and disrupted light yes there were the threads the snakes wavering through the air from those scattered whorls to converge all in one dark disturbing spot even as she watched one line crossed another as their possessors moved in space passing like two strands of insubstantial yarn that did not knot or tangle yes i can see them she told illvin some are snubbed up near to joen some are all spread out across the camp her lips moved as she made her count six hug the command tents twelve are arranged near the front of the grove nearest to porifors eighteen altogether she peeked turned half around toward the river and the jokonans second camp investing the town and closed her eyes once more then turned fully around toward the bivouac of the third column that had set up along the ridge to the east of the castle cutting the road to oby and commanding the valley upstream all the sorcerers seem to be in the main camp near joen i see no ribbons reaching to the other two camps yes of course she would want all her sorcerers as close under her eye as possible she completed her turn and opened her eyes again most of the sorcerers seem to be sheltered in tents one is standing under a tree looking this way she could not see his physical body through the leaves but she could tell which tree it was hm said illvin staring over her shoulder can foix tell which is which what man is a sorcerer what man is not oh yes i mean he can now he saw the sorcery light with me when the cups brokeand again standing on the wall when the rest of it began she glanced warily back over her shoulder at illvins tense closed expression his eyes were tight with thought some notion that did not seem to give him much pleasure what are you thinking i am thinking that by your testimony arhys appears to be immune to sorcery but sorcerers do not appear to be immune to steel as cattilara proved upon poor umerue if arhys could close with them just them and yet somehow avoid the other fifteen hundred jokonans around porifors he drew a breath and wheeled liss she jerked upright lord illvin go and find my lord brother and ask him to attend upon us here fetch foix too if he is to be found she nodded a bit wideeyed scrambled up and scuffed rapidly down the towers turning stairs illvin stared out over prince sordso and princess joens camp as if memorizing every detail ista leaned uneasily by his side studying that profile suddenly gone distant and cool he looked back and smiled down at her in apology i am seized by a thought i fear you will find me a rather distractible man it wasnt how she would describe him but she smiled briefly back in attempted reassurance all too soon footsteps sounded on the stairs arhys emerged into the luminous twilight followed by liss and foix arhys looked scarcely more corpselike than anyone else in porifors at present but his face was spared the usual smears of sweat foixs stolidity masked a deep depletion he had spent the afternoon clumsily trying to undo sorceries all over the castle to little effect dy cabon had named the effort fundamentally futile for various theological reasons that no one stayed to listen to and yet had begged foixs aid himself when faced with the rising demands of the sick arhys come here said illvin look at this his brother joined him at the western parapet five gods attest we know this ground royina ista says there are but eighteen sorcerers in joens pack altogether a dozen lie in the front of the camp along therehis hand swept in an arcsix more in the command tents a rather better guarded area i suspect one big circle could pass round them all if it were rapid enough how many sorcerers do you think you could excise with steel arhyss brows rose as many as i could close with i suppose but i doubt they would just stand there while we galloped up to them as soon as they thought to drop our horses wed be afoot what if we attacked in the dark you said you see better in the dark these days than other men hm arhyss gaze upon the grove intensified royina ista illvin turned urgently to herand where was all that sweet ista now what happens when a leashed sorcerer is slain ista frowned surely the question was rhetorical youve seen it yourself the demon together with whatever pieces of its mounts soul it has digested jumps to whatever new host it can reach the body dies what the fate of the remaining parts of the persons soul may be i do not know and one other thing illvin said excitement leaking into his voice the leash is broken or at leastcattilaras demon broke from control at umerues death more at that moment the free demon became joens rebellious enemy dedicated to flight from her as fast as possible how many demons could joen suffer to have cut away from her arrayjumping randomly into unprepared hosts or even turning on herbefore she was forced to retreat in disorder if she doesnt have others in reserve ready to harness like a fresh team of horses said arhys no said ista slowly i dont think she can all must be there tied in her net or they will flyaway from each other if not from her by umerues testimony it took joen three years to develop this array to bring each sorcererslave to some apex of carefully selected stolen skills without another visit to whatever back door of hell her master demon can unlock i doubt she can replace them and all shell get at first is a spate of mindless formless ignorant elementals we know she spills them too it cannot be a wellcontrolled process not when dealing with the essence of disorder itself although cattilaras demon fears recapture if that is not just some filial obsession of umerues it implies recapture is possible i dont know how quickly joen might effect it with several freed demons flying in all directions it would be more difficult i should guess said illvin arhys leaned his elbow on the stone wall and eyed his brother you are thinking of a sortie a sorcererhunt aye it cannot be done i am certain to take woundswhich catti would be forced to bear illvin looked away i was thinking the royina could switch you back to me for the occasion as it were ista gasped protest do you realize what that would mean arhyss injuries would be yours yes well illvin swallowed but then arhys could go on for quite a bit more than his enemies would guess perhaps physicians or women could stay at my side binding up the leaks as they spring buying extra minutes arhys frowned and then what at your last gasp break the link return all my wounds to me at once ista tried not to let her voice emerge as a shriek leaving you trapped in a hackedapart body that can neither die nor heal arhys said vaguely i really dont have all that much feeling in my body anymore maybe i might not be trapped maybehis ravishing gray eyes rose to meet istas and the sudden light in them terrified her down to her bonesi might be released to the death of nothingness no said ista indeed not said illvin i mean the sortie to swing round and return to porifors the others would ride to guard you and clear your way to the sorcerers and make sure you got back mm arhys stared down into the dusk how many men do you think it would take a hundred would be best but we do not have a hundred fifty might make it we do not have fifty either illvin we do not have twenty not mounted illvin straightened up from the parapet the excitement drained from his face twenty is too few too few to ride out or to ride back if too few to ride back then too few to ride out i could not ask it of any man if i were not riding myself and i would perforce be detained in here only in a sense said arhys he was looking increasingly disturbingly intent we are dying here by the hour worselord dy oby will ride apace to our relief he was never laggard but for the sake of his daughter he will brook no delay without warning of joens demonic deceits he will race his troops into this trap he cannot be here before day after tomorrow at the soonest said illvin i wouldnt be so sure if todays courier was taken by the jokonan screen and failed to arrive at oby hell know at once for i know the warnings about the ambush of foix and the divine reached him the fortress of oby is already well aroused arhyss frown deepened also the longer we wait the worse condition we will all be in that would certainly appear to be true illvin conceded and his voice lowered the worse condition i will be in our men are dying now without a blade being lifted or a quarrel being fired by nightfall tomorrow at this rate sordsos forces will be able to walk unopposed into a castle manned only by corpses unmoving save for one and i will be left facing the same enemyalone and unsupported ah said illvin sounding shaken had you not thought it through im surprised royinahe turned to istai am sundered now freeing me from this body will not change that state let it be done while while there is still some honor in it some use arhys you cannot ask this of me yes i can his voice fell further and you cannot refuse me ista was trembling both at what he proposed and at what he envisioned that solitary fate was she had to admit the logical progression of events arhys no this is too fey protested illvin fey is a man who looks forward to death i look back upon mine i am beyond fey i think if this hazard is to be cast at all it must be soon in the dark before dawn this night said illvin even he who had advanced the plan sounded appalled at its sudden acceleration this very night weve been shoved most forcefully onto the defensive and the jokonans do not look to us in our present shock to turn it about if ever the gods gave me the gift for finding the moment on the field i swear to you this is one illvins lips parted but no sound came out arhys smiled slightly and turned again to view the walnut grove in the fading light though perhaps not fading for him ista was reminded so how would i find these sorcerers and not waste time butchering ordinary men foix cleared his throat i can see them behind them sitting small and crosslegged by the wall again liss caught her breath arhys looked across at foix would you ride out with me dy gura its a good pairing i think you are less vulnerable to these sorcerous attacks than any other man here i let me look at the ground foix too advanced to the battlement and leaned upon it staring down at the camp ista saw by the way his eyes opened and closed that he marshaled his second sight to study this challenge arhys turned to ista royina can you manage this thing neither illvin nor i will be able to speak to youwe must rely on your judgment when to make or break our links lam every kind of afraid physically magically morally but mostly the last i think i could cut illvin free of you yes what about cattilara i would spare her said arhys let her sleep to wake a widow i am not sure that is a betrayal she could ever forgive she may be young and foolish but she is not a child now and will never be a child again in any case she must be allowed to wake and eat that she may lend you strength and not fail through no fault of her own illvin said i fear if she has any hint of this she will grow quite frenzied and i doubt her demon will be on our side either the stars were coming out overhead on the western horizon glowing pink feathers of cloud were fading to gray so much indifferent beauty in the world of matter i must take thought for cattilara said ista it seems no one else is willing to from the deepening shadows foix spoke lord arhys if you decide to ride out i will go with you if the royina will release me to your command ista hesitated for three sick heartbeats i release you thank you royina for this honor foix said formally come said arhys to illvin let us go see if there is enough unbroken gear left in castle porifors to outfit this curious hunt foix attend he turned for the stairs illvin strode back to grasp istas hand and lift it to his lips i shall see you shortly yes whispered ista the grip tightened and was gone chapter twentythree it was close to midnight before lord arhys went to rest in his chambers so that cattilara on the other side of the door might be roused to eat his page removed his boots but no more and settled by the foot of the bed to guard his repose ista thought the exhausted boy would be asleep on the floor before five minutes had passed arhys lay back on his bed eyes wide and dark in the light of the rooms sole candle be tender with her he pleaded to ista she has had to endure far too much i will use my very best judgment ista returned arhys accepted her words with a nod it was illvin overseeing the dispositions before returning to the nights tooeventful watch who cocked a curious eyebrow at her as they turned away be as careful of her as of her demon and i dont mean it the way arhys does he muttered to ista after that accursed escapade with the wagon i believe there is no limit to what she would do in pursuit of her ends i will use said ista neutrally my very best judgment she let foix and liss pass before her into lady cattilaras chamber and closed the door upon him gently but firmly the most levelheaded of cattilaras ladies was just arriving with the meal tray the haggard look on her face as well as the care she took setting the food down told ista she recognized the cost of it ista dismissed her only as far as a seat on a chest liss stayed by istas elbow as she approached cattilaras bed foix stand by her feet keep an eye on her demon ista directed foix nodded and did so ista was unhappy to be demanding yet one more duty of him when he was so plainly drained to the point of swaying on his feet he desperately needed to rest for a few hours before the sortie but joen had taught her greater caution of demons ista called up her inner sight and closed her hands around the flow of soulfire from cattis heart reducing it to the tiniest trickle of contact with arhys ista imagined the look of life flowing from his face in the next room and her chest tightened the demon shadow squirmed in agitation but did not challenge istas control cattilaras eyes flew open and her breath drew in she sat up abruptly then swayed dizzy liss pressed a tin cup of water into her hand by the way she guzzled pressing it to her dry lips ista thought they were none too soon with this sustenance liss transferred the tray to a small table by the bedside and drew off the linen cover plain fare and stale presented on a miscellany of battered old plates catti glared over the cup at ista and glowered down at the tray what is this servants food or a prisoners is the mistress of porifors so dethroned by her usurper now it is the last and best untainted food in the keep reserved for you we are now surrounded by a jokonan army and besieged by a troop of sorcerers their demon magic is chewing everything within these walls to pieces and spitting it out upon us all the water is gone the meat seethes with maggots half the courts are burned and a third of the horses lie dead men are dying tonight below us of disease and injury without ever having come within bowshot of joen and sordsos troops joens new way of making war is ingenious cruel and effective extraordinarily effective so eat because it is the only meal arhys will have tonight cattilara gritted her teeth but at least she gritted them on her first bite of dry bread we could have fled we should have fled i could have had arhys forty miles from here by now and out of this curse you for a lackwitted bitch foix and liss stirred at the insult but istas raised hand stayed them arhys would not have thanked you and who is we are you even certain whose voice speaks from inside your head right now eat catti gnawed gracelessly but too driven by her ferocious waking hunger to spurn the proffered meal liss kept the water coming for cattilaras sunken features betrayed how dangerously parched she had grown ista let her chew and swallow for several minutes until she began visibly to slow later tonight ista began again arhys rides out on a hazardous sortie a gamble to save us all or die trying you mean him to die catti mumbled you hate him you hate me you are twice mistaken though i admit to a strong desire to slap you at times now for instance lady cattilara you are the wife of a soldiercommander and the daughter of a soldiercommander you cannot possibly have been raised here in this dire borderland to such wild selfindulgence cattilara looked away perhaps to conceal a flash of shame in her face this stupid war has always dragged on it will always drag on but once arhys is gone hes gone forever and all the good in the world goes with him the gods would take him and leave me bereft and i curse them i have cursed them for years said ista dryly turnabout being fair cattilara was furious distraught writhing in overwhelming pain but was she divorced altogether from reason so what is reality now here in this waking nightmare where is reason absurd that i of all women should insist on reason keep chewing ista straightened her weary back crossed her arms i have a proposition for you cattilara glowered in suspicion you may accept or refuse but you may not have other choices it quite resembles a miracle in that regard arhys rides out tonight against joens sorcerers illvin has volunteered to accept his wounds to the point of death it seems to me that two bodies both nourishing arhyss sword arm and bearing his hurts would carry him farther than one perhaps just the needed edge that little difference between almost succeeding and almost failing you can be a part of his ride or you can be shut out of it foix startled said royina lord arhys would not desire this quite said ista coolly no one else here will offer you this choice cattilara you cannot do this behind his back said foix i am the appointed executor of this rite this is womens business now foix be silent cattilaraista drew breathwidow you are and shall be but the grief you will carry into the rest of your life will be different depending on the choices you make tonight how better snarled cattilara tears were leaking from her eyes now without arhys all is ashes i didnt say better i said different you may accept the part apportioned to you or you may lie down and be passed over if you do not take your part and he fails you will never ever know whether you might have made the difference if you accept the part and he still fallsthen you will know that too arhys would have protected you from this choice as a father would a beloved child arhys is wrong in this i give you a womans choice here at the last gasp he looks to spare you pain this night i look to your nights for the next twenty years there is neither right nor wrong in this precisely but the time to amend all choices runs out like poriforss water you think he will die in this fight grated cattilara hes been dead for three months i did not war against his death but against his damnation i have lost in my lifetime i have looked two gods in the eye and it has seared me till i am afraid of almost nothing in the world of matter but i am afraid of this for him he stands this night on the edge of the true death the death that lasts forever and there is none to pull him back from that precipice not even the gods can save him if he falls now your choice is no choice its death all ways no death in different ways you had more of him than any woman alive now the wheel turns be assured someday it will turn for you all are equal in this he goes first but not uniquely nor alone for he will have a large jokonan escort i do think he will if i have anything to do with it growled foix yes do you imagine not one of them is also beloved as arhys is you have a chance to let arhys go out in serenity with his mind clear and unimpeded concentrated as the sword which is his symbol i will not give you leave to send him off harassed and dismayed distracted and grieved cattilara snarled why should i give him up to deathor to the gods or to you or to anyone hes mine all my life is his then you shall be hollow and echoing indeed when he is gone this disaster is not my doing if people had just done things my way this all could have been averted everyone is against me the food on the tray was all gone sighing ista touched her ligature and opened the channel wide once more cattilara sank back cursing the flow of soulfire from cattis heart was slow and surly but it would suffice for the next few hours i would have liked to give her a chance to say goodbye said ista sadly lord illvins remarks on kisses withheld and words unspoken weigh much on my mind foix his face appalled said her remarks were better left unspoken to lord arhys just now i think so i judged five gods why was i appointed to this court go foix get what rest you may it is your most urgent duty now aye royina he glanced at liss will you come down to see us off later on yes whispered liss foix started to speak seemed to find his throat strangely uncooperative nodded thanks and bowed his way out ista too eventually went to lie down in her chambers for a few hours she longed for a dreamless slumber feared the sleep of dreams but in any case merely dozed disquieted by the occasional agonized noises that filtered in through her lattice from a castle disintegrating it seemed about all their ears at length liss drawn face candlelit by a stub in a brass holder whose glass vase lay in shards somewhere came to rouse her ista was already awake and dressed the bleak mourning garb was growing dirty and frayed but its black robe suited her mood and the shadows of this hour liss followed her holding up the meager light as ista eased out the door onto the gallery she took three steps down the empty stairs and stopped her breath caught a tall somber man stood on the treads two below her so that his face was level with hers in precisely the position she had kissed and challenged the dead arhys half a lifetime ago here his face and form were uncertain in outline she thought he looked a bit like arhys a bit like arvol and more than a little like her own dead father though dy baocia had been a shorter thicker man he was not much she thought like ias he was dressed as an officer of porifors in mail and a grayandgold tabard but the mail gleamed and the tabard was pressed and perfect its embroidery bright as fire his hair and beard were pure gray cut short as arhyss were clean and fine the wavering candlelight did not reflect from his upturned face nor from the endless depths of his eyes they shone instead with their own effulgent light ista swallowed raised her chin stiffened her knees i wasnt expecting you here the father of winter favored her with a grave nod all gods attend on all battlefields what parents would not wait as anxiously by their door looking again and again up the road when their child was due home from a long and dangerous journey you have waited by that door yourself both fruitfully and in vain multiply that anguish by ten thousands and pity me sweet ista for my greatsouled child is very late and lost upon his road the deep resonance of his voice seemed to make her chest vibrate her bones ring she could barely breathe water clouded her vision and fell from her unblinking eyes i know it sire she whispered my calling voice cannot reach him he cannot see the light in my window for he is sundered from me blind and deaf and stumbling with none to take his hand and guide him yet you may touch him in his darkness and i may touch you in yours then take you this thread to draw him through the maze where i cannot go he leaned forward and kissed her on the brow his lips burned like cold metal fearfully she reached up and touched his beard as she had arhyss that day tickling strange and soft beneath her palm as he bent his head a tear fell as a snowflake upon the back of her hand melted and vanished am i to be a spiritual conductor on your behalf now she asked dazed no my doorway he smiled enigmatically at her a white streak in the night like lightning across her senses and her reeling mind slipped from dazed to dazzled i will wait there for him for a little while he stepped backward and the stair was empty again ista stood shaken the spot on the back of her left hand where his tear had splashed was icy cold royina said liss very cautiously stopped behind her who are you talking to did you see a man um no i am sorry liss held up her candle youre crying yes i know its all right let us go on now i think perhaps you had better hold my arm till we get down the stairs the stone court the archway the star court with its restive horse line and the gate into the forecourt passed in a dark blur liss held her arm the whole way and frowned at its fierce trembling the torch lit forecourt was crowded with men and horses most of the flowerpots were broken fallen from the walls or tipped spilling their dry soil the succulents were smashed the more tender flowers wilted and limp like cooked greens the two espaliered trees on the far wall shed dry leaves in the breathless night heat falling one by one atop a drift of rotting petals foix was the first to notice her arrival his head turned and his mouth opened no doubt she moved in a cloud of god light just at present being so recently touched and i bear a burden that i am most gravely charged to deliver her eye swept the court found arhys and illvin but her attention was temporarily distracted by the horse they both studied from a distance it was a tall longnosed chestnut stallion held by three sweating grooms a blindfold covered its eyes beneath its bridle which was fitted with a deep curb bit one groom held its upper lip tightly in a twitch its ears were back flat and it squealed angrily showing long yellow teeth and kicked out illvin was standing well back from it looking aggrieved ista came up beside him and said lord illvin do you know that stallion is possessed of an elemental so foix has just informed me royina it explains a lot about that horse ista peered through halfclosed eyes at the writhing mauve shadow within the animal grant you it appears to be a small unformed stupid one that explains yet more bastards hell i was going to lend the accursed beast to arhys his good dappled gray has gone lame along with half the horses that remain to usan outbreak of thrush developing with unnatural speed and i hope arhys can soon deliver our thanks to whichever jokonan sorcerer thought of that one is this an especially good warhorse no but no one will care if arhys rides it to death in fact i think the grooms are hoping he will five gods know ive tried to without success hra said ista she walked forward the two grooms holding the beasts head squeaked protest her eyes narrowed and she reached up and placed her godsplashed hand upon the stallions forehead a tiny sixpointed mark burned upon her skin snowwhite to her outer vision a fierce spark to her inner eye remove its blindfold the groom glanced somewhat desperately at illvin who nodded permission but drew his sword and held it with the flat out watching tensely the horses eyes were dark brown with purple centers most horses eyes had purple centers ista reminded herself but they didnt usually have quite so deep a glow the eyes fixed on her and rolled whitely she stared back the animal suddenly grew very still ista stood on tiptoe grabbed one ear and whispered toward it behave for lord arhys or i will make you wish id merely ripped your guts out strangled you with them and fed you to the gods dogs corrected the nervous groom holding the twitch them too said ista take off the twitch and stand away lady its all right the groom backed away the horse shivering flicked its ears up to strict attention and arched its neck to bring its face submissively flat to istas torso it gave a brief nudge leaving a trail of red horsehairs across her black silk robe and stood perfectly quietly do you do that sort of thing often illvin inquired strolling over with extreme caution he reached out to give the beast an experimental pat on the neck no sighed ista it has been a day for unique experiences illvin was simply dressed in light linen trousers and his sparkspotted shirt in preparation for his role to come arhys looked so much as he had when ista had seen him for the very first time that she caught her breath except that his mail and tabard were not bloodspattered yet he smiled soberly at her as he came to her side a word royina before i go two words as many as you please he lowered his voice first i thank you for bearing me up to a better death one less shameful small and stupid than my first our men may yet surprise you on that score said illvin gruffly on the far side of the forecourt a mere dozen soldiers were also preparing their mounts pejar was among them his face was flushed with fever ista noted he should have been lying on a pallet not attempting this then she wondered how few men in porifors were still able to walk at all at this hour arhys smiled briefly at his brother and forbore to argue or correct or pull that thin hope from his hands he turned back to ista second i beg a boon anything within my power his clear eyes fixed on her with penetrating intensity she felt targeted if this dy lutez manages to die well tonight let it complete the set that was left undone so long ago let what victory i may gain swallow up forever the old cold dereliction and be you healed of the long wound that another dy lutez dealt you oh said ista oh she dared not let her voice break she had still an office to perform i was given a message for you too his brows rose he looked a little taken aback no courier has penetrated the jokonan blockade for a day what messenger was this i met him on the stairs but now it is this she swallowed to clear her voice your father calls you to his court you need not pack you go garbed in glory as you stand he waits eagerly by his palace doors to welcome you and has prepared a place at his high table by his side in the company of the greatsouled honored and bestbeloved in this i speak true bend your head wideeyed astonished he did so she pressed her lips to his brow the pale skin neither hot nor cold unsheened with sweat her mouth seemed to leave a brief ring of frost that steamed in the heavy night air a new line appeared in her second sight a fine thread of gray light strung from him to her it is a lifeline it could she somehow knew stretch to the ends of the earth without breaking oh moved she completed the full formal rite kissing the back of each hand then bending to his feet and touching her lips to each boot as well he jerked a little as if to dissuade her but then stood still and allowed the gesture he recaptured her hands and helped pull her back to her feet her knees felt like water surely he whispered in awe we are blessed yes for we bless each other be at rest in your heart it will be very well she backed away to let illvin embrace his brother illvin held arhys away by his shoulders after and gazed with smiling puzzlement into those strange exultant eyes which seemed to look back from some great and receding distance the cool lips smiled kindly though illvin turned to give him a leg up on the painfully obedient red stallion check his girths and stirrups and gear one last time and slap his leatherclad leg in some habitual gesture he stood away ista looked around through blurred and stinging eyes to find liss standing at the shoulder of foixs horse foix was already mounted he saluted liss in the gesture of the daughters order touching his forehead she returned a couriers salute fist tapped over her heart foix meeting istas eyes saluted her as well she gave back the sign of the fivefold blessing the dozen men of arhyss forlorn little company mounted up at his quiet word no one spoke much liss ista choked and cleared her throat liss she began again attend on me we must get to the tower both liss and illvin fell in beside her and they started back through the archway behind them ista could hear poriforss gates begin to creak open the iron ratcheting of the drawbridge chains echoing among the dying flowers illvin walked backward a moment staring into the firestreaked dark but ista schooled herself not to turn around chapter twentyfour istas aching legs pushed her up the narrow tower stairs the curving stone wall harsh beneath her groping hand into a square of unexpected radiance rows of candles were lined up at the base of the parapet walls on the north and south sides stuck into blobs of their own wax burning clear and unwavering in the breezeless night air the heat seemed to stream upward into the starry night sky but withal the air of the tower was much less close and stale than that of the forecourt with their arrival the platform seemed crowded ista surveyed the arrangements shed ordered and breathed satisfaction at one side lady cattilara dressed in a robe lay silently upon a straw pallet that was covered with a sheet another pallet also covered with old linens lay empty beside her the sewing woman with her basket goram and learned dy cabon his robes now very stained indeed all waited anxiously the little company would have to suffice the few physicians and acolytes of the mother left alive in the beleaguered town were felled by fevers or worse and in any case could not be smuggled up the collapsed tunnels to their castles aid illvin emerging from the stairs blackness shielded his eyes against the candle glow royina will you be able to see out to track my brothers progress it wont be these eyes i use to follow him and your attendants must be able to see you her material hand reached to touch the invisible reassurance of the gray thread which seemed to spin out from her heart into the darkness below i will not lose him now he grunted somewhat disconsolate acquiescence drew a breath and seated himself upon the empty pallet laying his sword aside he peeled out of his speckled and sweatstained shirt and rolled up his loose trouser legs goram helped pull off his boots he swung his long legs out straight and lay back face not so much composed as rigid his dark dilated eyes looking up at the stars wisps of cloud moisture out of reach crossed the spangled vault in gray feathers i am ready his voice sounded parched but not ista thought just from lack of water from the castle below she heard the faint ratchet of the drawbridge chains being pulled up again very slowly and a jingle of harness and thump of hooves passing away from the walls fading with distance the gray thread was moving in the pool of darkness below very like a fishing line taken by a pike we have not much time we must begin she dropped to her knees between the two pallets illvin took her hand and pressed it to his lips she caressed his slick brow as she took it back composed herself shut out the confusing sight of her eyes and brought up the tangle of lights and shadows by which the realm of spirit represented itself to her now she suspected the gods simplified it for her and that the reality beneath this was stranger and more complex still but this was what she was given it must do she undid her ligature around the white trickle coming from illvins heart opening the channel wide soulfire poured out joined the sluggish sullen stream from cattilara and flowed away into the night winding around the gray thread but not touching it the life drained from illvins face leaving it stiff and waxen and she shuddered she turned away and studied the sleeping cattilara the demon swirled in agitation beneath her thin breastbone enormous stresses propagated here straining toward some cataclysmic breakage istas next task was dangerous indeed dangerous to them all but she could not shirk from it so many souls were at risk in this ride she tightened cattilaras ligature pushing the soulfire up from her heart toward her head the demon tried to follow it she laid her snowspangled left hand upon cattilaras collarbone stared in fascination at the gray glow her fingers suddenly shed the demon shrank again crying with new terror cattilaras eyes opened she tried to surge upright only to find her body still paralyzed you she cried to ista curse you let me go ista let out her tight breath arhys rides out now pity his enemies for death on a demon horse descends upon them out of the darkness bringing sword and fire many will bear him company on his journey to his fathers keep tonight their souls like ragged banners borne before his echoing feet you must choose now will you aid him or impede him in his last journey cattilaras head yanked back and forth in an agony of denial no no no the god himself awaits his coming his own holy breath held in the balance of the moment arhyss heart flies ahead to his fathers hand like a messenger bird even if he could be dragged back now he would spend the rest of his life and i think it would not be long hanging at that window longing for his last home he would not thank you he could not love you with all his heart anchored in that other realm i think he might even grow to hate you knowing what glory you denied to him for one last moment the last instant of time and choice think not of what you desire but of what he does not of your good but of his greatest good no screamed cattilara very well ista reached to open the ligature one eye on the restive mutinous demon cattilara turned her head away and whispered yes ista paused exhaled murmured so i pray the gods may hear even me and let my whispered yes tower above my shouted no and mount all the way to their fivefold realm as i would be heard so i hear you she swallowed hard hold your demon on its course it will not be an easy one will i feel much pain asked cattilara her eyes met istas at last her voice would have been almost inaudible but for the silence on the platform not even cloth rustled from the people standing watching yes no i have no idea yes i think so all births have some oh good she turned her head away again but not in denial her eyes were wet but her face was as still as carved ivory ista lifted her hand but her intervention was not needed as cattilaras face went slack the white fire burst redoubled from her heart to join the flow from illvin in a torrent roaring down over the parapet so you do not ride alone arhys the hearts of the two who love you best go with you now she hoped his body received their outpouring as an exaltation at the other end of that white line she rose and hurried to the parapet motioning the others to make ready with pads cloths and tourniquets she stared out into the darkness the roads like gray ribbons the open spaces rucked like mistshrouded blankets across an unmade bed the trees of the grove black and silent a few watch fires burned in the enemy camp and jokonan horsemen slowly patrolled back and forth out of bowshot a clot of moving shadows reached the trees slipping between the patrols she glared out with all the strength of her other eyes following the white flood and thin gray thread to where a dozen soulsparks moved atop the lesser lifeblurs of their horses arhyss gray glow was distinctive foixs violettinged double shadow even more so she could see clearly through all the moving masses that lay between when arhys kicked the demonlit shape of his horse into a canter he closed rapidly on a quiescent colored thread of sorcerer light like a hawk swooping on unsuspecting prey can you see foix lisss breathless voice sounded by her ear yes he rides by arhyss side the shouts of alarm didnt go up till the first tent went down as more cries and a ring of steel split the night the mounted patrols wheeled about and began galloping back toward the camp abruptly the snake of sorcerer fire stretched and snapped a bluish gout of soulfire shot aloft separating even as ista watched from a violent purple streak which sped away trailing soul shreds in tornoff fluttering rags the bluish gout writhed in agony and faded into elsewhere the purple streak grounded itself in a moving soulspark somewhere beneath the trees both the recipient and the demon dropped flat in the shock of that arrival but the snake did not renew itself thats one said ista aloud the attackers made no cries or calls at all moving in grim determined silence the pale blur of another tent sheltering the head of another colored snake swayed shook and collapsed the jokonan sorcerer gathered energy for some strike at his attacker ista could see the flash of a bolt of demon magic pass through arhys and hear the wail of the sorcerers surprise and woe cut off she rather thought that faint distant liquid thunk might have been a beheading another violet streak separated from another white gout shocked and tumbling the violet blur fell helterskelter into a horse being ridden toward the fray by a jokonan cavalryman the animal stumbled jerked sideways dumped its rider and wheeled to run at a hard gallop away down the oby road the loose snake head seemed to quest after it as if seeking to strike but then fell back in on itself disintegrating in a stream of sparks thats two said ista from the trees a wavering glow blazed up yellow and bright as a tent caught fire beyond the grove lights were being lit in the big green command tents ista had no doubt that those sorcerers asleep when the first blow fell were now astir yanked awake by joen if theyd slept through the noise how quickly could the surprised jokonans coordinate their defenses their counterattack another spurt of soulfire without a demon this time seared past her eye an ordinary enemy soldier slain or one of arhyss defiant volunteers from a godseye view she realized it made no difference all deathbirths were accepted equally into that realm three she counted as the attack pressed forward are we winning gasped liss it depends on what you think is the prize at the fourth tent the attackers began to come to grief at last three sorcerer snakes had somehow combined there possibly arhys was weirdly invisible to them for they chose to concentrate on foix of coursethey must imagine another sorcerer as the greatest danger to them mistake foix for the heart or head of the enemy strike soullights swayed jerked spun in istas dizzied perceptions the bear went down roaring under a net of fire but the fourth and fifth snakes were beheaded ribbonbodies lashing furiously in their death throes before shredding apart in a streaming aurora from that far greenglowing tent ista could hear a woman fiercely screaming but the roknari words were blurred to unintelligibility by distance and rage i think they have taken foix said ista behind her a triple gasp help cried the sewing woman whitefaced liss whirled and dropped back to her post by cattilaras side on both cattilaras right thigh and on illvins long dark slices had opened up a brief glimpse of the redbrown of pulsing muscle a pale streak of tendon then both the twin wounds were flooded with red the sewing woman and liss and goram and dy cabon hastened to pad and bind each cut and slow the stream yes yes thought ista her strategy was good on one recipient that sword cut would have gone to the core the half wounds were half as dire she almost laughed aloud if blackly imagining the dismay of arhyss assailant knowing from the shock of contact the jerk of blade from the bone the ringing up his arm how hard hed struck yet seeing that wound close up again before his eyes indeed the wild wail that echoed up now from the grove might well be the very man you thought youd dropped all the horrors of nightmare down upon porifors while you sat safe now watch porifors return the favor we hold we hold for a very little while longer she turned again to try to peer beneath the trees she could mark arhyss striding progress across the camp by the sounds of terror she thought as his enemies flew screaming before his pale face and deadly blade and by the streams of white fire rising in his wake he was unhorsed she was uncertain when that had happened she hoped he was not yet alone without one comrade left to guard his back i think he is alone now a weird wet thunk sounded behind her she glanced back to see her helpers rushing to press pads to illvins and cattilaras stomachs that was a crossbow bolt she wondered if arhys had plucked it out to throw back at his dazed enemies or left it in place like a badge it would have been a killing strike on any other man at any other time soon there will be more by the gods a dy lutez does know how to die three times and three times three if needed she fell to her knees behind the parapet clinging to the stone it seemed to her that some great black glacier some ice dam in her soul was melting as if a hundred summers heat had fallen on it in an hour cracking coming apart and that in the miledeep milelong lake of icy green water backing it up an expectant surge rippled from bank to bank from the surface to the uttermost depths troubling the waters i passed blessing to you in the forecourt but you passed blessing back to me too trading rescues five gods watch us ride out together in this breaking dawn you five may awe us but i think we must awe you too seven she whispered aloud then something went wrong a hesitation a turning away too many far too many soulsparks swirled around that gray flame now he is surrounded cut off dozens who ran away now run toward encouraged by their own numbers daring to take him down in the midst of your enemies your father has prepared a feast for you on a table your father set long ago here it comes another thunk and another from behind her lisss sharp voice cried lady there are too many wounds splitting open you must stop this dy cabons strained rumble royina remember you promised arhys that lady cattilara would live and a certain fat white god has promised illvin to me if i did not mistake him if we both live a godgiven lover importunate and bold as a scarred stray cat rubbing past my guard into my good graces if i can keep him fed she glanced over her shoulder illvins body jerked upward with the transferred force of some massive blow to arhyss back and goram his face frantic rolled him over to reach the red rent cattilaras white hand half split from its wrist and liss pounced to staunch the spurting now oh yes now ista clenched her hand about the torrent of white fire running past her shoulder the flow stopped abruptly wild shocks pulsed back in both directions from her grip the violet channel shattered the white fire the constant companion of her inner eye for days winked out a hushed hesitation then in the shadowed grove a grotesque roar of hysteriatinged triumph went up from half a hundred jokonan throats the ice dam exploded a wall of water towered bent and broke thundering forward bursting its banks blasting her soul wide wider scouring and flushing a lifetime of stones rubble rotted and clotted trash before it boiling roaring outward ista spread her arms wide and opened her mouth and let it go the gray thread almost lost to view in the violent blazes stiffened to a taut rope it began to move back through her new dilation faster and faster until it seemed to smoke with the heat of its passage like an overstrained fiber rope about to char and burst into flame for an instant arhyss astonished agonized ecstatic soul moved through hers yes we are all every living one of us doorways between the two realms that of matter that gives us birth and that of spirit into which we are born in death arhys was sundered from his own gate and lost the way back to it forever so it was given to me to lend him mine for a little time but so great a soul does need a wide portal so knock down my gates and breach my walls and burst them wide and pour through freely by my leave and farewell yes ista whispered yes he did not look back given what he must be looking on toward ista was not in the least surprised it is done sire i hope you find it was done well she heard no voice saw no radiant figure but it seemed to her she felt a caress upon her brow and the ache there which had throbbed for hours as though her head were bound in a tight iron band stopped the end of the pain was like a morning birdsong there was a real morning birdsong she realized muzzily here in matters lovely realm a cheery brainless warble from the bushes below the castle walls the gray cloudfeathers among the fading stars were just beginning to blush a faint fiery pink color creeping from east to west a little thread of lemon light lined the eastern horizon illvin groaned ista turned to find him sitting up in dy cabons grip pulling bloodsoaked bandages from his unmarked body his lips parted with dismay as he took in the extent of the mess starting to glow scarlet as color seeped back into the world five gods he swallowed against a surge of bile that was bad at the end wasnt it it was no question yes said ista but hes gone now safe and gone in the grove below the fearcrazed jokonans she somehow knew were hacking arhyss body to bits pulling it apart terrified that it might yet reassemble and rise once more against them she did not see any merit in mentioning this to illvin just now cattilara lay on her side curled up she cried in quiet stuttering sobs almost unable to breathe clutching the sponge that had stanched her stomach so hard that the blood bubbled through her fingers the sewing woman patted her clumsily and uselessly on the shoulder the world darkened around ista as if dawn appalled by the scene retreated again over the horizon strolling into in her mind like some casual wayfarer a voice spoke familiar ironic and immense my word spacious in here all of a sudden is it not what are you doing here now i thought this was become your stepfathers battlefield you invited me come come you cant deny it i heard you whispering over in that corner she was not sure she had any emotions left for this not rage in any case her disembodied quietude might be either serenity or shock but the bastard was surely a god to be approached with caution why do you not appear in front of me because i am behind you now the voice grew warm and amused the press of an enormous belly seemed to heat her back along with an obscene implication of loins against her buttocks and a pressure of wide hands upon her shoulders you have a vile sense of humor she said weakly yes and you catch every one of my jokes too i love a woman with a keen ear he seemed to breathe into hers you should have a keen tongue to go with them i vow her mouth filled with fire why am i here to complete arhyss victory if you can the voice was gone the darkness faded into a streaked pale dawnlight she found herself fallen on her knees on the tower platform leaning into illvins alarmed grip ista ista he was saying into her ear royina dear dont frighten a poor naked cavalier speak to me yes she blinked open blurry eyes he was only a nearly naked cavalier she discovered to her disappointment the bloodstained rags of his linen trousers were still rucked up around his loins he was a most magnificent mess otherwise true dark matted hair falling in a wild tangle over his face and shoulders sweaty and sootsmeared and smelly and striped with red but all his scars were old ones healed and pale he huffed with relief when he saw her looking back at him and bent his neck to kiss her she fended off his lips with her palm wait not yet what was that he asked did you hear anything or see anyone no but ill swear you did what would you not swear instead that i am mad no and yet you see no god lights hear no voices how do you know i saw my brothers face when you blessed him and yours when he blessed you if that is madness i would run down the road after it dressed as i am and barefoot i will walk slowly good he helped her to her feet liss said anxiously royina what of foix ista sighed foix went down beneath many soldiers and sorcerers i did not see his soul arise nor his demon flee i fear he is taken perhaps wounded as well thats not good said dy cabon still kneeling by illvins pallet his teeth grated in a little nervous gesture do you think do you think joen can bind him into her array i think yes given time what i do not know is how long he can resist her five gods i do not wish to lose another boy not good at all illvin agreed he had barely exhaled steadying himself upright when a shout rang out gorams voice lady catti no ista twisted around cattilara was on her feet her bloody robe falling wide about her her eyes were huge her mouth open the demon light within her had expanded to the margins of her body and pulsed violently the demon is ascendant ista cried it is taking her seize her do not let her run goram closest attempted to take her arm a violet light appeared in her palm and she shoved it toward him he fell retching ista staggered toward her stepping between her and the opening of the stairs cattilara started forward then shied away her hands raised as if to shield her eyes she looked around frantically her knees bunched and she lunged for the wall liss sprang forward and grabbed her ankle she twisted snarling and yanked at lisss hair illvin danced forward hesitated for an instant of calculation and clipped her precisely across the side of the head she flipped backward halfstunned ista tottered over and fell to her knees beside her she seemed to see the demon like a tumor spreading tendrils throughout cattilaras body winding like a parasitical vine around the tree of her spirit sapping strength and life and light stealing the high complexities of personality language knowledge and memory that it could not in the fundamental disorder of its nature ever make for itself oh now i see how to do this she reached out with her spirit hands and lifted the demon trailing recoiling tendrils from cattilaras soul it came unwillingly flopping in panic like some sea creature drawn out of the water ista held out a material hand fingers spread for a screen and pushed back the trailing shreds of cattilaras soul like carding wool until only the demon was left in her hand she held it up dubiously before her face yes said the voice thats right go ahead she shrugged popped the demon in her mouth and swallowed it now what are you going to extend this metaphor to its logical conclusion it would be just like you i think i shall spare you that sweet ista said the voice highly amused but i do like your vile sense of humor i think we shall get along well dont you there was no cranny in her armored spirit for the demon to wedge itself within to clutch to hold and it wasnt only that she was filled by the god she felt the demon knotted up in terror pass out the other side of her soul into the realm of the spirit into the hands of the god its master gone what will happen to the pieces of the other souls who are tangled up in it she asked in worry but the voice had vanished again or at least didnt choose to answer cattilara was crouched on the tower platform panting and hiccupping in little short sobs illvin cleared his throat apologetically and shook out his hand the demon tried to fling you to your death and its freedom he told her she stared up at him with a ravaged face in a ragged voice she said i know i wish it had succeeded ista motioned the sewing woman goram and liss to her get her to a bed a real bed and call her women to her find her what comforts this castle can yet yield dont let her be left alone ill come to her when i can she saw them down the spiral stairs cattilara weary beyond weeping leaning on the sewing woman and shrugging away from liss ista turned back to find illvin and dy cabon slumping worriedly on the eastern parapet staring down at the jokonan camp in the growing light it roiled with activity half hidden beneath the trees wisps of smoke still rose from the tents that had been burned a stray saddled horse trotted away from a man trying to catch it his roknari curses carried faintly through the moist dawn air ista craned her neck in hope but it did not appear to be illvins red stallion so what has happened royina asked dy cabon gazing down in perplexity have we won or lost it was a very great hunt arhys slew seven sorcerers before they brought him down he stumbled at the eighth i think it was a sorceress i wonder if she was young and beautiful and he could not force his hand swiftly enough to the task ah said illvin sadly that would be arhyss downfall wouldnt it perhaps the jokonans had realized how few were his numbers and were combining against him by then anyway but the freed demons are fled away in all directions joen did not recover any alas that we do not have two more arhyses to complete the task said illvin perhaps ordinary men must try now he hitched his shoulders and frowned ista shook her head joen has hurt us and now we have hurt her back but we have not defeated her she still holds eleven sorcerers on her strings and an army barely scratched she is in a rage her assault will redouble without mercy dy cabon slumped on the parapet thick shoulders bowed then arhys rode in vain we are lost no arhys has won us everything we have only to reach out our hands to collect it you didnt ask me what i did with cattilaras demon learned his brows went up and he turned toward her did you not bind it in her as before no istas lips drew back on a smile that made him recoil i ate it what dont look at me its your gods metaphor i have finally penetrated the mystery of the bastards second kiss i know how the saint of rauma accomplished her task of booting demons out of the world and back to their holy commander because it seems the trick of it has now fallen to me arhyss parting gift or rather something he made possible she shivered with a sorrow to which she dared not yet give way illvin her voice was sharp urgent it jerked him from the grieving lassitude that seemed to be overtaking him as he leaned all his weight on the wall and stared into nothing he had lost she reminded herself a worrisome amount of his own blood in the past hour for such an alreadydepleted man muddled with cattilaras it was spread out in clotting pools across half the tower platform his wounds had all closed as if they had never been except for the row of scabbed needle holes bound with thread across his shoulder he looked back at her and blinked owlishly what is the swiftest most efficient possible way by which i might come facetoface with joen with unthinking brilliance he replied simply surrender then stared at her aghast and clapped his hand to his mouth as if a toad had just fallen from his lips chapter twentyfive ista had just finished washing or at least cleaning her body with a half cup of water and some rags when liss returned to their chambers she clutched a pile of white garments in her arms pushing open the inner door with a twist of her hips these are the best cattilaras women could find in a hurry she announced good put them on the bed ista closed the dirty black robe back about herself and came over to examine them it had not been by any definition a bath but at least the touch of her lesssticky skin against clean clothing might not feel like some violation how fares the marchess she is asleep now or unconscious i really couldnt be quite sure looking at her she was very pale and gray just as well either way the blood she spent on the tower buys her a favor perhaps in this drained slumber ista sorted through the piles a linen shift the color of new cream bordered with elaborate cutwork looked as though it had a hem short enough that she would not trip over it a delicate white over robe embroidered in shining white thread that lent it weight and swing was a bastards day festival garment the unknown needlewoman had somehow endowed the friezes of tiny dancing rats and crows with considerable charm perfect ista murmured holding it up the spark she noticed was gone from her left hand though the frost mark on her skin remained my lady urn isnt it a little provocative to place yourself in quadrene hands wearing the bastards own color ista smiled grimly let them imagine so its real message is one i do not expect them to read haste now tie the ribbons of the shift in back straightly please liss did so cinching in the graceful waist ista pulled on the overrobe shook out the wide sleeves and fastened it closed beneath her breasts with the amethystandsilver mourning brooch the meaning of the heirloom had shifted it seemed to her half a dozen times since it had come into her possession all its old woes had drained out utterly last night today she wore it newfilled with stern sorrow for arhys and for those who had ridden with him all about her must be renewed in this hour the hair next she instructed sitting on the bench something quick and neat i do not mean to go out to them looking like a madwoman dragged through a hedge or a haystack hit by lightning she smiled in memory put it in one braid liss swallowed hard and began brushing and said for the fourth or fifth time since dawn on the tower i wish you would take me with you no said ista with regret ordinarily you would be much safer as the servant of a valuable hostage than left in a crumbling fortress about to fall but if i should fail in what i attempt joen would make demon fodder of you steal your mind and memories and courage for her own or take you in trade for her sorcererslaves that arhys killed last night and set you on me not as my servant but as her guard or worse and if ista succeeded she had no idea what might happen after that saints were no more immune to steel than sorcerers as her predecessor the late saint of raumawas no longer able to testify what could be worse the long strokes of the brush faltered do you think she has enslaved foix and his bear yet ill know in an hour what worse might be should liss fall into joens hands suddenly occurred to ista now that would be the perfect unholy union of two hearts to feed liss to foixs bear and let foixs own caring drive him mad with horror and woe as their souls mixed then she wondered whose mind was blacker joens to do such a thing or her own to impute such a course to joen it seems i am not a nice person either good there are some white ribbons here should i braid them in yes please the pleasant familiar yank of the plaiting went on swiftly behind istas back if you see any chance of it at all i want you to escape that is your highest duty to me now my courier to carry away the word of all that has happened here though they call you mad for it lord dy cazaril will believe you at all costs get you to him silence behind her say i promise royina she instructed firmly a little mulish hesitation then a whisper i promise royina good liss pulled the last bowknot tight ista rose lady cattilaras white silk slippers did not fit ista but liss knelt and tied on a pair of pretty white sandals that did well enough binding the ribbons around istas ankles liss led the way to the outer chamber opening the door to the gallery for ista to step through lord illvin was leaning against the wall outside arms folded it seemed he had also found half a cup of water to bathe in for though he still reeked more than slightly his hands and freshshaved face were clean of blood and dirt he was dressed in the colors of court mourning in the light fabrics of this northern summer black boots black linen trousers a sleeveless black tunic set off with thin lines of lavender piping a lilac brocade sash with black tassels wrapped about his waist in the hot noon he had dispensed with the weight of the lavender vestcloak though an anxious goram hovered with the garment folded over his arm goram had arranged his masters hair in the pulledback elegant braiding in which ista had first seen it the frosted black queue down the back was tied with a lavender cord illvin straightened as he saw her and gave her a sketch of a courtiers bow truncated she suspected by bloodless dizziness what is this she asked suspiciously what i had not thought you slow of wit dear royina what does it look like you are not going with me he smiled down at her it would reflect exceedingly oddly upon the honor of porifors to send the dowager royina of all chalionibra into captivity without even one attendant thats what i said grumbled liss the command of the fortress has fallen to you ista protested surely you cannot leave it now porifors is a shambles there is little in here left to defend and not enough men left standing to defend it with though i would prefer to conceal that fact from sordso for a while yet the parley for your transfer this morning has bought us hours of precious delay which we could not have purchased with blood so if this is to be poriforss last sortie i claim it by right by the unfortunate logic of the situation in my last bad idea i could not ride along to correct my strategy in midleap but such logic does not prevail here your riding would not have changed the outcome i know disconcerted she studied him do you in some fey mood seek to outdo your brother i never could before i see no need to try now no he took her hand and made little soothing circles on her palm with his thumb in my youth i was apprenticed to my gods order but i missed the whisper of my calling i will not miss that calling twice well i scarcely see how i can when it smacks me on the side of the head and bellows attend in a voice to bring down the rafters i spent the years of my manhood aimlessly though well enough in my brothers service for the lack of a better direction i have a better direction now for an hour perhaps an hour will suffice if it is the right hour arhyss forlorn page padded into the stone court and cried from the foot of the stairs royina they are come for you now at the postern gate i come she called down gently to him she hesitated frowning at illvin will the jokonans even let you go along with me they will be glad enough to have another prisoner of rank at no further cost to themselves it is also the perfect disguise by which i might scout their camp and number their forces how much scouting do you think you can do as a prisoner she squinted at him what are you disguised as his lips twitched a coward dear ista as they believe we betray you in terror to save our property so they will think i have attached myself to you to save my skin i dont think they are going to think any such thing so much the better for my poor reputation then she blinked beginning to feel lightheaded if i fail they will make demon food of you a very banquet for some jokonan officersorcerer maybe sordso himself ah but if you succeed royina have you given thought to what you will do after she looked away uncomfortably from that dark intent gaze after is not my task just as i thought he said in a tone of triumph and you accuse me of being fey i rest my argument shall we go she found her hand disposed upon his arm while she was still trying to decide if she was convinced or just confused he handed her down the stairs as though they advanced together in some procession a wedding or a coronation or a feast day or onto a dance floor in a royas palace the illusion ended soon enough as they picked their way across the charnel wreckage of the star courttwo more horses lay dead and swelling there this morningthrough the shadow of the archway and into the disorder of the entry court a dozen men clustered on the walls in view of whatever jokonan embassy waited without very nearly the whole of the garrison who could stand two short round towers bulged outward on either end of the front wall of the forecourt allowing a covering cross fire upon the outer gate a few more soldiers and a broad familiar figure in unfamiliar clothes waited by the leftward tower that harbored the postern door ista and illvin trailed by goram and liss came to a halt there learned ista favored dy cabon with a nod he had shed his orders distinctive robes not that his filthy whites hadnt been ripe enough to burn by now and was dressed in a hodgepodge of borrowed gear that mostly failed to fit him in any color but white ista noted royina he swallowed before you go i meant to beg your blessing we are well met then before i went i meant to beg yours she stood on tiptoe leaned over his sadly reduced belly and kissed his forehead if the god light passed any message to him it was too subtle even for her inner eye to read he swallowed and placed his hand upon her brow whatever ceremonious benediction hed mustered escaped him as he burst into tears he managed only a choked bastard help us sh sh ista soothed his agitation it is well or as well as might be under the circumstances she studied him narrowly his sleepless hours with the spellsickened with their impossible demands made upon skills he didnt even possess had shaken him badly the bloody rite on the north tower had been even more harrowing his god she thought had sapped and mined his soul very nearly to the point of breakthrough stressing him close to cracking open little though he realized it the gods had either been unusually lucky in driving two such mules down the road to their task at porifors or else had been trying exceptionally hard i wonder if dy gabon is their second sortie five godswas it possible to pray that her burden might pass to him instead the notion shook her and she blinked to clear her vision she had a hideous conviction that the answer was yes yes yes let the responsibility for disaster pass to another not to her not to her again except that dy cabons chances of surviving success let alone failure seemed to her even less than her own she fought back an impulse to fling herself upon him and beg him to take her place no i have paid for this place i am emptied out with the cost of it i will not give it up for any man buck up dy cabon or else take yourself off illvin muttered scowling your weeping is unnerving her dy cabon swallowed again marshaling his selfcontrol sorry sorry i am so sorry that my mistakes brought you here royina i should never have stolen your pilgrimage it was presumption yes well if not you the gods would have just had to send someone else to make the mistakes who might have failed upon the road if you would serve me live to testify your order will need to know all the truth of this one way or another he nodded eagerly then paused as if finding her offer of release harder to digest than hed expected he bowed and stood back brow wrinkled illvin removed his sword and passed it to goram hold this for me till i return no point in handing my fathers blade to sordso for a present unless it be point first goram ducked a nod and tried to look stern but his features just came out looking contorted ista embraced liss who with a glower at dy cabon managed not to cry at her then illvin was handing her through the dark close space under the tower the door opened to the light and a soldier grunted and heaved at something that fell with a muffled thump then turned aside to let the two of them pass the object turned out to be a narrow board which he had thrown across the sharp cleft before the castle wall illvin hesitated and ista wondered if he thought of all the random breakage porifors had suffered in the day past and if this makeshift bridge was likewise vilely ensorcelled but he cast her a quick encouraging smile over his shoulder and stepped briskly across it it bent disturbingly in the center of its span but held ista glanced across at the jokonan embassy drawn up before the gate to accept her surrender some dozen horsemen were assembled mostly soldiers together with three officers ista recognized prince sordso instantly the translatorofficer rode nervously by his side the other officer a heavy leathery bronzeskinned man with graybronze hair was also a sorcererslave ista saw by the ascendant demon light that filled his skin as with sordso a twisting ribbon of light floated from his belly back toward the distant green tents also tethered thus was the one horsewoman or rather a woman who rode pillion roknaristyle behind a servant sitting sideways on a padded chair atop the horses haunches with her feet demurely disposed on a little shelf the sorceress wore courtly trailing garments and a broadbrimmed hat tied below her chin with dark green ribbons she was a much younger woman than joen though neither maidenly nor beautiful she stared intently at ista ista stepped out after illvin keeping her eyes upon his face and not the dark drop below which was deliberately lined at the bottom with sharp rocks and glinting broken glass cattilaras sandals slipped on her sweating feet illvin reached to clasp her hand a hard grip and pulled her to stand upon the dusty ground beyond instantly the board was jerked back scraping through the postern door which was then clapped shut the woman rode closer even as ista looked up to return her glower the demon light within her faded until ista only saw skin and clothing the mere expression of a face not the colors of a soul istas breath caught and she looked again at sordso now he appeared no more than a goldenhaired young man upon a prancing black horse not one of the sorcerers flung up their hands wincing at the glare of istas god light nor did the demons cringe within themshe could not see the demons within them my inner sight is stolen i am blinded something else was missing the pressure of the god upon her back which had borne her forward floating as if in a dream since that bloodstained dawn upon the north tower was gone as well behind her only an empty silence loomed infinitely empty since so infinitely filled just moments before she tried frantically to think when she had last felt the gods hands upon her shoulders she was certain he had been with her in the forecourt when she had spoken with dy cabon she thought he had been with her when shed stepped onto the board across the cleft he was not with me when i stepped off her useless outer eyes blurred with terror and loss she could barely breathe as though her chest was bound tight with heavy cords what have i done wrong who is this asked prince sordso pointing at illvin the bronzeskinned sorcerer pushed his horse up next to the princes and stared down in surprise at illvin who looked back coolly i believe it is ser illvin dy arbanos himself your highnesslord arhyss bastard brother the bane of our borders sordsos blond eyebrows went up the new commander of porifors what does he here ask him where is the other woman he gestured at his translator the officer rode nearer to illvin you dy arbanos the agreement was for the dowager royina and the daughter of the march of oby he said in ibran where is lady cattilara dy lutez illvin favored him with a slight ironic bow his eyes were icy black gone to join her husband when watching last night from the tower she felt him die she flung herself from the parapet and gave her grief to the stones below she lies now waiting to be buried when you withdraw as you agreed and we can again reach our graveyards i come in her place and to serve royina ista as warder and attendant since having seen your armies and their dubious discipline once before the royina did not desire to bring her handmaidens among you the translators brows drew down and not only at the oblique trailing insult he repeated the news to sordso and the others the sorceress nudged her rider to bring her closer is this true she demanded look yourselves for what you really seek then said illvin with a bow in her direction i should think prince sordso could recognize the remnants of his own sister umerue from this distance if she were still well alive is not quite the right term now is it if she were still residing within lady cattilara behind those walls the translator jerked in his saddle though whether in surprise at illvins message or at the tongue in which it was spoken ista was not sure sordso the bronzeskinned officer and the sorceress all turned their heads toward porifors their expressions growing intent and inward nothing breathed sordso after a moment it is gone the sorceress eyed illvin that one knows too much my poor sisterinlaw is dead and the creature you lost is fled beyond your reach said illvin shall we get this over with at a nod from the prince two soldiers dismounted they first took the precaution of checking illvin for concealed blades in his sash and boots he suffered their hands with a look of bored displeasure tension flowed into his long body when one of the soldiers approached ista relaxing only slightly when the man knelt by her white skirts you are to take off your shoes the translator called to her you will walk barefoot and bareheaded into the presence of the august mother as befitting a lesser woman and a quintarian heretic illvins chin went up and his jaw set whatever objections he had been about to voice though he closed his teeth upon it was an interesting subtlety ista thought that they did not also demand illvins boots the disparity only drove home his impotence to protect her the mans hot hands pawed at the ribbons liss had so lately tied around istas ankles she stood rigidly but did not resist he pulled the light sandals away from her feet and threw them aside he stood backed away and remounted his horse sordso rode up to her his eyes searching her from head to foot he smiled grimly at what he sawor possibly at what he didnt see in any case he did not fear to turn his back on her for he gestured her sharply to take position directly behind his horse in the procession forming up illvin tried to offer her his arm but the bronzeskinned officer pulled his sword and pointed with it for him to walk behind her sordsos hand rose and fell in signal and they started off across the dry uneven ground ista was barely conscious of the brassbright noon through which she stumbled she groped inside her mind within an echoing darkness called silent curses to the bastard then silent prayers nothing came back were the jokonan sorcerers doing this defeating a god in the realm of matter surely these opponents could not overwhelm this god not the gods failure then but hers her spirit gates had somehow been shut again broken and tumbled in choked with stones of fear anger or humiliation denying the newdilated passage she had made a mistake some monstrous mistake somewhere in the past few fleeting minutes maybe she had been supposed to give this task to give the god to dy cabon after all maybe keeping it for herself had been the great presumption a huge and fatal presumption overweening arrogance to imagine such a task was given to her who would be stupid enough to give such a task to her the gods twice it was a puzzle how beings so vast could be so vastly mistaken i knew better than to trust them yet here i am again sharp stones bit her feet along the road the procession turned aside toward the grove angling through a low space of dark muck that sucked at the horses hooves and stank of stagnant water and horse piss they scrambled up a slight rise she could hear illvins long footfalls behind her and his quickening breath his uneven puffing revealing more of his debilitation than his face ever would the grove loomed before her its shade a blessed relief from the hammering sun overhead ah not so blessed after all nor any relief they marched up past an aisle of the dead laid quite deliberately along the left side of their route as if made witnesses to this procession were the bodies of the men of porifors killed last night in arhyss sortie all were stripped naked their wounds exposed to feed the iridescent green flies that buzzed about them she glanced up the row of pale forms counted eight eight of the fourteen who had ridden out against fifteen hundreds six must still live somewhere in the jokonan camp then wounded and taken foixs muscular body was not among the still forms pejars was she looked again and recalculated five still live there was a ninth here but not a body more of a pile a spear was driven into the ground behind the shambles with arhyss disfigured head displayed atop the shaft peering out sightlessly over the jokonan camp the onceravishing eyes had been cut out by whatever fearmaddened soldier had sought revenge upon the emptied form too late he was gone before you got there jokonan her bare feet faltered over some root and she gasped in pain illvin striding forward caught her arm before she tripped and fell headlong they bait us look away he instructed through clenched teeth do not faint or vomit he looked ready to do both she thought his countenance was as gray as any of the corpses though his eyes burned like nothing she had ever seen in a mans face its not that she whispered back i have lost the god his brows flickered in consternation and confusion the bronzeskinned officer his sword out gestured them along toward the far edge of the grove though he did not force illvin from her side maybe she too looked as though she were about to faint she thought illvins judgment of baiting to be precise if either of them had still concealed any uncanny poweror any strength at all that display might well have drawn it out of them in some furious futile lashing at their complacent enemies if she had been either a sorceress or a swordsman she swore the prince would not have survived the smirk he had cast over his shoulder as shed stumbled past arhyss remains from a failed saint the jokonans were quite safe it seemed they meant to march catti past that illvin muttered under his breath add it to their tally and five gods grant i may be the one to come collect his eyes didnt stop glancing from tent to tent tracing the path of last nights destruction summing the condition of the men and horses that they passed thin silver tracks slid down his face but his hand scorned to wipe at them under the gaze of the few dozen jeering soldiers crowded up to watch their little parade ista did not know enough vile roknari to translate the insults though illvin no doubt did his dogged mutter continued theyre not preparing to strike camp theyre preparing an assault are we surprised ha one thing showsthey dont know how weak weve grown or theyd be preparing for a romp was he trying to distract his senses from the jokonan desecration of his brothers corpse she prayed the ploy might serve him she tried to extend her own blinded senses for any breath of the god anywhere nothing joen and sordso had placed arhyss head along her path to be a symbol of her failure a hammer blow of despair i wonder if arvol dy lutez felt as bereft as this when his dangling hair touched the water for the second time and yet the symbol turned beneath her enemies feet for the reminder of defeat was also a reminder of triumph a presence in an absence strange the god may be absent but i am still present maybe this is a task for dense matter to do what matter does best persist so she took a breath and kept on walking they arrived before the largest of the green tents one side was rolled up revealing what appeared to be nothing so much as a portable throne room rugs were strewn thickly across the ground a dais ran along the back supporting a pair of carved chairs decorated in gold leaf and a scattering of cushions for lesser haunches the pious dark green of staid and stern maternal widowhood was everywhere overpowering even the seagreen of jokonan arms and never had ista loathed the color more dowager princess joen dressed in a different but equally elaborate layering of stiff gowns from when they hadfive gods was it only this time yesterday that they had met upon the roadsat in the smaller lower of the two chairs her woman attendants knelt upon the cushions and a drab moonfaced young woman who might be another daughter crouched at her feet ista could not tell how many of them were sorceresses a dozen officers stood at painful attention along each side ista wondered if all eleven of joens surviving leashed demons were present for this demonstration twelve foix stood rigidly among the jokonan officers his face was bruised and cut but cleaned and he was dressed anew in jokonan garb and a green tabard with white pelicans flying his expression was dazed his weird smile forced and unnatural ista didnt even need her lost sight to be certain that a glittering new snake floated from the woman on the dais to him and that its fangs were sunk deeply into his belly illvins eyes too passed across foix and his jaw set if possible even more tightly the possibilities for more cruel baiting were endless fortunately perhaps time was not the bronzehaired officer gestured ista forward to the middle of the carpets to the center of this brief set piece of power facing joen illvin was stopped at swords point a few paces back behind istas right shoulder and she was more sorry that she could not see him than that he could see her she wondered what final stamp of humiliation had been prepared for her oh of course not humiliation control the humiliation out there had been to gratify sordsos sortiestung troops the woman in here was more practical ista blinked seeing joen for the first time without inner sight without the vast dark menace of the demon glowering from her belly like some pitchblack pit into which one might fall forever without her demon she was just a little sour aging woman unable to command respect or compel loyalty easy to escape small five gods but she was small all her possibilities shrunken in upon herself her only recourse force stubborn will without scope of mind istas mother had once filled her household with her authority from wall to wall the provincaras husband had ruled baocia but within his own castle even he had lived on her sufferance istas eldest brother upon inheriting his fathers seat had found it easier to move his capital to escape the permanent childhood that awaited him in his mothers house than to attempt to claim rule there yet even at her direst the old provincara had known her limits and had chosen no space larger than what she could fill joen it seemed to ista was trying to fill jokona with her authority as a woman filled a household and by the same techniques and no one could stretch herself that far in an unbounded world of infinite space one might move at will but perforce must leave room for the wills of others not even the gods controlled it all men enslaved each others bodies but the silent will of the soul was sacred and inviolable to the gods if anything was joen was seizing her slaves from the inside out what joen did to her enemies might be named war what she did to her own people was sacrilege prince sordso took his high seat flinging himself into the chair with a habit of body not yet eradicated by his new demonic discipline he grimaced around the chamber his mothers gaze fell on him and he sat up straight attentive istas eye was drawn again to the moonfaced princess at joens feet the girl seemed to be about fourteen but stunted for her age with the stubby fingers and odd eyes of one of those latelife children born sadly lackwitted and who often did not live long she was one princess who would not escape her mothers household via marriage to some distant country joens hand fell upon her head although not in a caress and it came to ista shes using the girl for a demon repository her own disdained daughters soul is made a stall for it the demon that she intends next to set in me joen stood up facing ista in heavily accented ibran she said welcome to my gates ista dy chalion i am the mother of jokona her hand lifted from the girls head flicked out fingers spreading within ista the god unfolded her second sight burst anew upon istas mind like a dazzling lightning stroke brilliant beyond hope revealing an eerie landscape she saw it all at one glance the dozen demons the swirling crackling lines of power the agonized souls joens dark dense writhing passenger the thirteenth demon spinning wildly through the air toward her trailing its evil umbilicus ista opened her jaws in a fierce grin and took it in a gulp welcome to mine joen of jokona said ista i am the mouth of hell chapter twentysix a wave of light passed along the deep violet cord between joen and ista and its color and brilliance seemed to intensify was joens first shocked impulse to strengthen her line for a dizzy instant ista wondered who was the fisherwoman and who the fish then she felt the struggling panicked young demon pass firmly into the bastards hands within her you have hooked a god joen now what shall you do it was as though a galley had thrown a grappling hook onto a continent thinking to tow it away she bears the demongod joen screamed kill her now yes that would do yet even as joen cried out time seemed to stretch in istas perceptions like cold honey spinning off a spoon on a winter morning she did not think it would stretch indefinitely where should i begin ista asked the presence within her begin at the center it replied the rest will follow perforce she opened her material hands and let her spirit hands flow out along the violet cable enter joens body through that channel wrap the dark mass and pull it out toward her it came resisting surging and spitting streaming corrosive violet shadows like water spilling it burned her spirit hands like vitriol and she gasped with the unexpected pain which seemed to strike down into the center of her being and pulse back out to every extremity the way the shock of a great wound reverberated in a body the creature was very dense and ugly and large and old centuries old rotten with time it is hideous yes said the god go on anyway finish arhyss ride istas material hands were too sluggish to keep up with her streaming will with her spirit hands alone she combed back the strands of joens soul tangled with the demon yet as fast as she did so joen flung out tendrils of cold white fire to wrap the demon round again and pull it back the demon shrieked let go ista urged let it go and turn to some better task even now you have a choice no joens mind returned it is my gift my great chance no one shall wrest it from me least of all you you were so feckless you couldnt even keep your own son alive mine shall have his place i have promised it ista flinched but the presence sustained her if she will not stay she must come it said continue your wrongful attempts to impose order create yet vaster destruction said ista to joen you torment and demolish the very souls you most desire to make grow and love you you possess truer gifts stunted though they have been let go find them instead and live the whipping white fire was a visible scream of denial in it ista could discern not the faintest whisper of assent so ista brought the great violetblack demon to her lips and pulled it inward it seemed to stretch and distort in its passage its screeching becoming pain in her mouth fire in her gullet there are souls inside it she realized many pieces of old souls all digested and smeared together souls of the dead and the long dead what is to be done about them the dead belong to us sorting them is beyond your calling the souls of the yet living torn apart untimely while still trapped in the realm of matter those are your care on our behalf and this ista asked joens live white soulfire tangled with the demon was passing into her now it clawed and burned comes out of your hands and into mine this is not the quiet damnation of sundering indeed the white fire seemed to howl splitting istas ears from within neither is this heavens healing no said the voice regretfully this is willnot so it shall pass with its demon to the place of benot ista had a vision of a strange dimensionless void the picture leaked perhaps from his mind to hers a roiling pool of demon energy without form without personas without minds or wills or song or speech or memories or any gift of higher orderthe bastards hell reservoir of pure destruction spilling from that pool into the world of matter a thin controlled flow returning to it an erratic stream balancing the life of the world exactly midway between the hot death that is chaos and the chill death that is stasis she realized at last why the concatenation of joens demons had made her edgy on a level separate from their direct threat to porifors was it possible that such a vortex of disorder might create its own rip between the two realms one that even the gods might be hardpressed to mend again so much divine attention in one small place some human attention now would gratify me greatly the voice murmured it did not ista noticed either confirm or deny her guess bring me in the rest of my little brethren sweet ista as swiftly as you may it will no doubt take practice before it comes easily so therefore my first trial is a dozen at once the pain flaring in her stomach felt as though she had been forced to swallow molten lead along with that sickening twisted thing well said the voice affably there is this if you survive this no other demon astray in the realm of matter should pose too onerous a challenge to you hereafter ista considered a wealth of objections starting with what do you mean if but abandoned the impulse starting an argument with this presence was likely to do nothing but spin her in endless circles till she was dizzy and make him laugh you will not abandon me again she asked suspiciously i did not abandon you before nor you me as i have marked persistent ista she turned her second sight outward again trying to see the god with it had been as futile as trying to see the back of her own head joens mouth was open her eyes rolling back her body slumping somewhere under istas breastbone the first burst of pain was diminishing as the god drew the ancient demon and its clawing mistress back into his realm following after it but now running to her and not to joen a dozen tangled writhing cords of light jerked and yanked as the demons fettered upon them tried to flee the feared presence of their god the human bodies in which they were lodged were only just beginning to move under their riders frantic lashings one at a time or all together ista reached out with her spirit hands and plucked one cord at random and slid her lightpalms along it to the demon within one of joens attendant women this one was well cultivated with parts of three or four different souls whirling within it the white soulfire of the living host was more readily discernible and she combed it back toward the woman imperfectly ista swallowed the demon the womans back arched and she began to collapse the demon passed through into the gods hands more easily this time almost immediately these cords i recognize them i pulled arhys safe to shore last night with something very like one they were stolen from us long ago the demon could not have created them you know the voice was edged with wrath though only the faintest reflection of it glimmered through to ista else she would have been crushed flat ista reached for another cord repeating the gesture of plucking and combing it was a man one of the officers his mouth opened on a beginning scream im not getting it all sorted she worried im not getting it right you are brilliant the voice reassured her it is imperfect so are all things trapped in time you are brilliant nonetheless how fortunate for us that we thirst for glorious souls rather than faultless ones or we should be parched indeed and most lonely in our perfect righteousness carry on imperfectly shining ista another then and another the demons flowed to her through her faster but it was an undeniably sloppy process the next demon was sordsos and it was the most complex construct ista had yet encountered layer upon layer of souls and their talents were interpenetrated with the young mans agonized constricted soulfire it was a weirdly loving fabrication ista thought she perceived bits of soldiers scholars judges swordsmen and ascetics all the golden generals public virtues collected and concentrated the purified pattern of perfect manliness it was horrifying how could something made of souls be so coldly soulless no poets though none at all this dark piece of soul here is different she realized as one fragment began to flow through her fingers yes said the god the man still lives in the realm of matter where is it should i attempt to yes if you think you can endure it it will be uncomfortable ista rolled up the patch of darkness and bundled it aside in her mind it pulsed there hot and thick somewhere off the edge of her material vision the bronzeskinned jokonan officer was lifting his sword beginning to turn a motion in black was illvin beginning to move withno afterhim ista ignored it all and kept on combing sordsos mouth was opening on a wordless howl but not she thought of a man bereaved by his dispossession it might be rage it might be triumph it might be madness then the next cord then the last she glanced upward with both material and inner sight at the ashen foix in his green tabard standing among the startled jokonan officers the violet shadow within him was no longer bearshaped but distributed unevenly throughout his body it seemed both to cringe from her and stare in fascination she considered the final cord in her spirit hand lifted it to her lips bit it through good said the voice oh should i have asked you are my doorward in the realm of matter a lords appointed porter does not run to him to ask if each beggar whether in rags or silks should be admitted or turned away else he might as well stand at his gates himself the porter is expected to use his judgment my judgment she let the end of the cord go it snapped back into foix and he was free or whatever foix was now was free foixs face flickered his lips parted firmed then after a bare second stretched again in that horrible strained smile of perfect assent false falseness treachery turning in air he is much less simple than he looks ista was barely aware of the cries and turmoil erupting throughout the tent the voices grew faint and far off diminishing the figures dimmer and dimmer she turned to follow the entrancing voice she seemed to come to the door of herself and look through an overwhelming impression of color and beauty pattern and complexity music and song all endlessly elaborated bewildered her senses she wondered how confusing the world looked to a newborn infant who had neither names for what she saw nor even the concept of names the child began ista supposed with her mothers face and breast and from there worked outwardand in a lifetime could not come to the end of it all this is a world greater and stranger than the one of matter that gave my soul birth and even the world of matter was beyond my comprehension how now shall i begin well ista said the voice do you stay or go you cannot hang forever in my doorway like a cat you know i have not words for this i would see your face abruptly she was standing in an airy room very like a chamber in porifors she quickly glanced down and was relieved to discover she was granted not only a body healed and light and free of pain but clothes as wellmuch as she had been wearing but cleansed of stains and mended of rips she looked up and rocked back this time he wore illvins body and face it was a healthy fullfleshed version if still tall and lean his courtiers garb was silver embroidered on white his baldric silk his sword hilt and signet ring gleaming his hair pulled back in roknari braids and a long thick queue was pure white the infinite depths of his eyes destroyed the illusion of humanity though even as their darkness recalled the man i should have liked she admitted faintly to see what illvin looked like with white hair then you will have to go back and wait a while the bastard replied his voice was scarcely deeper or richer than the originals it even adopted those northern cadences you would take your chances of course by the time all his hair is white will there be any left his body and face shifted through a hundred possible illvins at a hundred possible ages straight or bent thin or fat bald or not the laughter on his lips remained the same though i desire this it was unclear even to ista if her hand gesture indicated the god or the man may i come in his smile softened the choice is yours my ista as you do not deny me i will not deny you yet i would still await you if you chose the long way home i might become lost upon the road she looked away a great calm filled her no pain no terror no regret their immense absences seemed to leave room for something something new something never dreamed of before if this was what arhys had experienced it was no wonder hed never looked back so this is my death why did i ever fear it speaking as an expert you never seemed to me to fear it all that much he said dryly she looked back there may be more to paradise than the cessation of pain but oh it seems almost paradise enough might a next time hurt he shrugged once you return to the realm of matter the protection i can offer you is limited and its bounds alas do not exclude pain this death is for you to choose the next may not be her lips curved up despite themselves are you saying i might find myself back at this same gate in another quarter of an hour he sighed i do hope not i should have to train another porter i quite fancied a royina for a time the eyes glittered so does my greatsouled illvin hes prayed to me for you after all consider my reputation ista considered his reputation its dreadful she observed he merely grinned that familiar stolen heartstopping flash of teeth what training she added feeling suddenly cantankerous you never explained anything instructing you sweet ista would be like teaching a falcon to walk up to its prey it might with great effort be done but one would end with a very footsore and cranky bird and a tedious wait for dinner with a wingspan like yours its ever so much easier just to shake you from my wrist and let you fly plummet ista growled no not you granted you tumble and complain halfway down the abyss but eventually you do spread your wings and soar not always her voice went lower not the first time he tilted his head in a sliver of acknowledgment but i was not your falconer then we do suit you know she glanced away and around the strange perfect unreal room antechamber she thought boundary between the inside and the outside but which door was which my task is it done done and welldone my true foster laggard child i have come very late to everything to forgiveness to love to my god even to my own life but she bowed her head in relief done was good it meant one could stop did the jokonans slay me as joen ordered no not yet smiling he stepped up to her and tilted her chin up he lowered his mouth to hers as boldly as illvin had that afternoonyesterdayon the tower except that his mouth tasted not of horsemeat but of perfume and there was no uncertainty in his eyes his eyes the world her perceptions began to flicker infinite depths became dark eyes reddened with frenzied weeping perfume became parched salt flesh then fragrance then flesh sweet silence became noise and cries and then silence and then din again painless floating turned to a crushing pressure headache thirst which melted in turn to bliss i think he takes his foot to his cat and pushes her to decision she had no doubt she might yet dodge around that boot in either direction but just what direction he desired was plain the unsettling not yet did at least suggest he did not guide her back toward a body pierced with sword thrusts the bastard maneuvers me into this blast him it felt very comfortable cursing her god he was a god she might always curse and the more inventive the invective the more he would grin well suited indeed to true ista the flickering slowed stopped on parched mouth weight and pressure din and pain on dear distraught blinking merely human eyes yes and furthermore my god cheats he set out this bowl of cream before ever he held the door and he knew it well she smiled and tried to inhale illvin pulled his frantically questing tongue from her mouth and gasped she lives oh five gods she breathes again the crushing pressure ista discovered was illvins arms wrapped around her torso she stared up into tree branches blue sky and his face bent over hers his face was flushed with heat and furrowed with terror and a thin spattering of blood droplets marked it in an angled track from side to side she raised a weak hand and dabbed at the red beads and was relieved to find they did not appear to be his she whispered through dry bruised lips what has happened that is what i prayed you might tell me said foixs hoarse voice she looked up to see him looming over them he still wore his jokonan mail and tabard and stood in a convincingly menacing guard stance above his apparent prisoners she and illvin were seated on the ground not far from the green command tents foixs eyes were whiterimmed but it seemed not to be the surrounding jokonans that disquieted him you were marched into the tent foix continued in a lower tone you looked ordinary helpless then suddenly the god light blazed from you so brightly i was blinded for a breath i heard joen cry for your death upon her arm illvins tight clutch tightened further when i could see again continued foix gazing away in guardpretense all the demons in the tent seemed to be rushing into you like hot metal being drawn through a form i saw you swallow them all down joens soul as well it was all over in an instant save one murmured ista eh ur yes there was that i felt when you freed me from joens geas i almost bolted from the tent then but i got my wits back just in time prince sordso and some other officers were drawing their swordsfive gods but the scraping seemed to go on forever sordsos knuckles were white i tried to get between them and you illvin said huskily to ista he rubbed at his nose and blinked yes said foix barehanded i saw you lungea lot of good that was going to do but instead sordso whirled around and hacked at joen she was already dead by then murmured ista i saw she was starting to topple but his edge caught her just in time or something he struck so hard he spun around and fell backward off the dais half the freed sorcerers were running away but i swear half the rest had the same idea sordso did there was one of joens women had a dagger out and was going at the body even as it fell im not sure she knew or cared that it was deadshe just wanted to get in her stroke everyone was jostling and yelling and starting in every direction so i jumped in front of illvin and you and shouted back prisoners and brandished my sword cursed convincingly muttered illvin i just about tried to leap on you except that i had my hands full you fell royina you just turned gray and stopped breathing and crumpled up i thought you had died for your soul was gone from my sight like a lantern blown out illvin tried to lift you up fell down then scrambled up againi dared not helpi let him drag you out pretending to stand guard over him most of the jokonans thought you were dead too i think slain in your sorcery some kind of death magic like fonsa and the golden general all over again so um lie still for a minute there till we think what to do next it was not a difficult suggestion to follow following any other instruction now that would have been hard illvin was staring down into her face looking like a man whose kisses had just brought his beloved back from the dead and was now too terrified to move least he shed unexpected miracles in all directions ista smiled up muzzily at his delicious confusion the demons are all gone she reported in a vague dreamy voice in case they still harbored doubts it was what i was sent to do and i did it but the bastard let me come back to where she was now it occurred to hersitting on the hard ground in the midst of an enemy camp surrounded by several hundred very live and agitated jokonans vile sense of humor hers had been a timeless interlude but for everyone else she realized bare minutes had passed since joens sanguinary end but however dismasted their high command not all of the enemy officers were going to stay confused for long it was hard to summon fear of anything in her lingering bliss but she managed a flash of mild prudence i think we should leave now right now can you walk asked illvin uncertainly can you she asked curious crawling now she would believe crawling of him in his present interestingly debilitated state he should be in bed she decided hers by preference no muttered foix got to drag her again or carry her can you go on pretending to be a corpse for a little longer royina oh yes she assured him and sank back gratefully into illvins grip illvin flatly refused to drag her on the grounds that it would scrape her alreadybleeding legs and feet further but carrying her in his arms proved still beyond his strength a short argument in which ista as a corpse declined to participate resulted in foix helping illvin rise to his shaking legs with her buttupward over his shoulder her arms and legs dangling down in an appropriately lifeless manner it reminded her of the ride on feather she tried not to smile in memory on the grounds that it would be out of character for her part her white gown was even splashed with blood a continuation she suspected of the same spray that had crossed illvins face she could guess its source and shuddered they staggered away turn left foix directed keep walking more jokonan soldiers ran up to them foix pointed backward with his sword toward the command tents and cried hurry you are needed the soldiers sped away as their apparentofficer directed illvin muttered through his teeth foix you may speak a glib camp roknari but i beg you will leave sentences of more than one syllable to me that tabard cant cover everything gladly foix returned under his breath go right here were almost to the horse lines do you think theyre just going to let us walk up and steal horses asked illvin his wheeze sounded more curious than objecting ista peered upside down through slitted eyes to take in the guards loitering in the shade some of the men were standing and staring toward the uproar around the green tents yes foix tapped his green tabard im a jokonan officer youre relying on more than that observed ista her tone almost as detached as illvins yes why are you so certain they will not stop and question us asked illvin a hint of nervousness entering his voice as a few heads turned to follow their progress did you stop and question princess umerue no not at first what has that to do with anything ista mumbled from illvins hip i spoke imprecisely before there is one sorcerer left in this camp hes on our side however seemed a good idea the god did not object illvin tensed turning to stare presumably at foix two left said foix or a sorcerer and a sorceress if that is your proper classification royina i am not sure neither am i well have to ask dy cabon she returned agreeably right said foix dont do anything that looks too exciting though id rather not attempt anything gaudier and there are limits to mild misdirection indeed murmured illvin they trod on for a few more steps well said foix stopping before the lines have you a preference horsemaster anything already saddled and bridled one choice was made for them at the end of the line a tall ugly chestnut stallion suddenly lifted its head and nickered in excitement it began shifting its haunches from side to side disturbing the horses tied nottooclosely to it ears pricked it practically danced as they neared and raised and lowered its head snorting bastards eyes royina can you shut that stupid monster up foix muttered men are starting to stare me its you it wants set me down then illvin did so letting her slide through his arms to her feet gazing into her face with a searching look that was for an instant as good as a kiss and holding her upright on his arm she was very glad for the arm she approached the possessed animal who lowered its head again and laid its face flat to her bloody bodice in what might be submission love or dementia she looked it over in fascination it still wore the bridle with the deep curb bit a dozen cuts scored its body but they were already starting to heal with unnatural speed yes yes she murmured soothingly its all right where he went you could not follow you did what you could its all right now she tried to shake off her dreamy lassitude saying to illvin i believe i had better ride this one if you dont want it following after us whinnying its heart out she stood on tiptoe and glanced along the serrated ridge of its backbone find a saddle though she added foix filched a saddle from a pile farther down the line and illvin tightened the girths while foix picked out two more horses what is he called she asked illvin as he cupped his hands to give her a leg up it seemed a very long way to the ground typical of his mounts she disposed her skirts awkwardly in the military saddle and let illvins warm hands guide her ankles to the stirrups his fingers lingered unhappily over the bruises and cuts on her feet illvin cleared his throat id really rather not say its um crude he was never a ladys mount actually he was never any sane persons mount oh you rode him she patted the snaky neck the horse turned its head around and nuzzled her bare foot well if he is to be a ladys mount from now on hed probably better have another name then demon will do illvin cocked his brows up at her and a little grin flashed across his tense mouth nicely he turned to take his own horse in hand hesitating briefly in order to gather his strength before swinging himself up into the saddle he settled himself with a betraying grunt of exhaustion by mutual unspoken assent they started off across the bordering field together at a staid walk somewhere back in the grove something had caught fire ista could hear the muted roar of flames and mens cries for water how much pentup chaos both natural and unnatural had been released upon the jokonans by joens death she did not look back turn left illvin told foix dont we want to circle out of sight over that rise to the north eventually theres a gully along here that will hide us sooner go slowly though its likely to be patrolled thats where id put men anyway the counterfeit calm held the sharpening noise of the camp fell behind them and the empty countryside began to feign the air of some other quiet drowsy over warm afternoon one not given over to war sorcery gods and madness at the earliest chance ista told illvin you must bring goram to me whatever you desire royina illvin looked over the ground they traversed turning in his saddle shall we attempt to circle back to porifors asked foix following his gaze back over the treetops to the distant stone pile a curl of dirty smoke still rose from somewhere in it i think i might be able to get us in under cover of darkness no if we clear the gully i am going to try to win through to the march of oby i do not know if the royina can ride that far said foix clearly picturing not just ista but the pair of them falling from their saddles at any moment or do you think to meet him on the road he wont be on the road if hes where i suspect weve less than ten miles to cover and if hes not there yet his scouts will be along soon they dropped into the gully where they found illvins predicted jokonan patrol almost immediately between the unexpected direction of their passage foixs officers garb and witfogging sorcery their horses jokonan gear and illvins crisp arrogant court roknari they soon left the pickets bowing and scraping in their wake illvin returned the hapless soldiers the fourfold quadrene sign touching his thumb to his tongue in secret apology to the fifth god as soon as they turned again out of sight they pressed their horses to a faster pace illvin led them onward finding what cover the country afforded in low places little watercourses spinneys and groves angling ever north and east they had gone some four or five miles before they even stopped to water themselves and the horses though multiple columns of smoke still smudged the clear blue air behind them porifors had disappeared from sight beyond some low rolling ridges can you still feel your bear ista asked foix when hed finished dipping his head in the stream he sat back on his haunches and frowned not quite as i did before joen did something to us i hope it was not vile it is my impression said ista carefully that you two have been pressed together by all these events more quickly than you would have grown on your own without either of you becoming ascendant or enslaved you have merged because i think your demon did not steal your soul nor did you plunder its power you both shared freely foix looked embarrassed always did enjoy feeding the animals drawing you apart is beyond my present skillsor your present need you have achieved a curious theological state but not i suspect a unique one i have occasionally wondered where temple sorcerers came from now i know i expect it was one of the saint of raumas tasks to judge who might carry this power without succumbing to it you will need to take training from the bastards order probably i am sure your own order will spare you if i request it foixs face screwed up me a bastards acolyte dont think my father will be best pleased or my mother i can just see her explaining it to her lady friends ouch he grinned despite himself cant wait to see the look on ferdas face though he glanced shrewdly at her and will you take training too royina she smiled tutors foix a woman of my rank can demand tutors to wait on me at my convenience i think my convenience will be very soon and possibly not too convenient to them the reminder of ferda and the hope of finding news of his brother overcame foixs initial urge to coddle ista and it was he who marshaled the horses and boosted his companions back aboard roll up that tabard and stuff it in a saddlebag illvin advised settling into his saddle bastard willing the next scouts we encounter may well be dy obys baby temple sorcerer or no a mistaken crossbow bolt would not be good for your health ah yes said foix and hastened to do so illvin eyed his red stallion carrying ista with such exquisite care that she might hold a cup of water without spilling it and shook his head in wonder as if of all the marvels he had lately witnessed this was the most inexplicable can you endure he asked her its not much farther now after walking that mile riding a few more is nothing she assured him i feared the god had abandoned me but it seems hed only hid himself within and left me to carry him it was one of the bastards little jokes she decided that he had appeared to her before then as such an enormous man had he known even she who had now met three facetoface could not guess the limits of the gods foreknowledge all dark you were foix said makes sense the jokonan sorcerers would hardly have towed you into joens presence looking like some holy fire ship they werent that stupid but when you lit up he fell silent foix was not ista thought an inarticulate man but she began to see why lord dy cazaril said only poetry could come to grips with the gods foix finally managed i have never seen anything like it im glad that i did but if i never see anything like it again that will be all right i could not see it said illvin in a tone of deep regret but i could see when things begin to happen well enough i am glad you were there said ista i did little enough he sighed you bore witness that means the world to me and there was that kiss it did not seem such a small thing he blushed my apologies royina i was distraught i thought to draw you back from death as you once seemed to do for me illvin yes royina you did draw me back oh he rode along very quietly for a time but a strange smile crept across his face and would not go away again at length he looked up and rose in his stirrups summoning some unimaginable reserve of energy hah he whispered ista followed his glance it took her a moment to discern the faint clear smokes of careful fires marking a camp concealed in the watercourse that opened below them the fires were not few they followed the ridge around a slight bend and yet more of the camp came into view hundreds of men and horses more than hundredsshe could not count their numbers halfhidden as they were oby said illvin in satisfaction he made excellent time though i thank the gods he was no faster good breathed ista in relief im done indeed and we do thank you for your work without which we would all be dead in some hideous and uncanny fashion by now i on the other hand still have fifteen hundred ordinary jokonans to remove from around porifors i dont know if oby meant to wait for dawn but if we struck more quickly his eyes glazed over in a familiar fashion alternating shrewd glances summing the men below with staring off at nothing ista forbore to interrupt a patrol galloped up to them ser dy arbanos cried its astonished officer waving wildly at illvin five gods youre alive the riders formed around them in excited escort and swept them into the part of the camp marked by tents in the shade where their commanders had no doubt set up their headquarters a voice rang from the trees and a familiar form shot from the green shadows foix foix the daughter be thanked ferda ran toward them foix swung from his saddle to embrace his eager brother what are these men illvin inquired of dy obys officer nodding toward an unfamiliar company of horsemen in black and green the riders opened out to reveal a crowd of people approaching on foot some running some lumbering some proceeding more slowly and decorously all calling out to ista ista stared torn between joy and dismay bastard spare me it is my brother dy baocia she said in a stunned voice and dy ferrej and lady dy hueltar and divine tovia and all chapter twentyseven lord dy baocia and ser dy ferrej led the rush to istas side the red stallion laid his ears back squealed and snapped his teeth and both men recoiled several feet five gods ista dy baocia cried temporarily diverted that horse who was mad enough to put you up on such a beast ista patted demons neck he suits me very well he belongs to lord illvin in part but i suspect he may become a permanent loan from both his masters it seems murmured illvin he glanced across the camp royinaistalove i must report first to march dy oby his expression grew grim his daughter is still trapped in castle porifors if the walls hold as i pray along with liss and dy cabon ista reflected and added her silent prayers to his she felt the walls yet held but in truth her only certainty was that goram still lived and shed been mistaken before with the news we bring illvin continued i expect his troop will ride within the hour i cringe to think what rumors have come to him by now of my brothers fate there is much to do five gods speed you of your many burdens i am one the less now these people here will cosset me to distraction if i know them she added sternly you spare some care for yourself too dont make me come after you again a grin ghosted across his mouth would you follow me to the bastards hell dear sorceress without hesitation now that i know the road he leaned across his saddlebow and caught her hand and raised it to his lips she gripped his hand in turn and bore it to her own lips and nipped his knuckle secretly which made his eyes glint with reluctance they released each other foix illvin called attend upon me your testimony is urgently required dy baocia turned eagerly to foix do i have you to thank young man for the rescue of my sister no provincar said foix giving him a polite salute she rescued me dy baocia and dy ferrej stared at him rather blankly ista became conscious of the bizarre picture they must present foix gray with exhaustion wearing jokonan gear illvin a holloweyed reeking scarecrow in the most elegant of court mourning herself in rumpled white festival dress splashed with brown blood barefoot bruised and scratched her escaping hair completing the impression of general dementia look after the royina foix said to ferda then come to obys tent we have strange and great tales to tell he clapped his brother on the shoulder and turned to follow illvin temporarily unmenaced by istas erratic steed ferda came to demons shoulder to help her down ista was dizzy with fatigue but she stayed determinedly upright see that this dreadful horse is well cared for he bore lord arhys faithfully last night your brother rode in that great sortie as well and endured capture and grievous use he needs rest if you can make him take it in this uproar we have all of us been up since dawn yesterday through flight and siege and and worse lord illvin lost a great deal of blood last night make sure he gets drink and food immediately at the least she added after a thoughtful pause and if he attempts to ride into battle in his present state knock him down and sit on him although i trust he has more sense as soon as her horse was led out of range by a soldier of oby dy ferrej pounced on ista practically wresting her from ferda royina we have been in terror for your safety and not without cause in truth well i am safe now soothingly she patted his hand gripping her arm lady dy hueltar tottered up arm in arm with divine tovia ista ista lovie dy baocia was looking intently after illvin now that you are all delivered to each other i think id better attend on dy oby as well he managed a distracted smile at ista yes yes good did you bring troops of your own brother ista asked yes five hundred of horse all that i could muster in a hurry when these people descended upon me waving your alarming letter then by all means attend upon oby your guard may well have a chance to earn the coin you pay them chalion owes the garrison of castle porifors much but certainly relief above all and that as soon as may be ah he collected ferda and dy ferrej and hurried off after the other men half in curiosity half ista suspected in eagerness to escape his importunate entourage the problem of explaining her own adventures to them without sounding like a raving madwoman she discovered could be put off possibly indefinitelyby asking after their own journey a mere query of how did you come here so timely induced an answer that ran on until they reached dy baocias tents and longer the five hundred of horse ista found had been trailed by what seemed a hundred more servants grooms and maids in support of the dozen ladies from the courts of both valenda and taryoon who had accompanied lady dy hueltar on her selfappointed mission to bring ista home dy ferrej more or less in charge of shifting them all was justly punished ista decided that he had moved them such a distance in a week instead of a month was a near miracle in itself and her respect for him never low rose another notch ista cut though a plethora of plans by requesting a wash food and bed in that order divine tovia always more practical than most of istas attendants and with an eye to the blood on her gown backed her up the elderly physician managed to run off all but two maids her own acolyteassistant and lady dy hueltar from the tent where she guided ista for a bath and treatment ista had to admit it was both comfortable and comforting to have those familiar hands about her applying salve and bandages to her hurts tovias curved sewing needle too was very fine and sharp and her hands were quick about the wincing task of mending flesh where it was required what in the world are these bruises divine tovia inquired ista craned to see the back of her own thigh where the physician was pointing five dark purple spots were spaced around it her lips curved up and she twisted about to spread her own fingers between them five gods ista cried lady dy hueltar in horror who has dared to handle you so those are from yesterday when lord illvin rescued me from the jokonan column on the road what excellent long fingers he does have i wonder if he plays any musical instruments i shall have to find out is lord illvin that odd tall fellow who rode in with you asked lady dy hueltar suspiciously i must say i did not like the very forward way he kissed your hand no well he was pressed for time i shall make him practice later until his technique improves lady dy hueltar looked offended but divine tovia at least snorted a little ista was laid down in a tent under a guard of ladies but rose again to peek out despite her nightgown at the sound of many horses thundering out of the camp it was only late afternoon on this long summer day obys cavalry would be descending on porifors with hours of light still left for their work the timing ista thought was excellent maximum confusion disorder and dismay would have spread through the jokonan forces from the dire events of noon and the chances that competent leadership had yet reemergedespecially from the habits of sullen mindless obedience extracted by joenwere slight she let herself be coaxed back to bed by those who loved her though the ista they thought they loved she supposed was an imaginary one a woman who existed only in their own minds part icon part habit the reflection did not depress her unduly now that she knew someone who loved the ista who was real she fell asleep thinking of him ista awoke from ugly dreams not she thought entirely her own to the sound of female voices arguing lady ista wants to sleep after her ordeal said lady dy hueltar firmly i will not have her troubled further no said liss in a puzzled tone the royina will want the report from porifors we started before dawn to bring it to her as swiftly as we could ista lumbered up from her sheets liss she cried in here it appeared she had slept the short summer night through it sufficed now see what youve done said lady dy hueltar in aggravation what lisss bafflement was genuine she had not istas years of training in deciphering her nowsenior ladyinwaitings oblique locutions ista translated it handily as i didnt want to travel again today and now ill have to drat you girl a leap from her cot ista discovered wasnt going to occur she did manage to lever herself painfully to her feet before the tent flap was thrown back admitting a level golden light and a grinning liss ista embraced her she embraced ista back the grin and lisss presence seemed almost all the report she needed porifors is relieved there were no more devastating deaths last night the rest might be learned in order or no order as it came sit said ista not releasing lisss hands tell me everything lady ista needs to be dressed before receiving petitioners said lady dy hueltar sternly excellent notion said ista do go and find me some clothing to wear riding dress oh ista you wont be riding anywhere today after all youve been through you need to rest actually liss put in march dy oby has sent some officers to see the camp is broken down and shifted to porifors as quick as may be ferda is waiting with some of your brothers men to guard you on the way royina as soon as you are ready unless you prefer to ride in a cart with the baggage train she will surely want to ride in the wagons with us said lady dy hueltar tempting ista lied but no ill ride my horse lady dy hueltar sniffed balefully and withdrew ista continued eagerly to liss oh you will laugh at my new horse it has come to me as the spoils of war i think though i may persuade illvin to make it a court gift which would amuse him its illvins vile red stallion the one that possessed the stray elemental yes it has conceived a sudden adoration for me and abases itself in the most appalling unhorselike fashion you will find it quite reformed or if you dont let me know and ill put the fear of its god in it again but say on dear liss well the castle and town are secured and the jokonans driven off or takenmost of them fled north but there may be some stragglers still lurking or just plain lost said ista dryly it wouldnt be the first time liss snickered we have captured prince sordso and his whole retinue which has pleased lord illvin and march dy oby no end they say the prince has gone mad is it true you ensorcelled him to hack up the dowager princess no said ista all i did was remove the sorcery that was preventing him from doing so i rather think it was a wild impulse on his part soon regretted joen was dead before his sword struck her the bastard took her soul i wonder if it would be a relief or a regret to sordso to know that i should probably tell him in any case go on what of lady cattilara and our stalwart divine well we all watched from the walls as the jokonans marched you off and then it got all quiet for a little and then we could hear some terrible uproar at the those big green tents but we could not make out what was happening lady cattilara surprised us all after you and lord illvin were made hostage or so we all thought she rose from her bed she drove her ladies to defend the walls since almost all of the men were too sick to stand by thenit seems they make a game of archery here and the jokonan sorcerers spells had not destroyed their sporting bows some of the ladies proved quite good shots they had not the power to penetrate mail but i saw lady catti herself put an arrow right through a rude jokonan officers eye learned dy cabon stood with hershe swore that porifors would not fall while she was still its chatelaine me i threw rocksif you fling one from a high enough tower it hits quite hard by the time it lands on its target even if you dont have a strong throwing arm we could see the jokonans were just probing but we bit them till they bled nonetheless i think we could not have held for long against a determined assault but we discouraged them from attempting the walls at onceand then it was too late for the march of obys forces struck and swept them away lady catti was quite splendid when she opened the gates to her father i thought she would break down and weep when he embraced her for he did but instead she was very stern what of goram he helped hold the walls with us he was exhausted and feverish this morning which is why lord illvin did not dispatch him to you he told me to tell you since if you are riding to porifors this morning it made no sense to send goram twice ten miles to meet you at almost the same time anyway excellent thinking yes i will ride at once she looked around lady dy hueltar was bustling back into the tent leading a maid carrying an armload of clothing ah good istas satisfaction died as she saw the dress the maid was shaking out for her a fine layered silk suitable for a court function in widows dark green this is not riding dress of course not dear ista said lady dy hueltar it is for you to wear to breakfast with us all i shall take a cup of tea and a bite of bread if such may be had in this camp and ride at once oh no said lady dy hueltar in a tone of earnest correction the meal is being prepared we are all so looking forward to celebrating having you with us again just as it should be the feast would take two hours ista estimated maybe three one mouth the less will not be missed you all must eat anyway before you break camp it will not be wasted now lady ista do have sense istas voice dropped i ride if you will not bring me the clothing i asked for i will send liss through the camp to beg me some and if none is to be had ill ride in my nightgown or naked if i must id share my clothes with you royina liss offered at once clearly bemused by that last image i know you would liss ista patted her shoulder lady dy hueltar drew herself up in offense or possibly defense lady ista you mustnt be so wild her voice grew hushed you wouldnt want people thinking you had been overtaken by your old troubles again after all ista was tempted for a dangerous moment to test just how much sorcerous power the bastard had endowed her with but the target was too small and unworthy pitiable in her way a natural sycophant lady dy hueltar had made her way in the world most comfortably for the past two decades as companion to the old provincara enjoying an imagined indispensability and the status lent her by her august patron it was clear she wished that pleasant existence to continue and it could if only ista would move into her mothers place and take up her mothers life all just as before indeed ista turned to the maid you girlfetch me some riding clothes white if they may be had or whatever color but in any case not green the girls mouth opened in panic she glanced back and forth between ista and lady dy hueltar torn between conflicting authorities istas eyes narrowed why must you even go to porifors asked lady dy hueltar her seamed face worked with distress close to tears with your brothers troop to escort us we could surely start back to valenda right from here she must take deeper thought for lady dy hueltar ista decided for in truth her years of service had earned her some consideration but for the moment ista meant to ride she unclenched her teeth and said mildly funerals dear lady dy hueltar they will be burying the dead today at porifors it is my solemn duty to attend i will wish you to bring me the proper attire when you follow on oh funerals said lady dy hueltar in a tone of relieved enlightenment funerals oh of course she had accompanied the old provincara to a multitude of such ceremonies it only seemed their primary entertainment in late years ista supposed dryly though shed be hardpressed to name a commoner one but lady dy hueltar understood funerals she wont understand these but it wouldnt matter for the moment at least her customary role seemed safely confirmed to her the old lady brightened instantly she actually unbent so far as to go find ista riding dress while liss went to saddle demon and ista gulped tea and bread the costumes pale tan color even looked good atop the chestnut stallion ista fancied settling at last into the saddle the ride would limber her stiff body at least she had a lingering headache but she knew its cause and its cure lay in porifors ferda waved on his baocian troop and liss fell in at her side they pressed forward through the bright morning air a relay of dy obys men were hauling out rubble from the gates of porifors as istas party rode in ista watched them work with glad approval the rebuilding would be a longer project but with so many hands at least the clearing and cleaning would be swiftly accomplished the forecourt was already swept out the limp flowers in the two or three pots left intact on the wall even seemed to be lifting their heads again ista was obscurely grateful in all the noisy confusion that someone had spared a bit of water for them and she wondered whose hand it had been the apricot and the almond trees though halfdenuded had also stopped dropping leaves she hoped they would recover we can do better than hope she realized and thought to them live by the bastards blessing i command you if this lent the trees any special vigor it was not instantly apparent she trusted the ultimate results would not prove peculiar istas heart lifted to see lord illvin striding through the archway he was cleaned up hair rebraided freshly dressed as an officer of porifors it even seemed possible that he might have snatched a few hours of sleep the shorter stouter lord dy baocia pattered by his side puffing to keep pace at dy baocias other shoulder learned dy cabon trod waving eagerly at her to her relief a tiredlooking goram trailed immediately after them cautiously goram took her horses head eyeing the beasts new docility askance ista slipped from her saddle into illvins upreaching arms returning his secret embrace on her way to the ground greetings ista said lord dy baocia are you um all right now he bore a slightly dazed expression as might any commander touring the inside of castle porifors this morning his smile upon her was not nearly so vague as ista was used to in fact she suspected she had all his attention it felt very odd thank you brother i am well a little tired but doubtless less fatigued than many here she glanced at dy cabon how do the sick men fare weve had no more deaths since yesterday noon five gods be thanked he signed himself in heartfelt gratitude a few are even back on their feet though i judge the rest will be as long recovering as from less uncanny illnesses most have been moved down to town into the care of the temple or their relatives that is good to hear foix and lord illvin have told us of the great deeds and miracles you performed yesterday in the jokonans tents by the grace of the bastard is it true you died i am not sure i am muttered illvin his hand had somehow neglected to release hers they both tightened i did have a very odd vision which i promise i will recount to you at some less hurried moment learned well parts of it anyway for all my terror how i wish i too could have been there to bear witness royina i should have counted myself blessed above all in my order oh well stay a moment then i have another task which presses on me liss please take my horse goram come here looking puzzled and wary goram obeyed trudging up to her and giving her a daunted bob of his head royina his hands clenched each other nervously and he shot a look of supplication at his master illvins eyes narrowed in concern and his glance at ista sharpened ista stared one last time at the hollow gaps in gorams soul placed her palms upon his forehead and poured a sudden flood of white fire out of her spirit hands into those dark and empty reservoirs the fire splashed wildly in its new confines then slowly settled as if seeking its proper level she breathed relief as the unpleasant pressure in her head vanished goram thumped down crosslegged on the cobbles his mouth open he buried his face in his hands after a moment his shoulders began to shake oh he said in a faraway voice he started to weep in shock ista supposed and in other more complicated reactions her last nights dreams had given her some intimations lord illvin brother may i introduce captain goram dy hixar late of roya oricos cavalry via the service of lord dondo dy jironal more recently of service if an involuntary one to sordso of jokona as sword master and horseman in a sense goram looked up from his sobbing his face stunned stunned but not slack its shape seemed to tighten along with the mending mind underneath you have returned his memories and his wits but ista this is wonderful cried illvin now he may find his family and his home at last just what it is remains to be seen murmured ista but his soul is now his own and complete gorams steelgray eyes met hers and for a moment did not look away they were filled with amazement and a roil of other emotions she rather thought one of them was anguish she gave him a grave nod acknowledging it all he returned a shaken jerk of his head learned she continued you begged a gift of witness and you have it please help captain dy hixar back to his chamber he needs to rest quietly for until he has time to put them back in order his mind and memories will be very unsettled some spiritual comfort may not come amiss when he is ready indeed royina said dy cabon signing himself joyously it will be my honor he helped goramdy hixarto his feet and led him off through the archway illvin stared after then turned his dark eyes thoughtfully on her dy baocia inquired in a small voice ista what just happened princess joen through her demon was in the habit of stealing useful bits of other peoples souls for her sorcerers from among others prisoners of war prince sordso was her greatest construct and full of such fragments when sordsos demon passed through me yesterday the god gave it to me to recognize and retain the portion of captain dy hixar woven among the rest and to return it to him here it is part of the task the bastard has laid on me to hunt demons in the world pluck them from their mounts and relay them to his hell this task is now done yes he said hopefully or possibly worriedly he glanced around the shambles of porifors yesterday right no i expect it is only beginning in the past three years joen released a very plague of elementals they have escaped all over the five princedoms and the royacies though their greatest concentration is likely still in jokona the woman who had this calling before me was killed in rauma it is not an easy not an easy duty to train for if i read the god arighthe delights in obscurity and riddlesi think he wanted a successor who would be rather better guarded through what promises to be a ah theologically difficult period illvins eyes glinted listening to this he murmured much becomes clear he told me he did not want to train another porter ista added and that he fancied a royina for a time his exact words she let her slight pause emphasize this last i am called i come and you may either help brother or get out of my way i expect to form a traveling court small and adaptable the gods duties are likely to continue physically wearing my clerkas soon as i appoint oneand yours must deal shortly with forwarding my dower income as i doubt my tasks will take me back to valenda dy baocia digested it all for a moment then cleared his throat and said cautiously my men are setting up our camp by the spring to the east of the castle will you take your ease there ista or return to your rooms in here ista glanced up at illvin that will be for poriforss chatelaine to decide but until this fortress has had more time to recover i would not burden it with my expanded household i will rest in your camp for a while illvin gave her a short nod in appreciation of her delicacy and all that went unspoken in it until after the dead are buried her brother offered to escort her to his tents as he was going in that direction and illvin gave her a formal bow of temporary farewell my duties today are relentless illvin murmured but later i must discuss with you the matter of an appropriate guard company for this traveling court of yours indeed she returned and other appointments as well and callings those too pejar and his two slain comrades of the daughters order were buried outside the walls of porifors that afternoon ista and all her company attended upon them learned dy cabon had come to ista in distress earlier for while he might officiatenone better in istas viewhe had no sacred animals to sign the gods acceptances those belonging to poriforss own temple were overburdened and reported close to frenzied with the days demands learned she had chided him gently we do not need the animals we have me ah he said rocking back oh as you are made saint againof course she knelt now in the sunlight by each wrapped form in turn laid her hand upon its brow and prayed for their signs in rites at major temples like the one in cardegoss each order proffered a sacred animal appropriate in color and sex to the god or goddess it represented with an acolytegroom to handle it the creatures were led in turn to the bier and by their behavior the divines interpreted to the mourners which god had taken in their lost ones soul and therefore where to direct their prayersand not incidentally upon which orders altar to lay their more material offerings the rite brought consolation to the living support to the temple and occasionally some surprises she had often wondered what the animals trained to this duty felt she was relieved when she experienced no holy hallucinations merely a silent certainty pejar and the first of his comrades were taken up by the daughter of spring whom they had served so faithfully she felt at once and so she reported the last man she discovered was different curious she said to ferda and foix the father of winter has taken laonin i wonder if it is for the sake of his courage on arhyss rideor if he has a child somewhere he was not married was he urn no said ferda he glanced at dy cabons whites and swallowed whatever embarrassment he might have felt on the dead dedicats behalf ista rose from the graveside then i charge you to find out and see that the child if it lives is cared for i will write to holy general dy yarrin as well it shall have a purse from me to maintain its infancy and a claim on a place in my household when it comes of age if it desires yes royina said ferda surreptitiously he wiped his eyes with the back of his hand ista nodded satisfaction as a conscientious officer he would not fail in this task she was sure the shaded grove reserved for the castles dead overlooked the pleasant river many graves were still being dug and other grieving people comrades and relatives of the slain had watched their companys rites what rumors were circulating about her in porifors ista hardly knew but within the hour humble petitioners had descended upon dy cabon to beg the royal saints indulgence for their dead as a result ista spent the day until darkness fell being conducted by dy cabon and liss from graveside to graveside reporting the fates of souls there were too many but the task was not so endless as the devastation joens sorcerers would have left across chalion if not stopped by poriforss sacrifices ista refused none who asked her aid for most surely these had not refused her every mourner seemed to have some story to tell her of their dead not she realized at length in the expectation that she would do anything except listen attend royina see this man make him real in your mind as in ours for in the realm of matter he lives now only in our memories she listened till her ears and heart both ached returning to her brothers tents after nightfall she fell onto her cot like a corpse herself as the night drew on she told over the names faces fragments of mens lives in her thoughts how could the gods minds hold all these tales in full for they remember us perfectly at length exhausted she rolled over and slept chapter twentyeight arhyss funeral took place the next morning in the little temple in the town of porifors as if an ordinary border lord had died in an ordinary battle the provincar of caribastos had ridden in with a troop too late to bear arms but in time to help bear up the sealed coffin together with dy oby dy baocia illvin foix and one of arhyss senior officers it was as honorable an escort as might be had the sacred animal of the father of winter here was a fine old gray deerhound his coat brushed to a silvery sheen for the occasion he sat at once by the bier when his acolytegroom led him up and would not be moved from his guardplace thereafter the normally articulate illvin was pallid and closethroated he managed only a simple he was a greatsouled man in a voice that slid then stepped back to istas side it was plain that any further demand for speech would have cracked him to spare him dy oby and dy caribastos stepped forward to deliver all the proper orations listing their late relatives and liegemans public achievements lady cattilara too was pale and quiet she did not speak much to illvin or vice versa just the necessary practical exchanges there would never be friendship between them exactly but the blood theyd mingled on the tower ista judged had bought them enough mutual respect to survive upon cattilara jaw tight even managed a polite nod to ista for the three of them the mornings rite was a redundant farewell more a social burden to be endured than an hour of parting after the interment and the funeral meal the military men dragged illvin off for conclave lady cattilara made scant work of packing left her ladies to deal with the rest and rode out under the escort of one of her brothers bound for oby it would be after nightfall before she reached it but ista remembering her own horror of the zangre after iass death had no trouble understanding cattilaras desire not to sleep another night in her emptied marriage bed cattilara bore away great grief in her heart down that eastern road but not ista thought a crippling burden of hatred rage or guilt along with it what would eventually grow to fill that emptiness ista did not knowbut she felt that it would not be stunted early the next afternoon lord illvin came to ista in dy baocias camp they climbed the path above the spring partly for the view which took in both castle porifors and the valley it guarded partly to shed any of istas wouldbe attendants less athletic than liss illvin gallantly spread his vestcloak upon a rock for ista to seat herself liss wandered nearby looking longingly at an enticing corkoak tree that her dress prevented her from climbing ista nodded to illvins belt where both arhyss and cattilaras keys now hung provincar dy caribastos has confirmed your command of porifors i see for the moment at least said illvin for the moment he stared thoughtfully along the ridge to where the strongholds walls rose from the rocks its odd i was born in poriforslived here almost all of my lifeyet ive never owned it nor expected to it belongs today to my niece livianaa nineyearold girl who lives half a province away yet it is my home if anyplace is i own half a dozen little estates in caribastos unentailed scatterings from my motherbut they are mere possessions barely visited still necessarily porifors must be defended by younecessarily he shrugged it is the key fortress along this border i think this border may be about to shift he grinned briefly indeed things are stirring in our counsels im stirring em i dont need arhyss gifts to tell that this is a boon of timing and chance not to be wasted i trust so i expect marshal dy palliar and chancellor dy cazaril to ride into the gates of porifors within the week if my brothers and dy caribastoss and foixs lettersand minedo not fetch them they are not the men i take them for will they see it do you think here now is the moment to turn joens strategy aboutto sweep down all unexpected into jokona while it is so disrupted and turn vispings flankand the campaign could be done before it was even expected to start it does not take second sight to foresee that outcome said ista if it works dy palliar will doubtless be showered with the acclaim for his grand strategy illvin smiled grimly poor joen she even loses that credit she should have been a general anything but the frustrated puppeteer she was constrained to be ista agreed what will become of sordso i think he is not quite mad for all that he sniveled and kissed my skirt hem when i passed him in the forecourt yesterday his soul is his own now though it will be long before his nerves are anything but shattered yes one scarcely knows if he would be of more use to us as a hostage or set loose to be a very bad enemy leader he spoke of a religious vocation and conversion to the quintarian faith actually ive no idea how long the fit will last illvin snorted perhaps his poetry will grow better hereafter i shouldnt be surprised the castles battlements stood stark and pale in the bright light concealing the damage being repaired within ista could hear a faint echo of hammering by the time livianas future husband succeeds to the command of porifors it will have become a quiet backwater like valenda this place has earned its peace i think she glanced at illvin who was smiling down at her there are two thoughts in my mind just now only two two thousand but these are uppermost one is that my roving court needs a royal seneschal a competent and experienced officer preferably one who knows this area to direct my travels and secure my person his brows twitched up encouragingly the other is that marshal dy palliar will need an experienced intelligencer an officer who knows jokona and the jokonans better than any other who speaks and writes both court and vile roknari possessing trunks full of maps and charts and ground plans to advise his strategies in this region i greatly fear that these are two mutually exclusive posts he touched one finger thoughtfully to his lips i might mention it has occurred independently to several military minds here that any army presently wishing to march north would be very very happy to possess a cure for sorcerers to carry close at hand should any further enemy sorcerers be encountered on this campaign resources devoted to the protection of such a sorceresssaint would not be considered wasted so the saints seneschal and the marshals intelligencer might not find themselves working so far apart as all that istas brows rose hm perhaps if it is clearly understood that the saint serves not chalion not even the temple but the god and must go as the god directs alongside the marshals tents for a time but not in them well well dy cazaril will understand that part and i think he could drill it into dy palliars head if anyone could he stared thoughtfully up the valley road a week you think till they arrive ten days at most huh his long fingers rattled the keys at his belt meantime i actually walked over here to invite you to take rooms within castle porifors again now we are in slightly better order if you wish the weathers due to change judging by the wind we may have a bit of welcome rain by tomorrow night not umerues old chamber i trust no weve lodged prince sordso and his watchers there nor cattilaras dy caribastos and his retinue have taken over that whole gallery he cleared his throat i was thinking of the ones you had before across from mine although i fear there is not enough space to also house all of your ladies ista managed not to grin or at least not too broadly thank you lord illvin i should be pleased his dark eyes sparked his handkissing technique was definitely improving with practice she thought ista sent her restored raiment from valenda on ahead even minus all the staid selections in widows green that she left in her brothers tents she would be spared living in borrowed clothing henceforth a little later dy baocia escorted her from his camp foix attended guardsman handily making a smooth transition to courtier dy baocias transition was a little less smooth but on the whole he seemed to be managing the leap to the new ista reasonably well she thought he avoided discussing the disturbing part about eating demons seldom mentioned the god but hed entered into the material practicalities of her new vocation with gratifying attention to detail we must determine the size of your personal guard he remarked as they passed under poriforss gates too many will be a drain on your purse but too few could prove a false economy very true my needs will i expect vary with my locale add it to your list to discuss with my seneschal hell be the best judge of what this region requires will your seneschal also serve as your master of horse as he did for his late brother or shall i recommend you a man ser dy arbanoss duties will be too demanding i have another man in mind though im not sure yet if he will accept i may return for your recommendation if not what not dy gura here dy baocia inquired foix gave a little agreeable bow or his good brother ferda is claimed for the coming campaign by his cousin marshal dy palliar and must be off to join him shortly even as an officer of my household foix will likely do considerable traveling back and forth on temple business but a horsemasters tasks are daily i am not sure what title i shall offer foix royal sorcerer master of demons i should be perfectly content to retain officerdedicat royina foix put in hastily sounding slightly alarmed then narrowing his eyes in suspicion at her primly pursed lips i shall find you the work first and the title later then she said youll need something to swagger with when we visit other courts to keep up the expected royal hauteur on my behalf a grin flitted over his mouth as you command royina they turned into the stone court and mounted to the gallery ista controlled a shiver passing up the steps on which shed once faced a god from the open door of her double chamber a familiar but unexpected voice floated she doesnt want you lady dy hueltar said severely she doesnt need you i am here now and i assure you i am far better acquainted with all her requirements than you will ever be so just you run along back to the stables or wherever you came from out out madam it cannot be so said liss in a puzzled tone foixs brows climbed then drew back down darkly ista motioned him to patience and shouldered within the men following what is this argument ista inquired colored spots flared on lady dy hueltars cheeks she hesitated then drew in her breath i was just explaining to this rude girl here that now you are done with that rash pilgrimage dear ista you will be requiring a more befitting ladyinwaiting again not a girl groom on the contrary i need liss very much she isnt suited to be ladyinwaiting to a royina shes not even a lady liss scratched her head well thats true enough im not much good at waiting either im better at riding very fast ista smiled indeed her smile tightened a little as she considered the scene shed interrupted had lady dy hueltar actually imagined she might trick or drive liss off send her away believing herself dismissed lady dy hueltar made a little nervous gesture under istas cool gaze now that you are calmer lady ista surely it is time we began to think of returning safely to valenda your good brother here will lend us a more adequate escort for the return journey im sure im not going back to valenda im going to follow the army into jokona to hunt demons for the bastard said ista safety has little to do with the gods chores her lips curved up but it was scarcely a smile anymore has no one explained anything to you yet dear lady dy hueltar i did said liss several times she lowered her voice to ista its all right i had a greataunt who grew very confused in her age like this poor thing i am not lady dy hueltar began in rising tones then stopped she started again its much too dangerous i beg you to reconsider dear ista my lord dy baociaas the head of the family now its your place to insist she be more sensible actually ista noted hes been head of the family for a decade and a half dy baocia snorted and muttered under his breath ayeanyplace in baocia but valenda ista took lady dy hueltars hand and set it firmly on her brothers arm im sure youre very tired dear lady to have ridden so far so fast for so little need but my brother will see you safely on your way back home tomorrowor possibly tonight i have already moved my things here ista cast an eye at the piles of luggage the servants will move them back i will speak with you more later dy baocia with a few more not terribly gentle hints ista maneuvered them both out the door her last hope of support from dy baocia failing lady dy hueltar moved off with him in a cloud of mutual exasperation looking very crushed where did that woman come from foix asked shaking his head in wonder i inherited her my condolences shell be all right my brother will find some other corner of the family to tuck her into it wont please her as well as a higher household but perhaps shell get some satisfaction out of parading her former glories she doesnt batten you know in certain narrow ways she makes herself quite useful it is sad though that she herself destroys the gratitude that ought to be her reward foix glanced at liss whose face was a trifle set he said i find my gratitude quite limited im afraid liss tossed her braid it doesnt matter was she trying to convince you that id dismissed you asked ista oh yes it made her quite cross when i played the fool and failed to take her hints lisss mouth twitched up then down its true though im not a proper highborn lady ista smiled i expect we shall rendezvous with iselle and bergons court before the year is upin visping if not sooner at which point by my request and your valiancy a lady you shall be made in fact sera annaliss dy what was the name of that sheepinfested village again liss breathed teneret royina sera annaliss dy teneret ladyinwaiting to the dowager royina ista sounds very dignified dont you think foix he grinned ayei think mmother will like it quite well well bastard knows ive got to offer something now to make it up to her for er the bastard ah you aspire to some social climbing do you well its not impossible this year will offer young officers many opportunities for advancement i suspect foix swept liss a courtiers bow may i aspire lady liss eyed him with smiling speculation and drifted across the chamber to start putting istas things in order ask again in visping dedicat i shall ista had dy cabon bring goram to her in the stone court she sat in the colonnades shade on the bench where they had first spoken and studied the differences goram dy hixars clothing was still that of the groom his figure still short his legs still bowed his beard still grizzled but he had lost the turtle hunch he moved now with a swordsmans balance and tension his polite bow was supple enough for any provincial court learned dy cabon has told you i think of my need for a master of horse yes ista began yes royina dy hixar cleared his throat uncomfortably and swallowed his spit in her presence goram she thought would have let the gobbet fly can you undertake the task he grimaced the work aye but royina im not sure if you understand who i was am why i was not ransomed she shrugged captain of horse swordsman bravo quondam murderer destroyer of livesnot just of enemies but friendsshall i go on the sort of fellow whose funerals orations are all on the theme of well thats a relief he winced i see i need not confess to you no i saw he looked away all my sins delivered its a strange strange thing royina the lifting of ones sins is usually considered a miracle of the gods but your god has brought all mine back to me goram the groom was a hundred times better a man than goram dy hixar will ever be i was a blank slate broughtsaved for no merit of mineto live for three years with the two best men in caribastos not just best swordsmenbest men you understand she nodded i scarcely knew such lives were possible before nor wanted to know i would have mocked their virtues and laughed lord illvin thought i was overwhelmed with joy when i fell to my knees before you in the forecourt it wasnt joy that knocked me down it was shame i know i dont want to be who i am i was happier before royina but everyone thinks i should be praying my thanks she returned him an ironic smile be sure i am not one of them butyour soul is your own now to make of what you will we are all of us every one our own works we present our souls to our patrons at the ends of our lives as an artisan presents the works of his hands if it is so i am too marred royina you are unfinished they are discerning patrons but not i think impossible to please the bastard said to me from his own lips dy cabons breath drew in that the gods did not desire flawless souls but great ones i think that very darkness is where the greatness grows from as flowers from the soil i am not sure in fact if greatness can bloom without it you have been as godtouched as any here do not despair of yourself for i think the gods have not the dim gray eyes reddened edged with waters gleam i am too old to start over you have more years ahead of you now than pejar half your age whom we buried outside these walls these two days past stand before his grave and use your gift of breath to complain of your limited time if you dare he jerked a little at the steel in her voice i offer you an honorable new beginning i do not guarantee its ending attempts fail but not as certainly as tasks never attempted he vented a long exhalation then that being so and knowing what you know of mewhich is i think more than ever i confessed to anyone living or deadi am your man if you will have me royina thank you captain i shall as my master of horse you will take your instructions from my seneschal i think you will find him a tolerable commander goram smiled a little at that and saluted her farewell dy cabon stood by her a moment watching him exit the court his face was troubled well learned how do you feel about your witnessing now he sighed you know this godtouched business wasnt as much urn as much pleasure as i thought it would be back in valenda when we started i was terribly excited in secret to be picked out to do the gods work i did try to tell you back in casilchas yes i think i understand better now my court is going to need a divine too you know as i am to become a lay dedicat of the bastards order of a sort i think you might suit me very well we will likely be riding into the five princedoms if you truly aspire to martyrdom as your early sermons to me implied you may still have a chance he blushed deeply five gods but those were stupid sermons he took a deep breath ill be glad to forgo the martyr part as for the rest thoughi will say you yes royina with a glad heart even though ive had no dreams directing me well especially as ive had no dreams directing me not so sure i want them anymore he hesitated and added with a wholly inconsistent longing in his voice you did say you did see him facetoface in your dreams your real dreams yes ista smiled once he borrowed your face to speak through it appears that someone thinks you not unworthy to wear his colors learned to wear in turn the semblance of your flesh oh dy cabon blinked taking this in is that so really my goodness he blinked some more when he took his leave of her his mouth was still tugging up in the evening after supper when the sun had set and white stars were coming out in the cobalt sky above the stone court lord illvin climbed the stairs and knocked on istas door liss admitted him to the outer chamber with a friendly dip of her knees with a look of extreme bemusement on his face he held out his hands to ista look i found these growing on the apricot tree in the forecourt as i was passing through just now liss peered theyre apricots makes sense thats where theyd be doesnt it she hesitated the fruits were large and deeply colored with a faint red blush upon their dark golden skins ista bending to look flared her nostrils at their heavy perfume they smell lovely yes but it is not the season my mother planted that tree when i was born and the almond for arhys i know when theyre supposed to come ripe ive watched them all my life not for months yet there are still a few blossoms that havent fallen though half the leaves are gone these two were hiding amongst the few that held oni saw them by chance how do they taste i was a little afraid to bite into them ista smiled out of season they may be but i think they are not a disaster i think they may be a gift it will be all right she pushed open the door of her inner chamber with one foot come in let us try them urn said liss i can stay in sight if you leave the door open but i dont think i can get out of earshot ista gave illvin a tilt of her head toward the inner door excuse us a moment a little smile turning his mouth he gave her a courtly nod and passed within ista pulled the door shut behind him briefly and turned to liss i dont think i have explained to you yet about the other set of rules for discreet ladiesinwaiting she did so in clear succinct but on the whole polite terms lisss eyes grew bright as the stars outside as she listened attentively ista was relieved though not surprised that liss seemed neither confused nor shocked ista hadnt quite expected enthusiastic however she found herself swept within and the door firmly closed behind her almost before shed finished speaking i think i shall go sit on the steps a while dear royina lisss voice called back faintly through the wood its cooler i think i shall like to sit out for quite a long time ista heard the outer door close as well illvins eyes were crinkling with silent laughter he held out one of the fruits to her she took it her hand jerking a little when her fingers accidentally brushed his well he said raising his to his lips let us both be brave then she matched his bite the apricot tasted as wonderful as it looked and smelled and despite her attempts at daintiness she ended with juice dribbling down her chin she dabbed at it oh dear here he said moving closer let me help you the kiss lasted quite a long time with his apricotscented fingers winding pleasurably in her hair when they paused for breath she remarked i always feared it would take divine intervention to find me a lover i do believe i was right tch tch look at yourself bittersweet ista saint sorceress dowager royina of all chalionibra converses with gods when not cursing thema man would have to be maniacally intrepid to even think of you in that rude way this is good it will cut down on my rivals she couldnt help it she giggled she heard herself and laughed in wonder in joy in huge surprise he tasted her laughter too as though it were miraculous apricots and i was afraid i wouldnt know how to do this hed looked tall and splendid in the long sweep of black tunic and trousers and boots but he looked even better out of them she thought as she pulled him down beside her on her bed the warm night demanded neither sheets nor blankets she left a brace of candles burning the better to see the gods gifts
