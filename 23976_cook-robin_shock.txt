robin cook shock the human egg cell or oocyte that was snared by the slight suction exerted through the blunt end of the holding pipette was no different from its approximately five dozen siblings it was merely the closest to the end of the tiny glass rod when the rod came into the technicians view the group of oocytes was suspended in a drop of culture fluid under a thin layer of mineral oil beneath the objective of a powerful dissecting microscope the oil prevented evaporation it was vitally important that the environment of these living cells stay in an appropriate steady state like the others the fixated oocyte appeared healthy with an appropriate granularity of its cytoplasm also like the others its chromatin or dna fluoresced under ultraviolet light like miniature fireflies in a peasoup fog the only evidence of the cells earlier rude aspiration from its developing follicle were the ragged remains of its corona radiata of granulosa cells adherent to the comparatively dense envelope called the zona pellucida all of the oocytes had been yanked from their ovarian nest prematurely and then encouraged to mature in vitro at that moment they were ready for spermatic penetration but that was not to be the case these female gametes were not to be fertilized another pipette entered the visual field this was a more lethalappearing instrument particularly beneath the microscopes strong magnification although in reality only twentyfive millionths of a meter in diameter it looked like a sword with a tip beveled to needlepoint sharpness inexorably it closed in on the hapless immobile gamete and indented the cells zona pellucida then with a practiced tap by the experienced technician on the pipettes controlling micrometer the end of the pipette was plunged into the cells interior advancing to the fluorescing dna a slight suction was applied to the pipettes interior and the dna disappeared into the glass rod later after ascertaining that the gamete and its sisters had withstood the enucleation ordeal as well as could be expected the cell was again immobilized another beveled pipette was introduced this time the penetration was limited to the zona pellucida sparing the oocytes cell membrane and instead of suction being applied a tiny volume of fluid was introduced into whats known as the perivitelline space along with the fluid came a single comparatively small spindleshaped adult cell obtained from a buccal scraping of an adult humans mouth the next step involved suspending the gametes with their paired adult epithelial cells in four milliliters of fusion medium and placing them between the electrodes of a fusion chamber when the gametes were all appropriately aligned a switch was thrown sending a ninetyvolt electrical pulse through the medium for fifteen millionths of a second the result was the same for all the gametes the shock caused the membranes between the enucleated gametes and their adult cell partners to dissociate momentarily fusing the two cells following the fusion process the cells were placed in an activation medium under chemical stimulation each gamete that had been ready for fertilization prior to the removal of its dna now worked magic with its adopted full complement of chromosomes following a mysterious molecular mechanism the adult nuclei forsook their previous epithelial duties and reverted to their embryonic roles after a short period of time each gamete began to divide to form individual embryos that would soon be ready for implantation the donor of the adult cells had been cloned in fact hed been cloned approximately sixty times prologue april are you comfortable dr paul saunders asked his patient kristin overmeyer who lay on the aged operating table clothed only in a backless hospital johnny i guess kristin answered although she was not comfortable at all medical environments never failed to evoke a level of anxiety in her that was tolerable but not pleasant and the present room was particularly disagreeable it was an ancient operating theater the decor of which was the absolute opposite of the sterile utilitarianism of a modern medical facility its walls were surfaced in bilegreen cracked tile with dark splotches presumably from old blood staining the grout it looked more like a scene in a gothic horror movie set in the nineteenth century than a room currently in use there were also tiers of observation seats that disappeared up into the gloom beyond the reach of the overhead surgical light thankfully the seats were all empty i guess doesnt sound too convincing dr sheila donaldson said from the side of the operating table opposite dr saunders she smiled down at the patient although the only observable effect was a crinkling at the corners of her eyes the rest of her face was hidden behind her surgical mask and hood i wish this was over kristin managed at that moment she wished she hadnt volunteered for the egg donation the money would provide her with a degree of financial freedom that few of her fellow harvard students enjoyed but that seemed less important now her only consolation was that she knew shed soon be asleep the minor procedure she was about to undergo would be painless when shed been offered the choice of general anesthesia or local she chose the former without a moments hesitation the last thing she wanted to be was awake while they pushed a footlong aspiration needle into her belly i trust we are going to be able to get this done today paul said sarcastically to dr carl smith the anesthesiologist paul had a lot to do that day and had scheduled only forty minutes for the upcoming procedure between his experience with the operation and his facility with the instruments he thought he was being generous allotting forty minutes the only holdup was carl paul couldnt begin until the patient was under and minutes were inexorably ticking away carl didnt respond paul was always in a hurry carl concentrated on taping the precordial stethoscopes head onto kristins chest he already had the iv running the blood pressure cuff positioned the ekg leads attached and the pulse oximeter in place satisfied with the auscultatory sounds he heard through his earpiece he reached over and pulled his anesthesia machine closer to kristins head all was ready okay kristin carl said reassuringly as i explained to you earlier im going to give you a bit of milk of amnesia are you ready yes kristen said as far as she was concerned the sooner the better have a good little sleep carl said the next time ill be talking with you will be in the recovery area such was carls usual comment to his patient just before beginning anesthesia and indeed it was the usual course of events but on this occasion it was not to be blithely unaware that disaster was imminent carl reached for the iv line where he had the anesthetic agent piggybacked with practiced ease he gave the patient a predetermined amount based on her weight but on the low end of the recommended dosage it was the wingate infertility clinics policy for outpatient anesthesia to use the least amount appropriate of any particular drug the goal was to ensure the patients sameday discharge since the clinics inpatient facilities were limited as the induction dose of propofol entered kristins body carl dutifully watched and listened to his monitoring devices all seemed in order sheila chuckled beneath her mask milk of amnesia was carls humorous sobriquet for the anesthetic agent propofol which was dispensed as a white liquid and the term never failed to tickle her funny bone can we start paul demanded he shifted his weight he knew he couldnt begin yet but he wanted to communicate his impatience and displeasure they shouldnt have called him until all was ready his time was too valuable for him to be standing idly while carl messed around with all his toys continuing to ignore pauls peevishness carl concentrated on testing kristins level of consciousness satisfied shed reached an appropriate state he injected the muscle relaxant mivacurium which he preferred over several others for its rapid spontaneous recovery time when the mivacurium had taken effect he skillfully slipped in an endotracheal tube to ensure control of kristins airway then he sat down attached the anesthesia machine and motioned to paul that everything was set its about time paul mumbled he and sheila quickly draped the patient for laparoscopy the target was the right ovary carl settled back after making the appropriate entries into the anesthesia record his role at that point was to watch his monitors while maintaining anesthesia by carefully titrating the patients state of consciousness with a continuous propofol infusion paul moved quickly with sheila anticipating his every move along with constance bartolo the scrub nurse and marjorie hickam the circulator the team worked with metronomic efficiency at this point there was no conversation pauls first goal was to introduce the trocar of the insufflation unit to fill the patients abdominal cavity with gas it was the creation of a gasfilled space that made the laparoscopic surgery possible sheila helped by grabbing two bites of skin alongside kristins belly button with towel clips and pulling up on the relaxed abdominal wall meanwhile paul made a small incision at the umbilicus and then proceeded to push in the nearly footlong veress insufflation needle in his experienced hands two distinct pops could be felt as the needle passed into the abdominal cavity while holding the needle firmly at its serrated collar paul activated the insufflation unit instantly carbon dioxide gas began to flow into kristins abdominal cavity at a rate of a liter of gas per minute as they waited for the appropriate amount of gas to enter disaster struck carl was preoccupied watching his cardiovascular and respiratory monitors for telltale signs of the increasing intraabdominal pressure and failed to see two seemingly innocuous events namely a fluttering of kristins eyelids and a slight flexion of her left leg had carl or anyone else noticed these movements they would have sensed that kristins level of anesthesia was becoming light she was still unconscious but close to waking and the discomfort of the increasing pressure in her belly was serving to rouse her suddenly kristin moaned and sat up she didnt get all the way up carl reacted by reflex grabbing her rising shoulders and forcing her back down but it was too late her rising off the table forced the veress needle in pauls hand to plunge deeper into her belly where it penetrated a large intraabdominal vein before paul could stop the insufflation unit a large bolus of the gas entered kristins vascular system oh my god carl cried as he heard in his earpiece the beginnings of the ominous telltale millwheel murmur as the gas reached her heart a threshing sound like the agitation cycle of a washing machine weve got a gas embolism he yelled get her on her left side paul yanked out the bloody needle and tossed it to the side where it clanked against the tile floor he helped carl roll kristin over in a vain attempt to keep the gas isolated in the right side of her heart paul then leaned on her to keep her in position although still unconscious she fought back meanwhile carl rushed to insert as aseptically as possible a catheter into kristins jugular vein kristin resisted and struggled against the weight on top of her inserting the catheter was like trying to hit a moving target carl thought about increasing the propofol or giving her more mivacurium but was reluctant to take the time at last he succeeded with the catheterization but when he drew back on the plunger of the syringe all he got was a bloody froth he did it again with the same result he shook his head in dismay but before he could say anything kristin briefly stiffened then convulsed her body was racked by a fullblown grand mal seizure frantically carl dealt with this new problem while he battled the sinking feeling in his own gut he knew all too well that anesthesiology was a profession marked by numbing repetitive routine occasionally shattered by episodes of pure terror and this was as bad as it got a major complication with a young healthy person undergoing a purely elective procedure both paul and sheila had stepped back with their sterile gloved hands clasped in front of their gowned chests along with the two nurses they watched as carl struggled to terminate kristins seizure when it was over and kristin was again on her back motionless no one spoke the only sound other than the muted noise of a radio coming through the closed door to the sterilizer room was the anesthesia machine breathing for the patient whats the verdict paul said finally his voice was emotionless and it echoed in the tiled space carl breathed out like a balloon deflating reluctantly he reached forward with two index fingers and pulled back kristins eyelids both pupils were widely dilated and did not react to the brightness of the overhead light he took his own penlight from his pocket and shined the beam into kristins eyes there was no reaction whatsoever it doesnt look good carl croaked his throat was dry hed never had such a complication meaning paul demanded carl swallowed with difficulty meaning my guess would be that shes stroked out i mean a minute ago she was light now shes gorked out shes not even breathing on her own pauls head bobbed up and down perceptively as he pondered this information then he snapped off his gloves tossed them on the floor and undid his mask which he allowed to fall forward onto his chest he looked at sheila why dont you continue with the procedure at least youll get some practice and do both sides really sheila questioned no sense being wasteful paul said what are you going to do sheila asked im going to find kurt hermann and have a chat paul said as he untied and pulled off his gown as unfortunate as this incident is its not as if we havent anticipated such a disaster and at least weve planned for it are you going to inform spencer wingate sheila asked dr wingate was the founder and titular head of the clinic that i dont know paul said it depends i prefer to hold off and see how events play out what do you know about kristin overmeyers arrival today she came in her own car sheila said its out in the parking lot she came alone no as we advised her she brought a friend sheila said her name is rebecca corey shes out in the main waiting area as paul started for the door his eyes locked onto carls im sorry carl said paul hesitated for a moment he felt like telling the anesthesiologist what he thought of him but changed his mind paul wanted to keep a cool head and getting into a conversation with carl at that point would have gotten him all worked up it had been enough that carl had kept him waiting for so long without even bothering to change out of his surgical scrubs paul snatched a long white doctors coat from the room that served as the surgical lounge he pulled the coat on as he descended the metal stairs in the stairwell passing the first floor he exited out onto the lawn which was showing the first signs of spring with the coat clutched around himself against the blustery early april new england wind he hurried down toward the clinics stone gatehouse he found the chief of security behind his scarred and worn desk hunched over his departments schedule for the month of may if kurt hermann was surprised by the sudden arrival of the man who ran the wingate clinic he didnt show it other than looking up his only acknowledgment of pauls presence was a slight questioning elevation of his right eyebrow paul grabbed one of the straightbacked chairs that lined the sparse office and sat down in front of the security chief we have a problem paul said im listening kurt said his chair squeaked as he leaned back weve had a major anesthetic complication catastrophic actually wheres the patient still in the or but shell be out shortly name kristin overmeyer did she come alone kurt asked as he wrote kristins name down no she came by car with a friend named rebecca corey dr donaldson said shes in the main waiting room make of the car i have no idea paul admitted well find out kurt said he raised his steely blue eyes to meet pauls this is what we hired you people for paul stated tersely i want you to handle it and i dont want to know anything no problem kurt said he laid his pen down carefully as if it were fragile for a moment the two men stared at each other then paul stood up turned and disappeared out into the gusty april morning one october pm so let me get this straight joanna meissner said to carlton williams the two friends were sitting in the dark inside carltons jeep cherokee in a noparking zone on craigie street alongside the craigie arms apartment building in cambridge massachusetts youve decided that it would be best for us to wait to be married until after you finish your surgical residency some three or four years from now i havent decided anything carlton said defensively were having a discussion here joanna and carlton had been out to dinner in harvard square that friday evening and had been enjoying themselves until joannaid brought up the sore subject of their longterm plans as usual from that moment on the tone of the conversation had deteriorated they had been over this thorny issue many times in the past as a consequence of their engagement theirs was a quintessentially long affair they had known each other since kindergarten and had been dating each other exclusively since the ninth grade listen carlton said soothingly im just trying to think of whats best for both of us oh bull joanna blurted despite her vow to herself to stay calm she could feel anger brewing in her gut as if she were a nuclear reactor about to go critical im serious carlton said joanna im working my tail off you know how often im on call you know the hours being a resident at the mgh is a hell of a lot more demanding than id ever guessed what difference does that make joanna snapped unable to keep the irritation she felt from being painfully obvious she couldnt help feeling betrayed and rejected it makes a lot of difference carlton persisted im exhausted im no fun to be with i cant have a normal conversation outside of whats going on in the hospital its pathetic i dont even know whats happening in boston much less the world that kind of comment might have some validity if we were dating casually but the fact of the matter is weve been seeing each other for eleven years and up until i broached this delicate issue of setting a date tonight you were enjoying yourself and you were perfectly fun to be with i certainly love seeing you carlton said thats reassuring joanna interjected sarcastically what i find particularly ironic about this situation is that youre the one who asked me to marry you not vice versa the trouble is that was seven years ago id say that suggests your ardor has significantly cooled it hasnt carlton protested i do want to marry you im sorry but youre not convincing not after all this time first you wanted to graduate from college that was fine no problem i thought that was appropriate then you thought you should just get through the first two years of medical school even that was okay with me since i could get most of my phd coursework out of the way but then you thought it best to put things off until you got yourself all the way through medical school are you detecting a pattern here or is it just me then the issue became getting the first year of residency behind you stupid me even accepted that but now its the whole residency business what about the fellowship deal you talked about last month and then after that you might even think it best to wait while you set up your practice im trying to be rational about this carlton said its a difficult decision and it behooves us to weigh the pros and cons joanna was no longer listening instead her emeraldgreen eyes wandered away from the face of her fiancé who she recognized wasnt even looking at her as he spoke in fact hed avoided looking at her throughout this conversation as far as she could tell hed only intermittently met her glare during her monologue with unseeing eyes she stared straight ahead into the middle distance all at once it was as if she had been slapped across the face by an invisible hand carltons suggestion of yet another delay in setting a marriage date had spawned an epiphany and she found herself laughing not out of humor but disbelief carlton halted in midsentence while enumerating the pros and the cons of getting married sooner rather than later what are you laughing about he asked he raised his eyes from watching himself fumble with the ignition keys and gazed at joanna in the cars dim interior her face was silhouetted against the dark side window by a distant streetlamp whose light fingered its way through the windshield her sleek and delicate profile was limned by her lustrous flaxen hair which appeared to glow in the half light diamondlike flashes glistened from her starkly white teeth just visible through her slightly parted full lips to carlton she was the most beautiful woman in the world even when she was badgering him ignoring carltons question joanna continued her soft mirthless laugh as the clarity of her revelation sharpened precipitously shed come to acknowledge the validity of what her roommate deborah cochrane and her other female friends had been hawking all along namely that marriage in and of itself should not be her lifes goal theyd been right after all shed been programmed by the totality of her suburban houston upbringing joanna couldnt believe shed been so stupid for so long and so resistant to question a value system shed so blindly accepted thankfully while treading water waiting for carlton shed been smart enough to lay the foundation of a rewarding career she was only a thesis away from a phd from harvard in economics combined with extensive computer skills what are you laughing about carlton persisted come on talk to me im laughing at me joanna said finally she turned to look at her fiancé he appeared perplexed with his brows tightly knit i dont understand carlton said thats curious joanna said i see everything rather clearly she glanced down at the engagement ring on her left hand the diamond solitaire sucked in the weak available light and threw it back at joanna with surprising intensity the stone had been carltons grandmothers and joanna had been thrilled with it mostly because of its sentimental value but now it seemed like a vulgar neon reminder of her own gullibility a sudden sense of claustrophobia gripped joanna without any warning she unlatched the door slid out and stood up on the curb joanna carlton called he leaned across the cars center console and peered up into joannas face her expression was one of fierce resolve her usually soft lips were set in grim determination carlton started to ask joanna what was the matter although he knew all too well before he could even get the sentence out the car door slammed in his face pushing himself back upright he groped for the passengerside window button when the window opened joanna leaned in her expression hadnt changed dont insult me by asking whats the matter she said youre not being very adult about this carlton stated firmly thank you for your unbiased assessment joanna retorted i also want to thank you for making everything so clear for me it certainly makes it easier to make up my mind make up your mind about what carlton asked the newly found firmness of his voice vanished in its place was a definite quaver he had a premonition about what was coming and it was accompanied by a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach about my future joanna said here she extended her clenched fist with the obvious intention of giving something to carlton carlton reached out hesitantly with a cupped palm he felt something cold drop into his hand glancing down he found himself staring at his grandmothers diamond whats this all about carlton stammered i think its pretty clear joanna said consider yourself free to finish your residency and whatever else your little heart desires i certainly dont want to think of myself as a drag youre not serious carlton questioned caught completely off guard by this sudden turn of events he was befuddled oh but i am joanna said consider our engagement officially over good night carlton joanna turned and walked back along craigie street toward concord avenue and the entrance to the craigie arms her apartment was on the third floor after a brief struggle with the door release carlton leaped from his cherokee and ran after joanna whod already reached the corner a few deep red maple leaves which had fallen from the tree that very day wafted in his wake he caught up to his former fiancée as she was about to enter her apartment building he was out of breath he was clutching the engagement ring in his fist all right carlton managed youve made your point here take the ring back he extended his hand joanna shook her head her grim determination had disappeared in its place was a tenuous smile i didnt give the ring back as a mere gesture or machination nor am i actually angry you obviously dont want to get married now and all at once i dont either lets give it a rest were still friends but i love you carlton blurted im flattered joanna said and i suppose i still love you but things have been dragging on for too long lets go our separate ways at least for now but good night carlton joanna said she pushed herself up onto her tiptoes and gave carltons cheek a brush with her lips a moment later she was in the elevator she hadnt looked back putting her key in her apartment door she noticed she was trembling despite her airy dismissal of carlton she felt her emotions rumbling just below the surface wow her roommate deborah cochrane exclaimed she checked the task bar on her computer to see the time rather early for a friday night wussup deborah was dressed in oversized harvardemblazoned sweats in comparison with the soft porcelain femininity of her roommate she was mildly tomboyish with short dark hair a mediterranean olive complexion and an athletic build her facial features contributed by being stronger and more rounded than joannas yet no less feminine all in all the roommates complemented each other and emphasized each others natural attractiveness joanna didnt respond as she hung up her coat in the hall closet deborah watched her closely as she came into their sparsely furnished living room and collapsed on the couch she tucked her feet under herself and only then met deborahs inquisitive eyes dont tell me you guys had a fight deborah said not a fight per se joanna said just a parting of ways deborahs jaw dropped for the six years shed known joanna from freshman orientation onward carlton had been a fixture in joannas life as far as she was concerned thered not been the slightest hint of discord within the relationship what happened she asked with astonishment i suddenly saw the light joanna said there was a slight trill to her voice that deborah noticed instantly my engagement is off and more importantly im not going to count on getting married period if it happens fine but if it doesnt thats okay too my word deborah said unable to keep the glee from her voice this doesnt sound like the butter cream frosting silky bridesmaids dresses girl that ive come to love why the change of heart deborah considered joannas march toward marriage almost religious in its unswerving intensity carlton wanted to postpone the wedding until after his residency joanna said in short order she recounted the last fifteen minutes of her date with carlton deborah listened with rapt attention are you all right deborah asked when joanna fell silent she leaned forward to peer more directly into joannas eyes better than i would have guessed joanna admitted i feel a little shaky i suppose but all things considered im doing okay then this calls for a celebration deborah exclaimed she stood up and bounced into the kitchen ive been saving that bottle of champagne cluttering up the fridge for months she called over her shoulder this is the time to open it i suppose joanna managed she didnt feel much like celebrating but resisting deborahs enthusiasm would have taken too much effort all right deborah exclaimed as she returned with the champagne in one hand and two flutes in the other she knelt at the coffee table and attacked the bottle the cork came away with a resounding pop and caromed off the ceiling deborah laughed but noticed that joanna didnt are you sure youre okay deborah asked i have to say its a big adjustment thats an understatement deborah averred knowing you as well as i do its the equivalent of saint paul falling on the way to damascus youve been programmed by the houston social scene toward marriage since you were nothing but a twinkle in your mothers eye joanna laughed despite herself deborah poured the champagne too quickly both glasses filled mostly with fizz and spilled out on the table undeterred deborah snatched up the flutes and handed one to joanna then she made joanna clink glasses with her welcome to the twentyfirst century social scene deborah said both women lifted their stemware and tried to drink they coughed on the foam and laughed not wanting to lose the moment deborah quickly took both glasses into the kitchen rinsed them and returned this time she poured more carefully by letting the champagne run down the side of the glass when they drank it was mostly liquid not the greatest bubbly deborah admitted but its not surprising david gave it to me way back when unfortunately he was a cheapskate from the word go deborah had broken off a fourmonth relationship with her most recent boyfriend david curtis the week before in sharp contrast to joannas her longest relationship had been less than two years and that was way back in high school in many ways the two women couldnt have been more different instead of the affluent southern suburban social scene complete with debutante balls funded by oil money which joanna had enjoyed deborah grew up in manhattan with a bohemian single parent who was immersed in academia deborah had never known her father since it was her imminent birth that had ended her parents relationship her mother hadnt married until relatively late in life after deborah had left for college ive not been much of a champagne fan anyway joanna said i actually wouldnt even know if it were good stuff or not she twirled the glass in her fingers momentarily mesmerized by the effervescence what happened to your ring deborah asked noticing for the first time that the jewelry was gone i gave it back joanna said casually deborah shook her head she was amazed joanna had loved the diamond and everything it stood for shed rarely taken it from her finger im serious about this joanna said im getting that impression deborah said she was momentarily speechless the phone shattered the short silence deborah stood up to get it its probably carlton but i dont want to talk with him joanna said over at the desk deborah checked the caller id screen youre right its carlton let the answering machine get it joanna said deborah returned to the coffee table and plopped herself back down the two women eyed each other as the phone continued its insistent ring after the fourth ring the answering machine picked up there was silence while the outgoing message played then carltons anxious voice along with a bit of static filled the ascetically decorated room youre right joanna waiting until i finish my residency is a stupid idea i never said it was a stupid idea joanna interjected in a forced whisper as if the caller could hear and you know what carlton continued why dont we go ahead and plan for this june as i recall you always said you wanted a june wedding well junes fine by me anyway give me a call as soon as you get this message and we can talk about it okay the answering machine made a few more mechanical sounds before the little red light on the front of the console began to blink that shows you how much he knows joanna said theres no way my mother could put together a proper houston wedding in eight months he sounds a little desperate deborah said if you want to call him back and want some privacy i can make myself scarce i dont want to talk with him joanna said quickly not now deborah cocked her head to the side and studied her friends face she wanted to he supportive hut for the moment was confused how best to play that role this isnt an argument he and i are having joanna explained nor is it some kind of lovers game im not trying to be manipulative and frankly id feel uncomfortable if we did get married now this is a total switch exactly joanna said here he is trying to move the date up and id be arguing to postpone i need some time and space i understand completely deborah said and you know what i think youre being smart not to let this situation turn into a petulant debate the problem is i do love him joanna said with a wry smile if there was any debate i might lose deborah laughed i agree youre such a new convert to a more modern sensible attitude about marriage that youre vulnerable to a relapse you definitely need time and space and you know what i think i have the answer the answer to what joanna asked let me show you something deborah said she climbed to her feet and picked up the latest issue of the harvard crimson lying on her desk it was folded lengthwise in the classified section she handed the paper to joanna joanna scanned the page and read the circled ad she looked up at deborah questioningly is this ad from the wingate clinic what you wanted me to see it is indeed deborah said enthusiastically this is an advertisement for egg donors joanna said precisely deborah said how is this the answer joanna asked deborah came around the coffee table and sat down next to joanna with her index finger she pointed to the offered compensation the money is the answer she said fortyfive thousand dollars a pop this ad was in an issue of the crimson last spring and caused a buzz joanna said then it never reappeared do you think its legit or some kind of college prank i think its legit deborah said wingate is an infertility clinic in bookford massachusetts out beyond concord thats what i learned form their website why are they willing to pay so much money joanna asked the website says they have some wealthy clients who are willing to pay for what they consider the best apparently these clients want harvard coeds it must be something like that sperm bank in california where the donors are all nobel laureates its lunacy from a genetic point of view but who are we to question were certainly not nobel laureates joanna said technically were not even harvard coeds what makes you think theyd be interested in you and me why wouldnt they be deborah asked i think being grad students qualifies us as harvard coeds i cant imagine its just undergraduates that theyre looking for in fact the website specifies theyre interested in women twentyfive and younger we just make it under the wire but it also says we have to be emotionally stable attractive not overweight and athletic arent we stretching reality a bit here hey i think were perfect athletic joanna questioned with a smile maybe you but not me and emotionally stable thats pushing the envelope especially in my current state well we can give it a go deborah said maybe youre not the most athletically inclined female on campus but well tell them well only consider donating as a pair they have to take both of us all or nothing and our sat scores are appropriate are you truly serious about this joanna asked she eyed her roommate who could be a tease on occasion i wasnt at first deborah admitted but then i got to thinking about it earlier in the evening i mean the money is enticing can you imagine fortyfive grand apiece that kind of money could give us some freedom for the first time in our lives even while we write our theses and now that you have so recently opted out of the economic security of the marital goal the idea should be even more seductive from your perspective you need some equity besides your education to maintain your resolve and frankly to begin planning for the life of a single individual this kind of money could be the start joanna tossed the school newspaper onto the coffee table sometimes i cant tell when you are pulling my leg hey im not joking you said you need time and space this kind of money could provide it and more heres the deal we both go out to this wingate clinic give them a couple of eggs and collect ninety k of that we take about fifty k and buy a twobedroom condo in boston or cambridge which we rent out to pay the mortgage why would we buy a condo to rent it joanna asked let me finish deborah said but wouldnt it be better to just wisely invest the fifty k remember im the economist and youre the biologist you might be getting a phd in economics but youre a babe in the woods in relation to being a single female in the twentyfirst century so shut up and listen we buy the condo to begin establishing some real roots in the previous generation females looked to marriage for that but now we have to do it for ourselves an apartment would be a nice start as well as a good investment my word joanna exclaimed youre way ahead of me you bet your sweet ass deborah said and theres more heres the best part we take the other forty k and go to venice to write our phd theses venice joanna cried youre crazy girl oh yeah deborah asked think about it when youre talking about having some time and space what could be better wed be in venice in some nice cozy apartment and carltons here doing his residency we get our theses done and live a little at the same time without the good doctor breathing down your neck joanna stared ahead with unseeing eyes while her brain conjured up images of venice shed visited the magical city once but only for a few days and that had been with her parents and siblings when shed been in high school she could picture the sparkle of the water of the grand canal as it reflected off the gothic facades with equally startling clarity she could remember the bustle of st marks square with the competing quartets from the two famous opposing coffeehouses shed told herself back then that she would return someday to that most romantic city of course that fantasy had included carlton who was not along at the time but whom she was already seeing and theres something else deborah said interrupting joannas brief reverie giving a few eggs which by the way we have several hundred thousand of so they wont be missed will provide a tiny bit of satisfaction to our procreative urges now i know you are teasing me joanna said im not deborah insisted donating some eggs will mean that a few couples who couldnt have children will have them and these kids will have half our genes therell be a few half joannas and half deborahs wandering around i guess thats true joanna said in her minds eye she saw a little girl who looked something like herself it was a pleasant image until she saw the little girl was with two total strangers of course its true deborah said and the good part is that we dont have to change any diapers or lose any sleep what do you say we give it a whirl wait a minute joanna said she raised her hands as if to protect herself slow down assuming we got accepted which is hardly a sure thing given all the stipulations in the ad ive got a few major questions like what like how do we actually give the eggs i mean whats the procedure you know that im not fond of doctors and hospitals thats a fine thing for someone to say whos been dating a doctorintraining for the last half century its when im a patient that the trouble starts joanna said the ad says thered be minimal stimulation deborah said is that good absolutely deborah said usually they have to hyperstimulate the ovaries to get them to release a number of eggs and the hyperstimulation can cause problems in some people like pms from hell the hyperstimulation is done with strong hormones believe it or not some of the hormones come from menopausal italian nuns oh come on joanna complained im not that gullible i swear to god deborah said these menopausal nuns pituitaries are cranking out gonadal stimulating hormones to beat the band its extracted from their urine trust me ill take your word for it joanna said making an expression of disgust but getting back to the issue at hand why do you think the wingate people are not hyperstimulating i suppose theyre aiming for quality not quantity deborah said but im only guessing its a reasonable question to ask them how do they actually get the eggs im only guessing again but i believe it would be by needle aspiration i imagine theyd use ultrasound for a guide ugh joanna voiced with a shudder i definitely dont like needles and wed have to be talking about a mighty long needle where would they stick it i imagine vaginally deborah said joanna visibly shuddered again oh come on deborah said i suppose it wouldnt be a walk in the park but it cant be all that bad lots of women do it as part of in vitro fertilization and remember were talking about fortyfive thousand dollars thats worth a bit of discomfort would we be put to sleep i have no idea deborah said thats another question we could ask i cant believe youre serious about this but its a winwin situation wed get some serious money and a few couples would get children its like wed be paid to be altruistic i wish we could talk to somebody whos gone through it joanna said hey we might be able to do that deborah said the egg donation issue came up in a biology lab group discussion i was an instructor for last semester it was back when the wingate clinic had their first ad in the crimson one of the freshmen said shed been interviewed accepted and was going to do it what was her name i cant remember but i know how to find it she and her roommate were in the same lab section and both were terrific students it would be in my grade book for the course let me get it while deborah disappeared into her bedroom joanna tried to digest what had transpired in her life in the previous thirty minutes she felt shellshocked and a bit giddy events seemed to be transpiring at warp speed voila deborah called out from the bedroom a second later she appeared at the door with a softcover grade book open in her hand and made a beeline for the desk wheres the campus phone directory second drawer on the right joanna said whats the name kristin overmeyer deborah said and her roommate was jessica detrick they were lab partners and i gave them the highest grades in the class she got the phone book out and flipped to the appropriate page thats weird shes not in here how can that be maybe she dropped out of school joanna suggested i cant imagine deborah said like i said she was a dynamite student maybe the eggdonation ordeal was too much youre joking of course im joking joanna said but it is curious now i have to get to the bottom of this or youll use it as an excuse deborah said she rapidly flipped through the phone book found a number and dialed who are you calling jessica detrick deborah said maybe she can tell us how to get in touch with kristin provided the former roommates in her room studying on a friday night joanna listened after deborah gave her the thumbsup sign indicating that jessica had answered joannas interest peaked when deborahs expression clouded over and she started saying things like oh thats terrible and im sorry to hear that and what a tragedy after concluding a rather long conversation deborah replaced the receiver slowly then turned to look at joanna deep in thought she absently chewed the inside of her cheek well joanna demanded arent you going to clue me in whats the tragedy kristin overmeyer disappeared deborah said she and another freshman by the name of rebecca corey were last seen by a wingate clinic employee picking up an apparent hitchhiker just after leaving the clinic i heard about two students disappearing last spring joanna said i never knew the names what in gods name made them pick up a hitchhiker maybe they knew him its possible deborah said now it was her turn to shudder stories like that give me the creeps the women were never found what about their bodies just the car which belonged to rebecca corey it was found at a truck stop along the new jersey turnpike the women were never seen again nor any of their possessions like purses or clothing did kristin donate eggs a half dozen which her family sued to get possession of but which the clinic turned over voluntarily apparently the family wanted to have some say in who got them such a sad story so much for having someone to ask about the donation procedure joanna said we could always call the clinic and ask for the name of a previous donor deborah said if we call the clinic we could ask our questions to them directly joanna said if that goes well then maybe we could ask for a referral then youre willing to give it a try i suppose theres no harm in getting more information joanna said but im certainly not committing myself except for possibly a visit to the clinic all right deborah exclaimed she stepped over to joanna and highfived her venice here we come two october o am was a beautiful fall day with a riot of bright foliage stretching away from both sides of route as deborah and joanna sped northwest out of cambridge toward bookford massachusetts the sun was conveniently behind them although there were occasional flashes of glare reflecting off the windshields of the mass of commuter cars heading in the opposite direction into boston both women were wearing sunglasses and baseball caps there had been no conversation since they had rounded fresh pond each was engrossed in her own thoughts deborah was mainly marveling at how quickly everything had fallen into place as if the whole affair involving the wingate clinic had been preordained joannas musings were more inwardly focused she couldnt believe how much her life had changed in a week and yet how much at peace she felt on sunday when shed finally deemed herself emotionally capable of talking with carlton and handling what she expected would be his insistence on getting married in june he was in such a snit that hed refused to talk with her shed called and left messages for several days without result consequently theyd not talked for the entire week a fact which made joanna more convinced her sudden epiphany concerning her attitude toward marriage in general and to carlton in particular had been appropriate after all the episodes shed had to endure of what she had interpreted as rejection it seemed inappropriate that carlton would act negatively in this instance as far as she was concerned it was not a good sign communication had a high priority in joannas value system did you remember to bring that list of questions you wrote down deborah said i sure did joanna answered they were mostly questions about what to expect after the eggretrieval procedure and whether there would be any limitations concerning exercise etcetera deborah had been impressed at how responsive the wingate clinic proved to be she and joanna had called the number listed in the ad in the harvard crimson on monday morning and when they described themselves and their possible interest in donating eggs they were connected with a dr sheila donaldson who offered to visit them straight away less than an hour later the doctor had arrived at their craigie arms apartment and had impressed them with her professionalism in short order shed laid out the entire program and had effectively answered all the questions deborah and joanna had had up to that point we dont feel we have to hyperstimulate dr donaldson had said early in the discussion in fact we dont stimulate at all we call it our organic approach the last thing we want is to cause any problems with our donors which synthetic or pooled hormones can do but how can you be sure youll get any eggs at all deborah had asked occasionally we dont dr donaldson had said but youd still pay wouldnt you absolutely dr donaldson had said what kind of anesthesia is used joanna had asked it was her major concern that will be your choice dr donaldson had said but dr paul saunders the individual who does the retrievals prefers light general anesthesia at that point joanna had given deborah a thumbsup the day following the interview dr donaldson had called first thing in the morning to say that both women had been accepted and that the clinic would like to do the procedures as soon as possible preferably that week and in any case theyd like to hear back from the women that very day for the next several hours the women debated the pros and cons deborah was heavily in favor of going ahead with it eventually her enthusiasm won joanna over a call back to the clinic resulted in an appointment for that friday morning do you have any second thoughts about this joanna asked suddenly breaking a quarterhour silence not in the slightest deborah said especially thinking about that louisburg square apartment we looked at i hope someone doesnt nab it before we have the money in our hot little hands its also dependent on the seller willing to give us a second mortgage joanna said otherwise its far beyond our means the women had contacted real estate agents in both cambridge and boston and had seen a number of condo units for sale the one on louisburg square in beacon hill had impressed them the most it was one of bostons finest addresses centrally located and close to the red line subway which would whisk them over to harvard square in no time at all to tell you the truth im surprised the price is so reasonable i think its because its a fourthfloor walkup joanna said and because its so small especially the second bedroom yeah but that bedroom has the best view in the whole apartment plus the walkin closet you dont think walking through the kitchen to get to the bathroom is a problem id walk through someone elses apartment to get to the bathroom for a chance to live on louisburg square how would we decide who gets what bedroom joanna asked hey ill be happy with the smaller one if thats what youre worried about deborah said seriously absolutely deborah said maybe we could rotate somehow joanna suggested its not necessary deborah said id be perfectly happy with the smaller bedroom trust me joanna turned her head to look out the passengerside window the farther north they went the more intense the fall colors became the red of the maples was so bright it almost didnt look real especially when surcharged against the dark green of pine or hemlock trees youre not having second thoughts are you deborah questioned not really joanna said but its dizzying how quickly everything is happening i mean if everything goes according to plan by this time next week well not only be landowners well be in venice its like a dream deborah had gone online and had found surprisingly inexpensive seats to milan via brussels from milan they would take the train to venice arriving in the middle of the afternoon deborah had also found a small bedandbreakfast in the san polo sestiere near the rialto bridge where theyd stay until they could find an apartment i cant wait deborah exclaimed im psyched benvenuto a italia signorina she reached across and briefly tousled joannas coiffure joanna leaned to the side batted deborahs hand away and laughed mille grazie cara she said in a playfully sarcastic tone she then bent her head back and ran her fingers through her shoulderlength hair in hopes of returning it to some semblance of order i guess im a bit taken aback at how quickly the wingate clinic is making this all happen she said as she used the rearview mirror to inspect her efforts with her hair joanna was moderately obsessive about her hair and general appearance much more so than deborah who often teased her about it its probably the two clients who are pressuring them deborah said she readjusted the mirror did dr donaldson mention that joanna questioned no deborah answered i just assumed as much she did say that the clinic was only interested in two donors so were lucky we called when we did theres a sign that says bookford is the next exit joanna said pointing ahead the sign was small and set in front of a small clump of oak trees ablaze in lustrous orange i saw it deborah said as she put on the directional signal after another twenty minutes of driving along a narrow twolane road bordered with apple trees and stone fences that wound across a countryside of rolling hills and rustcolored cornfields the women entered a typical new england town at the outskirts there was a large billboard that said welcome to bookford massachusetts home of the bookford high school wildcats division ii state football champions the country road leading from the highway became main street and proceeded to bisect the town in a north and south direction it was lined with the usual bevy o turnofthepreviouscentury brickfronted stores about midway a large white steepled church stood behind a green across from i granite municipal building a swelling and noisy throng of schoolkids with bookbags were moving north along the sidewalks like migratory wingless birds its a cute town deborah commented as she leaned forward to get a better view through the windshield she slowed to less than twenty miles per hour it looks almost too cute to be real like its part of a theme park i didnt see any sign for the wingate clinic joanna commented hey did you hear the one about why it takes a hundred million sperm to fertilize one egg cant say that i have joanna said because none of them are willing to stop and ask directions joanna chuckled i suppose that means were going to stop youve got that right deborah said as she turned into a parking spot in front of the ritesmart drugstore there was angled parking up and down both sides of main street do you want to come in or wait here im not going to let you have all the fun joanna said as she alighted from the car the women had to dodge children chasing each other along the sidewalk their taunting yells and screeches were just shy of the auditory pain threshold and it was a relief for both women when the drugstore door closed behind them in contrast the interior of the store was engulfed in a relative hush adding to the calm was the fact that there were no customers there werent even any store personnel in sight after exchanging shrugs when no one appeared the two women walked down the central aisle toward the prescription section in the back of the store positioned on the counter was a bell which deborah struck decisively the noise was considerable in the comparable silence within moments a mostly bald obese man in a pharmacists tunic unbuttoned at the collar appeared through a pair of swinging doors like those leading into saloons in hollywood westerns although it was relatively cool in the store beads of perspiration stood out on his forehead can i help you ladies the proprietor asked cheerfully were looking for the wingate clinic deborah said no problem the proprietor said thats out in the cabot state mental hospital excuse me deborah said with surprise its in a mental institution yup the proprietor said old doc wingate bought or rented the whole damn place im not sure which nobody really knows not that it matters much oh i understand deborah said it used to be a mental institution yup the proprietor repeated for about a hundred years or so it was also a tb sanitarium seems that the people down in boston were eager to banish their mentally ill and people suffering with tuberculosis kinda locked em up in a fortress of sorts kinda outta sight outta mind a hundred years ago bookford was considered to be way out in the sticks boy times have sure changed now were a boston bedroom community they just locked these people up joanna questioned didnt they try to treat them i suppose the proprietor said but there wasnt much treatment back in those days well thats not entirely true they did a lot of surgery out there you know experimental stuff like collapsing the lungs of the people with tb and lobotomies on the crazies that sounds awful joanna said she shuddered i imagine it was the proprietor agreed well theres no tb or mental patients anymore deborah added of course not the proprietor said the cabot as we call it around here has been closed for twenty to thirty years i think it was in the seventies when the last patients were moved out you remember that was when the politicians began to seriously screw around with health care it was a tragedy of sorts i think they just bused the remaining patients back to boston and let em loose in the boston common i think that was a little before our time deborah said suppose youre right there the proprietor agreed could you tell us how to get to the cabot deborah asked sure as shooting the proprietor said which way you headed north deborah said perfect the proprietor said head up to the next traffic light and hang a right thats pierce street with the public library on the corner from the intersection you can see the cabots brick tower its about two miles east of town off pierce street you cant miss it the women thanked the pharmacist and retreated back to their vehicle sounds like a charming environment for an infertility clinic joanna said as she buckled her seat belt at least its no longer a tb sanitariumcummental institution deborah said as she backed out into the street for a moment there i was ready to head back to cambridge maybe we should joanna said youre not serious are you no not really joanna said but a place having a history like that gives me the willies can you imagine the horrors its witnessed i cant deborah said paul saunders put down the memorandum sheila donaldson had prepared for him and forcefully rubbed his eyes with the fingers of both hands keeping his elbows on his desk hed repaired to his fourthfloor tower office after spending several hours in the lab checking his embryo cultures for the most part they were doing reasonably well although not perfectly he feared it was due to the age and quality of the eggs a problem that he hoped to remedy shortly paul was an early riser his usual schedule was to get out of bed before five and be in the lab before six that way he could get a significant amount of work done prior to the patients arrival which generally began at nine that morning he was starting his clinical day early because two egg retrieval procedures were scheduled he liked to do retrievals as early as possible to ensure that the donors would have adequate time to recover from anesthesia to be discharged the same day inpatient accommodations were for emergencies only and even then paul preferred to refer them to the nearest acutecare hospital picking up the memorandum again and pushing back from the desk paul ambled over to the windows they were triplehung monsters that were considerably taller than pauls diminutive fivefootsix stature the view was the extensive lawn in front of the clinic that stretched down to the castiron razorwiretopped fence that encircled the entire grounds slightly to pauls left was the stone gatehouse from whence came the macadam drive it swept up toward paul and then curved away before disappearing from view to the left where there was parking on the south side of the building in the middle distance paul could see the spire of bookfords presbyterian church as well as the chimneys of a few of the towns taller buildings poking up through the fall colors in the far distance the foothills of the berkshire mountains were arranged along the horizon in the form of purple blips paul reread the memorandum pondered it for a moment then looked back out at the view he had every reason to be content things couldnt have been going better and the thought brought a smile to his doughy face it seemed incredible that only six years previously hed been essentially run out of illinois having lost his hospital privileges and barely keeping his medical license his lawyer at the time had told him it didnt look good so hed left and migrated east all because of a stupid fracas over his medicare and medicaid billing he had of course pushed the envelope but so had his obgyn colleagues in fact hed merely copied and then refined a practice that another group that occupied the same medical building was using why the government came after him was still a mystery one that could make him furious if he thought about it but he didnt need to not anymore now that things had turned out so rosy when he first arrived in massachusetts and was concerned that he might have difficulty getting licensed if the massachusetts medical board heard about his illinois problems paul had decided to continue his training by taking a fellowship in infertility it had been the best decision of his life not only had he avoided licensing problems but hed gained entry into a field that had no oversight to speak of professionally or businesswise on top of that it was amazingly lucrative for him infertility was a perfect match especially since by sheer luck of being at the right place at the right time hed come in contact with spencer wingate an established infertility specialist who was eager to semiretire lead the good life rest on his laurels do fundraisers and lecture by now paul was running the show in both the research and clinical realms whenever paul thought of the irony of his being a researcher it never failed to bring a smile to his face because hed never imagined himself in such a role hed been last in his class in medical school and had never had any research training hed even managed never to take a single course in statistics but it didnt matter in infertility the patients were desperate enough to try anything in fact they wanted to try new things what paul lacked in research experience he thought he made up for in imagination he knew he was making real progress on a lot of fronts that would eventually make him famous as well as rich turning back from gazing out over what he now thought of as his domain paul caught a fleeting glimpse of his image in an ornately framed mirror positioned between the two gigantic windows returning to peer directly at his reflection paul ran a hand up and down both cheeks he was surprised and concerned by the pastiness of his skin emphasized by his almostblack hair until he realized it was mostly due to the harsh fluorescent light coming from the banks of fixtures mounted on the high ceiling he laughed at his momentary concern he knew he was pale given his schedule his skin rarely saw the light of day much less real sun but he knew he didnt look as bad as the mirror suggested in his reflection his complexion matched his signature white forelock returning to the desk paul vowed to get down to florida sometime during the winter or maybe find an obgyn conference someplace in the sun where hed present some of his work he also thought that perhaps he should find the time to get some exercise since hed gained weight particularly around his neck of all places he hadnt exercised in years paul wasnt much of an athlete which had caused him serious distress in his south side chicago high school where athletics played a significant social role hed tried out for some of the teams but it had never worked and his efforts had only made him the butt of jokes let them see me now paul said out loud as he thought of the people whod teased him theyre probably bagging groceries he knew the twentieth reunion was coming up that june and he wondered if he should go just to flaunt his success in the faces of those bastards who had given him such a hard time paul picked up the phone and dialed the lab when it was answered he asked to speak to dr donaldson as he waited for her to come on the line he reread the memorandum he had in his hand what is it paul sheila asked without a preamble i got your memorandum paul said these two women who are coming in you think they are good candidates perfect sheila said both are healthy with normal habits absolutely no gyn problems theyre not pregnant both deny drugs or any medications of any kind and both are about midcycle are they both really graduate students thats affirmative so they must be smart without doubt but whats this about one wanting local anesthesia paul asked shes getting a phd in biology sheila said she knows something about anesthesia i made some suggestions but she didnt bite i figure carl can have a go but you tried paul persisted of course i tried sheila said irritably all right have carl talk to her paul said he hung up the phone without saying goodbye sheila could annoy him on occasion with her obvious jealousy that must be the tower the pharmacist was talking about deborah said pointing through the windshield theyd just made the turn onto pierce street from main and in the distance a narrow brick structure could be barely discerned poking up above its surrounding landscape if thats two or three miles away its got to be one tall tower from here its silhouette looks a little like the tower on the uffizi gallery in florence deborah said how apropos once they left the town behind the trees lining the road blocked any further view of the tower or the cabot complex itself until theyd passed a dilapidated red barn on the right around the next bend they came upon a sign for the wingate clinic on the left with an arrow pointing up a gravel road as soon as they turned onto the unpaved road they caught sight of the twostory gray granite gatehouse set back amongst the trees it was a heavy squat structure with small shuttered windows and a dark gray slate roof with elaborate finials at either end of the ridgepole the trim was painted black stone gargoyles stuck out from the corners as they approached they could see that the road led under the house into a tunnel where it was blocked by a heavy chainlink gate beyond the gate they could see a recently mowed lawn the only evidence the place was currently in use an imposing castiron fence topped with razor wire was attached to both sides of the gatehouse and ran off into the trees on either side deborah slowed then stopped my word she said that pharmacist wasnt joking when he said the inmates of the cabot were locked up in a fortress it almost looks like a prison theres certainly nothing welcoming about it joanna added how do you suppose we get in do you see a buzzer or do you think we have to call on a cell phone there must be a video monitor or something deborah suggested ill pull up to the gate deborah eased the car forward and nosed it into the tunnel the moment she stopped again a heavy paneled windowless door opened and out stepped a uniformed man clutching a clipboard he approached the drivers side window which deborah lowered can i help you the guard asked in a pleasant but nononsense tone he had on a shiny blackvisored hat similar to a policemans were here to see dr donaldson deborah said your names please the man asked deborah cochrane and joanna meissner deborah said the man consulted his clipboard checked off the two names then pointed with his pen through the gate follow the driveway to the right youll see the parking area someone will meet you there thank you deborah said the man didnt answer but instead touched the brim of his hat with a screeching sound the heavy chainlink gate began slowly to swing open did you see the gun the guard is packing deborah asked in a whisper when she had the window back up the guard was still standing off to the left it would be hard to miss it joanna said ive seen armed police in innercity hospitals deborah said but never at a rural medical clinic why on earth would they need so much security out here especially at an infertility clinic it makes you wonder if theyre more interested in keeping people out or keeping people in dont even joke like that deborah said she started forward through the open gate do you think they might be doing abortions too ive seen guards at abortion clinics in this state i couldnt think of anything more inappropriate at an infertility clinic i suppose youre right deborah agreed emerging from the tunnel and rounding a copse of evergreens the women got their first unobstructed view of the cabot it was an immense red brick structure four stories tall with a steeply peaked slate roof behind a crenellated cornice small barred windows and a soaring central tower the tower had larger multipaned windows without bars deborah slowed what a shock to see such a huge building sitting out here in the woods by itself curious design too seeing the tower up close id wager its a deliberate copy of the uffizis its so similar it cant have been by accident if my memory serves me its even got the same style clock although the one in the uffizi works ive seen other victorian buildings like this around massachusetts joanna said theres one out in worcester thats stone not brick and almost as big the difference is that its deserted at least this one is being used the wingate clinic must be awfully busy to use this much square footage joanna nodded following the driveway around the right side of the building deborah drove into a parking lot with a surprisingly large number of cars in it both women were quick to notice that a number of the vehicles were not the usual honda civics or chevy caprices one car stood out particularly among the mercedes porches and lexuses it was a burgundy bentley convertible good grief joanna commented do you see that bentley like with the guards gun it would be hard to miss its metallic paint was gleaming in the early morning sunlight do you have any idea how much that car costs joanna asked not in the slightest over three hundred thousand dollars gadzooks thats obscene especially at a medical establishment deborah parked in a plainly marked visitors spot as the women climbed from the car a porticoed door facing the parking lot opened a tall chestnuthaired whitecoated female figure appeared she waved now this greeting is the opposite extreme from what we experienced at the guardhouse deborah said she waved back as she and joanna started toward the door some fifty yards away it looks like dr donaldson i think youre right deborah said i hope we dont regret this joanna said suddenly she was walking with her head down to watch where her feet were going i have an uncomfortable feeling were making a big mistake deborah grasped her friend around her upper arm and pulled her to a halt what are you saying you dont want to go through with this if thats the case we should just turn around and drive back to boston i dont want you to think im putting any pressure on you because im not joanna squinted in the early morning sunlight at the slender doctor standing at the clinics door they were close enough now to be sure it was dr donaldson and they could tell the doctor was glad to see them a broad welcoming smile was fixed on her thin face talk to me girl deborah demanded giving joannas arm an additional squeeze joanna brought her attention around to deborah can you look me in the eye and say youre confident everything will be all right absolutely deborah said like ive said ten times for us its a winwin situation im talking about these procedures joanna said oh for goodness sake these retrievals are small potatoes women undergoing infertility treatment go through it multiple times on top of enduring tons of hormones for us its no big deal joanna hesitated her green eyes moved back and forth between deborah and dr donaldson as she mulled her embarrassing medical squeamishness she didnt even like getting a flu shot after a sigh she cleared her throat and managed a smile all right lets do it are you sure i mean you dont feel like youre being forced do you joanna shook her head im all right lets get it over with the women started walking again for a minute you had me scared deborah said i scare myself sometimes joanna commented three october am i trust your ride out from boston was without incident dr donaldson said as she closed the clinic door behind the women it was fine deborah said as she eyed a large unoccupied waiting room the furniture appeared to be expensive modern scandinavian which stood in sharp contrast to the period victorian architectural details a large ushaped receptionists desk stood empty in the center of the room leather upholstered chairs and couches lined the walls a generous display of current magazines were sprinkled around on coffee and side tables i realized this morning that id failed to give you directions dr donaldson said i apologize no need to apologize deborah said i should have asked but we had no trouble we stopped at the local pharmacy and asked very smart dr donaldson said she clasped her hands now first things first i trust that neither of you have had anything to eat since midnight deborah and joanna nodded excellent dr donaldson said let me give dr smith our anesthesiologist a call hed like to speak with you meanwhile if youd like to take off your coats and make yourselves comfortable well get things started while dr donaldson used the receptionists phone deborah and joanna removed their coats and hung them in a cloakroom are you all right deborah whispered to joanna in the background they could hear dr donaldson on the phone yeah im fine joanna answered why do you ask youre so quiet youre not changing your mind again are you no im just unnerved by this place joanna said lots of little surprises like armed guards even that furniture out there in the waiting room bothers me i know what you mean deborah agreed it looks like it cost a fortune but looks terrible in the environment its weird things like that usually dont bother me im sorry im such a basket case just try to relax and think about having coffee in piazza san marco returning to the main room they allowed dr donaldson to guide them over to a couch once seated she informed them that dr carl smith was on his way down she then asked if they had any questions how long do you suppose this will take joanna asked a retrieval only takes forty minutes or so dr donaldson said then well have you relax for a few hours to make sure the anesthesia has completely worn off youll be on your way before you know it will we be having the procedure at the same time joanna asked no dr donaldson said miss meissner youll be first since youll be having the light general anesthesia of course if miss cochrane would like to switch to general anesthesia then you two could decide whom you would prefer to be first im happy with the local anesthesia deborah said whatever you prefer dr donaldson said she looked from one woman to the other any other questions for the moment does the clinic occupy this whole building deborah asked heavens no this building is huge it used to house a large mental institution as well as a tb sanitarium so we heard deborah said the infertility clinic takes up two floors in this wing only dr donaldson explained we also have a few of the offices in the tower the rest of the facility is empty except for the old beds and a lot of the old equipment its almost like a museum how many people work here joanna asked we have about forty employees presently but the number has been steadily increasing for the exact count id have to check with helen masterson the acting head of personnel forty employees is a lot joanna said it must be a godsend to a small rural community like this one would think so dr donaldson said but in actuality we have a chronic problem recruiting help were forever advertising in the boston papers mostly for lab technicians and experienced admin people are you ladies interested in jobs dr donaldson smiled teasingly i dont think so deborah replied with a laugh the only department that isnt shorthanded is the farm dr donaldson added weve had no problem in that arena since day one the farm joanna asked what do you mean the farm the wingate clinic has a large animal farm dr donaldson explained its an integral part of our research efforts were interested in basic reproductive research in species besides homo sapiens really said joanna what other species are you looking at any species that are economically significant dr donaldson said cattle pigs poultry horses and of course were also very much involved with the reproduction of domestic pets such as cats and dogs where is this farm joanna asked on the property directly behind this main building which we affectionately call the monstrosity and past a dense stand of white pine the setting is rather idyllic theres a pond a dam and even an old mill in addition to the barns cornfields hayfields and paddocks the cabot institution sat on over two hundred acres with housing for its professional staff and its own farm to make it largely selfsufficient foodwise having the farm on the premises was one of the major reasons we leased the property it makes our research a lot more efficient to have the farm adjacent to the laboratory not to mention the housing you have a laboratory here deborah asked absolutely dr donaldson said a major lab im particularly proud of it probably because im mainly responsible for setting it up could we have a tour deborah asked i imagine that could be worked out dr donaldson said ah here comes dr smith the women turned to see a large heavyset man dressed in surgical scrubs enter the room carrying a clipboard just then the front door opened and a throng of employees swarmed in abuzz with conversation one woman headed for the receptionists desk while the rest crowded into the hall that smith had just exited joanna felt herself stiffen seeing the anesthesiologists operating room garb made the reality of the upcoming procedure more difficult to suppress after introducing himself and shaking hands with both women dr smith sat down crossed his legs and positioned the clipboard on his lap now then he said as he took one of the many pens from his breast pocket miss cochrane i understand your preference is local anesthesia correct deborah said may i ask why dr smith questioned i just feel more comfortable with it deborah answered i assume youve been informed that we prefer light general anesthesia for egg retrievals dr donaldson said as much deborah said she also said the decision was mine thats very true dr smith said at the same time id like to tell you why we prefer to have you asleep under light general anesthesia we do the retrieval under direct laparoscopic observation with local paracervical anesthesia the retrieval is done with an ultrasoundguided needle comparatively speaking its like working in the dark dr smith paused and smiled any questions about what ive said so far no deborah said simply theres one more issue dr smith said under local anesthesia we dont have the control of pain coming from intraabdominal manipulation in other words if we have any trouble getting to either ovary and have to do some maneuvers to make it possible you might experience some discomfort ill take my chances deborah said even considering the pain issue i think i can handle it deborah said i prefer to be awake dr smith glanced briefly at dr donaldson who shrugged he then went through a brief medical history with both women when he was finished he stood thats all i need for now ill have you two get changed and ill see you upstairs will i be getting a sedative joanna asked absolutely dr smith said it will be administered as soon as you get your iv any other questions for the moment when neither woman responded dr smith smiled and left dr donaldson then escorted the women down the main hall and into a separate smaller waiting room on one side were several changing cubicles with louvered doors and on the other a bank of lockers a rack of hospital johnnies paper slippers and bathrobes was next to the lockers a pleasantfaced petite nurse was restocking the patient apparel several gurneys were parked by the double swinging entry doors in the middle of the room were a grouping of chairs a couch and a coffee table littered with magazines dr donaldson introduced the women to the nurse whose name was cynthia carson she in turn supplied the women with sets of the inpatient hospital garb gave each of them a key to a locker along with advice to pin the keys to their johnnies and opened the doors of two adjacent changing cubicles at that point dr donaldson took her leave a few moments later cynthia also left to get the iv supplies she said shed be right back that was a rather hard sell for general anesthesia joanna called out from her stall you can say that again deborah agreed the women stepped out from their respective changing rooms each holding her thin bathrobe closed with one hand and clutching her street clothes with the other they burst out laughing when they saw each other i hope i dont look as pathetic as you joanna managed i hate to break it to you deborah responded but you do they went to the lockers to secure their belongings why didnt you give in and take the general anesthesia joanna asked youre not going to start in on me too are you deborah asked the anesthesiologists points made a lot of sense to me joanna said especially when he explained about pain from intraabdominal manipulation it was enough to make me feel lightheaded dont you think you should reconsider listen deborah said as she slammed the locker door and yanked out the key she faced her friend her cheeks had a sudden flush you and i have already had this discussion i have this thing about being put to sleep call it a phobia you dont like needles and i dont like anesthesia okay okay joanna said jeez calm down im the one whos supposed to be unnerved by this not you deborah sighed she closed her eyes briefly and shook her head im sorry i didnt mean to snap at you i suppose im on edge too no need to apologize joanna said at that moment cynthia reappeared with an armload of paraphernalia which she dumped on one of the gurneys in her other hand she had an iv bottle which she proceeded to hang on the gurneys iv pole which one of you is miss meissner she called out joanna raised her hand cynthia patted the gurneys padded surface covered with a fresh bedsheet how about hopping up here on this contraption so i can start an iv then im going to be giving you a cocktail that will make you feel like its new years eve deborah reached out and gave her friends arm a squeeze as they exchanged a compassionate glance joanna then did as she was told deborah came around to stand on the other side of the gurney cynthia went through the preparations of starting the iv with a practiced economy of motion at the same time she kept up a distracting stream of conversation about the weather and before joanna had a chance to work herself up into a dither cynthia was already putting a tourniquet around joannas left arm just below the elbow joanna averted her face and grimaced as the needle broke the skin the next instant the tourniquet was gone and cynthia was applying tape there at least thats done cynthia said joanna turned her face reflected her surprise is the iv in already yup cynthia said cheerfully as she drew up medication in two syringes here comes the fun part but just to be onehundredpercent sure you have no allergies to any medication isnt that right thats right joanna said cynthia bent over the iv port and took the cap off the first syringe what am i getting joanna asked you really want to know cynthia asked she finished with the first and started with the second yes diazepam and fentanyl how about in english valium and an opioid analgesic ive heard of valium whats the other stuff its in the morphine family cynthia said the nurse quickly cleaned up the wrappers and other debris and threw it all into a special receptacle while she made an entry onto the clipboard that shed pulled from beneath the gurneys pad the door opened to the hallway and another patient walked in she smiled at the women went to the clothes rack for a set of the hospital patient clothes then disappeared into one of the changing rooms do you think shes another donor joanna asked ive no idea deborah said thats dorothy stevens cynthia said in a hushed voice as she went around to the head of the gurney and unlocked the wheels shes a wingate client whos here for yet another embryo transfer the poor dear has suffered a lot of disappointment am i going already joanna asked as the gurney began to move yes indeed cynthia said i was told they were eagerly awaiting your arrival when i went out to get the iv material can i go along deborah asked shed taken hold of joannas hand im afraid not cynthia said you stay and relax youll be going up yourself before you know it ill be all right joanna said with a smile to deborah i already feel that opioid stuff its not half bad either deborah gave joannas hand a final squeeze before the doors swung shut deborah caught a glimpse of joanna merrily waving to her over her shoulder deborah turned back to the room she walked over to the couch and sat down heavily she was hungry from not having eaten anything since before going to bed the night before she picked up several magazines but found she could not concentrate not with her stomach growling instead she tried to picture where they were taking joanna in the huge old white elephant of a building tossing the magazines aside she glanced around the room there was the same jarring disjuncture between the elaborate crown molding and trim and the furniture as there had been out in the main waiting room joanna had been right the wingate was a place filled with contrasts that were vaguely unsettling as much as joanna deborah was looking forward to having the egg retrieval procedures behind them one of the changing room doors opened and dorothy washburn emerged clutching her clothes she smiled at deborah before heading over to the lockers to store them deborah watched her and wondered what it was like to contend with continued infertility treatment and continual disappointment dorothy locked the locker then came over to the sitting area while pinning the locker key to her johnny en route she picked up a magazine sat down and began to flip through the pages apparently sensing deborahs stare she raised her strikingly cerulean eyes this time it was deborahs turn to smile she then introduced herself and dorothy did the same for a few minutes the two women indulged in light conversation after a pause deborah asked dorothy if shed been a patient of the wingate clinic for some time unfortunately i have dorothy said has it been a pleasant experience i dont think pleasant is the right word dorothy said its not been an easy road by any stretch of the imagination but to the wingates credit they did warn me anyway my husband and i are not about to give up at least not yet or at least not until weve used up all our credit youre having an embryo transfer today deborah asked she was reluctant to admit she already knew my ninth dorothy said she sighed and then held up crossed fingers good luck deborah said sincerely i could use some deborah imitated the crossedfingers gesture is this your first time to the wingate dorothy asked it is deborah admitted for both myself and my roommate im sure youll be satisfied with your choice dorothy said are you both doing in vitro no deborah said were egg donors we responded to an ad in the harvard crimson thats wonderful dorothy said with unabashed admiration what a loving gesture you are going to give hope to some desperate couples i applaud your generosity deborah suddenly felt uncomfortably venal she hoped to change the subject before her true motive for donating was revealed luckily she was saved by cynthias abrupt return the nurse burst through the swinging doors without warning okay dorothy cynthia called out with great enthusiasm youre on get yourself down there to the transfer room theyre all ready for you dorothy stood took a deep breath and then headed out the door shes quite a soldier cynthia remarked as the door swung shut i sure hope this turns out to be a successful cycle if anyone deserves it she does how much does a cycle cost deborah asked concern about her venality had brought the issue of economics to the fore it varies quite a bit depending on what procedures are involved cynthia said but on average its around eight to ten thousand dollars oh my goodness deborah commented that means dorothy and her husband have spent nearly ninety thousand dollars probably more cynthia said that doesnt include the initial infertility workup or any ancillary treatments that might have been indicated infertility is an expensive undertaking for couples especially since insurance doesnt usually cover it most couples have to come up with the cash somehow two more patients entered and cynthias full attention immediately turned to them she took the womens paperwork glanced at it briefly got them apparel and directed them into changing rooms deborah was surprised at the apparent age of one of them she couldnt be sure but she thought the woman looked old like she was in her middle to late fifties feeling restless deborah got to her feet excuse me cynthia deborah said the nurse was reading the patients paperwork more thoroughly dr donaldson mentioned that i could have a tour of the laboratory who should i see about it thats a request i havent had before cynthia said she thought for a moment i guess you could try claire harlow in public relations she gives tours to prospective patients although i dont know if that includes the lab or not if you dont mind walking around in your robe you can go out to the receptionist in the main waiting room and have her page miss harlow you dont have a lot of time so i wouldnt go far i imagine theyll be calling for you in another fifteen minutes or so despite the warning about time deborah had to do something following cynthias suggestion she retraced her steps out to the main waiting room and had the public relations person paged while she waited for the page to be returned she noticed that quite a few patients had arrived since she and joanna had passed through there was not much conversation most of the women were reading the magazines a few were blankly staring ahead claire harlow was a softspoken gentle accommodating woman who seemed pleased to take deborah up a floor and show her the main lab as dr donaldson had suggested it was huge extending along the back of the building for almost the entire wing occupied by the wingate deborah was duly impressed having spent many hours in biology labs she knew for the most part what she was looking at the equipment was the newest and best available and included surprising things like automated dna sequencers the other surprise was how few people were in the mammoth room where is everybody deborah asked the doctors are all doing various clinical procedures at the moment claire answered deborah strolled along a long countertop supporting more dissecting microscopes than shed seen in any one place before they were also more powerful than the microscopes deborah had had the pleasure of using an army could work in here deborah said were always looking for qualified people claire said deborah came to the end of the lab bench and glanced out the window it faced out the back of the building and offered an impressive view it was particularly expansive because the building sat on the spine of a hill with lawn sloping away in both the front and the back northward through a tangle of orange oaks and red maples deborah could make out stone buildings similar to the gatehouse but with white trim are those buildings part of the farm deborah asked no those are some of the living quarters claire explained pointing off to the right in a southeastern direction to where the property sloped down even more dramatically than elsewhere she directed deborahs attention to a shimmering of light just visible through oldgrowth pines that sparkle is sun reflecting off the surface of the mill pond the farm buildings are grouped around it whats the story with the brick chimney spewing smoke deborah questioned gesturing toward a smokestack rearing up above the trees even farther to the right is that part of wingate complex as well the smoke was white as it left the chimney but faded to a dark purplishgray as it trailed off in the distance toward the east it certainly is claire said thats the old power plant for heat and hot water its a rather interesting structure it was also the crematorium for the cabot institution crematorium deborah sputtered why on earth did they have a crematorium out here out of necessity i guess claire said back in the olden days i think a lot of the patients were essentially abandoned by their families deborah cringed at the thought of an isolated mental hospital with its own crematorium but before she could ask another question claires pager went off the woman checked the lcd window thats for you miss cochrane theyre ready for your procedure deborah was pleased she was eager to get it over with so she and joanna could be on their way four october o am there was no transition period one minute joanna was fast asleep and the next she was fully awake she found herself staring up at a high unfamiliar embossedtin ceiling well well the sleeping beauty has awakened a voice said joanna turned in the direction of the voice and found herself looking up into an equally unfamiliar face at the exact instant she was going to ask where she was her momentary confusion was replaced by full comprehension of her situation lets get your blood pressure the nurse said as he took his stethoscope from around his neck and put the earpieces into his ears he was an impeccably groomed individual close to joannas age dressed in surgical scrubs his name tag said myron hanna he began inflating a blood pressure cuff already present around joannas left upper arm joanna watched the mans face his eyes were glued to the pressure gauge while he pressed the stethoscopes bell against the crook of her elbow as the cuff deflated she felt her pulse surge through her arm the man smiled and removed the apparatus your blood pressure is fine he said he then reached for her wrist to time her pulse joanna waited until he was through what about my procedure she asked your procedure is all done myron said as he recorded his findings on a clipboard youre joking joanna said she had no appreciation of the passage of time nope youre all done myron repeated and it was successful i assume dr saunders must be pleased i cant believe it joanna said my roommate told me when you wake up from anesthesia youre sick to your stomach thats rare nowadays myron said not with propofol isnt it great stuff is that what i had yup what time is it a little after nine do you know if my roommate deborah cochrane has had her procedure shes having it as we speak myron said how about sitting up for me on the side of the bed joanna did as she was told her mobility was limited by the iv still attached to her right arm how do you feel myron asked any dizziness any discomfort i feel fine joanna said perfectly normal she was surprised especially by the lack of pain why dont you sit there for a few minutes myron suggested then if you are okay well yank the iv and send you downstairs to change back into your street clothes fine by me joanna said as myron recorded her blood pressure and pulse she glanced around at her surroundings there were three other beds besides hers none was occupied the room was antiquated it had clearly missed whatever facelift other parts of the institute had received old tile lined the walls and floors the windows looked old and the sinks were made of soapstone the ersatz recovery room reminded her of the archaic operating theater where shed had her procedure and the thought gave her a shudder it was the kind of or in which she could imagine lobotomies being performed against vulnerable patients wishes when shed first been wheeled in the setting had reminded her of a gruesome severalhundredyearold painting shed seen once of an anatomy lesson in the painting the tiers of seats disappearing up into the darkness were occupied by leering men gazing down at a skinned ghastly pale corpse the door to the recovery room opened joanna turned and spotted a short man with a shock of dark hair his pale complexion made her think again of the old anatomy lesson painting she saw hed stopped short and his surprised expression quickly changed to irritation he was attired in a long doctors white coat over green surgical scrubs hello dr saunders myron said looking up from the desk mr hanna i thought you told me the patient was still asleep dr paul saunders snapped his eyes stayed glued to joannas she was sir when we spoke myron said she just woke up and everything is fine joanna felt acutely uncomfortable under the mans unblinking gaze joanna had reflexive visceral reaction to authority figures thanks in part to her emotionally distant staunchly disciplinarian oilcompanyceo father blood pressure and pulse are all normal myron said he stood up and started forward but stopped when dr saunders held up his hand the doctor advanced toward joanna with his mouth set his nose had a wide base that gave the false impression of closely spaced eyes but by far his most distinguishing characteristics were irises of slightly different colors and a minute widows peak of white hair that quickly lost itself in the rest of his mildly unruly coiffure how do you feel miss meissner paul asked joanna noticed his tone was devoid of emotion similar to the tone her father had used to ask her how her day had been back when she was in elementary school okay she answered unsure if the man cared particularly or even wanted her to respond marshaling her courage she asked are you the doctor who did my egg retrieval shed been put to sleep before pauls arrival into the operating room yes paul replied in a manner which discouraged further questions would you mind if i had a look at your abdomen i suppose not joanna said she glanced at myron who immediately came around the other side of the bed he encouraged her to lie back supine and then pulled the sheet up to her waist to cover her legs paul gently pulled up the johnny being careful to keep the sheet covering joannas lower half in place and gazed down at joannas exposed midriff joanna lifted her head to look herself there were three bandaids one was directly below her navel and the other two were in the lower quadrants forming an equilateral triangle no sign of any bleeding myron said and the gas has been absorbed paul nodded he pulled the johnny back to cover joannas abdomen and turned to leave dr saunders joanna called out impulsively paul stopped and turned back how many eggs did you get i cant remember exactly paul said five or six is that good its perfectly adequate paul said a faint smile graced his heretofore grim expression then he left hes not much of a conversationalist joanna commented hes a busy man myron said he pulled the sheet back to expose her legs why dont you stand up and see how that feels i think youre about ready to have that iv taken out does dr saunders do all the egg retrievals joanna asked as she sat up and dropped her feet over the side of the bed then she slid off to stand while holding the johnny closed behind her back with her left hand he and dr donaldson do them together do you think his coming in here means my roommates procedure is done that would be my guess myron said how do you feel any dizziness at all joanna shook her head then lets get that iv out and get you on your way fifteen minutes later joanna was at the locker extracting her clothing shoes and bag there were four other patients in hospital garb sitting on the couches and chairs and flipping through magazines none of them paid her any attention deborahs locker was still locked up tight as joanna entered the same changing room shed used earlier cynthia arrived with deborah in tow deborahs face lit up with a broad smile when she caught sight of joanna and she immediately rushed over to squeeze into the changing room she closed the door behind her how did it go for you deborah demanded in a whisper it wasnt bad at all joanna answered unsure why they were whispering the anesthesiologist said i might feel a little burning in my arm when he gave me the milk of amnesia but i didnt feel a thing i dont even remember going to sleep milk of amnesia deborah questioned what the hell is that its what the anesthesiologist called the medicine he gave me joanna said it was so rapid it was like somebody just turned out the lights i didnt feel a thing through the whole procedure and on top of that im happy to report i didnt have any nausea when i woke up not even a little queasiness nothing and i woke up the same way i went to sleep really suddenly joanna snapped her fingers to emphasize her point the whole experience was benign how was yours truly a piece of cake deborah said no worse than a routine pap smear no pain a little i suppose when the local anesthetic went in but that was it the worst part was the humiliation of being looked into how many eggs did they get i havent the slightest idea deborah admitted i assume only one thats how many we women put out each month without hormonal hyperstimulation they got five or six from me well arent we impressed deborah said in a playfully sarcastic tone how do you know i asked joanna said the doctor came by when i was in the recovery room his names dr saunders you must have met him because hes the one who does the egg retrievals along with dr donaldson was this dr saunders a rather short guy with unusual eyes hes the one i think hes also kinda strange as well as quiet what was weird was that he seemed to act mad when he found out i was already awake get out of here deborah blurted im serious the reason im surprised is that he acted mad with me too no kidding joanna said then hes definitely got a problem which is reassuring because i was wondering if i was making it up you know me with authority figures all too well deborah said and you think he was irritated because you were awake yes joanna said he snapped at the nurse because the nurse had told him a few minutes earlier on the phone that i was still asleep i suppose he had it in his mind to breeze in and breeze out instead he had to relate to me such as it was thats absurd deborah said the nurse excused his behavior by saying he was a busy man he was equally inappropriate with me like everybody else hed started in about wanting to use general anesthesia and how much better it would be but i just said no way so he got mad and you know what it dawned on me why they had me suffer not eating or drinking since midnight they thought they were going to talk me into it you didnt have it did you hell no deborah said i told them i was ready to get up and walk out and i came close if it hadnt been for dr donaldson who smoothed things over i think i would have but anyway it all worked out lets get out of here joanna said im with you deborah responded she opened the louvered changing room door winked at joanna and disappeared joanna could hear deborah out in the waiting room banging open her locker as joanna peeled off the hospital clothing and tossed it into a convenient hamper for a moment she gazed at herself in the changing rooms fulllength mirror the thought of the small incisions beneath the bandaids made her shudder they stood as minute reminders that someone had recently been looking into her innards the crash of the neighboring louvered door closing snapped joanna back to reality fearful of keeping deborah waiting who was notoriously quick at dressing joanna concentrated on getting into her clothes once that was accomplished she began brushing out her hair which shed pulled back into a ponytail for the procedure but which was now a mass of snarls before she was finished she heard deborah emerge into the waiting room how are you doing in there deborah called through the door almost ready joanna answered her hair was giving her more trouble than usual with loose ends dangling in her face shed had bangs in high school that shed grown out in college after a last check in the mirror she finally opened the changing room door deborah rewarded her with an exasperated expression i hurried joanna said sure you did deborah said as she got to her feet you should try short hair like mine youll save yourself a lot of grief its ten times easier never joanna said jokingly but she meant it despite the difficulties she treasured her long hair the two women called out a thank you to cynthia and she waved in acknowledgment the women sitting on the couch and the chairs looked up several smiled but all had returned to their reading before joanna and deborah had passed through the swinging doors i just realized theres something we forgot to ask about deborah said as they walked down the main hallway do i have to ask or are you just going to tell me joanna said with a sigh when deborah failed to complete her thought she found it mildly irksome that deborah had a tendency not to finish a thought unless prompted we forgot to ask how or when we were going to be paid its certainly not going to be in cash joanna said i know that deborah grumbled it will be by check or wire joanna said all right but when the contracts we signed stipulated we would be paid when we had performed our service which weve now done so theyll pay us now you seem to be more trusting than i deborah said i think we should inquire about it before we leave that goes without saying joanna said i think we should page dr donaldson if shes not out in the main waiting room the two women came to the threshold of the waiting room and glanced around the generous space nearly every seat was taken there were spotty areas of hushed conversation but in general the room was surprisingly quiet for being so crowded well no dr donaldson deborah said her eyes swept the room once again to be certain so lets have her paged joanna said together they approached the central desk the receptionist was an attractive young amply endowed redhead she had pouty full lips like many of the women gracing the covers of the magazines displayed in the grocery checkout line her nameplate said rochelle millard excuse me joanna said to get the womans attention she was surreptitiously reading a paperback book cradled in her lap the book disappeared as if by magic can i help you rochelle asked joanna asked for dr donaldson to be paged are you joanna meissner rochelle questioned joanna nodded rochelles eyes switched to deborah are you miss cochrane i am deborah said i have something for each of you from margaret lambert the comptroller rochelle opened a drawer to her right and pulled out two envelopes with cellophane windows neither was sealed she handed them to the surprised women after exchanging a covert conspiratorial smile the two women peeked inside their respective envelopes a moment later their eyes met with new smiles bingo deborah said to joanna she laughed then she turned to the receptionist and said mille grazie signorina partiamo a italia the first part means a thousand thanks in italian joanna said the rest im not sure about and forget about paging dr donaldson its not necessary leaving the confused receptionist joanna and deborah started for the door i feel a little like a thief taking this kind of money out of here deborah said sotto voce as they wended through the crowded room like joanna she was clutching her envelope in her hand she avoided eye contact with anyone fearing she might be forced to face someone whod had to mortgage her home to pay for infertility treatment with this many patients here i think the wingate can afford it joanna responded im getting the distinct feeling this business is a virtual money machine besides its the prospective clients who are actually paying us not the clinic thats just the point deborah said although i suppose those people choosey enough to demand a harvard coeds egg cant be hurting for cash exactly joanna said concentrate on the idea that we are helping people and they in their gratitude are helping us its hard to feel altruistic getting a check for fortyfive thousand dollars deborah said maybe i feel more like a prostitute of sorts than a thief but dont get me wrong im not complaining when the couples get their children theyll be thinking they got the better deal by a long shot you know i think you are right deborah said im going to stop feeling guilty they emerged into the crisp new england morning deborah was about to descend the stairs when she became aware that joanna was hesitating glancing at her friends face she noticed that joanna was grimacing whats the matter deborah asked with concern i just had a pang down here in my lower abdomen joanna said she gestured with her left hand over the area i even felt a twinge in my shoulder of all places do you still feel it yes but its better do you want to go back and see dr donaldson joanna tentatively pushed against her lower belly just in from the crest of her left hip there was a mild degree of discomfort until she let go then she got another stab of pain a whimper escaped from her lips are you all right joanna joanna nodded like the first spasm the pain had been fleeting except for a remaining mild ache lets go page dr donaldson deborah said she grasped joannas arm with the intention of leading her back into the wingate clinic but joanna resisted it doesnt feel that bad joanna said lets go to the car are you sure joanna nodded again gently extracted her arm from deborahs grip and started down the steps at first it felt decidedly better to walk slightly bent over but after a half dozen steps she was able to straighten up and walk relatively normally how does it feel now deborah questioned pretty good joanna asserted dont you think it would be a better idea to go back in and see dr donaldson just to be on the safe side i want to get home joanna said besides dr smith specifically warned me about having the kind of pain im experiencing so its not as if its unexpected he warned you about pain deborah asked with surprise joanna nodded he wasnt sure which side i would feel it on but he said id have a deep ache with some stabs of sharp pain which is right on the money the surprise for me is that i didnt feel it until now did he have any suggestions for what to do for it he thought ibuprofen would suffice but he said that if it didnt i could have a pharmacist call him through the clinics telephone number he said hes available twentyfour hours a day thats strange they gave you a warning about pain deborah said nobody warned me and i havent had any i think maybe you should have insisted on local anesthesia like i did very funny joanna said i liked being asleep through the ordeal it was worth a bit of pain and the mild inconvenience of having to get three stitches removed where did you have stitches at the peephole sites are you going to have to come back here to get them removed deborah asked they told me any medical person could do it joanna said if carlton and i are talking by then he can do it for me otherwise ill just stop in the health service they reached the car and deborah went around to the passenger side to open the door for her roommate she even supported joannas arm as joanna climbed in i still think you should have had local anesthesia she said youre never going to convince me joanna said with conviction of that she felt sure five may oo o pm a shudder rippled through the plane signaling the start of a period of mild clear air turbulence joanna lifted her eyes from the paperback book she was reading to glance around the cabin to make sure no one else was concerned she didnt like turbulence it reminded her that she was suspended far above the earth and not being of a scientific mind she didnt mink it was reasonable that an object as heavy as a plane could actually fly no one had paid the few bumps and thuds any notice least of all deborah sitting next to her who was enviably asleep her roommate hardly looked her best her now shoulderlength mane of almostblack hair was tousled and her mouth was slightly agape knowing deborah as well as she did joanna knew shed be mortified if she could see herself although the thought of awakening her passed through joannas mind she didnt instead she found herself marveling at the transposition of their respective hairstyles deborahs was now long while joanna had spent the last six months with her hair short even shorter than deborahs had been back when they had lived in cambridge switching her attention to the window joanna pressed her nose up against the glass by doing so she could see the ground thousands upon thousands of feet below and just as it had been fifteen or twenty minutes ago it was featureless tundra interspersed with lakes having consulted the map in the airline magazine joanna knew they were flying over labrador en route to bostons logan airport the trip had seemed interminable and joanna was antsy and looking forward to their arrival it had been almost a year and a half since theyd left and joanna was eager to set foot in the good old usa she had resisted coming back to the states for the duration despite her mothers recurrent pleading which was particularly insistent during the christmas holiday seasons the holidays were a big deal in the meissner household and joanna missed them especially when deborah had gone back to new york to be with her mother and stepfather but joanna had been unwilling to face her mothers constant harping about the unmitigated social disaster caused by her breaking off the engagement with carlton williams as theyd originally planned she and deborah had gone to venice italy to escape the humdrum aspect of their graduate student lives and to make sure joanna didnt have a relapse into believing that marriage was a necessary goal at first they lived for almost a week in the san polo district near the rialto bridge in the bedandbreakfast that deborah had found on the internet after that theyd moved to the dorsoduro sestiere on the recommendation of a couple of male university students theyd met on their second day while having coffee in piazza san marco with a bit of luck and a lot of walking they had managed to locate a small affordable twobedroom apartment on the top floor of a modest fourteenthcentury house on a square called campo santa margherita as serious students the women had quickly adapted to a strict schedule to facilitate their work every morning they made themselves get out of bed by seven regardless of the previous evenings festivities after a shower theyd descend to the campo and take a short walk to a traditional italian bar for fresh cappuccinos which was particularly pleasant in the summer months when theyd sit in the shade of the squares plane trees then it was on to the rio di san barnaba to complete their colazione with fresh fruit purchased from the waterborne greengrocers or verduriere a half hour later they were back in the apartment at their respective workstations to write without fail they wrote until one oclock in the afternoon only then did they turn off their laptops after washing up and changing clothes they headed to the restaurant theyd picked out for that days lunch which often included a glass or two of white wine from friuli then it was time to switch hats from committed doctoral students to tourists armed with a virtual library of guidebooks theyd set out to visit the sites three afternoons a week they went to the university itself where theyd arranged to have italian lessons as well as lectures on venetian art the womens italian sojourn wasnt all work and serious touring socially they had a blast dating almost exclusively italian men who were associated in some way with the university deborahs first beau was a graduate student in art history who was also a gondolier in season joanna began seeing an instructor in the same department but neither woman allowed herself to become terribly involved maintaining as deborah described it a decidedly male attitude toward dating namely treat it like a sport joanna sighed when she thought of all the wonderful sights they had seen and experiences theyd had it had been an extraordinary year and a half in every way including professionally tucked in their carryons stored above in the overhead compartment were two completed phd theses thanks to email which had facilitated sending chapters and their revisions back and forth the theses had already been accepted all that was left were their defenses which both women were confident would not be a problem a week after they got back both had interviews scheduled joanna at the harvard business school and deborah at genzyme even carlton had come for several visits the first time it had been totally out of the blue and it had made joanna furious before leaving for europe shed tried a number of times to call him but he had gone out of his way to avoid her and had staunchly refused to return her messages after finding the apartment joanna had written a letter to give him the address so he could write to her when he felt he wanted to do so instead hed just shown up and rung the doorbell one foggy rainy winter day if it hadnt been for a sense of guilt over how far carlton had come to visit joanna wouldnt have seen him on that trip as it was she let him stew in his room at the gritti palace for a number of days before calling they met for lunch at harrys bar carltons choice and although the conversation was painful at first they managed to come to an understanding of sorts which at least began a correspondence the correspondence had led to two other visits by carlton to la serenissima as the venetians of old had called their fair city each visit was more pleasant than the previous for joanna yet not entirely comfortable the perspective of her year abroad made her view carlton as being progressively limited by the dedication medicine required yet the ultimate result of the contact was a truce in which they admitted they cared for one another but felt their current unengaged status was appropriate enabling each to pursue their own interests another series of bumps and thuds made joanna again glance around the planes interior she was amazed that no one else appeared to be upset then the turbulence ended as suddenly as it had begun joanna looked out the window again but nothing had changed she wondered how clear air could possibly make the plane behave as if it were a land vehicle driving over potholes as the flight grew calmer joanna couldnt dismiss the nagging feeling that her life was not complete despite all the gaiety the traveling and the intellectual stimulation deborah was convinced that joannas restlessness had something to do with her rejection of traditional female goals house husband children but joanna had located a different source seeing the italians continual love affair with infants left her wondering about the fate of her harvested eggs increasingly she was tempted to find out what became of them for a long time deborah poohpoohed her curiosity but on the eve of their homecoming her friend had surprised her with a stunning reversal wouldnt it be interesting to find out what kind of children resulted from our eggs she asked over their last venetian supper joanna had put her glass of wine down and had looked into her roommates dark eyes for some explanation she was confused shed asked the same question a month previously and it had evoked an angry reaction with deborah accusing her of being obsessed what do you think are our chances of finding anything out deborah asked seemingly oblivious to joannas reaction it might be hard considering the contracts we signed joanna said yeah but that was more to ensure our anonymity deborah said we didnt want anyone coming after us for child support or anything like that i think it works both ways joanna said the wingate clinic certainly didnt want us coming after the kids and demanding maternal rights i suppose youre right deborah said too bad though it would be interesting even if it were only to be sure we can have kids you know there are no guarantees of fertility these days im sure all those people we saw out there in the wingate clinic would attest to that i can imagine joanna said still bewildered by deborahs turnaround id like to find out myself so how about we call the wingate when we get back and see what they say there cant be any harm in asking good idea deborah had said that was a day and an ocean ago now the planes intercom system crackled to life and brought joanna back to the present the captains voice announced that they were soon to start their initial descent into boston he added that he was going to turn on the seatbelt light and he wanted to make sure that everyone was buckled up joanna checked her seat belt to make certain it was fastened as a rule she always wore her seat belt during flights whether the seatbelt light was on or not a quick glance at deborahs revealed it too was secure returning her attention to the view out the window she noticed thered been a change the tundra had been replaced by dense forest broken by widely spaced farms she guessed they were over maine which was a good sign as far as she was concerned it meant that massachusetts wasnt that far off here comes my last bag deborah shouted she dashed back to the baggage carousel from where she and joanna had been searching through a pile of suitcases she pulled the bursting bag free and lugged it over to where she and joanna had amassed their others once theyd loaded them onto two carts they stood in line for customs well here we are back in beantown deborah commented as she ran her hand through her long thick hair what a great flight it seemed a lot shorter than i expected not to me joanna said i wish i could have slept half the time you did planes put me to sleep deborah said as if i couldnt tell joanna said enviously an hour later the two friends were in their twobedroom apartment on beacon hill newly vacated by the tenant theyd rented it to for their italian sojourn how about flipping a coin to see who gets which bedroom joanna suggested no way deborah responded i said id take the smaller bedroom and im fine with that are you sure absolutely for me a big closet and the view are more important than a space its the bathroom thats the problem joanna said the bathroom had two entrances one from the hall and one from the second bedroom in joannas mind that made the second bedroom far superior the smaller bedroom is fine by me trust me okay joanna said im not going to argue an hour later the women had distributed the furniture partially unpacked their luggage and had even made their respective beds when as deborah put it they ran out of gas realizing it was after ten oclock at night back in italy they collapsed on the sofa in the living room the bright midspring afternoon sun was still streaming in through the front windows to belie their exhaustion and jet lag what do you want to do about dinner deborah asked in a monotone theres something else i want to do before thinking about eating joanna said she pushed herself upright and stretched take a nap deborah asked nope joanna said i want to make a call she stood and walked across the room to pick up the phone from the floor they had no phone table where the phone jack was located they could have placed the desk there but had decided to put it on the other side of the room to keep glare from the window off the computer screen if you are going to call carlton im going to throw up joanna looked at her roommate as if shed gone crazy im not going to call carlton what makes you even suggest it she brought the phone back to the couch the phone was on a twentyfivefoot cord ive been worrying about you backsliding deborah said ive been noticing how many letters youve been getting lately from that boring doctorintraining and it worries me especially now that were back here in boston within a stones throw of his hospital joanna laughed you really think im spineless dont you i think of you as insufficiently girded against twentyfive years of maternal indoctrination joanna chuckled well for your information calling carlton never entered my mind what i want to do is call the wingate clinic do you have the number youre going to call already we just got home why not joanna said its been on my mind for months and yours too or so you said toss me my phone book deborah said without moving its on the top of the desk joanna did as she was told and while deborah looked up the number joanna sat back down next to her deborah found the number put her finger under it and held it up for joanna to see using the speakerphone button to get a dial tone joanna punched in the numbers the call went through and was picked up quickly joanna identified herself as a previous egg donor and said she wanted to speak to someone knowledgeable about the program there was no response did you hear me joanna questioned i heard you the operator said but i thought you were going to say something else im not sure what you are asking are you interesting in donating again possibly joanna said she glanced at deborah and shrugged but at the moment id like to speak with someone about my previous donation is anyone available is everything all right the operator asked are you having a problem no not really joanna said i just have a few questions id like answered perhaps i should page dr sheila donaldson joanna asked the woman to hold on and hit the mute button she glared at deborah what do you think i was hoping for a secretarial type not a doctor id guess that secretaries would defer to dr donaldson so we might as well speak to her directly i imagine it will save a step i suppose youre right joanna said she motioned toward the phone wait deborah said are you thinking about donating again not at all joanna said but i figured we might as well stay on their good side who knows it might help deborah nodded joanna pressed the mute button again and told the operator to go ahead and page dr donaldson do you want to hold on or should the doctor call you back ill hold on joanna said a moment later elevator background music emanated from the telephone maybe we should give the idea of donating again some thought deborah said i wouldnt mind being able to continue the lifestyle that ive become accustomed to she smiled teasingly youre joking joanna said not necessarily deborah said i wouldnt do it again joanna said ive appreciated the opportunities weve had thanks to the money but its not been without an emotional price maybe id consider it after i have some children of my own if thats going to happen but of course by then id probably be considered too old before deborah could respond dr donaldsons voice interrupted the music she identified herself with a degree of urgency and asked how she could be of assistance im a former egg donor at your institution joanna said it was quite a while ago but i have a question id like to ask whats the problem dr donaldson demanded impatiently the operator implied there was a problem i specifically told her there was no problem how long ago did you donate just about a year and a half what is your name dr donaldson asked her voice decidedly calmer joanna meissner my roommate and i came in together i remember you dr donaldson said i came in to visit you at your apartment in cambridge as i recall you had long blond hair and your roommate had short dark hair almost black the two of you were graduate students im impressed joanna said im sure you see a lot of people what is it youd like to ask joanna cleared her throat and then forged ahead wed like to find out what happened to our eggs you know how many children resulted and maybe even their sex im sorry but that information is confidential we dont need names or anything like that joanna persisted im sorry all information and i mean all information of that sort is strictly confidential can you at least tell us if children were born joanna asked it would be reassuring just to know if our eggs are healthy im sorry but we have stringent rules that preclude giving out any information whatsoever i dont know how to say it any clearer joanna made a look of exasperation hello dr donaldson deborah called out she leaned forward to speak directly into the speaker phone this is deborah cochrane and im here as well with joanna what if the children need genetic information for some reason from the biological mother or if they require a transplant bone marrow or a kidney joanna shuddered at the thought we keep a computerized record dr donaldson said in the unlikely event that something like what you are talking about were to occur we might contact you but that would be the only exception and it is extremely unlikely and even if it were to happen the involved parties would still have the option of remaining anonymous we would not give any of the information out deborah threw up her hands the only time the situation is different is when one of our clients finds their own donor dr donaldson continued but that is a completely different circumstance its called an open donation thank you dr donaldson joanna said im sorry joanna pressed the speaker phone button to disconnect well thats that deborah said with a sigh im not giving up so easily joanna said the possibility that ive got progeny out there has eaten up too much emotional energy for me to just let it go she pulled the phone wire out of the phone put the phone on the floor and headed over to the computer on the desk what do you have in mind joanna bent down behind the electronics unit of the computer and plugged the phone line into the modem way back you told me the wingate clinic had a website and that youd gotten some information from it lets see what kind of firewall they have did you keep the web address yeah i put it into favorites deborah said she got off the couch and came over to watch joanna joanna was much more facile with every aspect of the computer than she whats a firewall its software that blocks unauthorized access joanna said quickly she went onto the internet and got the address for the wingate a moment later she was at the clinics web page pulling up a chair she tried to get into the clinics files no luck huh deborah said over joannas shoulder after a half hour unfortunately no joanna said of course i cant even be sure they have their web page on their own server im not even going to ask what that means deborah said she yawned and then made her way back to the couch where she stretched out full length suddenly joanna disconnected from the internet yanked out the phone line and retreated back to where the phone was on the floor in front of the couch when the phone was reconnected she called information to get the number for david washburn who the hell is he deborah asked a classmate joanna said i took a couple of computer classes with him a very nice guy i might add who actually asked me out a few times why on earth are you calling him now hes very computersavvy joanna said and hacking was one of his sports as an undergraduate calling in the pros deborah commented with a wry smile something like that joanna agreed joanna had to go back to the desk for a pencil and paper to write the number down once she had she dialed directly deborah put her hands behind her head and watched joannas intent expression as the call went through where are you finding the energy she asked youre all jazzed up and i feel like death warmed over this whole issue has been gnawing at me for too long joanna said id like some resolution six may o pm what time is it deborah asked sleepily almost nine joanna said checking her watch where on earth is he the conversation with david washburn had gone well after joanna had explained to him what they were trying to find out he was happy to help but he insisted on coming over to use their computer to do it i cant afford any electronic trail to my machine he had explained im on informal probation after slipping some porno shots onto the defense department web page with the caption make love not war unfortunately the feds were less than amused deborah yawned noisily are you sure he meant tonight im positive joanna said i told him wed be going out for a quick bite to eat but then wed be home he said fine it would give him a chance to finish what he was doing im afraid im not going to stay awake deborah said do you realize its three oclock in the morning back in italy where our bodies think they are why dont you turn in joanna suggested ill wait up arent you tired im exhausted joanna admitted deborah put her feet over onto the floor pushed herself up to a sitting position but before she could stand a raucous buzz filled the room both women started it had been the first time theyd heard the front doorbell and it was considerably louder than they expected no fear well ever miss that deborah said collapsing back onto the couch joanna got to her feet and moved quickly over to the door panel what do i do she asked in a minor panic there were several buttons as well as a circular area of perforations through the metal youre on your own joanna pressed the first button a crackling sound issued forth hello hello she said with her mouth close to the perforations its me david a distant voice responded okay joanna answered back she then pressed the second button while still holding the first depressed she heard a distant buzz followed by the faint sound of the front door opening and then closing well that wasnt so difficult joanna said she walked over to the apartment door opened it and stepped out bending over the railing she looked down the hall was like a chambered nautilus with the stair spiraling all the way down to the street level david bounded up the stairs with a broad smile baked on his face he was a tall athletic african american after a moments hesitation he gave her a big hug how you doing girl he said just fine joanna answered hugging back even though shed not seen him for over two years he appeared exactly the same he had the same short scruffy beard the same laidback manner and the same casual clothes man what a surprise to hear from you you look good real good you too joanna said you havent changed one iota just a little older and a little wiser david said with a laugh and im happy to report the old jump shots still going down fine but you look different in fact you look younger how can that be youre just trying to flatter me joanna said no really david persisted he moved from side to side to view joanna from slightly different angles come on joanna protested youre embarrassing me no need to be embarrassed david said you look terrific and now i know what it is your hair its short im not sure i would have recognized you if i had bumped into you on the street you look like youre sixteen oh sure joanna said come in and meet my roommate joanna took davids arm she led him inside and introduced him to deborah whod managed to get herself upright joanna then apologized for not having a thing to offer him to drink no problem david said well make up for it on another occasion now i know you ladies must be tired just getting back from italy and all so why dont we get right down to business he peeled off his jacket made of black parachute fabric from his pocket he produced a handful of floppy discs and held them up i brought along some tools including my brute force passwordguessing program wheres your machine a few minutes later david had the computer booted up and onto the wingate clinics web page with a rapidity that made deborah blink david browsed around the site his fingers moved like a concert pianist across the keyboard so far so good he reported can you tell me what you are doing deborah asked nothing yet david said as he continued his surfing just checking things out and looking for obvious holes in their firewall do you see any not yet but theyre there how can you be sure one of the roles of a website is to provide the world with access to the organizations network here you can see the wingate clinic has it set up for people to send in healthrelated data and to get information back any time there is such an exchange theres the possibility of unauthorized access in fact in general the more interactive a site is the easier it is to hack in other words the more traffic the more holes deborah nodded but she wasnt sure she understood her use of computers was restricted to her biological research work using the internet as a resource and sending email but what about passwords deborah questioned whenever she used the computer in the lab she had to enter her password which only she knew dont those keep people out yes and no david said thats supposed to be the idea but it doesnt always work like it should a lot of network managers are lazy and they never change the manufacturer default passwords so that narrows down what has to be tried also with a www server theres no limit to how many attempts you can make so we can try a bruteforce passwordguessing program like the one i brought with me deborah rolled her eyes for joannas benefit its actually a lot of fun david said sensing deborahs doubt its like an intellectual arcade game i cant imagine its too much fun for the people being hacked joanna said its usually pretty innocuous david said most hackers i know arent malicious its like an ongoing competition between them and the people designing the security or theyre just doing someone a favor like me with you guys youre not interested in doing anything other than getting the information that it seems to me youre entitled to it would have been a lot easier if the clinic saw it that way joanna said all at once david stopped typing he stroked his beard thoughtfully well i have to give credit where credit is due seems like a pretty tight site certainly no glaring holes in fact it seems to me to be fairly sophisticated theyve got an authentication server does this organization have a lot of bucks to throw around that would be my guess joanna said im getting the feeling were up against some pretty good security here david said which means well have to get more sophisticated ourselves what is it exactly that you would like to be able to do deborah asked id like the web server to recognize and authenticate us david said then wed have the run of all their files what im going to try now is to fill up the buffer on their new patient form and see if i can throw in some assemblylevel commands in the space after the buffer to bypass the authentication its like riding in through the cgi on the patientform coattails could you tell me that in english deborah said david looked up to deborahs face she was watching over his left shoulder i was actually simplifying the process when i just described it fine deborah said pretending to be irritated if thats the case then ill take myself over to the couch and lie down ill let you two computer wizards attend to business david looked up at joanna over his other shoulder i want to make sure you understand that if i do this and it works there will be an electronic trail through your internet service provider to this machine if the hack is picked up they could come after you are you okay with that joanna mulled the question for a moment she knew what they were doing was technically breaking the law yet the information was important to her even necessary for her peace of mind in view of the changes in her life and what were the chances such an intrusion would be noticed if all they did was trace their own eggs she thought the chances seemed small indeed what do you think deborah joanna asked im willing to leave it up to you deborah said im curious obviously but not as curious as you then lets do it joanna said right on baby david said gleefully as he rubbed his hands together in anticipation of the challenge he cracked a few of his knuckles before bending to the task again his fingers flew over the keyboard the sound was like a continuous clatter rather than individual strokes images flashed on the screen in rapid succession after more than thirty minutes of intense concentration david halted he took an exasperated deep breath while flexing his fingers in the air its not working is it joanna said im afraid not david said this is no mickey mouse setup that i can assure you what do you propose david looked down at his watch this might be a long process its a more secure site than i would have imagined and its not letting me sneak in any commands whatsoever i thought we were dealing with a windows nt environment but it now looks like a windows with kerberos is kerberos the authentication method developed at mit joanna asked you got it david said so whats your bottom line suggestion as the easiest way to get the information we want david laughed let me stay here for a week and ill try to bust in with stuff like the lophtcrack utility other than that id suggest you find someone who works out there at the wingate clinic who has access and who would be sympathetic to your cause those are the only two choices no theres something else get yourself or me into the server room david laughed again actually thats the most efficient foolproof way hell it would probably only take less than ten minutes to create your own pathway then it would be a piece of cake either from a workstation inside the network or even from offsite if you did it right joanna nodded while her mind pondered the choices she felt progressively committed as if the more she hit up against barriers the more she wanted to succeed especially since she could picture a little girl somewhere nearby who looked like the photos she had of herself as an infant david glanced down at his watch then back up at joanna its after ten you want me to keep going here or what im cool with it if you do but like i said i cant promise anything other than im sure i can crack this site eventually i just dont know how long it will take youve done enough joanna said thank you she stared off vacantly deep in thought david noticed the faraway look in her green unblinking eyes he waited for several beats then stuck his hand up in her line of sight and waved it back and forth are you with me girl joanna shook her head as if waking from a trance and smiled sorry she said i was just wondering about what you said concerning getting into the server room how hard would that be once you were in the building it all depends david said obviously if they care about security its not like you can just walk in anytime you want but it is physically a room joanna said its not just computer jargon about something that exists in cyberspace its a real room all right david said and its got real hardware inside which includes a keyboard and a monitor to access the central processor how would you envision the room to be secured a locked door david said all the ones ive seen have had a card swipe access you know like a credit card interesting joanna said if i were to get in there what exactly would i do thats the easy part david said you have some paper handy joanna pulled open one of the desk drawers and got out a fresh yellow legal pad she handed it to david who proceeded to outline the steps that needed to be done joanna watched with full attention at several points she asked for clarification which david was happy to provide and thats it david said he ripped off the page and handed it up to joanna she glanced over it again satisfied she had no further questions she folded it and slipped it into her pocket thank you ever so much for coming over joanna said hey my pleasure david said he scraped back the chair and stood up any time for a former classmate by the way hows your phd thesis coming along joanna asked now youre starting to sound like my mother david said with a laugh he gathered his floppy discs into a neat pile unfortunately im running into a little writers block along about the second chapter hows yours very well joanna said its done done david squeaked before blowing out a lungful of air through pursed lips he visibly sagged what a way to cut a friend off at the knees im sorry hey its not your fault maybe you should think about changing your environment joanna suggested thats what deborah and i did shes finished as well maybe its because im not so fired up about stochastic processes in the commodity markets of third world countries any longer but then again who would be anyway if im not being too personal how are you and your fiancé getting along im no longer engaged joanna said davids posture improved really how long has that been a year and a half are you okay with that it was my idea cool how about you and me having dinner some night id like that joanna said ill be in touch david said he pulled on his jacket and pocketed his floppy discs on his way to the door he glanced over at deborahs supine form say goodbye to your roommate im not asleep deborah said she pushed herself up to a sitting position and blinked repeatedly in the light after another round of small talk david said his final goodbyes and departed deborah who was still sitting on the couch watched joanna go over to the computer to shut it down no luck getting into the wingates files deborah questioned she yawned widely not yet joanna said the computer monitor went blank and the electronics unit fan went silent is david still going to try no i am joanna walked past deborah and disappeared into the bathroom im confused deborah called out the reason you called david was because you couldnt do it did he give you some suggestions or advice that makes you think you can do it now were moving to plan b joanna called out over the sound of running water deborah stood up from the couch she waited for a moment to allow a wave of queasiness to pass giddy with fatigue she made her way over to the open bathroom door and leaned against the jamb joanna was brushing her teeth im afraid to ask but what in heavens name is plan b im going to get a shortterm job at the wingate clinic joanna said through foam you have to be joking deborah said joanna spit loudly into the sink then looked at deborah in the mirror im serious the only certain expedient way of getting into the wingate computer files is to get into their server room at least according to david this is crazy deborah said the sleepiness in her voice disappeared first of all david doesnt seem to be the source of infallible information when he got here he was sure he could hack into the wingate computer but he couldnt hed be able to do it it just might take a long time he knows what hes talking about he gave me very specific suggestions once i get into the wingate server room joanna went back to brushing her teeth deborah made a gesture of exasperation with her hands then put them on her hips she watched her roommate for several minutes before responding wont this server room be locked probably joanna said she rinsed her mouth and plopped her toothbrush into the water glass business side up ill just have to be resourceful david thinks it will have a card swipe access ill just have to get one of those cards joanna started washing her face do you realize how insane this sounds deborah said i dont think it sounds insane in the slightest joanna said i want to know if there are children from my eggs and i thought you wanted to know about yours as well of course i want to know but thats not the point i think it is the point lets be practical about this deborah said trying to control her voice how are you going to get a job at the wingate clinic it should be easy joanna said remember when we were out there they said they were always looking for people they said that finding help was the downside of being in such a rural area well im good at word processing im sure i can find something to do but theyll recognize you deborah said with a vehemence that bordered on anger calm down joanna urged she stared at her roommate whod become red in the face dont you understand theyll recognize you deborah repeated probably most of the people we dealt with out there are still there from the receptionist to the doctors i dont think people would recognize me joanna said we were only out there for one morning a year and a half ago tonight david said he wouldnt have recognized me with my short hair if he bumped into me on the street and he saw me at least three times a week for a number of years and i wont use my real name youre not going to be able to get a job without giving a social security number deborah said and the number and the name have to match its not going to work joanna finished drying her face and stared at her image in the mirror deborah had a point shed not considered shed need a name and a matching social security number she thought maybe she could ask to impersonate one of her friends but dismissed the idea immediately she couldnt knowingly implicate one of her friends in a scheme in which shed be technically breaking the law well deborah questioned ill get the name and social security number of someone who died recently joanna said vaguely she could remember reading something like that in a novel the more she thought about it the more she thought it could work deborahs jaw had dropped open at joannas latest suggestion she pulled herself together i cant believe this you truly are obsessed id prefer to call it committed joanna said she pushed past deborah and walked into her bedroom deborah followed i think youre going to be committed to walpole prison deborah said either that or a mental institution thats the kind of committed thats involved here im not robbing a bank joanna said she unbuckled her belt and stepped out of her jeans im just getting some information about my progeny i dont know what kind of offense impersonating a dead person is deborah said but i know unauthorized access into computer files is a felony im aware of that joanna said nonetheless im going to do it joanna continued undressing when she was done she pulled a nightgown over her head she arranged it so it draped evenly then she hung up her clothes finally she looked back over at deborah who was still standing in the doorway deborah had not responded to her last statement other than to eye her with a combination of exasperation and disbelief well joanna said breaking the silence are you just going to stand there or do you have more to say if you do out with it otherwise im going to bed tomorrow is going to be a busy day all right deborah said with angry resolve she lifted a hand and poked a finger at joanna if you insist on this crazy idiotic plan then im going too excuse me joanna blurted im not letting you go out there and get in all sorts of trouble without me after all it was my idea to do the egg donation in the first place youre not the only one with a problem with guilt and id never be able to live with myself if something happened to you that i could have prevented you dont have to come with me just to be my protector joanna said with color rising in her face deborah closed her eyes and extended her hands palm down this is not an argument the die has been cast obviously youre serious about this crusade and now so am i deborahs eyes fluttered as if it had been difficult for her to open them joanna came over and stared into her roommates deep eyes now i have to ask you if you are serious im serious deborah said with a nod ill get a job as well with that huge lab out there im sure theyre as hungry for lab techs as they are for secretarial help then lets do it joanna said she raised her hand with her fingers extended and highfived with deborah seven may oo o am still habituated to italian time the women found themselves awake early despite their exhaustion deborah was the first to get out of bed believing joanna was still asleep she tried to be quiet as she passed through the kitchen into the bathroom the moment she flushed the toilet the connecting door to joannas bedroom opened you look like something the cat dragged in deborah said as she eyed her roommate youve looked better yourself joanna said what time is it quarter past six but my pituitary gland thinks its noon spare me the specifics joanna said all i know is that i had intended on sleeping late yet ive been awake for at least an hour me too deborah said how about we go down to charles street for breakfast i need coffee big time since the cupboard is bare we dont have much choice three quarters of an hour later the women descended to the square and walked down mt vernon street to charles it was a fine spring morning with lots of bright flowers in the window boxes although there were few pedestrians until they got to charles the birds were out in full force at the end of charles street fronting the boston common they found a starbucks that was open they went in and ordered cappuccinos and got some pastry as well they carried their food over to a small marble table by the window at first they ate and drank in silence the coffee is good joanna said at length but i have to say it tasted better in campo santa margherita isnt that the truth deborah agreed but it is reviving me so you still want to go out to the wingate clinic and get jobs joanna asked absolutely deborah said im psyched but wed better start brainstorming about specifics how are we going to get names and social security numbers of dead people thats a good question joanna said while i was lying in bed this morning i was thinking about it a few years ago i read about somebody doing it in a novel how did he or she do it she had an in she worked in a hospital and got the information from the hospital chart what did she do with it it was a medicare scam of some sort good grief deborah commented thats interesting but unfortunately its not going to help us that is unless you were thinking of enlisting carltons help i think wed better leave carlton out of this joanna said if he had an inkling of what we were up to hed probably turn us in to the fbi deborah took another sip of her coffee i think we should break the problem into two parts first we get the names after we have the names we worry about getting the social security numbers and whatever else we need like birth date and maybe even mothers maiden name getting names wont be a problem joanna said at least that came to me while i was lying in bed all we have to do is head over to the library and look at the globes obituary pages good ideal deborah said she sat forward eagerly why didnt i think of that its perfect the obituaries usually have ages if not birth dates that will help picking out appropriate names since we should try to look for women about our age as bizarre as that sounds i know joanna said its creepy they also have to be women who have died relatively recently getting the social security number is going to be more difficult deborah said maybe ill have to break down and ask carlton for help joanna said the chances are any woman our age whos passed away will have been a patient in a local hospital if shed been in the mgh and if we could come up with some plausible reason why we want the social security number that wont make carlton suspicious maybe hed help thats a lot of ifs and maybes deborah commented i suppose joanna agreed ive got it deborah said she slapped her palm against the tabletop a couple of years ago when my grandfather died my grandmother had to get a death certificate to take his name off the deed to the house how does that help us the death certificate is public information deborah said she laughed at herself i cant believe i didnt think about this right off the death certificate has the social security number my gosh thats perfect absolutely deborah said first we hit the library then city hall wait a second joanna said she leaned forward conspiratorially weve got to make sure that the social security number hasnt been retired knowing government bureaucracy im sure it takes a while but we have to be sure youre absolutely right deborah said it would certainly blow our cover if we get out there to the wingate and a background check turns up that one or both of us are dead she laughed hollowly i know what we can do joanna said after we go to city hall we stop at the fleet bank well open up savings accounts with both names as american citizens wed have to supply the social security numbers and theyll run a check on them straight off so well know sounds good deborah said what time do you think the library opens my guess would be nine or ten joanna said but theres one other thing we should discuss what about altering our appearances a bit more i think our different hairstyles are quite effective and probably enough under the circumstances but why not go a step further just to be sure you mean like hair color hair color is one thing but im also talking about our general style our look were both rather preppy i think we each ought to aim for another type well im all for changing my hair color deborah said ive always wanted to be a blond ive heard you guys have a lot more fun im trying to be serious here joanna said okay okay deborah said so what else do you have in mind strategic facial piercings and a couple of wild tattoos joanna laughed in spite of herself lets try to be serious for a moment im thinking in terms of clothes and makeup theres a lot that we could do youre right deborah said occasionally ive had a fantasy of dressing up like a hooker i guess i have an exhibitionist streak ive just never acted on it this could be my big chance are you mocking me again or are you serious im serious deborah said we might as well make this fun i was thinking about going in the opposite direction joanna said the prudish librarian stereotype that will be easy deborah joked youre practically there already very funny joanna said deborah wiped her mouth with her napkin and tossed it onto her pastry plate are you finished i certainly am joanna said then lets get this show on the road deborah said on the way here we passed a grocery store why dont we stop in and get some staples so that we dont have to come out for every meal by then the library should be open it sounds like a perfect plan joanna said the women were standing on the front steps of the old boston library building gazing at the trinity church across the busy copley square when the librarys custodian unlocked the front door it was nine oclock since neither of the women had been in the boston library before they were in deborahs words blown away by the grand architecture and the vivid john singer sargent murals i cant believe i lived in the boston area for six years and never came in here deborah said as they walked through the echoey marbled halls it was as if her head were on a swivel as it pivoted from side to side to take in all the details i have to agree joanna said after inquiring where they could go to view old boston globe newspapers the women were directed to the microfilm room but once there they learned that there was a delay sometimes as much as a year before the papers were microfilmed consequently they were sent to the newspaper room there they found the newspapers themselves how far back should we go deborah questioned id suggest a month and then work backward joanna said the women got a stack of several weeks worth of papers and carried them over to a vacant library table they divided the stack in two and went to work this isnt as easy as i thought it would be deborah said i was wrong about ages and birth dates few of the death notices have them well have to just look at the obituaries joanna said they all seem to have the age the women went through the first stack of papers without success and went back for another there certainly arent many young women joanna commented nor young men deborah added people our age are not supposed to die that often and even if they do theyre usually not famous enough to have an obituary written about them of course we dont want the name of anyone famous either so we might have a problem here but lets not give up yet after three more trips to get fresh stacks of papers they had success ah heres one deborah said georgina marks joanna looked over deborahs shoulder how old twentyseven deborah said she was born january right time frame joanna said does it say what she died of yes it does deborah said she was quiet while she scanned the rest of the article she was accidentally shot in a shopping mall parking lot obviously in the wrong place at the wrong time apparently rival gangs were having a fight and she caught a stray bullet can you imagine being called up and being told your wife was killed while she was out on a shopping trip at the neighborhood mall deborah shuddered to make it worse it says here she was the mother of four young children the youngest was only six months old i think it is best if we dont obsess about the sad details joanna said for us these should be just names not people youre right deborah agreed at least she wasnt famous except for the tragic way she died so it should be a good name for our purposes i suppose ill be georgina marks she wrote the name and the birth date down on a pad of paper she and joanna had brought now lets find a name for you deborah said both women went back to scouring the obituaries it wasnt until theyd perused six more weeks of papers that deborah came across another name candidate prudence heatherly age twentyfour deborah read out loud now that name has an interesting ring to it its perfect for you joanna it even sounds like a librarian so it will go with your disguise i dont find that funny in the slightest joanna said let me read the obituary she reached for the paper but deborah moved it out of her reach i thought we werent going to obsess about the details deborah teased im not obsessing joanna said i want to make sure shes not a local celebrity in bookford besides i feel i have to know something about the woman if im going to be borrowing her name i thought these were just names not people please joanna enunciated slowly as if losing her patience deborah handed the paper over and watched her roommates face while she read the obituary joannas expression progressively sagged is it bad deborah asked when joanna looked up id say it was just as bad as georginas story joanna said she was a graduate student at northeastern thats getting a little too close to home deborah said what did she die of or shouldnt i ask she was pushed in front of the red line subway at the washington street station now it was joannas turn to shudder a homeless man with no apparent motive did it my word what a tragedy for a parent getting a call saying your daughter was pushed in front of a train by a vagrant at least we have the two names deborah said she snatched the paper away from joanna and refolded it she wrote prudence heatherly down on the pad below georgina then busied herself restacking the papers joanna was motionless for a moment but then pitched in to help together the women carried the papers back to where they were kept fifteen minutes later first deborah and then joanna exited the library from the same entrance theyd entered although they were pensively subdued they were pleased with their progress it had only taken an hour and three quarters to get the two names should we walk or take the subway deborah questioned lets take the subway joanna answered from the front of the library it was only a short walk to the inbound t stop on boylston street and the green line took them directly to government center when they emerged on the street level they were conveniently in front of the inappropriately modern boston city hall which loomed out of its brickpaved mall like an enormous anachronism can you tell me where id find death certificates joanna asked the receptionist at the information desk located in the buildings multistoried lobby joanna had waited several minutes before speaking the woman was involved in an animated but hushed dialogue with her colleague sitting next to her theyre downstairs at the registry department the woman said without looking up and hardly interrupting her conversation joanna rolled her eyes for deborahs benefit the two women set out for the wide stairs leading downward once on the lower level they found the proper registry department window without difficulty the only problem was there wasnt any personnel in evidence hello deborah called out anybody home a womans head popped up from behind a row of file cabinets can i help you she called out wed like several death certificates deborah answered back the woman ambled around the row of file cabinets rocking from side to side she was wearing a black dress that restrained her ample flesh in a series of descending horizontal bulges reading glasses hung around her neck on a chain and rested on the nearly horizontal swelling of her bosom she came to the counter and leaned on it i need to know the names and the year she said in a bored voice georgina marks and prudence heatherly joanna said and both passed away this year it takes a week to ten days for the certificates to get here the woman said we have to wait that long to get them joanna questioned with dismay no thats how long the death certificates take to get here to the registry after the individual dies i only mention it because if these people youre interested in have just passed away the certificates wont be here both these people have been dead for over a month joanna said then they should be here the woman said that will be six dollars each we only want to look at the certificates joanna said we dont need to remove them from the premises six dollars each is fine deborah interjected she gave joanna a jab in the side to keep her quiet after writing the names down while eyeing joanna skeptically the woman leisurely disappeared behind the file cabinets why did you poke me joanna complained i didnt want you messing things up to save twelve dollars deborah whispered if the woman guesses were here just to get social security numbers she might get suspicious i think i would so well pay the money take the certificates and get the hell out of here i guess youre right joanna said reluctantly of course im right deborah said the clerk returned a quarter hour later with the forms deborah and joanna had the money ready and the exchange was made five minutes later the women were back outside where each carefully copied down the respective social security numbers onto a piece of paper they pocketed the death certificates i suggest we try to memorize the numbers while were on the way to the bank joanna said it might attract attention if we dont especially if we pulled out the death certificates by accident inside the bank deborah said joanna chuckled i also think we should start addressing each other with our assumed names otherwise well forget in front of people and that could be a problem good point prudence deborah said with a chuckle of her own it was only a tenminute walk from city hall to the charles river plaza where the local branch of the fleet bank was located for the most part the women were silent while committing the respective social security numbers to their memories when they turned into the charles river plaza joanna pulled deborah to a stop lets discuss this for a moment before we go inside she said we should open these accounts with just a token deposit because were not going to be able to get this money back out what do you suggest i dont think it really matters joanna said how about twenty dollars fine by me deborah said but i wouldnt mind hitting the atm machine on the way in thats not a bad idea either joanna said each got several hundred dollars in cash before entering the bank proper they then went directly to the service desk since it was in the middle of the lunch hour the bank was busy with hospital people from the mgh and the women had to wait almost twenty minutes before being helped but setting up the accounts was accomplished quickly since the bank officer whose turn it was to help them was particularly efficient her name was mary the only minor problem was the lack of any ids but mary solved it by saying they could bring them in the following day by one oclock mary had already excused herself to activate the accounts and get them receipts joanna and deborah were sitting on vinyl chairs facing marys desk what if she comes back and says were dead deborah whispered then were dead joanna answered but thats what were here for but what are we going to say wed have to say something well just say we must have been mistaken about the numbers well tell them well check them and come back i was enjoying myself a half hour ago deborah complained now im nervous we cant tell them a fishy story like that here she comes joanna said in a forced whisper mary came back clutching the deposit receipts ive got you all set up she reported every thing is just fine she gave a receipt to each woman along with one of the packets of material sitting on her desk which shed prepared earlier youre all set do you have a parking ticket no we walked over joanna said for an address the women had given seven hawthorne place part of the charles river park apartment complex behind the hospital a few minutes later the women were back out in the may sunshine deborah was euphoric we did it she declared as they walked quickly away from the bank i had my doubts there for a minute but apparently weve got good names and social security numbers theyre good for now joanna said but thats going to change sometime in the near future lets head back to the apartment put in a call to the wingate clinic and get the next step out of the way what about a bit of lunch deborah said im starved that coffee and pastry we had a little after seven this morning is long gone i could use some food myself joanna agreed but lets make it quick wingate clinic a pleasant voice said cheerfully it came from the speaker phone in joanna and deborahs apartment the telephone itself was on the couch between the women who were sitting on either side of it it was twothirtyfive and sun was just beginning to spill onto the hardwood floor through the front windows im interested in employment in your institution joanna said to whom should i speak the women had flipped a coin to see who should make the call joanna had won that would be with helen masterson director of personnel the operator said shall i connect you please joanna said the same elevator music theyd heard the day before drifted out of the phone but it didnt last long a strong deep womans voice preempted the muzak both women jumped helen masterson here i understand you are looking for employment yes both myself and my roommate joanna said as soon as shed recovered what kind of experience do you and your roommate have helen asked ive had extensive wordprocessing experience joanna said as a student or in a work environment both joanna said shed worked summers during undergraduate school in a houston law firm with whom her father did a great deal of business are you college graduates yes indeed joanna said ive a degree in economics my roommate georgina marks was a biology major joanna looked over at deborah who gave her a thumbsup sign has she had any laboratory experience deborah nodded emphatically yes she has joanna said i must admit you both sound perfect for the wingate clinic helen said how did you hear about us excuse me joanna said while making a grimace of consternation for deborahs benefit it was a question shed not anticipated deborah fumbled for the pad and pencil on the floor while helen repeated the question she quickly wrote a friend saw an ad word of mouth joanna said a friend of ours saw an ad was that a newspaper ad or a radio ad joanna hesitated deborah shrugged im not sure joanna said well it doesnt matter except to know which is more effective helen said do you live here in bookford we currently live in boston joanna said so you are willing to reverse commute thats the plan at least for the time being wed be driving out together why do you want to work out here in bookford helen asked we need to find work quickly joanna said we heard your organization was in need of help we just got back from a rather long stay in europe and frankly we need the money it sounds like we can help each other helen said i can either fax you or email you employment questionnaires which you can fill out and send back the same way you got it which way would you prefer email is fine joanna said she gave helen her email address which conveniently had no association with her name ill email forthwith helen said meanwhile i think we should go ahead and schedule interviews what would be a convenient date for you and your roommate just about any day this week or next week is available the sooner the better joanna said deborah nodded in fact tomorrow would be fine for us if it works for you by all means helen said i applaud your eagerness would ten oclock be okay ten oclock will be fine joanna said will you need directions helen asked i dont think that will be necessary joanna said were quite resourceful we look forward to seeing you tomorrow helen said before disconnecting joanna hung up the phone very smooth deborah commented i think were in so do i joanna said she unplugged the phone and headed over to the computer lets log on so we can get the email as soon as it comes in true to her word helen had sent the email within minutes of hanging up the phone and it popped up on the womens computer screen just moments after they logged on fifteen minutes later joanna and deborah had filled in their respective employment forms directly on the screen and emailed them back to the wingate clinic this almost seems too easy deborah commented as she shut down the computer dont jinx us joanna said you can call me superstitious but im not going to say anything like that until after i get into the wingate server room theres too much that can still go wrong you mean like one or both social security numbers suddenly going bad either that or someone like dr donaldson recognizing us tomorrow morning let me guess deborah said youre back to thinking about the disguise idea ive never stopped thinking about it joanna said and we have the rest of the afternoon so lets do it we can head over to the galleria mall in cambridge and without spending much get ourselves some new outfits im game deborah said the trendy tart thats going to be me maybe i can find something with an exposed midriff that i can combine with a miracle bra then on the way back we can stop at cvs and get some hair coloring and extra makeup do you remember the receptionist when we were out at the wingate doing the egg donations it would be hard to forget her joanna said im going to give her a run for her money deborah declared i dont think we should go overboard on this joanna said skeptically we dont want to draw attention to ourselves unnecessarily speak for yourself deborah said you dont want us recognized and im going to make sure it doesnt happen especially with me but we want them to give us jobs joanna said no need to worry deborah said im not going to go that far eight may oo am spencer wingate tossed aside the magazine hed been reading and looked out at the countryside spread out below spring had finally arrived with its typical new england sluggishness the patchwork of fields and meadows had assumed a deep verdant green color although isolated patches of ice and snow were still visible in the deeper gullies and ravines many of the hardwoods were still without leaves but they were covered with delicate yellowgreen buds ready to burst which gave the undulating hills a softness as if they were upholstered in diaphanous green fleece hew much longer before we touch down at hanscom field spencer called out loud enough for the pilot to hear over the whine of the jet engines spencer was in a lear he owned a quarter share although not of the plane he was currently in two years previously hed signed on with one of the fractionalownership companies and the service had served his needs admirably less than twenty minutes sir the pilot yelled back over his shoulder theres no traffic so well be flying directly in spencer nodded and stretched he was looking forward to returning to massachusetts and the vista of the quaint southern new england farms fanned the fires of his anticipation hed wintered for the second year in a row in naples florida and this season hed become bored especially over the last months now he couldnt wait to get back and it wasnt just because the wingate infertility clinics profits were down three years previously with the clinic purring and money pouring in faster than hed ever deemed possible hed fantasized about retiring to play golf write a novel that would become a movie date beautiful women and generally relax with that goal in mind hed started a search for a younger man to take the daytoday reins of his booming business serendipitously hed found an eager individual fresh from an infertility fellowship at an institution where spencer had lectured hed seemed heavensent with the business taken care of spencer turned his attention to where hed go on the advice of a patient who had extensive experience with florida real estate he found a condominium on the west coast of florida once the deal had been consummated hed headed toward the sun unfortunately reality did not live up to his fantasy he was able to play a lot of golf but his competitively busy mind found it less fulfilling than he would have liked over the long haul especially since he could never rise above an irritating level of mediocrity spencer considered himself a winner and found losing intolerable ultimately he decided there was something basically wrong with the sport and the idea of writing turned out to be even more of a bust he discovered it was harder work than hed envisioned and it required a degree of discipline he did not have but worse yet there was no immediate positive feedback like hed gotten seeing patients consequently and rather quickly he gave up the novelmovie idea as not suitable for his more active personality the social situation was the biggest disappointment throughout most of his life spencer had felt hed had to sacrifice experiencing the kind of lifestyle his looks and talents should have provided hed married in medical school mostly out of loneliness a woman whom he came to recognize as beneath him both intellectually and socially once the children which had come early were off to college spencer had divorced luckily it had been before the wingate infertility clinic had taken off the wife had gotten the house which had been no great shakes and a onetime payment dr wingate the pilot called over his shoulder should i radio ahead for ground transportation my car should be there spencer yelled back have them bring it out on the tarmac aye aye sir the pilot answered spencer went back to his musings although thered been no dearth of beautiful women in naples he had trouble meeting them and those he did meet were difficult to impress although spencer thought himself rich in naples there was always someone a quantum leap ahead in both wealth and the trappings that came with it so the only part of spencers original retirement dream that had come to pass was the opportunity to relax but even that had become old after the first season and hardly fulfilling then came the news beginning in january that the clinics profits were falling at first spencer thought it was surely an aberration or an accounting trick of writing off a major liability in one month but unfortunately it continued spencer looked into it as best he could from afar it wasnt that revenues had dropped quite the contrary it was because the research costs had skyrocketed suggesting that spencers onsite leadership was sorely needed back when paul saunders had first come on board spencer had told him that he encouraged research but obviously things had gotten out of hand they tell me your car is already in front of the jetsmart aviation building the pilot called back to spencer and buckle up were beginning our final approach spencer flashed the pilot a thumbsup sign his seat belt was already fastened glancing out the window as they came in for the touchdown he saw his burgundy bentley convertible gleaming in the morning sun he loved the car vaguely he wondered if he shouldnt have taken it to naples perhaps with it he would have had better luck with the ladies spring was a season which joanna had always loved with its flowers and with its promise of warm soft summer evenings to come spring had always arrived early in houston with an avalanche of color that overnight transformed the dull flat landscape into a fairyland of azaleas tulips and dogwoods as she drove northwest out of boston on the way to bookford she tried to concentrate on such happy remembrances and the euphoria they engendered but it wasnt easy first of all there were few flowers in evidence and hence not much color save for the green grass and the light green of the budding trees second of all she was irritated at deborah who was sitting next to her and happily singing along with the radio tuned to soft rock although her roommate had promised im not going to go that far with her disguise in joannas estimation shed gone beyond the pale her hair was now strawberry blond her lips and augmented nails a bright crimson and she was attired in a decollete miniskirted dress combined with a padded miracle bra and highheeled shoes the final touches were dangling earrings and a tiny rhinestonestudded heart necklace in sharp contrast joanna had on a dark blue midcalflength skirt a buttoned highnecked white blouse a pale pink cardigan sweater also buttoned up to the top and clearplasticrimmed glasses her hair was dyed a mousy brown i seriously doubt you are going to get a job joanna said suddenly breaking a long silence and maybe i wont either because of you deborah switched her attention from staring out the windshield to her roommates profile although she didnt say anything immediately she leaned forward and switched off the radio joannas eyes diverted briefly to deborahs then back to the road ahead is that why youre so quiet deborah asked youve not said boo practically since we left this morning you promised me you wouldnt turn this into a joke joanna said deborah looked down at her pantyhosecovered knees for a moment this is no joke she said this is called taking advantage of an opportunity and having a bit of fun you call it fun and i call it a study in bad taste thats your taste deborah said and ironically mine too but not everybody would agree with you particularly not the male population you dont seriously think men are going to be turned on by your appearance do you actually i think they will be deborah said not all men mind you but a lot ive watched men react to women dressed like this theres always a reaction perhaps not for reasons i care about but nonetheless a reaction and for once in my life im going to experience it i think its a myth joanna said i think its a female distortion similar to mens idea that women are turned on by brawn and big muscles nah i dont think its the same at all deborah said with a wave of her hand besides youre speaking from your old traditional female upbringing with dating serving as a prelude to marriage let me remind you yet again that men can look at women and dating as being a game or even a sport they see it as entertainment just as id also like to remind you the modern twentyfirstcentury woman can i dont want to get into an argument about this issue joanna said the problem is weve an appointment with a woman and i doubt that she is going to be amused with your appearance the bottom line is that i dont think you will get a job pure and simple i disagree on that regard as well deborah said the personnel director is a woman i grant you that but shes got to be a realist about recruitment im applying for a job in a laboratory not out in the front meeting patients besides they saw fit to hire that redhead receptionist who was almost as provocatively dressed as i am but why even take the chance joanna complained the worry was as you voiced it yourself whether or not wed be recognized deborah said trust me were not going to be recognized on top of that were having a little fun im not going to give up trying to loosen you up and keep you from having a social relapse oh sure joanna said now youre going to try to convince me that your dressing up like a tart is for my benefit give me a break all right mostly for me but a little for you too by the time they got to bookford and drove through town joanna had reconciled herself to deborahs appearance she imagined that the worstcase scenario would be for deborah not to get a job but there was little reason that deborahs difficulties would affect her chances deborahs not getting a job would hardly be a disaster after all joanna had originally planned to go to the wingate clinic by herself it was deborah whod insisted on coming along do you remember where the turnoff is joanna asked on the previous visit shed not been driving and whenever she was the passenger she had difficulty remembering landmarks it will be on the left just after this upcoming curve deborah said i remember it was just beyond this barn on the right youre right i see the sign joanna said as she straightened the car after the turn she slowed and pulled off onto the gravel road ahead they could see the stone gatehouse nosing into the tunnel beneath the house and barring their way was a line of trucks the uniformed guard could be seen clipboard in hand apparently conversing with the driver inside the cab of the first truck looks like delivery time for the farm deborah said the back of the last truck said webster animal feed what time is it joanna asked she was concerned about the time since theyd ended up leaving the apartment twenty minutes later than intended having had to wait for deborahs nails to dry its five before ten deborah said oh great joanna commented despairingly i hate to be late for appointments especially if im applying for a job we can only do the best we can deborah said joanna nodded she loathed patronizing comments like that and she knew deborah knew it but she didnt say anything she didnt want to give deborah the satisfaction instead she drummed the steering wheel minutes ticked by joannas drumming picked up its pace she sighed and glanced up into the rearview mirror with the intention of checking how her hair had weathered the trip before she could adjust the mirror she caught sight of a car turning off pierce street onto the gravel road while she watched the car drove toward them slowed and stopped immediately behind do you remember that bentley convertible we saw in the clinics parking lot the last time we were here joanna asked vaguely deborah said cars had never interested her other than to get from point a to point b and she could not distinguish between a chevy and a ford or between a bmw and a mercedes it just drove up behind us joanna reported oh deborah commented she turned and looked out the back of the car oh yeah i remember it i wonder if its one of the doctors joanna said while continuing to eye the burgundy vehicle in the rearview mirror with the glare on the windshield she could not see the interior deborah checked her watch again gosh its after ten whats the deal that stupid guard is still talking with that truck driver what on earth could they be talking about i guess theyre careful who they let on the grounds that might be the case but we have an appointment deborah said she unlatched the door and slid out where are you going joanna asked im going to find out whats going on deborah said this is ridiculous she slammed the door then rounded the front of the car teetering on her toes to keep her narrow heels from penetrating into the gravel she started forward toward the gatehouse despite her earlier irritation joanna had to laugh at her roommates gait until she noticed that deborahs short skirt was hiked up on her backside thanks to static cling with her panty hose letting down the window she leaned out hey marilyn monroe your rear end is hanging out using the knuckles of both index fingers spencer rubbed his eyes briefly to bring them into better focus hed pulled up behind the nondescript chevy malibu feeling irritated that now that he was finally here his way was blocked by a mini traffic jam hed seen the two heads in the car in front but had thought nothing of them until one of them had gotten out for spencer it was like seeing a mirage the woman appeared like the person hed been searching for and not finding the entire time hed been in naples not only was she attractive with a slim athletic body but she was dressed in an alluring style the likes of which hed not seen except on rare visits to miamis south beach to make the unexpected situation even more provocative the womans dress was pulled up in the back exposing a nearnaked pantyhoseclad derriere emboldened by a sense of being on home turf spencer did not hesitate like he would have had he still been in naples he opened his door and got out hed heard the yell from the womans companion and now the skirt was down where it was supposed to be yet it still hovered above midthigh and being made of a synthetic clingy fabric it undulated sensuously as the woman unsteadily walked over the gravel drive launching himself forward in a jog spencer headed toward the gatehouse in hot pursuit as he passed the womens malibu he caught a fleeting glimpse of the companion which was enough to tell him she was of a totally different ilk slowing to a walk he passed the first truck and approached the woman whose back was to him she was arguing arms akimbo with the guard well have them back up the damn trucks and let us go by deborah was saying we have an appointment with ms masterson head of personnel and were already late the guard with his clipboard was unintimidated his eyebrows were raised and he had a smirk on his face as he peered down at deborah through his aviator sunglasses he started to respond to her suggestion but spencer interrupted him what seems to be the problem here spencer questioned in the most authoritarian tone he could muster unconsciously mimicking deborahs stance he put his hands on his hips the guard glanced at spencer and told him in no uncertain terms it was none of his business and that he should get back in his vehicle he used the words please and sir but obviously intended them as mere formalities these feed trucks are not on his list deborah explained contemptuously theyre acting like this is fort knox for crying out loud perhaps a call down to the farm will clear things up spencer suggested listen sir the guard said pronouncing sir as if it were an epithet he pointed toward spencers bentley with the clipboard with one hand while resting the other on the top of his bolstered automatic i want you back in that car asap dont you dare threaten me spencer growled for your information im dr spencer wingate the guards menacing expression quavered as he stared spencer in the eye it appeared as if he were having an internal debate as to how to proceed deborahs attention switched from the guard to spencer with his surprising announcement she found herself looking up into the face of the stereotypic soapopera doctor tall slender angled face tanned skin and silvergray hair before anyone could verbally respond the heavy windowless black door opened a muscular man emerged dressed in a black knit shirt black pants and black crosstrainer shoes his dirtyblond hair was cropped short he moved as if in slow motion closing the door behind him dr wingate he said calmly you should have warned us you were coming whats with these trucks sitting here kurt spencer demanded were waiting for dr saunderss okay kurt responded they were not on the manifest and dr saunders likes to be informed of irregularities theyre feed trucks for chrissake spencer pronounced you have my okay send them down to the farm so we can get in here as you wish kurt said he took a plastic card from a pocket and swiped it through a card swipe mounted on a pole near the first trucks cab immediately the heavy chainlink fence began to squeak open in response to the gates movement the driver of the lead truck started his diesel engine in the confined space within the gateruse tunnel the noise was considerable as were the fumes deborah quickly moved outside as did spencer thank you for solving that problem deborah said she noticed that the doctors eyes which were darting up and down her frame were almost the same blue as those of the security man in black my pleasure spencer said to his despair his voice cracked as he tried to camouflage a surge of nervousness talking with deborah directly up close with the amount of cleavage visible he could tell that her dark olive skin wasnt tan as hed originally assumed it was her normal coloring he also noticed her eyebrows were dark as were her eyes combining it all with the blond hair gave him the impression she was a wild and sensual free spirit well see you around doctor deborah said she smiled and started back toward the car just a moment spencer called out deborah stopped and turned what is your name if i may ask georgina marks deborah responded she felt her pulse quicken it was the first time shed used the alias is it true you have an appointment with helen masterson at ten oclock deborah answered unfortunately were late thanks to that security fellow i will give her a call and let her know it was not your fault thank you thats very kind of you so you are looking for work here at the clinic yes deborah said my roommate and i are both interested we plan to commute together interesting spencer said what kind of work are you looking for ive a degree in molecular biology deborah said being purposefully vague about the level id like to work in the lab molecular biology im impressed spencer said sincerely from what school may i ask harvard deborah said she and joanna had discussed this issue when theyd filled out the emailed employment applications since they were concerned about being recognized from the harvard association theyd considered naming a different school but theyd decided to be truthful to be able to field any specific questions about their college training harvard spencer responded he was momentarily nonplussed molecular biology had been enough of a surprise harvard only made it worse suggesting that deborah might not be quite as much the free spirit hed originally taken her to be and perhaps not so easily impressible what about your roommate he asked to change the subject is she looking for lab work as well no prudence prudence heatherly would like to work in the office deborah said shes skilled in word processing and computers in general well im sure we can use both of you spencer said and let me make a suggestion why dont you and your roommate come to my office after you see helen deborah tilted her head to the side and squinted her eyes as if she were assessing spencers motives maybe we could have a coffee or something spencer suggested how would i find you deborah asked just ask helen spencer said as i said ill be giving her a call about you and ill mention well be getting together ill do that deborah said she smiled then turned around and headed back toward the car spencer watched her go he couldnt help but notice the voluptuous way her buttocks moved beneath the silky synthetic fabric of her skirt although he could tell it was an inexpensive garment he thought it was erotically flattering harvard he marveled to himself he would have thought his old high school alma mater sommerville high more likely and ultimately more promising how can anyone walk around in shoes like this all day deborah questioned as she climbed back into the car you should see yourself joanna laughed its hilarious careful deborah warned youre going to undermine my selfesteem joanna restarted the car as the truck in front began to move i noticed you were talking with that gentleman with the bentley youll never guess who he is deborah said coyly joanna put the car in gear and began to move forward slowly to her chagrin deborah as usual was making her ask joanna resisted for several beats but her curiosity prevailed all right who is he she questioned dr wingate himself and contrary to your concerns he was titillated by my outfit titillated or contemptuous theres a big difference although it might not be apparent without doubt the former deborah said i have proof were invited for coffee after we see the personnel director are you joking absolutely not deborah said triumphantly joanna nosed the car into the tunnel spencer was still there between the man in black and the uniformed guard although the gate was open it started to close with the distance joanna had allowed to develop between herself and the truck spencer motioned to joanna to stop she did and rolled down the window ill be looking forward to seeing you ladies later he said enjoy your interviews from his wallet he pulled a blue plastic card similar to the one the man in black had used earlier and ran it through the card swipe the gate stopped lurched and then began swinging open again spencer motioned for them to drive on with a gracious welcoming gesture hes rather distinguishedlooking joanna said as she motored out of the tunnel i should say deborah agreed strangely enough he bears a strong resemblance to my father now youre the one joking deborah said she looked over at joanna i dont think he looks like your father in the slightest to me he looks like a doctor on a soap opera im serious joanna said he has the same build and the same coloring even the same cold aloofness you have to be reading the aloofness into him deborah said with me he was anything but aloof you should have seen the gymnastics his eyeballs were doing thanks to the cleavage my miracle bra has created you dont think he looks a little like my father nope joanna shrugged thats strange because i do maybe its something subliminal the car cleared the stand of evergreens just beyond the gatehouse affording the women the first full view of the old cabot building this place is even grimmer than i remembered deborah said she leaned forward to get a better look through the front windshield i dont even remember those stone gargoyles on the downspouts theres so much victorian decoration its hard to take it all in at once joanna said its certainly easy to see why the employees call it the monstrosity the curving driveway bore them up to the parking area on the south side just as they broached the top of the hill the smokestack could be seen off to the east as was the case when deborah saw it previously it was belching smoke you know deborah said that chimney reminds me there was something about this place i forgot to tell you joanna found a parking spot and pulled in she turned off the ignition silently she counted to ten hoping that for once deborah would finish one of her delayed thoughts without joanna having to ask i give up she said at length what did you forget to tell me about the cabot had its own crematorium as part of its power plant it gave me a queasy feeling when i was told about it wondering if some of the inmates remains back then could have been used to heat the place what a ghastly thought joanna responded why on earth did you think that i couldnt help it deborah said the crematorium the barbedwire fence laborers they must have had for the farm they made me think of nazi concentration camps lets go inside joanna said she wasnt about to grace such a thought with a response she opened the car door and got out deborah did the same on her side a crematorium would also be a handy way to cover up any mistakes or mischief of any sort deborah added were late joanna said lets get in there and get these jobs nine may o am the odor was warm moist fetid and offensively feral paul saunders was wearing a surgical mask but not for antiseptic purposes it was purely because he found the smell intolerable in the sows birthing stall he was standing with sheila donaldson and greg lynch the powerfully built veterinarian hed been able to entice away from the tufts university veterinary program with a high salary and the promise of stock options he and sheila had surgical gowns over their street clothes and were sporting rubber boots greg had on a massive rubber apron and heavy rubber gloves i thought you said this birth was imminent paul complained he had his arms crossed and his hands in surgical gloves all indications are that it is greg said besides were at day two hundred and eightynine in this pregnancy shes long overdue he patted the pigs head and the animal let out a loud prolonged squeal cant we induce her paul said wincing at the high pitched shriek he looked over the stalls railing at carl smith as if to ask whether carl had brought any oxytocin or any other kind of uterine stimulant carl was standing by the anesthesia machine theyd purchased for the farm he was there in case of an emergency its best we just let nature take its course greg said its coming trust me no sooner were the words out of gregs mouth than a shower of amniotic fluid sprayed out over the strawcovered floor accompanied by another earsplitting squeal both paul and sheila had to leap out of the way to avoid being drenched by the warm fluid paul rolled his eyes once hed regained his footing the indignities i have to bear in the name of science he complained its unreal things are going to happen pretty quickly now greg said he positioned himself behind the animal vainly trying to avoid stepping in the feces the animal was on her side not soon enough to suit me paul said he looked at sheila when was the last ultrasound yesterday sheila said and i didnt like the size of the umbilical vessels i was able to visualize you remember i told you right yes i remember paul said shaking his head dejectedly sometimes the failures we have to endure in this business get to me especially in this part of the research if this batch is again all stillborn im going to be at a loss i dont know what else to try we can at least try to be optimistic sheila suggested a phone rang in the background one of the animal handlers watching from the sidelines ran to get it the pig squealed again here we go greg said he thrust his gloved hand inside the animal shes dilated now give me some room paul and sheila were more than happy to move as far out of the way as the stall would allow dr saunders im supposed to give you a message the animal handler said hed returned from answering the phone and had come up to pauls right side paul waved the man away the first of the litter was crowning amid squeals from the mother pig the next instant the firstborn was out but it did not look good and the dusky blue creature made only feeble attempts to breathe the umbilical vessels were huge more than twice the normal size greg tied them off and then got ready for the next once the births had started they happened in rapid succession within minutes the entire litter was lined up on the stalls strawcovered floor bloody and unmoving carl had made a motion to pick up the first one to try to resuscitate it but paul told him not to bother because there was obviously too much congenital malformation for several minutes the group silently stared at the pitiful newborns the sow instinctively ignored them the idea of using the human mitochondria obviously didnt work paul said breaking the silence its discouraging i thought my idea was brilliant it made so much sense yet you can tell just by looking at these creatures they all have the same cardiopulmonary pathology as the last group at least were getting them to go to term consistently greg said when we started we were dealing with firsttrimester miscarriages every time paul sighed i want to see a normal offspring not a stillborn im long past seeing them getting to term as any sign of success should we autopsy them sheila asked i suppose to be complete paul said without enthusiasm we know what the pathology is because its obviously the same as last time but it should be documented for posterity what we need to know is how to eliminate it so its back to the proverbial drawing board what about the ovaries sheila asked that goes without saying paul said thats got to be done now while theyre still alive the autopsies can wait if need be after the ovaries are taken you can put these creatures in the cooler and autopsy them when convenient but once the autopsies are done incinerate the carcasses what about the placenta sheila asked that should be photographed along with the sow paul said he gave the bloody mass a nudge with his rubber boot it should also be autopsied it too is obviously abnormal dr saunders the animal handler said about that phone call for chissake stop pestering me about the phone paul yelled because if its about those damn feed trucks i dont care if they sit out there for twentyfour hours they were supposed to have arrived yesterday not today it was not about the trucks the animal handler said in fact the trucks are already here at the farm what paul cried i specifically said they were not to come in until i gave the okay and i did not give the okay they got the okay from dr wingate the animal handler said thats what the phone message was about dr wingate is here at the clinic and wants to see you over at the monstrosity for a moment the only sounds in the vast barn were the occasional distant moos of the cows squeals of the other pigs and the barking of the dogs paul and sheila looked at each other with surprise did you know he was coming back paul asked sheila eventually i had no idea sheila said paul looked over at carl dont look at me carl said i didnt have any idea either paul shrugged just one more challenge i suppose well there you have it miss heatherly and miss marks helen masterson said concluding her canned preemployment monologue she leaned back in her desk chair with her palms and fingers pressed together as if praying she was a husky woman with a ruddy fleshy face dimpled chin and a short nononsense hairstyle when she smiled her eyes were reduced to mere slits both joanna and deborah were seated in front of her on the other side of the womans cluttered desk if the conditions rules and salary that ive laid out are acceptable we here at the wingate clinic are pleased to offer you women employment joanna and deborah briefly looked at each other and nodded sounds good to me deborah said to me too joanna agreed wonderful helen said with a smile making her eyes all but disappear now do you have any questions for me yes joanna said wed like to start as soon as possible in fact we were hoping tomorrow could be our first day is that possible thats rather difficult helen said it doesnt give us time to process your applications she hesitated for a moment before continuing but i suppose that shouldnt necessarily restrict us and frankly were expanding so quickly we can use the help so if we can get you to be seen today by dr paul saunders who insists on meeting all new employees and get you processed by security why not what does it mean to be processed by security joanna asked she exchanged glances with deborah thats really just to get you an access card helen said it gets you in the front gate and allows you to log on to the computer at your workstation it can do more than that of course depending on how its programmed joannas eyebrows raised at helens mention of the computer it was a gesture unnoticed by the personnel director but seen by deborah im curious about your computer setup joanna said since i assume ill be doing a lot of word processing id like to learn more about it for example i assume your system has multilayered authorization levels im no expert in the computer arena helen said with a nervous laugh ill have to refer you to our network administrator randy porter for definitive answers but if i understand your question the answer is certainly yes our local area network is set up to recognize various groups of users each with distinct access privileges but dont worry both of you will certainly have appropriate privileges for your designated work if thats your concern joanna nodded it is my concern especially since the system sounds sophisticated would it be possible for me to see the hardware itself i imagine that would give me a good idea about what to expect i dont see any reason why not helen said any other questions i have a question deborah said we ran into dr wingate at the front gate he said he was going to get in touch with you about us did he yes he did helen said which was a bit of a surprise and im to take you to his office when you are finished with me any other questions joanna and deborah looked at each other before shaking their heads then i have some questions of my own helen said i know you are planning on commuting back and forth to boston but id like you to think about the very nice accommodations we have here on the premises which we encourage our staff to utilize since we prefer our employees to live here would you be willing to see the units it would only take a few minutes we have a golf cart out back to take us over there joanna started to decline but deborah overrode her by saying it might be interesting to see the apartments if they had time well that leads me to one final question helen said she looked at deborah i dont know how to word this miss marks but do you always dress so so flamboyantly joanna suppressed a giggle as deborah stumbled over an explanation for her style of dress well perhaps you could tone it down a tad helen said trying to be diplomatic were healthcare professionals after all without waiting for a response from deborah helen picked up her phone and dialed an extension the ensuing conversation was short she merely asked if napoleon was in listened for a moment nodding her head and then said shed be over straightaway with two new recruits helen stood up and the women followed suit as they did they could see over the tops of the dividers that separated the large highceilinged former ward into individual work spaces they were in the administration area located on the second floor and where joanna was slotted to work the windows of those cubicles which had them looked out over the front of the building affording a commanding view to the west few heads were visible in the maze of work spaces it was as if most everyone were on a coffee break come with me helen said stepping out of her cubicle she started off down the central aisle while talking over her thick shoulder well have you meet dr saunders its a pro forma exercise but we should have his imprimatur before proceeding any further you remember who he is dont you joanna whispered to deborah as they followed a few steps behind the personnel director helen wended her way out into the corridor which separated the administration area from the laboratory located on the east side of the wing of course i remember deborah said it will be the first test if were going to get away with this im not concerned about him joanna said its dr donaldson that im worried about dr saunders didnt look at my face long enough to remember me at least not while i was awake he looked at me long enough deborah said and he was not a happy camper as i told you helen suddenly stopped by a door that had a no admittance sign posted on it why not she said after a beat and without explanation she opened the door which was unlocked and passed through the women followed the twentyfootlong corridor beyond deadended at a blank second door helen tried the door but it was locked she took out her wallet and extracted a blue swipe card similar to the one spencer had used to open the outside gate careful to keep the magnetic strip properly oriented she passed the card rapidly through a card swipe attached to the wall next to the door there was a click when she retried the door it opened helen pushed the door wide open and stepped to the side she looked back at joanna this is our computer server room theres our equipment beyond that i cant tell you very much joannas eyes swept the windowless room whose floor had been raised eight inches to conceal the wiring there were four large vertically oriented electronic units and a small bookcase filled with manuals more importantly there was a server console with a keyboard a mouse and a monitor displaying an active screen saver golden sting rays and bluegray sharks endlessly swam to and fro a single empty ergonomic chair sat in front of the console very impressive joanna said i wouldnt know helen admitted have you seen enough joanna nodded will i have access to this room with my card she asked helen regarded her as if shed said something inordinately stupid of course not clearance for spaces such as this is reserved to department heads only why would you want to come in here anyway joanna shrugged only if i were having a problem i couldnt rectify from my workstation keyboard for that kind of a problem youll have to see randy porter if you can find him i have to admit hes fairly elusive if hes not in his cubicle helen closed to the door and it locked with a resounding click on to see our fearless leader helen said she retraced her steps back to the main corridor and set out again acting as if the slight detour to see the server room had caused them to be late she nipped her pace joanna and deborah had to hurry to keep up deborahs heels striking against the terrazzo floor made loud cracking noises like automaticrifle fire the vaulted ceiling magnified the sounds by producing multiple echoes what do you think deborah whispered between breaths if we dont luck out and get the access we need to our files then ill have to get into that room for about ten or fifteen minutes which means well need a blue card that will open the door apparently ours wont how are we going to manage that well have to be creative joanna said im sorry to have to hurry you like this helen called back to e women from where she was holding open a heavy fire door leading from the buildings south wing into the central tower dr saunders can be hard to corner if he leaves his office before we arrive we could have trouble finding him and if you dont get to see him you will not be starting work tomorrow joanna and deborah passed through the fire door which helen let close behind her the women found themselves in a dramatically different environment instead of terrazzo the floor was oak and instead of tile plaster or exposed brick the walls were paneled mahogany there was even a threadbare oriental runner extending down the long hallway come on helen urged she led the women down the corridor and through a doorway into an outer office a secretary sat at a desk behind which were two doors one closed the other ajar there were several couches and a coffee table dont tell me we missed dr saunders helen inquired of the secretary hes still here the woman said as she gestured over her shoulder at the closed door but hes engaged at the moment helens face registered understanding she knew full well whose office was behind the closed door lowering her voice she said i was shocked to learn dr wingate was here you and everyone else the secretary whispered with a nod no one expected it he arrived this morning unannounced theres been a bit of fireworks as you well can imagine it was helens turn to nod then she shrugged it will be interesting to see what happens thats the truth the secretary said at any rate im sure dr saunders will be out shortly perhaps you and your applicants would like to make yourselves comfortable she smiled graciously at joanna and deborah almost simultaneous with the group taking seats the closed office door opened and banged against its stop paul saunderss short frame filled the doorway but his attention was directed back into spencers office his face was flushed and his hands were balled into tight fists i cant sit in here the entire day and argue about all this paul spat ive got patients to see and work to do even if you dont spencers form materialized behind paul and crowded him out of the doorway forcing him to take a step back into the anteroom spencer was almost a foot taller and his tanned skin made paul look paler than usual his eyes blazed with an intensity equivalent with pauls ill excuse that kind of impertinence as a product of the heat of the moment he snapped thats very big of you considering its true i have a fiduciary responsibility to this clinic and its stockholders spencer hissed and i want you to understand that i intend to carry out that duty the wingate is primarily a clinical organization and weve been that way from day one our research is to support our clinical efforts and not vice versa thats a luddite attitude if ive ever heard one paul shot back research is an investment in the future shortterm sacrifice for longterm benefit were positioned to be at the cutting edge of stemcell research which has the potential of being the basis of twentyfirstcentury medicine but we have to be willing to forfeit some profit and take some risks in the short run well revisit this discussion when you have more time spencer stated flatly see me after your last patient abruptly he stepped back into his office grabbed the edge of his door and slammed it shut with a resounding bang paul took another step backward as if blown by wind from the slamming door furious at being dismissed when it had been his intent to walk out he spun around he took a single step toward his office when his eyes caught sight of the unexpected audience like the turret on a battleship his head pivoted in a staccato fashion as his gunbarrel eyes took in each individual in turn they stopped on deborah his expression softened ms masterson has some recruits for you to interview the secretary announced so i see paul said his tightly fisted hands relaxed and he gestured toward his open door as his eyes took in deborahs highheeled shoes short skirt and plunging neckline come in come in he said gladys did you offer our guests something to drink it didnt occur to me gladys admitted she furrowed her brow well have to rectify that paul said how about some coffee or a soft drink not for me thank you deborah said struggling to get to her feet it was an effort in the high heels since the couch was inordinately deep paul responded by bounding around gladyss desk to offer a hand but deborah made it upright without assistance she pulled her miniskirt down which had the effect of lowering her already low neckline paul glanced at joanna nothing for me either joanna said she felt like the poor relation when paul immediately switched his attention back to deborah and then made a point of graciously guiding her into his office joanna and helen followed paul added a third chair to the two facing his desk and gestured for everyone to sit he went around behind his desk and sat himself helen proceeded to introduce the two women with their aliases and mentioned their respective harvard undergraduate degrees along with which departments they hoped to work for excellent paul said with a broad smile revealing his small square widely spaced front teeth which were in concert with his wide squat nose bloody excellent as they say in merry old england he laughed without taking his eyes off deborah he added it appears miss masterson youve found us several more fine prospective employees youre to be congratulated so we should continue with the employment process helen questioned certainly by all means they have expressed an interest in starting as early as tomorrow helen said thats even better paul said their zeal should be rewarded since were in dire need of help particularly in the lab youll be very welcome miss marks thank you deborah said mildly selfconscious about the attention she was getting at the expense of joanna im looking forward to using some of that superb equipment you have no sooner had the statement left her mouth than deborah felt her pulse quicken and her face redden it had belatedly occurred to her that she had yet to see the lab on this trip luckily the only person who seemed to realize the blunder was joanna paul continued the conversation without so much as a beat let me ask you something about your lab experience miss marks paul said have you ever done any nuclear transfer i havent deborah stammered but i can certainly learn we do a lot of nuclear transfer paul said its an integral part of our research efforts since i spend a lot of time in the lab ill be happy to show you the technique personally youll find me a willing and hopefully apt pupil deborah said having regained her composure out of the corner of her eye she caught joanna briefly rolling her eyes well then helen said after a brief silence gripped the room she stood i think wed better get to it if were going to have miss heatherly and miss marks working tomorrow the women stood as did paul im sorry about the verbal exchange you people inadvertently witnessed earlier paul said the founder of the clinic and i have an occasional minor disagreement but its more about style than substance i hope the little episode doesnt adversely color your impression of the institution five minutes later helen was leading the women back through the fire door into the south wing of the building i gather that dr wingate doesnt come into the clinic often joanna said to helen not over the last year and a half helen said we all thought he was permanently retired and living in florida is there some problem about him and dr saunders getting along deborah asked i wouldnt know anything about that helen said vaguely as shed done previously once in the footballfieldlength southwing corridor she bustled ahead mostly due to deborahs highheeled shoes the younger women lagged behind that was a strange interview joanna said in a hushed voice that man is weird which of course we already knew at least he didnt recognize us deborah said true but no thanks to you what is that supposed to mean deborah demanded in a forced whisper between breaths i dont think you should be coming on to these men like you are get out of here im not coming on to anyone theyre coming on to me well youre not helping this is supposed to be a quick clandestine operation not a drawnout parody youre just jealous thatll be the day i dont want men staring at me like that ill tell you what i think all this proves deborah said but then didnt finish her thought tell me joanna mockingly pleaded after a brief silence we blondes certainly have more fun joanna swiped at deborah playfully but deborah avoided the blow both laughed briefly ahead they could see helen standing at a doorway and looking back at them impatiently what did you think of that little verbal setto between the two chiefs deborah asked while they were still out of earshot of helen therere obviously some interesting management issues here joanna said i couldnt help but notice how helen referred to dr saunders as napoleon when she was on the phone and how she called him our fearless leader when talking with us that doesnt imply a lot of respect i agree deborah said i also didnt buy her disclaimer about having no knowledge of a problem between the two well its not our concern thats for sure deborah agreed the next step in the womens preemployment process was a visit to security contrary to joannas earlier concerns it was an easy procedure the location was one of the cubicles in the administration area manned by a guard wearing the same uniform as the individual with the clipboard at the front gate he took polaroid photos of both women and created laminated plastic wingate clinic id cards which the women were instructed to have on their person at all times while on the premises the second part of the security process involved the blue entry cards the guard produced these by entering the womens predetermined level of access obtained from material given by helen into a form displayed on his workstation monitor it took a moment because he typed with only two fingers once the typing was completed the cards were extruded automatically he handed them over and told the women to be careful with them the next step was computer access that involved going to a different cubicle where the women were introduced to randy porter according to helen they were lucky to have caught him at his workstation randy was a sandyhaired slightly built fellow who looked like he was still in his teens he explained to the women that when they sat at their workstations for the first time and swiped their blue cards through the slot on the top of their keyboards a prompt would pop up asking them for a password he said they were to select new and then provide a secret word which only they would be apt to know and which they could count on remembering should the password be a specific number of letters or digits joanna asked thats up to you randy said but it is best if it is six or more alphanumeric ciphers just be sure its something you can remember because if you forget your password you have to come to me and that can take some time helen gave a short corroboratory laugh any other questions randy asked what kind of a system is it joanna asked the operating system is windows data center server and the hardware its an ibm server xseries with a shiva firewall randy said is that what youre asking thanks joanna said simply its all greek to me helen said is that it thats it from my end randy said unless there are more questions as they left the network administrators cubicle helen checked the time it was almost one oclock in the afternoon she hesitated in the aisle id like to introduce you to your respective department heads helen said but it is lunch time perhaps i could invite you to have something to eat in our dining hall gauging from dr saunderss response im certain he would not want you to go hungry joanna started to decline the invitation but deborah interrupted her by saying lunch sounds good to me wonderful helen said i know im famished the dining hall was located on the second floor of a twostory curved pavilion attached to the back of the central section of the building helen led the women back on the same route theyd used to get to the directors office but after the fire door they took a light instead of a left damn it why did you have to agree to eat here joanna whispered sotto voce to deborah when she was confident helen had gotten far enough ahead so she could not hear because im hungry deborah said flippantly the more we do here today and the longer we stay the greater the chance well be recognized oh im not so sure about that deborah said besides the more we learn about this place the greater chance well have succeeding tomorrow when were here in earnest i wish youd take this more seriously im taking it seriously deborah blurted joanna shushed her as they came up to helen whod waited for them the dining room was semicircular in shape with windows looking out the rear of the building with the ground sloping downward the view to the east was expansive deborah recalled that the lab had a similar view although from smaller windows and hence it was not quite as dramatic the roof peaks and chimneys of some of the living quarters could be seen sticking up above the budding trees as could the much larger chimney of the power station also the red top of a silo was just visible between the power station and the living quarters helen restrained the women at the threshold while she scanned the diners obviously searching for someone in particular the room was large and like the rest of the building it had numerous victorian details including a central period crystal chandelier considering its size the room was hardly crowded only thirty to forty people were sitting at widely separated tables their voices caused only a soft murmur joanna stiffened as she caught sight of dr donaldson sitting with five other professionalappearing colleagues turning her back in the doctors direction joanna grabbed deborah by the upper arm and motioned with her head deborah immediately comprehended relax for goodness sake deborah said joannas anxious paranoia was getting on her nerves is something wrong helen asked no nothing joanna said innocently she gave deborah a dirty look there they are helen said pointing off to the right theres megan finnigan the laboratory supervisor and christine parham the office manager conveniently enough theyre sitting at the same table come on let me introduce you joanna cringed and tried to keep her back toward dr donaldson as she followed deborah whod fallen in behind helen helen was leading them toward one of the tables near the window to joannas dismay the sound of deborahs heels on the aged parquet floor combined with her tawdrily provocative outfit had caught the attention of everyone in the place including dr donaldson deborah was unconcerned about the stir she was causing her attention had been absorbed by a table of spanishspeaking diners shed passed near the dining rooms entrance they were all young compact darkly complected women who deborah guessed were south american or central american natives what caught her attention was that they all appeared to be pregnant and all of them seemed equally far along following the introductions to the two department heads who had finished their meals and were about to depart helen took joanna and helen to a separate table there they were served by another woman who like the young women theyd seen on the way in appeared to deborah like she was from south or central america she too was pregnant to the same degree as the others once the lunch was served deborahs curiosity got the best of her and she asked helen about the women they are central americans helen said corroborating deborahs impression theyre from nicaragua its an arrangement that dr saunders has made with a colleague in that country they come for a number of months on a work visa and then return home i have to say they have solved a big problem for us by providing kitchen cleaning and serving help which we were unable to find in this area do they come with their families no just by themselves its a chance for them to make a serious amount of money which they send back home but they all look pregnant deborah remarked is that some kind of coincidence no coincidence at all helen said its a way for them to earn extra money but listen eat up i really would like to show you the living quarters which i hope we can talk you into taking advantage o i know youll be pleased with the rents theyre shockingly reasonable especially compared to those in boston deborah looked at joanna to see if shed been listening for most of the meal joanna had been preoccupied by dr donaldsons presence and the supposed need to keep her back to the table where the doctor had been sitting but dr donaldson had now left and it was apparent to deborah that joanna had heard what helen had said about the women laborers joanna returned deborahs stare with a look that was a mixture of dismay and disbelief ten may o pm after lunch helen managed to get the two women into the golf cart despite joannas reservations once the tour began even joanna found it interesting the size of the property was impressive and most of it was covered with dense oldgrowth forest the residences of the upperechelon personnel like wingate saunders donaldson and a few of the others were detached homes similar to the gatehouse in style although with white trim instead of black making them significantly more appealing even the average workers housing was charming the buildings were twostory row houses grouped together in a fashion reminiscent of a rural english village the twobedroom unit helen showed the women was quite homey its front windows looked over a small cobble stoned central square while its larger rear windows faced south affording a view over the millpond equally attractive was the rent eight hundred dollars a month at deborahs insistence after leaving the apartment helen took them on a short loop around the farm and even around the power plant before bringing them back to the main building the only downside of the entire excursion was that joanna and deborah were never out of helens earshot and had no chance to speak privately it wasnt until helen deposited them back in the anteroom of wingate and saunderss office to wait for dr wingate that they had their chance to talk what was your take on those pregnant workers in the dining room deborah asked in a whisper to keep gladys the secretary from overhearing i was blown over joanna said i cant believe they have a whole group of migrant women who are being paid to become pregnant do you think it is some kind of experiment heaven only knows joanna said with a shudder the question is what are they doing with the children i should hope the children are going back with the mothers to nicaragua joanna said i dont even like to think of any other possibility the first thing that comes to my mind is that they are selling them deborah said surrogacy doesnt seem likely since they are all so equivalently far along selling them could be quite a lucrative business on the side being an infertility clinic they certainly have the appropriate clientele and when we were here a year and a half ago you were impressed with the money this place was seemingly raking in i was impressed with the money they have to be generating from the infertility business joanna said with the numbers theyre obviously doing here they dont have to be in the baby business to make ends meet it doesnt make sense selling babies is against the law pure and simple and helen masterson was so upfront about it if they were doing something against the law she certainly wouldnt have been so forthright i suppose youre right deborah said there has to be some reasonable explanation maybe they are women suffering from infertility themselves maybe helping them get pregnant is part of the deal to get them to come joanna treated deborah to a look of disbelief thats even less likely than surrogacy and for the same reason yeah well i cant think of any other explanation nor can i joanna agreed im going to be happy to learn about my eggs and then turn my back on this organization i felt uneasy about this place the first day we came here to donate and today has just underlined that impression the door to dr wingates office opened and the doctor emerged with narrowrimmed reading glasses perched on the end of his nose clutched in his hand were balance sheets which he continued to examine intently up until the moment he placed them on the secretarys desk he didnt appear to be pleased call the accountants he muttered to gladys tell them i want to see all four quarters of last year yes sir gladys said spencer gave the balance sheets a final knock with his knuckle were still mulling over their contents before looking in the direction he took a fortifying breath and then walked over to where they were sitting as he approached his expression softened and a tentative smile appeared good afternoon miss marks he said reaching out to shake hand which he held for an extra moment as he locked eyes with her then turning to joanna he said im sorry but i dont remember your name georgina mentioned it but its slipped my mind prudence heatherly joanna said she shook spencers hand and stared up into his face deborah had been right the man didnt look like her father yet there was something about him that was similarly superficially appealing im sorry to have kept you ladies waiting he said switching his attention back to deborah weve been enjoying a chance to sit and relax deborah said she could tell the good doctor was having trouble keeping his eyes off her crossed legs miss masterson has kept us on a busy schedule i hope your visit has been successful very much so deborah said well be starting work tomorrow excellent spencer said excellent indeed he rubbed his hands restlessly and looked back and forth between the two women as if he were trying to make up his mind about something he pulled a chair over and sat down across from them well he said what can we get you coffee tea or a soft drink some sparkling water would be nice deborah said same for me joanna said reluctantly she felt like the odd man out she hadnt particularly wanted to come to wingates office and now that she had it was painfully obvious the man was unabashedly interested in deborah as far as joanna was concerned the way he was looking at deborah bordered on disgusting spencer told the secretary to get the cold drinks while she was doing so he made small talk about the clinic when the secretary returned it was with only two small bottles of san pellegrino arent you having anything deborah asked no im fine spencer said but he didnt seem to be he crossed and uncrossed his legs several times while the women poured their drinks he was obviously nervous about something are we taking too much of your time joanna inquired perhaps we should go and let you get back to your work no dont go spencer said timewise im fine what i would like to do miss marks is have a word with you in private deborah took the glass from her lips and stared at spencer the question was so unexpected she wasnt sure shed heard correctly spencer pointed toward his office if we could just step into the other room for a moment i would be appreciative deborah looked at joanna who shrugged suggesting it didnt matter to her although deborah could tell she was not amused about the whole situation all right deborah said redirecting her attention back to spencer she put her glass down on the coffee table and with a muffled grunt got herself to her feet following spencers lead she entered the office spencer came in behind her and closed the door ill come right to the point miss marks spencer said for the first time he avoided looking at her by directing his attention out the giant window ive encouraged an unspoken policy here at the clinic discouraging social liaisons between management and employees and since you will technically not be an employee until tomorrow i was wondering if you would consider having dinner with me tonight the moment he got the last word out he turned from the window and regarded her expectantly deborah was rendered momentarily speechless shed been enjoying the part she was playing but she hadnt anticipated attracting anything more than a second look she hadnt expected to he asked out by the head of the clinic a man who shed assumed was married and who was at least twice her age theres a quaint restaurant not too far out of town spencer said as deborah hesitated i dont know if youve been there yet its called the barn im certain its charming deborah managed finding her voice and its awfully nice of you to think of me but there are some logistical problems you see my roommate and i dont live out here we live in boston i see spencer said well perhaps i could talk you into an early dinner i believe they open as early as fivethirty which isnt very long from now that way you could be on the road back to boston as early as seven or eight oclock instinctively deborah checked her watch it was almost four in the afternoon i certainly enjoyed our little chat this morning spencer added encouragingly id love to continue it and learn more about what aspect of molecular biology captures your fancy i mean we obviously have common interests common interests deborah scoffed to herself while she stared into the mans blue eyes she sensed a touch of desperation in this successful and reasonably attractive physician deborah decided to test the water what would mrs wingate say about this idea there is no mrs wingate spencer responded unfortunately my wife divorced me a number of years ago it was unexpected in retrospect i suppose i was too dedicated to my work and neglected my marriage im sorry deborah said its all right spencer said lowering his eyes its a cross ive had to bear the good side is that ive finally come to terms with the situation and im ready to get out there and socialize to some extent well im flattered that you have thought of me but i am out here in bookford with my roommate and we have only one car you dont think she could entertain herself for a couple of hours deborah could not believe this guy did he truly believe that shed be willing to ask her best friend to twiddle her thumbs for two hours so they could have dinner it was so absurdly egocentric she couldnt think of an immediate reply therere plenty of things she could do in town spencer said theres a nice little bar and a surprisingly good pizza place and the local book store is a favorite hangout with an espresso bar in the back deborah was about to tell the good doctor to go jump in the mill pond when she held back a way of turning the unexpected situation to her and joannas benefit occurred to her like a bolt out of the blue instead of telling spencer off she said you know dinner at the barn is starting to sound very tempting spencers face brightened im pleased and im sure penelope or what ever her name is will find checking out the town enjoyable as for you im sure youll find the barn a surprisingly good restaurant the food is country style but tasty and the wine list isnt so bad either her name is prudence deborah said the deal is that prudence comes to the restaurant as well spencers expression clouded he started to protest but deborah cut him off shes a great kid deborah said dont be too quick to judge because of her style she might look conservative but let me tell you she can be a hellraiser when she gets a few drinks under her belt im sure shes lovely spencer said but i was hoping to have some time with you alone you might find this hard to believe deborah said but we often go out on dates together with the same guy provided the guy is willing to have an open mind improvising in hopes of being seductively coquettish she winked while touching her upper lip with the tip of her tongue really spencer commented as his imagination took wing hed never been with two women before although hed seen such episodes in xrated videos really deborah said trying to make her voice huskier than it really was spencer gestured with his palms up fingers spread hey i certainly have an open mind lets do it wonderful deborah said well meet you at the barn at fivethirty and do me a favor certainly spencer said what dont work too hard the rest of the afternoon it will be better if youre not too tired you have my word spencer said raising his hands in surrender joanna slammed the car door and stuck the key in the ignition but she didnt start the car instead she leaned her forehead against the steering wheel while deborah got in on her side now run this by me once more joanna spat did you tell me that you agreed for the two of us to go to dinner with this disgusting lecher who you admit has some sort of sexual fantasy in mind tell me that im just dreaming this all up no you got it right deborah agreed but im surprised at your description of the good doctor this morning you said he was distinguished that was in response to his appearance not his behavior and that was this morning not this afternoon well deborah said you should have let me know you felt so strongly before i was carried off into his office deborah knew she was taunting joanna but her roommate hadnt given her a chance to explain the situation as they left wingates office deborah had mentioned the evenings plans and joanna had immediately launched into an angry diatribe then without allowing deborah so much as another word joanna had stormed out of the wingate clinic this car is going back to boston straightaway joanna announced if you want to stay out here and get it on with that rake thats your business but personally i think you are crazy will you calm down deborah said im quite calm enough joanna said now are you getting out or what shut up and listen deborah ordered i had the same reaction as you when he first suggested dinner but then it occurred to me he has something we want and need something critical joanna took a deep breath to keep from lashing out again at deborah as usual deborah was forcing her to ask okay joanna said at length what does he have that we need his blue access card deborah said triumphantly hes more than a department head hes the founder his blue card will certainly open the door to the server room and probably every other door in the entire place joanna lifted her head from where shed been leaning it against the steering wheel what deborah was saying was undoubtedly true but what did it matter she looked at her roommate hes not going to give us his access card because we go to dinner with him of course not deborah said were going to take it all we have to do is get him drunk and while one of us is diverting him the other snags the blue card at first joanna thought deborah was just being her blithe self and that shed laugh and say she was just kidding but she didnt she returned joannas gaze with a look of selfsatisfaction i dont know joanna said sounds easy on paper but difficult to execute you said yourself we were going to have to be creative to get into the server room deborah said this is creative youre making a lot of assumptions joanna said how do you know he drinks maybe hes a teetotaler i dont think thats a worry deborah said he mentioned that the restaurant where were supposed to meet him has a good wine list wine and women are definitely on his mind i dont know about this idea joanna said reluctantly oh come on deborah said admit its a good ideal have you come up with another plan for getting into that room no but but nothing deborah interjected what do we have to lose our dignity oh please give me a break just then dr donaldson and cynthia carson came out through the clinic door joanna suddenly scrunched down and ordered deborah to do the same now what deborah asked mimicking joanna and flattening herself below the level of the window dr donaldson and cynthia carson just came out of the clinic joanna whispered a few minutes ticked by the women heard car doors open and slam shut followed by the noise of the tires moving on the gravelstrewn pavement only then did they sit up im getting out of here joanna said after making sure the coast was clear she started the car jammed it in gear and backed out of the parking spot so deborah said are you with me or not joanna sighed all right she said ill give it a try but to get that blue card will take more than dinner well have to get him to take us back to his house probably deborah admitted but we might get lucky as far as the division of labor is concerned i want to make it clear that youll be doing the distracting and ill be doing the extracting i think well have to play it by ear as i said earlier hes expecting some kind of menage a trois good grief joanna exclaimed as she nosed the car up to the gate to get it to open none of my old friends in houston would believe this the women drove into town and revisited the ritesmart drugstore to ask directions to the barn the pharmacist had gained a few pounds but was just as cheerful as hed been a year and a half previously the barn is about two miles north of town he said pointing up main street in the direction theyd come its a good restaurant i recommend you have the pot roast doublebaked potatoes and the cheesecake with chocolate sauce that sounds like nice light fare joanna mocked as they returned to the street the women spent a half hour window shopping to pass some time before getting back into the car and driving out to the restaurant it was a quaint establishment having been an actual barn in its previous life lots of oldfashioned farm equipment graced the grounds and some was even attached to the side of the building inside the animal stalls had been converted into eating areas with banquettes the only windows were in the front creating a dark cozy atmosphere in the interior miss marks and miss heatherly the hostess asked before the women had a chance to say a word when they answered yes she motioned for them to follow clutching several menus she led them to the rearmost stall there in the dim candlelit recess was dr spencer wingate decked out in a blazer with an ascot and matching pocket square when he caught sight of joanna and deborah he bounded out from behind the table gallantly kissed each womans hand and then graciously gestured for them to sit down the hostess placed menus in front of each woman smiled and disappeared i hope you dont mind he said ive taken the liberty of ordering some wine before you got here he reached out and turned the labels of the two bottles sitting on the table toward the women a crisp white and a fullbodied red i like my reds fullbodied he laughed briefly deborah winked at joanna she thought the evening was getting off to a good start would anyone like a cocktail in addition to the wine spencer asked were not hard liquor drinkers deborah said but dont let that inhibit you a martini would hit the spot he said are you sure neither of you ladies would care to join me both women declined the evening progressed smoothly the conversation was effortless since spencer was easily encouraged to talk about spencer by the time dessert was served the women had been treated to a lengthy and detailed history of the wingate clinic and its success the more spencer talked the more liberally he drank the only minor problem was that he showed no outward effect from the alcohol hed imbibed i have a question about the clinic deborah said when spencer finally paused in his monologue to attack the cheese cake drenched in chocolate sauce whats the story about the pregnant nicaraguans are some of the nicaraguan ladies pregnant spencer asked it seemed to us they all were pregnant deborah said and all about the same degree as if theyd become pregnant through some airborne infection spencer laughed pregnancy as an infectious process thats a good one but its not too far from the truth after all it is caused by the invasion of a few million microorganisms he laughed again at his attempt at humor you mean to tell me you are unaware of these pregnancies deborah asked i know nothing about them spencer assured her what those ladies do on their time off is their business why im asking deborah continued is because we were told becoming pregnant for them was a way to earn extra money really spencer said who told you this ms masterson deborah said we asked her about them at lunch i shall have to ask her myself spencer said a short faltering smile appeared on his face ive not been as actively involved with the clinic as i should have been over the last couple of years so there are certain details im not aware of of course i knew about the nicaraguan ladies being with us its an arrangement dr saunders has made with a doctor friend in nicaragua to solve our chronic manpower problem what kind of research is dr saunders involved in deborah asked a little of this and a little of that spencer said vaguely hes a very creative researcher infertility is a rapidly advancing specialty whose advances will soon be making a big impact on medicine in general but this discussion is getting way too serious he laughed and for the first time swayed a bit before steadying himself lets lighten it up what i propose is that we go back to my house and raid my wine cellar what do you ladies say i say the sooner the better deborah responded as she covertly poked joanna whom she felt was being far too quiet and demure i think having more wine is a terrific idea joanna said when the bill came the women were interested to see where spencer kept his wallet they were both hoping it would be in his jacket pocket but it wasnt to their chagrin it was in his rear pants pocket where it returned once the credit card had been replaced as they reached the front of the restaurant and were about to leave spencer excused himself to use the rest room youre going to have to be creative to get his pants off joanna whispered they were standing near the hostess podium although there had been no patrons when theyd arrived the restaurant was now almost full its surely not going to take creativity to get him out of his pants deborah whispered back the creativity is going to come in dealing with his expectations im amazed at how much he drank and how little its seemed to affect him hes had two martinis and two bottles of wine minus the minuscule amount you and i drank he did slur his words a little during dessert joanna said and sway a little too deborah added but thats not much effect for that much alcohol to be that tolerant he must be more of a lush than he appears if it had been me with that amount of alcohol id be comatose for three days spencer appeared at the mens room door smiled when he saw the women and then proceeded to stagger on a skewed course to collide with the hostess stand he grabbed onto it for support the dismayed hostess came from behind the stand to help all right deborah exclaimed in a triumphant whisper to joanna thats encouraging it must have been some kind of a delayed reaction is he all right the hostess asked as the women came up on both sides of spencer and lent a hand hes going to be just fine deborah said hes just unwinding a bit do you beautiful ladies know where my house is spencer asked slurring his words again we certainly do deborah said ms masterson pointed it out to us today then well have a race spencer announced before deborah could nix the idea spencer shook free and ran out of the restaurant deborah and joanna exchanged a startled glance before giving chase when they emerged into the fading evening light spencer was already climbing into his bentley they could hear him laughing wait deborah cried they ran toward the car but by the time they got to it spencer had the huge engine roaring deborah got her hand on the drivers side door handle but the door was locked she rapped on the glass she started to suggest that she drive but spencer merely laughed harder pointed to his ear to indicate he couldnt hear and then accelerated out of the parking lot oh crap deborah said as she and joanna watched the red tail lights disappear into the gathering gloom he shouldnt be driving joanna said yeah well he didnt give us a lot of choice deborah responded i hope he makes it if he doesnt lets be the first on the scene not that thats how i planned on getting that blasted card the women ran back to the chevy malibu joanna got it out on the road as fast as she could after every curve they half expected so come across the bentley off in one of the stubbled corn fields when they got to the traffic light at the corner of pierce and main they began to relax realizing that in all probability if spencer had gotten that far he was going to make it what did you think of spencers response about the nicaraguan ladies deborah asked as they turned onto pierce and headed east he seemed truly surprised about them being pregnant joanna said that was my take as well deborah said im getting the impression that things are happening at the wingate clinic that the founder doesnt know much about id have to agree joanna said of course he admitted hed not been as involved with the clinic as he should have been over the last couple of years they turned off the main road onto gravel and approached the wingate clinic gatehouse it was dark except for a barely discernible glow of light behind one of the small shuttered windows as they entered the tunnel beneath the structure the cars headlights illuminated the heavy gate and the cardswipe pylon do you think the guard will come out joanna asked as she slowed the car almost to a stop deborah shrugged my guess would be no since its after hours so lets just pull up to the card swipe and try one of our new cards deborah got the card out of her shoulder bag and handed it to joanna joanna lowered the window leaned out and swiped the card the gate responded immediately and began to swing open voila deborah said she took the card back and put it away joanna followed the drive as it curved around the clump of evergreens the main building came into view there were only a few lights visible in the first two stories of the southern wing the rest of the building was a black crenelated hulk rearing up against the deepening purple sky the place looks even more sinister at night joanna commented i couldnt agree more deborah said it looks like a place count dracula could find inviting joanna passed the parking area and entered the woods beyond a few moments later in the deepening darkness they began to see lights among the trees emanating from the homes of the wingate clinics hierarchy they were able to pick out a house they believed to be spencers and drove up its driveway the bentleys rear end jutting askew out of the garage told them they were right joanna turned off the malibus engine any ideas of how we should proceed from this point joanna asked not really deborah admitted except to push the alcohol maybe wed better try to find his car keys while were at it and hide them good thought joanna said as she alighted from the car as the women made their way up the darkened front walk they could hear rock music playing the closer they got the louder it became yet despite the noise of the music spencer heard the bell and threw the door wide open his cheeks were flushed and his eves red hed changed out of his blazer and was wearing an elaborately trimmed dark green velvet smoking jacket with an elaborated flourish requiring him to grab onto the doorjamb to maintain his balance he invited them in could we turn the music down a tad deborah yelled with an unsteady gait spencer went to the entertainment console the women used the opportunity to survey the interior it was decorated like a english manor house with oversized dark brown leather furniture red oriental carpets and dark green paint oil paintings of horses and fox hunts lined the walls each one individually illuminated the knickknacks were mostly riding paraphernalia well spencer said returning from lowering the stereo what get for you ladies before we get down to business joanna rolled her eyes for deborahs benefit lets explore that wine cellar you mentioned deborah said good idea spencer said barely pronouncing the ds the basement looked as though it hadnt been touched since the midnineteenth century save for the addition of several bare lowwattage electric lights the exposed granite blocks that formed the foundation were dark with mold the partitions were made of roughhewn oak planks held together with huge primitive iron nails the floor was dirt the air was clammy because of a number of muddy puddles maybe ill wait here on the steps joanna said as she looked around the dimly illuminated dungeon but deborah forged on despite her high heels deborah was fearful that spencer would not make it in his inebriated state on several occasions she did have to give him support to keep him from falling the wine cellar turned out to be just one of the many partitionedoff cubicles whose crude doors were secured with huge old padlocks spencer produced a key the size of his thumb from his jacket pocket and got the hasp open inside the compartment were a halfdozen cases of wine placed haphazardly on makeshift shelves spencer did not hesitate he opened the first case and pulled out three bottles thesell do he said without bothering to replace the padlock he staggered back to the stairs clutching the bottles under his arm my fayva shoes are ruined deborah mockingly moaned to joanna as they climbed the cellar stairs in the kitchen spencer produced a corkscrew and opened up the three bottles all california cabernets spenser selected three widemouthed wineglasses from the cupboard and deborah volunteered to carry them spencer led the way back to the living room he sat in the center of the couch and motioned for the women to sit on either side then he poured the wine and handed out the glasses not bad not bad at all he said after taking a sip now how do we get started he laughed im new at this threesome stuff i think we better have some wine first deborah said the night is young ill drink to that joanna said she held up her wine glass and everyone else did the same once again the women were able to get spencer talking by merely asking about his childhood that simple question unleashed a long monologue with shades of horatio alger while he talked spencer plied himself liberally with wine as in the restaurant he seemed oblivious to the fact that the women hardly drank at all when oneandahalf bottles of wine had been consumed and the story of spencers early life got to the college stage deborah interrupted to ask joanna if she could speak to her for a moment joanna agreed and the women drew to the side spencers blue eyes followed them with great interest and anticipation do you have any suggestions deborah said sotto voce with the rock music in the background she was confident there was zero chance spencer could hear the mans a sponge for alcohol other than his eyes and cheeks this extra wine has had little effect i dont have any suggestions except except what deborah asked she was getting desperate it was almost nine oclock and she wanted to get home to bed she was exhausted and tomorrow was going to be a big day ask him to slip into something more comfortable like silk pajamas or whatever he has thats a stock cliché that might work and it he bites it will mean his pants and wallet will stay in his bedroom where i can get at them meaning ill have to deal with him without pants deborah groaned do i have to remind you this was all your idea joanna blurted all right all right deborah said keep it down but if i scream you better get your ass down here in a hurry the women returned and spencer looked up at them expectantly deborah tried the line that joanna had suggested spencer responded with a crooked smile he nodded and struggled to get to his feet the women immediately came to his assistance im all right he protested he got up by himself and swayed briefly then he took a deep breath set his sights on the stairs and started off the women watched him bob and weave on his way across the living room as if he had little comprehension where the various parts of his body were at any given moment i take back what i said a moment ago deborah announced the wine is having an appropriate effect after all both women winced as spencer ricocheted off a console table and sent a group of painted toy cavalry soldiers to the floor despite the collision he maintained his footing and made it to the stairs with his hands on both banisters he managed better on the stairs than hed done on the open floor he disappeared above lets talk about what we are going to do when he comes down deborah said anxiously depending on what hes wearing or not wearing he might be too preoccupied to talk about his favorite subject any longer as soon as he comes down ill excuse myself to use the bathroom joanna said you keep him occupied there is a back stair in the kitchen deborah said that should get you up to the bedroom i saw it joanna said ill just make it as fast as i can youd better deborah warned instinctively she tried to pull her miniskirt down to cover more of her thigh but that only succeeded in exposing more decolletage as you can well imagine im feeling rather vulnerable in this outfit youre not going to get any sympathy from me thanks deborah said lets sit down my feet are killing me the women sat and discussed spencers life story when they exhausted that they talked about how they would manage the following day if they got spencers blue access card our goal will be to get me into that server room as soon as possible so i can give us access to their restricted files joanna said david said it would only take fifteen minutes or so once its done we can get the information about our eggs from a workstation or even from our computer at home well bring our cell phones deborah said that way i can stand guard when youre in the server room and let you know if anybody is coming thats not a bad idea joanna agreed deborah looked at her watch how long has casanova been upstairs changing into something more comfortable joanna shrugged i dont know five or ten minutes i wish hed hurry deborah said im so tired i could lie down on this couch and be asleep in two seconds i feel the same way joanna said its the jet lag our bodies are still on italian time its also because weve been up since six true joanna said tell me what are you going to do tomorrow in the clinics lab while youre waiting for me to get into the server room im interested in finding out exactly what they are doing with all that fancy equipment deborah said id like to find out the specifics about their research which includes finding out what the real story is behind the nicaraguans you will be careful wont you joanna warned whatever you do dont jeopardize our cover until weve got the information that were really after ill be careful deborah said she looked at her watch again my good god whats he putting on up there superman tights it is a little long joanna agreed what should we do joanna shrugged again do we dare go up and look what if hes stark naked and lying in wait for us good grief what an imagination deborah said are you really worried what is he going to do jump out and say boo the man walked out of the room with legs that resembled wet spaghetti you know joanna suddenly suggested he might have passed out thats a happy thought and i suppose its a distinct possibility hes now had two martinis and three and a half bottles of wine over a threehour period lets go up and look but you first thanks buddy the women went to the bottom of the stairs with the music thudding away even at its reduced volume there was no possibility of hearing any noise from above sticking close together they mounted the stairs and then hesitated at the top there were a number of closed doors although at the end of a corridor one was ajar a bit of weak light spilled out onto the hall carpet other than the music from below there was no sound deborah motioned for joanna to follow and feeling like trespassers the women headed toward the open door when they reached the threshold they had a full view of an undisturbed kingsized bed the only light was coming through an open door to a bathroom beyond spencer was nowhere to be seen where the hell is he deborah whispered angrily could he be playing some kind of game with us joannas earlier suggestion sprang into her mind should we look in the other rooms joanna asked lets check the bathroom deborah said theyd taken no more than three steps into the room when joannas grip on deborahs arm tightened suddenly dont scare me like that deborah complained joanna pointed toward the bed on the opposite side just visible were spencers feet snagged in his trousers with some trepidation the women went around the bed and looked down spencer was lying prone with his shirt half off and his pants in a bundle around his ankles he was obviously sound asleep and breathing heavily it looks like he fell joanna said deborah nodded id guess in his haste he tripped on his pants once horizontal he was out cold do you think he hurt himself i doubt it deborah said he wasnt close enough to anything to hit his head and this broadloom is two inches thick do we dare are you kidding deborah said of course we dare hes not going to wake up she bent down and after a brief search and a tug she extracted spencers wallet spencer did not move the wallet was inordinately thick deborah opened it and began rifling through it the blue access card was not immediately apparent but she found it in one of the compartments behind the credit cards i like the fact that it was hidden away she said she landed it to joanna bent back down and slid the wallet back into the pocket shed found it in why do you care where he had it in his wallet joanna asked because it means he doesnt use it often deborah said we dont want him to miss it until after weve had a chance to use it come on lets find those car keys hide them and get the hell out of here getting out of here is the best suggestion youve made all day joanna said as far as the car keys are concerned why bother hes not going to wake up for at least twelve hours and when he does hes not going to feel much like driving kurt hermann stared at the polaroid photo of the new employee georgina marks he was holding it in his rock steady hand beneath the greenglassshaded desk lamp as he studied her face he recalled the appearance of her full body with her breasts ready to spill out over the front of her dress and her skirt barely able to cover her behind to him she was an abomination a direct affront to his fundamentalist mentality in his slow deliberate style kurt laid the photo down on the desktop next to the photo of the other new employee prudence heatherly she was different obviously a biblefearing female kurt was sitting in his office in the deserted gatehouse where he frequently spent his evenings adjoining the office was a makeshift gym where he could hone his muscular finely tuned frame as a determined loner he avoided socialization and living on the wingate premises made it easy especially since the institution was sited in a small town which had nothing to offer as far as he was concerned kurt had been working for the wingate clinic for a little more than three years the job was perfect for him with just enough intrigue and challenge to make it interesting and yet not so busy that he had to work too hard his military experience made him uniquely qualified for security hed joined the army directly after high school and had made it into the special forces where hed been trained for covert operations hed learned to kill with his bare hands as well as with any number of weapons and hed never been troubled by it joining the army had not been the beginning of his association with the military having grown up as an army brat kurt had never known a different lifestyle his father had been in the special forces and had been a strict disciplinarian whod demanded utter obedience and perfection from his wife and child thered been a few ugly scenes in kurts early adolescence but hed fallen into line quickly enough then his father had been killed in the waning days of vietnam in a cambodian operation which to this day was still classified to his horror after his fathers death his mother embarked on a series of love affairs before she wound up marrying a prissy insurance salesman the army had been good to kurt appreciating his abilities and attitude it had always been there to smooth over the minor brushes with the law that kurts aggressive behavior sometimes brought on there were a number of things kurt could not tolerate but prostitution and homosexuality in any form were at the top of the list and kurt was not one to shy away from acting on his principles things had gone well in kurts life until hed been posted to okinawa on that rugged island he admitted things had gotten out of hand slowly kurt leaned over and stared again into georginas eyes on okinawa hed met a number of women just like her so many in fact hed felt a religious calling to reduce their numbers it was as if god had spoken to him directly getting rid of them was easy hed have sex with them in an isolated environment and then when they had the moral depravity to demand money hed kill them he was never caught or charged but eventually he was implicated by circumstantial evidence the army solved the problem by discharging him under president clintons government employee reduction plan which turned out to be mostly from the military and not from the bureaucracy a few months later kurt answered an ad placed by the wingate clinic and was hired on the spot kurt heard the gate creak open followed by the sound of a car accelerating through the tunnel pushing back from his desk he went to the window and opened the shutters he could make out the taillights of a latemodel chevrolet as it disappeared down the gravel road he looked at his watch after closing the shutters kurt returned to the desk he looked down at the womans nowfamiliar face hed seen that car come in soon after wingates and hed followed it up to wingates house it didnt take a rocket scientist to know what was going on behind closed doors the appropriate biblical passages immediately sprang to mind and as he recited them his hands balled into tight fists god was talking to him again eleven may o oo o am it was another gorgeous bright spring morning as the women sped northwest heading back toward bookford which theyd left only nine hours previously both were exhausted contrary to the morning before theyd not awakened spontaneously and had had to be dragged out of their beds by their respective alarms when theyd gotten home the night before neither went to bed much as theyd longed to deborah had felt impelled to clean her shoes which had gotten muddy in spencers basement she also spent some time accessorizing her outfit for the next day shed realized belatedly that shed have to wear the same dress since all her other clothes were a completely different style a fact which she felt would have suggested she wasnt whom she said she was joanna had gotten on the phone with david washburn to rehash exactly what she would do once she got into the wingates server room at his insistence she even had to go over to his apartment to get some of his bruteforce cracking software hed told her that the more hed thought about it the more he believed that even the server room console would require a password to get the keyboard to function he showed her how to use the software and had her try it several times until he was confident she was familiar with it by the time she got home it was well past midnight and deborah was already fast asleep as fatigued as they were they drove in silence while listening mindlessly to morning talk radio when they got to the wingate entrance deborah whose turn it was to drive used her swipe card the gate opened without a hitch and in they drove since they were some of the first employees to arrive that morning there were any number of parking spaces available deborah took one close to the front door are you worried about running into spencer joanna asked not really with the hangover hes undoubtedly going to have i dont think anybody is going to be seeing much of him today youre probably right besides hes probably not going to remember much about last night anyway well good luck partner deborah said same to you joanna said i forgot to ask if you remembered your cell phone i certainly did and you yup and i even remembered to charge the battery so lets do it with a sense of purpose and not a small amount of anxiety the two women alighted from the car and entered the building according to instructions theyd gotten the previous day they went first to helen mastersons cubicle where they completed a bit more paperwork they were relieved that no problems with their fake social security numbers had emerged overnight from helens office space they split up with joanna heading to christine parhams cubicle only three down from helens and deborah crossing the main hall to find megan finnigans office joanna wasnt sure how to get christines attention the woman was at her desk facing away from the cubicles doorless entrance first joanna rapped on the partition wall but since it was composed of a soundabsorbent material the meager noise was not enough to rouse the office manager joanna resorted to calling the womans name christine had remembered joanna from the introduction the previous day in the dining room she also had a copy of joannas employment questionnaire sitting on the corner of her desk come right it and sit down prudence christine said she removed some folders from the chair pressed up against the side of her desk welcome to the wingate joanna sat as requested and eyed the office manager she was a woman cast from a similar mold as helen masterson with the same solid build and broad spadelike hands suggesting her immediate forebears could have been farmers she had a kind face with natural florid patches that appeared like dabs of rouge on her broad cheekbones in a nononsense manner christine informed joanna what would be expected of her and what her initial duties would be as joanna had anticipated she would be doing data entry for billing purposes for the clinic side of the wingate operation she was told that her duties and responsibilities would be expanded in the near future if working at the wingate continued to be mutually satisfactory any questions christine asked what is the office policy on coffee breaks joanna asked she smiled i suppose that sounds like asking about vacation on the first day but i should know its a very reasonable question christine said were not strict about coffee breaks and we encourage people to do whats best for them the important thing is to get your work done generally speaking most people take a half hour in the morning and another half hour in the afternoon either at one time or broken into several shorter periods lunch is also a half hour but again were not sticklers for that joanna nodded she liked the idea of being able to take a half hour especially if she were able to coordinate it with deborah that was when shed try to get into the server room if that didnt work then shed have to use the lunch period i should remind you there is no smoking christine said if you do smoke you have to go out to your car i dont smoke joanna said no problem there in your application it says you have a lot of computer experience christine said so i suppose we dont have to go over anything about our system it is rather straightforward and i know you have spoken with randy porter i think ill be fine in that regard joanna said well lets get you started christine said ive got a clear cubicle for you and a full inbasket christine led joanna to a work space pressed up against the common wall with the main hall the cubicle was as far from the windows as possible it had a standard metal desk a file cabinet a desk chair a side chair and a wastebasket on the desk was an inbasket which was brimming an outbasket a keyboard with a monitor and a mouse and a telephone the partition walls were completely bare im afraid its not very cozy prudence christine admitted but you are welcome to bring in any decorative items you wish to personalize the space its fine joanna said she put her purse on the desk and smiled back at the office manager christine then introduced joanna to the other workers who occupied the immediately adjacent cubicles they seemed a pleasant and hospitable group who readily reached over the chestheight dividers to shake joannas hand well then christine said i think that covers the basics remember im here to help so just give a yell joanna said she would and waved as christine took her leave turning to the desk joanna took her cell phone out of her purse and immediately dialed deborahs number she got deborahs voice mail and assumed deborah was still going through her introduction she left a message for deborah to call her back whenever she had a free moment next joanna sat down at the keyboard after swiping her blue card through the slot she got a window on the monitor requesting her to set up a new password joanna used the word anago it was her favorite boston restaurant once on the network joanna spent a quarter hour checking what kind of access she had as she had expected it was very limited and the donor files in which she was interested were unavailable at that point joanna turned her attention to the inbasket it was her intent to get as much of the required busywork out of the way as possible so that when she had the opportunity to get into the server room no one would be looking for her for mundane workrelated reasons joanna hadnt been working very long before she was concretely aware of how much money the clinic was able to generate and she was looking at only a small portion of a single mornings receipts even without knowledge of costs she gathered the infertility business was an enormously appealing investment deborah nodded every so often to make it seem like she was listening she was sitting in megan finnigans postagestampsized office just off the main laboratory room shelves lined all four walls and were filled with manuals laboratory source books and loose stacks of papers the laboratory supervisor was a rail of a woman with graystreaked mousycolored hair that continually fell into her line of sight every minute and a half with metronomic regularity she tossed her head to whip the errant strands away from her face the tic made it hard for deborah to keep her eyes on the woman without reaching out grabbing her by the shoulders and telling her to stop deborahs mind couldnt help but wander as the woman gave her a canned lecture about laboratory techniques deborah wondered how joanna was making out do you have any questions megan asked suddenly as if having been caught napping deborah sat up straighter i dont think so she said quickly good megan said if any occur to you you know where i am now ill turn you over to one of our more experienced technicians her name is maureen jefferson shell be training you in nuclear transfer sounds good to me deborah said as a final point megan said id like to suggest you wear more sensible shoes oh deborah asked innocently she glanced down at her high heels which looked good despite the previous days rigors you have a problem with these lets just say they are inappropriate megan said i dont want you slipping on the tile and breaking a leg i wouldnt want that either deborah said as long as we understand each other megan said she glanced briefly at deborahs skirt which was revealing a lot of leg but didnt say anything instead she stood up and deborah did the same maureen jefferson was a twentytwoyearold african american woman whose color was like coffee with a lot of cream there was a sprinkling of freckles over the bridge of her nose she wore her hair bobbed which showed off to maximum advantage an impressive collection of pierced earrings her eyebrows were quite arched giving her an expression of continual amazement with the introductions complete megan took her leave at first maureen didnt say anything but merely shook her head as megan walked back down the central aisle it wasnt until megan disappeared into her office that maureen turned to deborah shes a piece of work wouldnt you say she is a bit rote deborah said my guess is she gave you her stock lecture on laboratory cleanliness im not sure deborah said i didnt listen to too much of it maureen laughed i think you and i are going to get along just fine girl what do you go by georgina or what georgina deborah said using the alias always made her pulse quicken my friends call me mare like a female horse maureen said then mare it is deborah said thank you lets get down to business ive got a doubleheaded dissecting microscope set up here so we can be looking at the same field let me get some eggs from the incubator while mare was on her errand deborah pulled out her cell phone and turned it on she saw she had a message but rather than listen to it she dialed joannas number joanna picked up right away did you call deborah asked i did but the message was just to call me hows it going boring but tolerable joanna said the first thing that i did was try to access the donor files but no go thats not surprising the plan is ill be taking a halfhour break at eleven can you meet me where lets say that water fountain in the main hall near the door to the server room ill be there deborah said she ended the call and slipped the phone back into her shoulder bag while shed been talking shed looked around the lab there were only five other people visible in a work space that could have supported fifty it was obvious the wingate anticipated growing exponentially mare returned carrying a covered petri dish that contained a small amount of fluid to the naked eye the fluid was clear and uniform but in actuality it was layered on top was a film of mineral oil and beneath was an aliquot of culture fluid containing sixty or so female eggs mare sat on one side of the doubleheaded microscope and motioned for deborah to take the stool on the other side she turned on the source light and the ultraviolet light then both women leaned forward to peer through the eyepieces for the next hour deborah was treated to a handson demonstration of nuclear transfer using micropipettes the first part involved removing the nuclei from the eggs the second part involved putting much smaller adult cells just under the eggs outer covering the process involved a certain amount of finesse but deborah caught on quickly and by the end of the hour was doing it almost as well as mare that finishes that batch mare said she leaned back from the scope and stretched her tight shoulder muscles i have to say youve caught onto this more quickly than i expected thanks to an excellent instructor deborah said she stretched as well the delicate operating of the micropipettes required such strict control that all muscles were kept tense ill get you another petri dish thats been set up when i take this group weve done to the fusion people mare said i dont see any reason you cant be on your own already usually it takes a day or two but youre already doing it like a pro i think you are being overly generous deborah said but tell me what kind of eggs are we working with here are they bovine or swine deborah had seen a few female gametes of different species either in photomicrographs or in actuality in the lab at harvard she knew they looked strikingly similar except for size which could vary considerably from the size of the eggs she was working with she guessed they were swine since it was her impression that bovine eggs were larger but it was truly a guess neither mare said these are all human eggs although mare had answered deborahs question matteroffactly the information hit deborah like a sledgehammer in the entire hour shed been working with the cells the idea that she was working with human eggs had never even occurred to her it made her tremble to think about it especially since shed been paid fortyfive thousand dollars for one egg are you sure these are human eggs deborah managed im pretty sure mare said at least that is my understanding but what are we doing here deborah stammered whose eggs are these thats not for us to question mare said this is one busy infertility clinic were helping to get the clients pregnant she shrugged theyre clients eggs and clients cells but by doing nuclear transfer we are cloning deborah said if these are human cells were cloning human beings technically perhaps mare said but its part of the embryonic stemcell protocol in private clinics like the wingate were allowed to do stemcell research on extra material not used for the infertility treatment and otherwise destined to be destroyed were not getting any government funding so anybody who is against this kind of work doesnt have to feel they are paying for it through their taxes and remember these are extra gametes and the clients whove produced these gametes have agreed for them to be used and most importantly the fused cells are not allowed to become actual embryos the stem cells are harvested in the blastocyst stage before any cellular differentiation i see deborah said with a nod but she wasnt sure she did it was a situation she was not prepared for and she was troubled hey calm down mare urged this is no big deal weve been doing this for several years its okay trust me deborah nodded again although she wasnt sure how she felt about all this youre not one of those religious nuts are you mare asked she leaned forward to look deborah in the eye deborah shook her head at least she was certain of that thank goodness mare said because this stemcell research is the future of medicine but im confident i dont have to tell you that she slid off her stool let me go get some more eggs she added if youd like we can talk more about it when get back fine deborah said thankful for a moment to think with her elbows on the lab bench deborah cradled her head keeping her eyes closed she tried to imagine how the wingate clinic could produce so many extra eggs she estimated that she and mare had already gone through four or five dozen and the morning was young knowing what she did about ovarian hyperstimulation ending up with that many eggs for research was extraordinary usually only ten or so eggs resulted from a stimulated cycle and most of those were used for invitro fertilization ah miss marks a voice said simultaneously there was a tap on deborahs shoulder she looked up and although she was sitting she found herself eye to eye with dr paul saunders im glad to see you and you look as lovely as you did yesterday deborah managed a smile how are you finding the lab work interesting deborah said i understand miss jefferson has been showing you the ropes paul said shes certainly one of our best technicians so you are in almost as good hands had i had the opportunity to come over first jung this morning as i had originally planned deborah nodded such conceit reminded her of spencer and she found herself wondering if it were a universal character trait of infertility specialists i suppose paul continued i dont have to explain to you how important this work is to our clients and the future of medicine in general miss jefferson told me the eggs on which wed done nuclear transfer were human eggs deborah said needless to say i was shocked knowing how scarce human eggs are did she say she was certain paul asked his pale face darkened i think her words were pretty sure deborah said they are swine eggs paul said absently he ran his fingers through his hair were doing a lot of work with pigs lately do you know what the major thrust of our research is these days miss jefferson mentioned stem cells deborah said thats part of it paul agreed very definitely an important part but not necessarily the most important right now my major focus involves how the oocyte cytoplasm reprograms an adult cell nucleus thats the basis for current animal cloning techniques you know the way dolly the sheep had been cloned im aware of dolly deborah said she leaned back as paul spoke his ardor magnified as evidenced by a suffusion of color in his otherwise pale cheeks progressively he thrust his face toward deborah so that she could feel the wind as he pronounced hard consonants we are at a fantastic crossroads in biological science paul said lowering his voice as if imparting a trade secret youre in luck miss marks youve joined us at a most exciting revolutionary time were on the brink of a number of huge breakthroughs tell me did helen masterson explain our employee stockoption plan i dont think so deborah said she was now leaning back as far as she dared without jeopardizing her balance on the lab stool she was sitting on we in management want everybody to benefit from the coming gold mine this area of research is about to be paul said so were offering stock options to all our valued employees particularly those on the laboratory side of the operation as soon as the first breakthrough occurs and we announce probably in nature well go public wingate clinic will go from a narrowly held private company to a publicly traded one i suppose you can guess what that will do to the value of the stock options i guess theyll go up deborah offered paul was now so close she could see directly into the black depths of his pupils it occurred to her why his eyes looked so strange not only were the irises slightly different colors but his inner canthi covered enough of the white sclera to make him appear mildly crosseyed through the roof paul said slowly pronouncing each word separately which will mean everybody will be a millionaire everybody that is with stock options so the important thing is that it all stays quiet paul put a finger to his lips in the classic gesture for silence to emphasize his point secrecy is of paramount importance thats why we encourage our people particularly our lab personnel to live on the premises and why we discourage loose talk with anyone outside the organization we liken this effort to the manhattan project when the atomic bomb was created am i making myself clear deborah nodded paul had moved back slightly although he still had her locked in his unwavering unblinking stare she was able to right herself on the stool were trusting you not to talk with anyone about what we are doing here paul continued its for your own benefit he hesitated im a very trustworthy person deborah said when she sensed he was waiting for her to respond we dont want another organization to beat us out paul continued not after all this work and there are a number of institutions working on the same problems right here in the boston area deborah nodded she was well aware of the local biotech industry especially since she was scheduled for an imminent interview with genzyme can i ask a question deborah said by all means paul said he put his hands on his hips and rocked back on his heels the pose combined with his shock of dark hair reminded deborah of helen mastersons nickname for him napoleon im curious about the nicaraguan workers they all look pregnant to the same degree whats the story lets just say for now that they are helping paul said its not that big a deal and ill be happy to explain it in more detail at a later date paul broke off from staring into deborahs eyes to cast a quick look around the lab reassured that no one was paying them any heed he returned his attention to her this time his line of sight rapidly scanned the long hosieryclad legs and the plunging neckline before snapping back to deborahs face it was a fleeting visual inquisition not lost on deborah im glad weve had the opportunity for this little chat paul said lowering his voice i enjoy talking with someone with whom i feel equivalent intelligence and with whom i have strong common interests deborah suppressed a sardonic laugh distinctly she remembered the same inane common interests comment from spencer and intuitively she sensed it was going to lead to the same end she wasnt disappointed in the next breath paul said id love to have the opportunity to describe to you all the exciting research im doing including the contribution from the nicaraguans but it would be best in private perhaps youd like to have dinner tonight although the wingate is unfortunately out here in the sticks there is a fairly good restaurant you might enjoy that wouldnt be the barn would it deborah asked wryly if paul was surprised deborah knew the name of the restaurant he didnt let on instead he launched into a glowing description of its food and romantic decor and how hed enjoy sharing it with deborah he then went on to suggest that after dinner they could return to his house where hed show her the protocols for some of the major breakthrough experiments he currently had underway at the wingate deborah suppressed another laugh being asked to pauls house to see research protocols sounded like a variation on the comeseemyetchings ploy deborah had no interest in going out with the nerd despite her keen curiosity about the wingates research she declined his invitation using joanna as an excuse just as shed done with spencer the day before to her surprise pauls reaction was almost identical to spencers with the same suggestion about joanna entertaining herself while they dined deborah now wondered if megalomania was a requirement to be an infertility specialist or if the job evoked it emphatically she declined again what about later in the week paul pleaded or even over the weekend i could drive into boston mares return saved deborah from pauls deepening desperation she brought a petri dish over to the lab bench and set it in on the microscopes stage before deferentially acknowledging dr saunderss presence so how is our new employee doing paul asked reverting with surprising agility to his usual condescending manner shes doing terrific mare said shes a natural shes ready to be on her own as far as im concerned thats good news paul said he then asked mare if he could have a word with her in private mare agreed and the two withdrew several lab benches to be out of deborahs earshot deborah pretended to be interested in the fresh petri dish but watched paul and mare converse out of the corner of her eye paul did all the talking he was obviously agitated as evidenced by his emphatic gesticulations the monologue lasted less than a minute after which they returned to deborah i will talk to you later miss marks paul said stiffly prior to leaving in the meantime carry on ill get you started with this new group mare said taking the seat opposite deborah deborah put her eyes to the microscope and for the next few minutes the women worked in tandem organizing the oocytes for deborah to begin extracting the dna moving all the eggs to one side had been the way theyd begun with the first group earlier mare had explained it was to avoid missing any when it was finished mare leaned back there you go mare said uttering the first words since pauls departure good luck if you have any questions just yell ill be over on the next bench doing another batch deborah couldnt help but notice the new coolness in the way mare treated her as the lab tech stood up to leave deborah cleared her throat excuse me i dont know how best to say this then maybe you shouldnt mare said ive got to get to work she started for the neighboring lab bench have i somehow put you in an awkward position deborah called after her because if i have im sorry mare turned around her face softened to a degree its not your fault i was just wrong wrong about what these eggs mare said theyre pig oocytes oh right deborah said dr saunders already told me good well ive got to get to work mare pointed toward the other microscope shed set up earlier she smiled weakly then continued on deborah watched the woman for a moment as she settled herself in preparation for work deborah then leaned her face forward to her own microscopes eyepieces she peered in at the field whose left side was chockfull of tiny granular circles each containing a fluorescing clump of dna but for the moment her mind wasnt on the task at hand instead she was thinking about the eggs species despite paul and mares allegations to the contrary deborah believed she was looking at a mass of human oocytes a half hour later deborah had enucleated more than half the eggs beneath her microscopes objective needing a rest from the intensity of the work she leaned back and rubbed her eyes forcibly when she opened them she started with her degree of concentration shed not heard anyone approach and was surprised to find herself staring up into the contrite face of spencer wingate in the background she could see that mare had looked up as well and her face registered similar surprise good morning miss marks spencer said his voice was more gravelly than it had been the day before he was dressed in a professorial long white doctors coat a crisp white dress shirt and a demure silk tie the only outward evidence of the previous nights inebriation was red roadmap eyes could i speak with you for a moment spencer asked certainly deborah said with a degree of uneasiness her first concern was that hed come to ask about his blue card but she instantly dismissed the idea as unlikely she slid off the stool assuming that spencer meant for them to step away a glance in mares direction revealed the woman was watching them with rapt attention spencer pointed toward one of the windows and deborah walked over to it spencer followed i want to apologize for last night spencer said i hope i wasnt too much of a bore im afraid i dont remember too much after we got to my home you certainly werent a bore deborah said with a forced laugh trying to make light of the situation you were very entertaining im not sure thats a compliment spencer said of course the worst part from my perspective is the lost opportunity im not sure i follow you know spencer said lowering his voice even more with you and your roommate penelope he winked suggestively oh right deborah said realizing he was making reference to the ridiculous menage a trois fantasy all at once she felt as putoff with spencer as shed felt earlier with paul but she held her tongue instead she said her name is prudence of course spencer said while tapping his forehead with the palm of his hand i dont know why i have so much trouble remembering her name i dont know either deborah said but thank you for the apology for last night even though it wasnt necessary now i better get back to work deborah took a step back to her seat but spencer moved into her path blocking her progress i thought we could try again tonight he said i promise to be more sensible with the wine how about it deborah looked up into the mans blue eyes she sought for an appropriate response which was difficult to find given the lack of respect she had developed for him considering the disagreement shed witnessed the day before between spencer and paul she had a sudden desire to say shed just been asked out by his apparent rival in an attempt to fan intramural disord under the circumstances she thought it would be the quintessential putdown but she held herself back in view of what she and joanna were trying to do making an enemy of the founder was hardly prudent no sense in taking two cars spencer added when deborah hesitated responding we could all meet in the parking lot around fivefifteen not tonight spencer deborah said in as sweet a voice as she could force herself to assume tomorrow then spencer suggested let me get back to you on it deborah said joanna i mean prudence and i need to catch up on our sleep deborah felt a warmth wash over her and knew that she was blushing it had been her only name slip but it was a bad one in front of the clinics founder maybe on the weekend spencer suggested apparently unaware of deborahs blunder what do you think thats a distinct possibility deborah added quickly trying to sound positive partying for us is far better on a night when we dont have to get up early the next morning i couldnt agree more spencer said then we could all sleep in sleeping late sounds heavenly deborah agreed generically my direct dial number is triple eight spencer said with another lascivious wink ill wait to hear from you ill be in touch deborah responded although she had no intention of actually doing so spencer walked out of the lab deborah watched him go then switching her attention to mare noticed the lab technician was still staring at her deborah shrugged as if to say theres no accounting for the managements behavior reclaiming her stool she checked her watch thank goodness there wasnt long to wait before shed be meeting up with joanna and they could get on with what they were there for twelve may o oo am as eleven oclock neared joanna had considerably more respect for people doing office work although it was true shed been working particularly hard to get the maximum amount done data entry was more tiring than shed imagined the concentration necessary to keep from making a mistake was intense and doing it day in and day out for three hundred sixtyfive days a year was difficult to imagine at exactly five minutes before eleven joanna stood up and stretched she smiled at her neighbor in the immediately adjacent cubicle to the south whod stood up when she heard joannas chair roll back the woman proved to be rather nosy and had made it a point to look in on joanna periodically throughout the morning her name gale overlook seemed fitting to joanna joanna had given a lot of thought to her plan she knew what she would do first with the scheduled rendezvous time with deborah imminent joanna grabbed her purse which contained the bruteforce cracking software her cell phone and wingates blue card she headed down the aisle between the cubicles her destination was the computer network administrators work space her hope was to find him in his cubicle and for one simple reason if he was in his cubicle he couldnt be in the server room earlier in the midst of a minor anxiety attack about being caught in the server room it had dawned on joanna that probably the only person who ever went in there was randy porter consequently if he was in his cubicle shed have little to fear a wave of relief spread through her as she passed his cubicle he was at his keyboard turning left she headed over to the main corridor deborah was there at the designated rendezvous about twenty feet beyond was the door to the hallway leading to the server room with its cardboard no admittance sign i hope your morning was as interesting as mine deborah said as joanna came up and took a sip from the drinking fountain mine was about as interesting as watching paint dry joanna said she looked up and down the hall to make sure no one was paying any attention to them nothing happened but then again i didnt want anything to happen we got asked out to dinner at the barn twice more deborah said proudly who asked you out this time spencer wingate for one and he asked us out not just me did you see him in person i most certainly did he came by the lab to apologize for passing out last night and then pleaded for a rematch i told him i was busy but you were available very funny joanna said how did he look not bad considering deborah said i dont think he remembered much thats understandable joanna said i trust the blue card did not come up in your conversation not a word who else was hitting on you the second invitation was from paul saunders can you imagine going out with him only in a fit of selfloathing joanna said but i dont believe for a minute i was included in that invitation not from the way he was looking at you yesterday in his office deborah didnt deny it she glanced briefly up and down the corridor to make certain no one was paying them any attention lets get down to business she said speaking more quietly do you have any particular plan for our server room incursion or what i do joanna said she too lowered her voice and went on to tell deborah her thoughts about randy porter great idea deborah said to tell the truth i was concerned about how i was going to stand watch for you without a back exit from the server room even if i let you know someone was coming in thered be no way for you to get out precisely joanna said now all you have to do is let me know if randy porter leaves his cubicle the moment he does press talk on your cell phone which youll set up dialed to mine if my phone rings ill get out of the server room right away sounds like a good plan to me deborah said should we try it now i think so joanna said if it doesnt work for whatever reason we can try again at lunch if that doesnt work well have another chance in the afternoon otherwise well have to come back tomorrow lets think positively deborah said she punched in joannas number on her cell phones keypad im not wearing this dress another day in a row i checked on randy porter just before i came to meet you joanna said he was in his cubicle i think he was on the internet which should keep him occupied do you have what you need joanna patted her purse ive got the software davids instructions and wingates blue card lets hope the card works or were back to square one it should work deborah said ill head down to admin now and you just hang out right here if randy porter is still sitting on his duff in his office ill call you and let it ring twice thatll be the green light and you go do your thing the two women grasped hands for a moment then deborah set briskly out walking down the corridor when she reached the entrance to the administration area she paused and looked back joanna was still at the water fountain leaning against the wall with her arms crossed she waved and deborah returned the gesture deborah couldnt remember exactly where randy porters cubicle was in the gridlike maze that filled the old hospital ward after a quick search of the area where she thought it would be and not finding it she began a more systematic search eventually she found it and was happy to see randy still sitting in front of his monitor deborah didnt allow herself much of a look but her impression was that he was playing a video game deborah reached into her purse and pulled out her cell phone with joannas number already dialed she pushed the talk button holding it up to her ear she listened for two complete rings then pressed end she replaced the phone in her bag keeping one eye on randy porters cubicle she made her way over to the main corridor there was no perfect spot where she could stand and not cause attention consequently she had to keep moving joanna switched her cellphone mode from ringer to vibration the moment shed gotten deborahs signal the noise made her jump even though shed expected it clearly she was on edge after a furtive final glance up and down the corridor to make sure no one was watching she passed as quickly as possible through the no admittance door into the short hall beyond as the door closed behind her she found she was breathing heavily as if shed run a hundred yards her pulse soared she was a little dizzy all at once the reality of being an intruder enveloped her in a paralyzing rush belatedly joanna realized she was not cut out for tasks like breaking into computer server rooms actually doing it was far more psychologically demanding than planning it with her back against the door to the main hall joanna took a number of deep breaths combining the controlled respiration with a short reassuring soliloquy she was able to calm herself down enough to proceed tentatively she moved forward slowly it first but then gaining confidence when her dizziness faded she reached the server room door after one last look back at the door to the corridor she reached into her purse and pulled out wingates blue access card quickly she swiped it through the card swipe any residual concern shed had about whether the card would work was dispelled with the mechanical click she opened the door in the next instant she was inside hurrying over to the server console what randy porter liked most about computers was the games he could play them all day and yearn for more when he got home at night it was like an addiction sometimes he wouldnt go to bed until three or four in the morning because with the world wide web someone was always up and willing to play even at or am he hated to give up and only did so because he knew hed be a total zombie at work the following day what was so good about his job at the wingate clinic was that he could indulge himself during office hours it had been different back when hed first been hired straight out of the university of massachusetts hed had to put in long hours getting the wingate local area network online and then thered been the demand for the best security available that had required extra work and even some outside consulting and finally thered been the web page that had taken a number of months to set up and then modify until everybody was happy but now everything was humming along just fine which meant there was little for him to do except be available for the occasional software or hardware glitch even those problems were usually because the individual involved was so dorky that they didnt realize they were doing something incredibly stupid of course randy didnt tell the individual that he was always polite and pretended it was the machines fault randys normal day began at his keyboard in his cubicle with the help of windows active directory he checked to make sure all systems were running normally and all terminals were in a locked position that generally took him about fifteen minutes after a coffee break hed return to his cubicle for his morning gaming to avoid being caught by christine parham the office manager hed frequently move around to various workstations that were not in use that made him hard to find on occasion but that never led to any trouble since everybody thought he was off fixing someones computer on may oth at in the morning randy was locked in mortal combat with a slippery talented opponent with the moniker of screamer the game unreal tournament was randys current favorite and at that moment he was locked in a tense standoff in which he or screamer would imminently be killed randys palms were damp from anxiety but he pressed on fully believing that his experience and expertise would give him the upper hand there was a sudden unexpected beep randy reacted by practically leaping out of his ergonomic chair at the bottom righthand corner of his screen a small window had popped up within the window the words server room breached were blinking insistently before randy could respond to this prompt he heard a fateful zapping noise that yanked his attention back to the main window to his chagrin the view was a virtual ceiling a second later his adversarys face appeared peering down at him with a gloating smile it took less time than a pentium processor for randys brain to compute that hed been killed crap randy muttered it was the first time hed been killed for over a week and it was a letdown big time irritably he looked back at the blinking window responsible for distracting his attention at such a critical juncture someone had opened the server room door randy didnt like anyone going into the server room and monkeying around he considered it his domain there was no reason for anybody to be in there unless it was ibm servicing the equipment and if that happened it was his responsibility to be in there with them randy exited from unreal tournament and pushed his joystick around behind the monitor so it was less obvious then he stood up he was going to see who the hell was in the server room whoever it was was responsible for getting him killed when the cell phones vibration went off joannas heart leaped into her mouth shed been struggling with her anxiety from the moment shed come through the outer server room door shed found herself clumsy at the keyboard it took her longer to carry out simple tasks which only made her more anxious and worse still at the keys assuming the call was deborah joanna knew she had only seconds to get out of the server room before randy porter appeared still all thumbs she began exiting the system all she had to do was cancel out the windows shed brought up onto the screen but it seemed to take forever since her movement with the mouse was so jerky finally the last window disappeared leaving the screen blank quickly joanna tossed the cracking software back into her purse shed had yet to insert the cd into the drive her phone had gone off only minutes after shed sat down at the serverroom console and she had only been in the initial stages of giving herself access frantically she snatched her purse from the desktop and dashed over to the server room door but the second she opened it she heard the telltale sound of the outer door opening in total panic joanna let go of the door she was holding and took a step backward she felt desperate and completely trapped with no other choice she darted back around the vertically oriented electronic units each about the size of a shallow fourdrawer file cabinet scrunching down in a tight ball behind the farthest unit she tried to make herself as small as possible it was hardly a hiding place but she had no other choice joannas heart was beating so hard she was certain that whoever was coming would be able to hear it it was literally pulsing in her ears she could feel perspiration appear within her clutched fists which were pressed against her cheeks she tried to prepare herself for being discovered by thinking of what she would say the problem was there was absolutely nothing that she could say from the moment randy had left his cubicle enroute to the server room hed been silently venting his anger he was upset more for having been interrupted and subsequently killed than for someone going into his server room by the time he arrived on the scene he was thinking more of getting back to unreal tournament and rechallenging screamer than yelling at the person whod violated his domain what the blazes randy questioned when he came on the open serverroom door and the empty room beyond he looked back at the outer door to the corridor which hed left ajar wondering how whoever had been in the server room had gotten out his eyes then breezed around the inside of the server room for a second time all was in order he looked at the server room console it too was as hed left it with the monitor displaying its screen saver then he grasped the door and swung it back and forth on its hinges what had suddenly occurred to him was the possibility that when hed last been in the room hed not closed the door completely and it had just swung open with a shrug randy pulled the door closed he heard the reassuring click and then tried to push it open again it stayed firmly locked with a final shrug he turned around and with the intent of getting back to his cubicle and screamer he hurried back out into the hallway its okay its okay deborah repeated in a soothing voice she was holding joanna by the shoulders trying to calm her down joanna was trembling with an occasional sob they were in the lab standing next to the window where deborah had spoken with spencer earlier that morning mare had seen them come in but shed apparently noticed joannas distress and respecting their privacy shed not come over deborah had called joannas cell phone the moment shed seen randys head suddenly pop up above the room partition just prior to his dashing from his cubicle deborah had to make the call on the run because randy was moving quickly her worst fears were realized when randy made a beeline for the main corridor and turned in the direction of the server room the other problem was that she didnt see joanna and her intuition told her that thered not been enough time for joanna to have gotten out when randy had gone directly to the server rooms outer door and immediately gone in any minuscule hope deborah had entertained that he was heading elsewhere than the server room was dashed coming up to the door herself she hadnt known what to do unable to make up her mind shed done nothing agonizing minutes had passed deborah had debated whether she should go in and try to defuse whatever situation had developed she had even envisioned charging in grabbing joanna and bolting for the car then to her utter surprise randy porter had reemerged alone and seemingly calmer than when hed gone in deborah had quickly bent over and taken a drink from the water fountain to avoid the impression she was loitering randy had passed behind her and shed sensed his pace slowed but he had not stopped when shed righted herself randy had been a distance away hed been heading back down the corridor in the direction hed come but with his upper torso twisted to keep deborah in sight when hed caught her eye hed given her the thumbsup sign deborah had blushed as it had dawned on her that a significant portion of her derriere had most likely been exposed when shed bent over the relatively low water fountain im not cut out for this joanna said angrily in response to deborahs attempts to calm her although whom she was angry atas not immediately clear she pressed her lips together but they quivered as if she might cry again im serious deborah shushed her im not cut out for this joanna repeated lowering her voice i fell apart in there i was pathetic i beg to differ with you deborah said whatever you did it worked he didnt see you ease up youre being too hard on yourself you really think so joanna took several uneven breaths absolutely deborah said anyone else including myself would have blown it but you pulled it off somehow and here we are ready to give it another college try but im not going back in there joanna said forget about it are you really ready to give up after all the effort weve been through its your turn joanna said you go in the server room ill stand guard if i could i would deborah said the trouble is i dont have the facility you have with computers and you could tell me what to do until youre blue in the face and i guarantee id screw it up joanna stared back at deborah as if she were angry with her im sorry im not a computer nerd deborah said but i dont think we should give up we both want to find out what happened to our eggs and now i have a new interest i suppose youre going to make me ask what it is joanna muttered deborah glanced over at mare to make sure she wasnt trying to overhear their conversation then she lowered her voice and explained to joanna the human eggs versus swine eggs episode that had occurred that morning joanna was immediately intrigued despite her distress thats strange joanna exclaimed deborahs expression suggested she hardly considered strange to be a strong enough word incredible is more like it she said think about it they spent ninety thousand dollars for a halfdozen eggs from us and then have several hundred for me to screw around with today i mean im an amateur with this nucleartransfer stuff thats more than strange all right its incredible joanna said so we have even more reason to create ourselves a pathway into their computer files deborah said i want to find out what kind of research theyre doing and how theyre getting all these eggs joanna shook her head that may be an appropriate motivation but im telling you i dont think ill be able to convince myself to go back in there but were better off than we were before deborah said i cant see how joanna said as near as i can tell mr randy porter leapt up out of his seat simultaneously with your opening the server room door that tells us hes got it wired to pop up on his monitor i mean it stands to reason the timing couldnt have been a coincidence i suppose that seems like a reasonable assumption joanna agreed but how does that help us simply because it means we have to do more than watch him sit in his cubicle deborah said weve got to lure him out and keep him occupied joanna nodded as she thought over what deborah was saying am i to believe you have some plan to do this of course deborah said with a sly smile when he passed me a few minutes ago in the hall while i was bending over the water fountain he practically got torticollis judging from that reaction id be very surprised if i couldnt corner him in the dining room at lunch and have a chat i trust ill be able to keep him interested then when youre finished in the server room you can give my cell phone a call to rescue me joanna nodded again but she didnt totally agree not right away heres how it is going to work deborah said sensing joannas lingering doubt go back to administration and make sure randy porter is in his cubicle then go to yours i dont care if you work or not it really doesnt matter what matters is for you to watch for randy porter to leave for lunch the moment he does call me that way maybe i can even intercept him on his way to the dining room which might be easier than if i get there when hes already sitting as soon as i make contact and its working ill call you thats when you duck back into the server room and do what you have to do the more i think about it the more convinced i am that its far bet to be doing it over the lunch hour it makes a lot more sense when youre finished come directly to the dining room you can rescue me and have lunch at the same time you make it sound so easy joanna said i honestly think it will be deborah said what do you think i suppose it sounds like a reasonable plan but what if you start a conversation and he breaks it off youd let me know of course id call you instantly deborah said and remember if hes in the dining room youll have plenty of time to get out its not the same as when hes sitting in his cubicle joanna nodded several times in a row do you feel better now about going back in there i guess joanna said good deborah said now lets get the ball rolling if perchance mr porter is not in his cubicle when you get over there youd better call me we might have to adjust the plan if we cant find him all right joanna said trying to bolster her courage she clasped hands with deborah briefly and then turned to leave deborah watched joanna go she knew her roommate had been seriously upset but she also knew joanna to be resilient deborah was confident that when the chips were down joanna could be counted on to pull through deborah went back to her microscope and tried to go back to work but it was impossible she felt far too jazzed up for such a painstaking task as enucleating oocytes she was also on edge in case joanna called indicating that randy porter was not in his cubicle after five minutes had passed without a call deborah pushed back from the lab bench and wandered over to mares station the woman looked up from her microscopes eye pieces when she sensed deborahs presence i have a question deborah said where do these eggs were working on come from mare hooked a thumb over her shoulder they come from that incubator way down there near the end of the lab and how do they get into the incubator mare gave deborah a look that wouldnt have qualified as a dirty look but it wasnt all that friendly either you ask a lot of questions its the sign of a budding researcher deborah said as a scientist when you stop asking questions its time to retire or find another calling the eggs come up in a dumbwaiter inside the incubator mare said but thats all i know ive never been encouraged to ask nor have i been inclined who would know deborah asked i imagine miss finnigan would know with his hands on both arms of his chair randy slowly raised himself to provide a progressively more expansive view of the administration area he wanted to see if christine was in her cubicle without her knowing he was checking if he stood up all the way she could see him but by doing it slowly he could stop when he just caught sight of the top of her sizable curlyhaired head bingo she was there and randy lowered himself back down with the knowledge the office manager was nearby randy lowered the volume on his computer speakers although when he was home he let the sound effects roar at full volume when he was in the office he was a realist especially with christine only a few cubicles away next randy pulled out his joystick when he got that in the exact position he preferred he adjusted his rear end in the seat pan of his chair to game at the full level of his abilities he needed to be comfortable when all was set to his liking he gripped the mouse in preparation for logging onto the internet but then he paused strangely enough another thought occurred to him randy had not only programmed the server room door so that he would be alerted when it was opened hed also programmed it so that the card swipe that opened the door would record the identity of the individual with a few rapid clicks of the mouse randy brought up the appropriate window what he expected to see was his name last on the list from when hed gone to check the room after helen masterson had gone in that would have confirmed his suspicion that the door had just opened on its own accord from his having not shut it properly but to his surprise his name wasnt last the last name was dr spencer wingate the heralded founder of the clinic and the time was that very morning randy stared at the entry with a mixture of confusion and disbelief how could that be he wondered since he was serious about his computergaming prowess he kept an accurate log of his triumphs and even his rare failings after minimizing the current window randy brought up his unreal tournament record there it was hed been killed at taking a deep breath randy rocked back in his chair staring at the computer screen while his mind recreated his recent dash back to the server room he estimated that it took him only a minute or two to get from his cubicle to the server room meaning hed arrived there about or if that were the case where the hell was dr wingate whod entered at and if that werent enough of a conundrum why did the doctor leave the door ajar something very strange going on randy thought especially since dr wingate was supposed to be semiretired even though rumor had it that he was around randy scratched his head wondering what to do if anything he was supposed to report any security lapses to dr saunders but randy wasnt sure there had been a lapse as far as he was concerned dr wingate was the highest honcho in the whole organization so how could anything that concerned him be a security lapse then randy had another idea maybe hed say something to weird kurt hermann the security chief had had randy program his computer so it too recorded any and all openings of the cardswipe doors that meant that kurt already knew dr wingate had been in the server room what the security chief didnt know was that the doctor had only been in there for two minutes and had left the door open oh crap randy said out loud worrying about all this was as bad as work what he really wanted to do was get back on line with screamer so he tipped forward and grabbed his mouse miss finnigan deborah called out she was standing in the laboratory supervisors doorway shed knocked on the jamb but the depth of megan finnigans concentration on her computer had precluded her from responding but deborahs voice had penetrated and the woman looked up with a startled expression she then hastily cleared her screen id prefer it if you knocked she said i did knock deborah responded the woman tossed her head to rid her face of her bothersome strands im sorry im just very busy what can i do for you you encouraged me to come to you if i had any questions deborah said well i have a question what is it im curious about where the eggs come from that ive been working on i asked maureen but she said she didnt know i mean its a lot of eggs i just didnt realize they were available in such numbers availability of eggs has been one of the major limiting factors in our research from day one megan said weve devoted a lot of effort to solve the problem and it has been one of dr saunders and dr donaldsons major contributions to the field but the work is as of yet unpublished and until it is it is considered a trade secret megan smiled patronizingly and gave her head another one of her signature tosses that so annoyed deborah after youve worked here for some reasonable period and if you are still interested im sure we can share with you our successes ill look forward to that deborah said one other question what species are the eggs ive been working on megan did not answer immediately but rather returned deborahs stare in a manner that made deborah feel as if the lab supervisor was gauging deborahs motives the pause was long enough for deborah to feel uncomfortable why are you asking this megan questioned finally as i said im just curious deborah responded megans responses to her simple questions were answers in themselves deborah felt she was not going to get a straight answer and at that point wanted to leave she had the sense that her further questioning would only draw unwanted attention im not immediately sure which protocol maureen is working under megan said id have to look it up but at the moment im too busy i understand deborah said thank you for your time dont mention it megan responded she smiled insincerely deborah was relieved to return to her microscope going to the supervisors office had not been a good or particularly productive impulse deborah went back to work but had managed to enucleate only one oocyte when her curiosity heightened by her short conversation with megan got the best of her again merely looking at the mass of oocytes in the microscopic field begged the question about their origin especially if they were human eggs as deborah suspected leaning back deborah gazed over at mare who was ignoring her as shed essentially been doing since the verbal skirmish with paul saunders over the eggs identity a quick glance around the huge lab convinced deborah that none of the dozen or so people toiling away were paying her any heed either grabbing her purse as if she intended to go to the ladies room deborah slid off her stool and headed out into the main corridor believing shed only be working at the wingate for that one day she decided the eggs origin was too much of a mystery to ignore she didnt know if she could sleuth it out but she thought shed learn what she could while she had the chance deborah walked down the corridor in the direction of the central tower until she reached the last of the three doors leading from the corridor into the lab leaning into the lab she could see mare a good distance away hunched over her scope to deborahs immediate right was the walkin incubator where mare had been going for the petri dishes full of eggs deborah went to its glass door slid it open and stepped inside the air was warm and moist a large wallmounted thermometer and humidistat indicated it was exactly f with one hundred percent humidity shelves for the petri dishes lined both sides of the narrow room at the rear was the dumbwaiter but it was a far cry from its initial incarnation when it had served to bring food up to the wards from the institutions basement kitchen it was made of stainless steel instead of the usual wood with a glass door and glass shelves for a dumbwaiter it was large about the size of a highboy chest of drawers it also had its own auxiliary heat and humidifying source to make sure it too stayed at the proper temperature and humidity deborah pushed on the dumbwaiter to see if it would move enough to give her a view down the shaft but it was rock solid it was obviously a highly engineered piece of equipment deborah stepped back and eyed the unit she guessed the back of the shaft was common with the wall of the main corridor leaving the incubator she went back out into the main hall and gauged where the dumbwaiter shaft was located then she paced off the distance to the stairwell near the fire door to the central tower using the old metal stairway she climbed up to the third floor when she opened the door she was surprised although she vaguely remembered dr donaldson saying the vast old institution save for the small portion occupied by the wingate was like a museum she was unprepared for what she was looking at it was as if sometime in the nineteentwenties everybody professional staff and patients alike had just walked out leaving everything behind there were old desks wooden gurneys and antiqueappearing wheel chairs lining the dark hall huge cobweblike strands hung like garlands from victorian light fixtures there were even old framed currier and ives prints hanging askew on the walls the floor was covered with a thick layer of dust and pieces of plaster that had fallen from the shallowly vaulted ceiling superstitiously deborah covered her mouth and tried to breath shallowly as she paced off the distance from the stairwell she knew intellectually that any of the tubercular organisms and any of the other miasma that had at one time roamed the halls were long gone but she still felt vulnerable and uneasy once she had an approximate fix on where the dumbwaiter shaft was she entered the nearest door not unexpectedly she found herself in a windowless room which had served as a butlers pantry complete with cupboards full of institutional dishes and flatware there were even some old warming ovens with their doors ajar in the semidarkness they looked like huge dead animals with their mouths open the dumbwaiter shafts doors were where she expected them to be they were designed to open vertically like a freight elevator but when deborah pulled on the frayed canvas strap it was obvious there was a failsafe mechanism to keep them locked until the dumbwaiter itself had arrived brushing her hands free of the dust deborah retraced her steps back to the stairwell and climbed to the fourth and top floor she found the situation the same as on the third floor returning to the stairwell she descended to the first floor when deborah emerged from the stairwell she knew instantly that the eggs did not come from there the first floor had been renovated even more dramatically than the second floor to house the wingate clinics clinical operations and at that time of the morning it was in full swing with a constant flux of doctors nurses and patients deborah had to step to the side to allow an occupied gurney to go by dodging the crowd deborah paced off the distance from the stairwell to where she guessed the dumbwaiter shaft was behind the corridor wall leaving the corridor she found herself in a patienttreatment area where the dumbwaiter shafts doors should have been located she was confronted by a shallow linen closet it was immediately obvious to her that there was no opening for the dumbwaiter on the first floor a simple process of elimination left only the basement as the eggs origin deborah headed back to the stairwell to get down there she had to descend three flights instead of the two that had separated each of the upper floors this suggested to her that the basement would have a higher ceiling but it turned out not to be the case there was a mezzanine floor of sorts between the basement and the first floor composed of a myriad of piping and ductwork the basement had the appearance of a dungeon with infrequent barebulb lighting the walls were exposed brick with arched ceilings and the floor granite slabs the unease deborah had felt up on the third and forth floors was magnified in the gloomy basement it too contained a multitude of mementos of its mentalinstitution tbsanitarium past but here they were more decrepit as if abandoned in dank shadowed recesses deborahs immediate feeling was that if there were any of the old infectious agents lingering in the building this was where theyd live girding herself against the power of her own imagination deborah proceeded to pace off the distance from the stairwell as best she could the floor plan did not have the simple central corridor like all the floors above it was considerably more mazelike requiring her to be more creative in judging the distance while proceeding in a zigzag course around massive supporting piers as she passed through an archway and skirted a large kitchen with spacious metal countertops huge ovens and soapstone sinks deborah confronted something shed not expected a blank modern metallic door with no handle hinges or even lock tentatively deborah reached out in the semidarkness and lightly touched the shiny surface she guessed it was stainless steel curiously however it was not cold but rather felt comfortably warm to her touch she glanced around in the halflight at all the old kitchen equipment then back to the shiny door the incongruity was startling placing her ear against the door she could hear the hum of machinery within she listened for several minutes hoping to hear voices but she didnt moving back from the door she caught sight of a card swipe just like the one outside the serverroom door at that moment she wished she had wingates card after a moment of indecision and a brief argument with herself deborah reached out and knocked on the door with her knuckle it resonated solidly as if thick she wasnt entirely sure she wanted anyone to answer and no one did gaining in confidence she pushed against the door but it was immovable using the heel of her fist she hit around the periphery of the door just to see if she could determine where the latch was she couldnt shrugging her shoulders in the face of such an impenetrable barrier deborah turned and retraced her steps back to the stairwell it was almost noon and time to return upstairs to wait for joannas call deborah had learned little on her foray but at least shed tried she thought that maybe if all went well she could come back in the afternoon with wingates card the stainlesssteel door and what might be behind it had definitely piqued her curiosity thirteen may o pm earlier in the day joanna had developed more respect for dataentrylevel office workers now she had significantly more respect for thieves she couldnt imagine doing anything like what she was currently doing for a living deborah had talked her into returning to the server room with a compelling argument and plan that seemed to have worked joanna had been in the server room now for almost twentytwo minutes and no one had bothered her her biggest enemy had been herself the immobilizing panic shed felt on the first visit had come back with a vengeance the moment shed come through the outer serverroom door and had let up only enough to allow her to function although not all that efficiently the worst part of the whole episode had been the agonizing wait for the bruteforce cracking software to come up with a password to unlock the server keyboard while it ran joanna had been reduced to a pathetic quivering mass of anxiety beset with intermittent jolts of fear from constantly hearing noises that were either innocuous or completely fabricated by her overwrought brain she was actually surprised at herself it had been her misconception that she would been a cool person under the kind of stress she was experiencing once shed gotten into the system her terror had been ameliorated a degree just from the mere fact of doing something rather than just watching the main trouble had then become her tremor it had made operating the mouse and the keyboard difficult as she had progressed joanna had silently thanked randy porter the man had made her job significantly easier by not hiding what she was searching for too deeply within subfolders from the very first window joanna had brought up she found a server drive named data d that sounded promising opening that drive presented her with an array of folders conveniently named one of them was called donor rightclicking on the folder and selecting properties she saw that access was extremely limited in fact besides randy as the network administrator only paul saunders and sheila donaldson were authorized entry confident shed found the correct file joanna went through the process of adding herself as a user that required merely typing in her user account designation plus her office domain just as she was about to click the add button she heard a door open somewhere in the distance that caused her heart to leap in her chest and a new batch of perspiration pop out on her forehead for several seconds joanna was unable to move or even breath as she strained to hear the telltale sounds of footsteps in the serverroom corridor but she didnt still she expected someone was behind her slowly she turned a modicum of relief coursed through her veins when she saw an empty serverroom doorway standing up and taking a few steps back she looked down the serverroom corridor to the outer door it was closed ive got to get out of here joanna moaned quickly she returned to the keyboard and with a trembling hand clicked to add herself to the donor file access list as rapidly as she was able joanna went back through the windows shed progressively opened to return the server monitor to its desk top and ultimately to its password demand she snatched up her purse and was about to flee when she remembered the cracking software still in the cd drive shaking worse than ever now that she was within seconds of success she managed to get the cd out and in her bag finally she was able to leave she closed the serverroom door and then ran the few steps to the outer door unfortunately there was no way to anticipate if it was a good time to emerge into the main corridor or not it all depended on who happened to be out there she just had to take a chance and hope for the best in one motion she opened the door and stepped out pulling the door closed behind her trying not to panic she avoided looking up and down the corridor but rather went immediately to the water fountain it wasnt that she was thirsty although her mouth was certainly dry she just wanted something to do rather than look like a thief making her escape joanna straightened up it had been encouraging while drinking not to have heard any voices and now that she looked it seemed shed selected a particularly opportune moment to emerge it was one of the few times joanna had seen the corridor completely deserted eager to see if she had been successful and also to take a quick look inside the folder even if deborah was not with her joanna hurried back to her cubicle in administration since it was the middle of the lunch hour the administration area was all but deserted which was fine with joanna she dashed into her cubicle tossed her purse on the desk and sat down she unlocked her workstation with dexterity somewhat improved above what shed had to deal with in the server room joanna quickly mapped a network drive to the donor folder as she clicked for the command to take effect she held her breath yes joanna hissed loudly through clenched teeth she was into the folders directory she felt like cheering but held herself back and it was a good thing yes what a voice asked it was halfway between a demand and a question whats going on feeling an iota of the same terror of discovery shed experienced in the server room joanna raised her eyes and looked up and to the right as shed feared she would when shed first heard the voice she found herself gazing up into gale overlooks pinched face whatd you do win the lottery gale asked she had a way of speaking that made anything she said seem derogatory joanna swallowed she had another cruel instantaneous realization although she considered herself reasonably witty and as capable of repartee as any of her friends feeling anxious and guilty which she did at that moment caused her mind to go blank instead of words a kind of stuttering emerged from her mouth whatd ya have on your screen gale asked becoming even more interested in the light of joannas apparent distress gale bobbed her head around trying to see the screen through the reflected glare although joanna was momentarily speechless she did have the presence of mind to close the computer window bringing her screen back to its desktop were you on the net gale asked accusingly yes joanna said finally finding her voice i was checking some stocks to see what theyre doing christines not going to like that gale said she frowns on people going on the net for personal reasons during working hours thank you for telling me joanna said she stood smiled stiffly grabbed her purse and left joanna walked swiftly anger at herself for acting so suspiciously and irritation at gale overlook for being such a meddler had the beneficial effect of focusing her rampant anxieties as she headed toward the dining room she actually began to feel better by the time she got to the fire door leading into the tower portion of the building she had recovered enough even to feel mildly hungry hesitating on the dining rooms threshold joanna scanned the room for deborah it was significantly more crowded than the day before when helen masterson had brought her and deborah joannas eyes stumbled onto spencer wingate quickly she moved them away she was not in the mood to make eye contact with the man she saw paul saunders and sheila donaldson at another table and looked away equally quickly then she saw deborah sitting at a table for two with randy porter they appeared deep in conversation joanna made her way over to deborah attempting to keep her face away from sheila donaldson as much as possible it wasnt until joanna was standing at the table side before deborah was auare of her and looked up hello prudence dear deborah said lightly you remember randy porter im sure randy smiled shyly and shook hands but didnt stand joanna wasnt surprised shed long since become accustomed to the fact that a lot of men raised above the masondixon line had little schooling in the social graces randy and i have been having an interesting discussion deborah said i didnt know the world of computer games was so intriguing it seems weve been missing something big time am i right randy absolutely randy said he leaned back with a selfsatisfied smile well listen randy deborah said i tell you what ill come by your workstation later and you can show me unreal tournament how does that sound sounds good to me randy said he was rocking forward and backward slightly as if constantly agreeing with himself im glad to have had this opportunity to talk with you randy deborah added it was fun she nodded and grinned hoping randy would take the hint but he didnt i have a couple extra joysticks in my car randy said i can have you ladies set up to play in no time at all im sure wed appreciate that deborah said losing patience but right now prudence and i have some things wed like to talk about hey thats okay by me randy said but he didnt budge wed like a little privacy deborah added oh randy said he looked back and forth between the two women as if confused but then finally got the message he then fumbled with his napkin before standing ill see you guys around right deborah said randy left and joanna took his seat hes not well trained in his social cues joanna commented deborah gave a short mocking laugh and you probably believe you had the worst part of the deal going in the server room was it that bad hes a total computer nerd deborah complained he couldnt talk about anything else absolutely nothing but thats water over the dam she cleared her throat leaned forward and in an excited but lowered voice asked well what happened did you do it or what joanna leaned forward as well their faces were only inches apart its done fantastic congratulations so what did you learn nothing yet joanna said other than i checked from my workstation and what i did in the server room worked i was into the proper folder i even saw your name in the directory so why didnt you learn anything because my nosy neighbor interrupted me joanna said shes like a jackinthebox whenever i say or do anything out of the ordinary i thought shed be at lunch when i got back there but unfortunately i was wrong one of the nicaraguan waitresses came over and joanna ordered a soup and salad the food choice was deborahs suggestion she said it would be the fastest i cant wait for us to get back to your workstation deborah said once the waitress had left im really psyched about all this and strangely enough at this point im as interested in finding out about the research around here as i am about our eggs thats going to be a problem joanna said first of all we have to worry about my nosy neighbor i think it might be best if we wait until she leaves her cubicle before we go back into the donor folder then lets do it over in the lab deborah said therere a lot of available workstations that will be private enough we wont have to worry about someone looking over our shoulders we cant use a workstation in the lab joanna said the access i created is via the office domain only good grief deborah remarked why does this all have to be so complicated but all right so we use yours but i think we should just ignore your neighbor hell i can stand between her and the screen as soon as youve eaten lets go and do it theres another problem joanna said the only access i created is into the donor folder there were other folders in the same drive such as research protocols and research results but i didnt give myself access to them why the hell not deborah questioned she furrowed her brows because i was too afraid to take any more time joanna said oh for chrissake deborah complained i dont believe this you were right there with the files staring you in the face how could you pass it up deborah shook her head in irritated amazement you dont understand how nervous i was joanna said im lucky i was able to do anything in that room how much more time would it have taken deborah questioned not long joanna admitted but im telling you i was terrified its been a hard lesson but ive learned that im lousy at committing felonies you understand what we are doing is a felony dont you i suppose deborah said absently she was clearly disappointed if worse comes to worst and we are caught joanna said at least if we can prove we were just after information about our own eggs i think wed be treated leniently but we certainly wouldnt be if we were caught breaking into their research protocols no matter what the rationalization alright maybe you have a point deborah said anyway ive another plan give me the wingate blue card why joanna asked she eyed her roommate questioningly she knew deborah could be impulsive before deborah could respond joannas food arrived the waitress served it and left deborah leaned forward again and told joanna the story of her search for the eggs origin by investigating the dumbwaiter shaft she told about finding the blank highly polished stainlesssteel door completely out of place in the decrepit antiquated basement kitchen when she was finished she said simply i want to see whats behind that door joanna finished chewing her mouthful of salad and swallowed she gazed at deborah with exasperation im not going to give you the wingate card what deborah blurted joanna shushed her before looking around to see if deborahs outburst had attracted any undo attention luckily it hadnt im not going to give you the wingate card joanna repeated in almost a whisper were here to find out about our eggs that has been the goal from the beginning no matter how compelling you believe finding out what theyre doing around here is we cant afford to put what were here for in jeopardy if that door down in the basement has a card swipe like the serverroom door and you go in there theres a good chance someone is going to be alerted just like with the server room and if that happens my intuition tells me that well be in deep trouble deborah returned joannas stare irritably but as the seconds ticked by her expression softened as did her indignation although she didnt like to hear it what joanna was saying had the ring of truth still deborah felt frustrated a few minutes earlier she had thought she had two equally promising avenues of approach to what she thought was an important mystery her intuition was loudly proclaiming that at best the wingate clinic was involved in ethically questionable research and at worst it was breaking the law as a biologist who was aware of many of the biomedical issues of the day deborah knew that fertility clinics like the wingate operated in a medical arena without oversight in fact the desperate clients of such clinics frequently begged them to try untested procedures in such an environment no patients minded being proverbial guinea pigs and they blithely dismissed possible negative consequences for themselves or society in general as long as there was the slightest possibility of producing a child such patients also tended to put their doctors on a pedestal that encouraged the doctors to believe in a kind of intellectual conceit that ethics and even laws did not apply to them im sorry i didnt do more joanna said i suppose i let you down i wish i hadnt been such a basket case in the server room but i did the best i could under the circumstances of course you did deborah said now she felt guilty about having gotten upset at joanna who actually had accomplished a rather heroic task for all of deborahs bluster she sincerely questioned if shed have been able to do what joanna had done even if she had the computer knowhow entertaining randy had been an nuisance not a stressful challenge what we should really be discussing is where we should access the donor folder joanna said taking another bite of her lunch explain deborah said id really be more comfortable doing it from home tonight via the modem joanna said it would be safer but there are problems such as if our download of a secure file is detected they could trace it back to our computer through our internet provider not good deborah said theres also the chance that if we wait my access could be discovered and eliminated before we take advantage of it now you tell me deborah complained this i wasnt aware of what are the chances of it happening probably not terribly high joanna admitted randy would have to have some reason to look for it sounds like we have to do it here deborah said i agree joanna said sometime later this afternoon but i think we should plan on leaving immediately afterward if randy detects the download and figures out it is coming from within the network hell find the pathway then it wouldnt take him long to trace it to prudence heatherlys workstation which means we have to be long gone deborah said all right i get the picture now are you finished eating joanna looked down at her halfeaten soup and salad are you in a rush i cant say im in a rush deborah said but the entire time ive been here including the half an hour or so with my new friend randy the security chief has been staring at me joanna started to turn around but deborah quickly reached out and gripped her wrist dont look why not i dont know exactly deborah admitted but he gives me the creeps and id rather not even acknowledge that ive noticed hes been looking at me for all i know its this damned dress again what was a lark initially has become a pain in the ass how do you know it is the security chief i dont know for certain deborah admitted but it stands to reason remember yesterday when we were trying to get in and the trucks were in the way it wasnt until he came out and ordered the uniformed guy to let them in that the mexican standoff was resolved when we drove in he was standing next to spencer do you remember him not really joanna admitted remember my attention was taken by spencer at the moment when i had the distorted idea he reminded me of my father deborah chuckled distorted is right but were getting away from the issue what about your food you havent taken a bite for the last five minutes joanna tossed her napkin onto the table and stood up im ready lets go except for frequenting the dining room kurt hermann seldom went into the wingate clinic proper he preferred to remain in the gatehouse or on the extensive grounds or in his apartment in the staff village the problem was he knew some things went on in the clinic that he did not countenance but thanks to his military training he could compartmentalize his thinking by not going into the clinic it was like out of sight out of mind and he just didnt think about it but there were occasions when entering the main part of the clinic was required and his current preoccupation with georgina marks was one of them using his contacts and the few facts from her employment application form plus the registration of the car she drove hed put out requests for information about her what had come back so far was confusing if not intriguing he had originally intended to approach her in the dining room during lunch but he had changed his mind it had been obvious that shed set her talons on the adolescent computer fellow with whom shed arrived and the last thing kurt wanted to weather was a rejection from the kind of person she was then the situation had abruptly changed georginas girlfriend had shown up and from afar it appeared as if the computer whiz had been summarily canned kurt needed to know why hes not in his cubicle christine parham the office manager asked kurt looked away for a moment to keep from lashing out in response to such an inane question hed just finished telling the woman that randy porter was not at his desk slowly kurt returned his glaring eyes to christines he didnt have to respond would you like me to page him christine asked kurt merely nodded for him the less said the better he had a counterproductive penchant for telling people what he thought of them when irritated and georgina marks had him irritated christine put in the call while she waited for a response she asked kurt if security was having computer problems kurt shook his head and checked his watch hed give this mission another five minutes if randy porter had not been found by then hed leave instructions for the twerp to come to the gatehouse kurt didnt want to be away from his office for too long with the number of feelers he had out about georgina marks and the calls he expected in return he wanted to be available to take them in person nice weather were having christine commented kurt didnt respond but she was saved from having to come up with any more small talk by her phones insistent jangle it was randy who reported that he was working on someones computer in accounting but could come by immediately if needed christine told him the chief of security was there to see him so hed better come right over ill meet him at his desk kurt said before christine had hung up she relayed the message kurt wended his way to the network administrators cubbyhole he sat in the second chair and gazed around contemptuously at the science fiction artwork gracing the cubicles walls he took in the joystick foolishly pushed behind the monitor as if to hide it kurt thought the kid could use a few months of boot camp which is what he thought of all young people whod not experienced it hello there mr hermann randy said breezily as he swooped into the room his insouciant attitude around people like kurt belied a wariness like a dog around an unpredictably cruel master is something amiss with one of the security computers he threw himself into his desk chair as if it were a skateboard requiring him to grab onto the edge of the desk to keep from rolling into the wall the computers are fine kurt said im here to talk to you about your lunch date georgina marks kurt looked away for a moment like hed done recently with christine he ruminated why everybody had to answer his questions with essentially the same question it was maddening what do you want to know about her randy asked brightly did she come on to you strong randy wagged his head so so he said more so in the beginning i mean she initiated the conversation did she proposition you what do you mean kurt looked away again briefly it was trying talking to most of the staff particularly randy porter who looked and acted like he was still in high school did she proposition you means did she offer sex for money or services randy had had the distinct impression that the security chief was a weird dude but this question out of the blue took the cake he didnt know what to say since he sensed the man was angry and wound up tight like a piano wire tuned to high c would you mind answering the question kurt growled why would she be offering me sex randy managed kurt looked away yet again another question generating a question which unhappily reminded him of the compulsory chats with a psychiatrist hed been ordered to have prior to leaving the army taking a breath he then repeated his question slowly and threateningly no randy barked then he lowered his voice sex didnt come up we were talking about computer games why would she bring up sex because sex is what that type of woman does shes a biologist randy said defensively it is a strange way for a biologist to dress kurt said mockingly do any of the other biologists look like her at this point in his investigation kurt wasnt sure georgina was a biologist or that her name was georgina but he did not mention his suspicions he didnt want them getting back to the woman and alerting her until hed finished his inquiries it was his current belief that she was at the wingate for some ulterior motive and dressed as provocatively as she was prostitution was high on his list after all it had been his original assessment and shed already apparently scored with spencer wingate the same day shed met him at the gate i liked the way she was dressed randy said yes i bet you did kurt snapped but why did you leave so abruptly this afternoon were you turned off for some reason is that when she asked you if you were interested in a trick no randy protested im telling you sex wasnt involved wed had a nice conversation but she wanted me to leave her friend had appeared and they wanted to talk so i left kurt stared at the skinny computer kid from kurts interrogation experience he sensed the fellow was telling him the truth the problem was that what randy was saying didnt jibe with any of kurts current beliefs about this new employee she was becoming more of a mystery rather than less of one there is something id like to talk to you about randy said eager to get the conversation away from georgina marks he went on to tell kurt about the strange episode involving dr wingate and the server room kurt nodded as he absorbed the information he didnt know what to make of it nor what to do about it for the last several years hed answered to paul saunders not spencer wingate as a military man he loathed situations with a blurred hierarchy let me know if it happens again kurt said and let me know if you have any more interaction with georgina marks or her friend for that matter and it goes without saying that youre to keep this conversation just between you and me do i make myself clear randy nodded immediately kurt stood up and without another word walked out of randys cubicle deborah gave up trying to work with her mind churning it was impossible to concentrate and since she and joanna would soon be departing the scene it was a sham anyway shed been waiting over an hour for joannas call to say that her nosy cubicle neighbor was gone clearing the way for them to access the donor file but it had never come apparently the neighbor wasnt going anyplace soon deborah drummed her fingers on the counter top shed never been particularly patient and this unnecessary waiting was pushing her beyond her limit screw it she said suddenly under her breath she pushed back from the microscope grabbed her purse and headed for the door shed kowtowed to joannas apprehensions and paranoia about her neighbor long enough after all what did it matter as soon as they got the information they were out of there besides as deborah had suggested she could block the screen with her body so the neighbor couldnt see anyway avoiding looking in the direction of the few lab people shed met deborah headed out into the hall once again as if she were on her way to the ladies room a few minutes later she slipped into joannas cubicle joanna was dutifully working without sound deborah mouthed the question which direction is gale overlook joanna pointed to the partition to the right deborah stepped over to it and looked over it was a cubicle the mirror image of joannas interestingly enough it was not occupied theres no one here deborah reported adopting a questioning expression joanna looked as well well ill be darn she said she was here two minutes ago how convenient deborah said she rubbed her palms together excitedly how about doing your sorcery right this minute lets get the information about our progeny and fly the coop joanna stepped over to the opening of her cubicle and looked in both directions satisfied she came back and sat down at her keyboard hesitantly she looked up at deborah ill keep a lookout deborah assured her then she added and after all this effort this better be good with a few rapid keystrokes and clicks of the mouse joanna pulled up the first page of the directory for the donor file there amongst other names at the beginning of the alphabet was deborah cochrane lets do you first joanna said fine by me deborah said joanna clicked on deborahs name and her file popped up both women read over the material which included background and baseline medical information at the bottom of the page was an underlined boldfaced notation that shed adamantly insisted on local anesthesia for the retrieval they certainly took that anesthesia question seriously deborah said have you finished with this page joanna questioned yeah lets get on to the good stuff joanna clicked to the next and what turned out to be the final page at the top was the notation number of eggs retrieved next to it was a zero what the hell deborah questioned this suggests they didnt get any eggs from me at all but they told you they had joanna said of course they did deborah said this is strange joanna said lets check my file she returned to the directory and scrolled through until she got to the ms finding her name she clicked on it for the next thirty seconds they read through the material which was similar to what theyd read for deborah on her first page but on the next page they were in for a larger surprise than the one caused by deborahs zero eggs in joannas file it said that had been retrieved i dont know what to make of this joanna said they told me theyd gotten five or six not hundreds whats after each egg deborah asked the type was too small to read joanna enlarged the view after each egg was a clients name along with the date of an embryo transfer after that was paul saunderss name followed by a brief description of the outcome according to this each one of your eggs went to a different recipient deborah said even thats strange i thought each patient would get multiple eggs if they were available to maximize the chances of implantation that was my understanding as well joanna said i dont know what to make of all this i mean not only are there too many eggs but none of them was successful with her finger she ran down the long list where there was either a notation about implantation failure or a miscarriage date wait theres one that was successful deborah said she reached out and pointed it was egg thirtyseven a birth date of september was indicated it was followed by the name of the mother an address a telephone number and the notation it was a healthy male well at least there was one joanna said with relief heres another one deborah said egg fortyeight with a birth date october it was also a healthy male okay two joanna said she was encouraged until both she and deborah had gone through the entire list out of the there were only two other positives egg and egg both having been implanted that january each of these was followed by the notation that the pregnancies were progressing normally how could they have implanted this so recently joanna asked i suppose it means theyre using frozen eggs deborah said joanna leaned back and looked up at deborah this is hardly what i expected you can say that again deborah responded if this is correct thats a success rate around one in a hundred that doesnt speak well for my eggs theres no way they got almost four hundred eggs from you this has to be some kind of research fabrication for god knows what reason almost four hundred eggs is about as many as youll produce during your whole life you think this is all made up that would have to be my guess deborah said weird things are going on here as we both know in that light a bit of data falsification wouldnt surprise me in the slightest hell it happens in the best of institutions much less in an isolated place like this but ill tell you now that were confronted with this mishmash im even more disappointed we cant get into their research files joanna turned around to the keyboard and started typing what are you doing now deborah questioned im going to print the file out joanna said then were going to take it and leave im crushed with these results youre crushed deborah said they have me down for no eggs whatsoever at least they thought enough of you to attribute some live kids joanna glanced up at deborah as she suspected her roommate was smiling joanna had to give her credit thanks to her mischievous personality she could find humor in most any circumstance for her part joanna was not amused at all one thing i do notice deborah said with each egg entry of yours the sperm donor is not mentioned i would assume it was the womans husband joanna said she finished setting up the printing command and clicked on the print button now thats going to take a few minutes with the size of the file if theres anything you want to do do it now because once we have the file i want to leave im ready now deborah said what a day randy lamented he was thankful to have gotten rid of kurt hermann but disgruntled hed had to have such a weird conversation in the first place the man was like a caged tiger with his quiet demeanor and the slow way he moved and spoke randy shook himself as if having had a wave of nausea just remembering talking with him randy was on his way back from fixing the workstation in accounting which hed had to put on hold when hed been called to have the chat with the security chief it was going on two in the afternoon and he was looking forward to getting back to his cubicle putting up with kurt hadnt been the worst part of the day that was reserved for having lost to screamer and randy was aching for a rematch arriving in his cubicle randy went through his usual trick to see if christine was around he was glad to see she wasnt which was typical for that time in the afternoon when she had her departmenthead meetings that meant he could allow a little more sound sitting down he pulled his joystick from behind the monitor next he typed in his password to unlock his keyboard the moment he did so he saw the same pesky prompt flashing in the lower righthand corner of his computer desktop that had been responsible for his death that morning somebody had been in the server room again with angry strokes randy brought up the appropriate window sure enough the door had been opened at pm and left open until pm which meant that whoever had gone in there had remained for twentysix minutes randy knew that a visit of twentysix minutes was not like someone popping in for a peek and it bothered him considerably in twentysix minutes someone could cause a lot of trouble indeed next randy called up the appropriate folder to see who it had been he was shocked to find that once again it had been dr spencer wingate randy sat back and stared at the founders name while trying to decide what to do hed told kurt about the first incident but the security chief had hardly seemed impressed although he had asked to be informed if it happened again randy tipped forward again he decided hed call the security chief but only after seeing if he could find anything in the system that had been changed what first came to mind was a change in user levels with rapid strokes and movement of the mouse he accessed his active directory after only a few minutes he had the answer dr wingate had added prudence heatherly to the access list for the donor folder in the servers data drive randy tipped back in his seat again he asked himself why the founder of the clinic would add the name of a new employee to a secure file that even dr wingate didnt have access to it didnt make a lot of sense unless prudence heatherly was working for him in some undercover capacity this is unreal randy said in a way he was enjoying himself it was something like a computer game where he was trying to figure out his opponents strategy it wasnt as exciting as unreal tournament but then again little was he sat and pondered for a number of minutes without coming up with a plausible explanation randy reached for the phone he wasnt looking forward to talking with kurt again but at least it was by phone not in person he also decided to tell the man just the facts and none of his supposition while he dialed the extension he noted the time it was two oclock on the button fourteen may oo pm joanna tried to act normally despite a creepy feeling she was being watched as she descended the steps at the wingate clinics entrance and started down the walkway toward the chevy malibu deborah was already in the car and joanna could see her head silhouetted in the drivers seat since the workday was hardly over they had decided that it would attract less attention if they left separately than if they walked out together so far it seemed to have worked deborah had apparently made it safely and no one had confronted joanna joanna had her purse over her right shoulder in her left hand she was carrying a thick envelope containing the bulky printout of the donor file as she walked she had to fight against the urge to run once again she felt like a thief making her getaway only this time she was carrying the stolen goods she got to the car without incident and went around to the passenger side as quickly as she could she climbed in lets get the hell out of here joanna proclaimed wouldnt this be a good time for the car not to start deborah joked as she reached for the ignition joanna swatted her playfully giving vent to the tension she felt dont even suggest it you teasel move it deborah leaned away from joannas slap got the car going and backed out of the parking space well we did it for whatever it was worth deborah said as she maneuvered the car to begin the descent of the long curving drive i guess we should give ourselves credit for that even if the payoff was a big disappointment we didnt do it until we get out of the gate safely joanna said i suppose thats technically true deborah said she pulled up to the gate stopping at the indicated white line joanna held her breath during the short interval before the gate began its long slow swing open a moment later deborah powered the car through the tunnel beneath the gatehouse and into the clear beyond joanna visibly relaxed and deborah noticed were you really worried there deborah asked ive been worried all day joanna admitted she opened the envelope and extracted the heavy printout deborah glanced at joanna as she made the right turn onto pierce street to head into bookford what are you going to do a little pleasure reading on the way home actually i had an idea joanna said and a pretty good one as im sure youll agree she began shuffling through the pages looking for two in particular while being careful to keep them all in order it took her several minutes are you going to clue me in or is this great idea of yours a secret deborah asked finally she was mildly miffed at joannas continuing silence joanna inwardly smiled she realized by not completing her thought shed unconsciously subjected deborah to the same irritating speech foible deborah was forever pulling on her enjoying her revenge joanna didnt answer until shed isolated the proper pages and put the rest of the file on the backseat voila joanna said she held the sheets up so deborah could look at them deborah took her eyes off the road long enough to see that the papers joanna was holding were those giving the details about the two children that had supposedly been born from her eggs okay i see what youve got there so whats the big idea both these children would be about seven to eight months old joanna said that is if they exist yeah so weve got names here addresses and phone numbers joanna said i suggest we call them up and if theyre willing pay them a visit deborah gave joanna a fleeting glance with an expression of total disbelief youre joking she said tell me you are joking im not joking joanna said it was your suggestion that this list was a fabrication lets check it out at least one of these addresses is right here in bookford deborah pulled over to the side of the road they were in sight of the public library at the corner of pierce and main she put the car in park and turned to look at joanna i hate to disappoint you but i dont think visiting these people is a good idea at all a call okay but not a visit well call first joanna said but if the children exist i want to see them that was never part of our plan deborah said we were just going to find out if children had resulted we never talked about a visit its not healthy nor do i think the parents would appreciate it im not going to tell them i was the donor joanna said if thats what you are worried about im worried about you deborah said knowing a child exists is one thing seeing him in reality is another i dont think you should put yourself through such a situation its asking for emotional heartache its not going to cause any emotional heartache joanna said it will be reassuring it will make me feel good thats what the addict said with the first dose of heroin deborah said if these children exist and you see them youll want to see them again and thats not fair to anyone youre not going to talk me out of this joanna said she took out her cellular phone and began punching in the number for mr and mrs harold sard she looked at deborah as the call went through the fact that it was ringing meant it was a real number and not a madeup one hello mrs sard joanna questioned when the phone was answered yes whos this this is prudence heatherly from the wingate clinic joanna said hows the little one doing jason is doing just fine mrs sard said were quite excited hes just starting to crawl joanna raised her eye brows for deborahs benefit hes starting to crawl already thats terrific listen mrs sard the reason im calling is that wed like to do some followup on jason would it be alright if myself and another wingate clinic employee came by for a brief visit with the boy of course mrs sard said if it werent for the hard work you people do we wouldnt have this bundle of joy hes such a blessing weve wanted a child for so long when would you like to come by is the next half hour or so convenient that would be perfect hes just awakened from his afternoon nap so he should be in good spirits do you have the address i do but i could use some directions joanna said the directions turned out to be simple they involved merely turning left on main street heading into town and then taking the first left after the ritesmart pharmacy the house was a sixtiesstyle splitlevel with its faux brick disengaging from its front facade and its trim sorely in need of a paint job in contrast a brandnew childs swing set stood gleaming in the afternoon sun at the side of the modest house deborah pulled into the driveway behind a vintage ford pickup she spotted the swings a new swing set for a sixmonthold id wager that means an eager dad the woman did say theyve been wanting a child for some time it doesnt look like a house belonging to people able to pay the money the wingate requires joanna nodded it makes you wonder where they found the money infertility makes couples desperate they often remortgage the house or just borrow the money but looking at this house doesnt suggest either of those avenues as possibilities deborah turned to joanna which means theyve probably ended up with little money for the financial burden of raising a child are you sure you want to go through with this i mean it might be rather bleak in there and upsetting my advice is we just turn around and leave no harm done i want to see the child joanna said trust me i can handle it she opened the door and got out deborah did the same on her side and the two women headed up the front walk with her high heels deborah had to walk with particular care to avoid the many cracks in the concrete even so she lost her shoe requiring her to bend over to extricate it do me a favor and bend your knees when you do that joanna said i can see why you caught randys attention back at the water fountain your jealousy has no bounds deborah teased back the two women climbed the front steps are you ready for this deborah asked with her finger poised over the doorbell ring the darn bell joanna said youre making this into such a big deal deborah rang the bell it could be heard chiming within the chiming went on for several seconds as if playing a tune thats a nice touch deborah said sarcastically dont be so judgmental joanna complained the door opened and through the dirty glass of the storm door the women could make out a moderately obese woman in a house dress carrying a baby with a shock of black hair when the storm door opened to provide an unencumbered view both womens mouths dropped in astonished dismay deborah even staggered back in her high heels and only by grabbing onto the railing was she able to maintain her balance paul saunders had more important things to do than meet with kurt hermann hed even had to postpone the autopsy he was going to do with greg lynch on the sows newborns down in the farm autopsy room but kurt had said it was crucial they speak right away and paul had reluctantly agreed especially when kurt had insisted they meet in the gatehouse away from other ears paul knew that meant trouble but he wasnt concerned he was confident in kurts abilities and discretion for which he was paid a lot of money a very lot of money as paul neared the squat structure he recalled the last time hed been there it had been well over a year before when thered been the anesthetic disaster he couldnt help but remember how efficiently and with what aplomb kurt had handled that crisis and the memory contributed to pauls composure at the door paul kicked off the mud his shoes had picked up on his walk down the moist lawn that was still recovering from the previous snowy winter once inside he found his security chief at his desk in his ascetic office paul grabbed a chair and sat we have a major security problem kurt said with his characteristic equanimity he had his elbows on the desktop with his clasped hands in the air he pointed his steepled index fingers at paul to emphasize his point but otherwise there was no sign of emotion or panic im listening paul said two new employees started today kurt said a georgina marks and prudence heatherly i assume you interviewed them as you normally do absolutely paul said in his minds eye he immediately pictured georgina and her curvaceous body ive been doing some investigating they are not who they said they are explain theyve used assumed names kurt said georgina marks and prudence heatherly were from the boston area but they are both recently deceased paul swallowed in an attempt to relieve a suddenly dry mouth who are they he asked he cleared his throat do we have any idea we know the name of one of them kurt said its deborah cochrane the car they were driving is registered to her the other name is as of yet unknown but that will soon change the address they gave is incorrect but we have a real address at least for deborah cochrane and at this point im assuming its the correct address for both congratulations on finding this out so soon paul said i dont think congratulations are in order just yet kurt said theres more im still listening paul said he fidgeted he was momentarily concerned that as good as kurt was perhaps hed discovered that paul had asked the woman using the georgina alias out to dinner and had been turned down randy porter has discovered that the woman calling herself prudence heatherly has managed to download and print out one of your sensitive files its a file called donor good god paul blurted how could that have happened i was assured by that computer prick that my files were secure im not as computersavvy as i ought to be kurt said but randy implied that she had help from dr spencer wingate who i believe they seduced paul had to steady himself by grabbing the sides of the chair he knew spencer was disgruntled but this was going too far how did he help her by adding her name as a user of the file kurt said i had to practically beat that information out of randy but that was what he said all right paul snapped feeling his cheeks redden ill talk to spencer and get to the bottom of it from his end although i might need your help with him too in the meantime you handle the women and be as thorough as you were with that unfortunate anesthetic death if you catch my drift i dont want those women to leave the premises under their own power and preferably not at all and i want the file that was printed out by the time he was finished he was practically yelling unfortunately the women are gone already kurt said maintaining his calmness despite pauls mounting fervor as soon as i learned all this i immediately tried to track them down to detain them apparently once they got the file they left i want you to find them and get rid of them paul barked while repeatedly stabbing a finger at kurt i dont want to know how you get rid of them just do it and do it in a way that does not implicate the wingate weve got to contain this that goes without saying kurt said and since ive already given it some thought im pleased to say that i believe it will be rather easy first we have an address which means well have quick access to the women and second the women had to know their behavior was felonious meaning they wouldnt have been inclined to tell people what they were up to also at least one of them was a donor here which makes the motive for wanting the file personal rather than for some social crusade all this means is that although theres been a major security breach it is containable if we act quickly then by all means act quickly paul shouted i want this taken care of by tonight at the latest these women could cause us a major goddamn headache ive already made arrangements to head into boston kurt said he stood up and as he did so he made sure paul caught sight of the silenced clock automatic pistol he pulled from the desks center drawer he wanted to get the credit for the seriousness he considered the situation to be but pauls response was different than kurt expected instead of pretending he didnt see it paul asked if there was another one around he could borrow for the night kurt was happy to oblige he was hoping paul would solve the spencer wingate problem himself after all having two potential commandersinchief at odds with each other could be a messy situation joanna was still trembling from the initial of the reality she was facing and she had the sense that deborah shared her feelings with equal intensity mrs sard had invited them into their living room and insisted on giving them coffee but joanna didnt touch the cup the house was so filthy she was afraid to food that resembled weekold yogurt was smeared on the couch next to where joanna was sitting toys and dirty clothes were strewn about haphazardly the smell of dirty diapers permeated the air the kitchen which joanna had caught a glimpse of when theyd first come in was piled high with dirty dishes mrs sard had maintained nonstop chatter which mostly involved the baby who clung to her for most of the visit like a marsupial she was manifestly pleased by the unexpected visit giving joanna the impression she was starved for company so the baby has been healthy deborah asked when mrs sard paused for breath quite healthy mrs sard said although just recently weve been told he has some mild senorineuronal hearing loss joanna had no idea what senorineuronal hearing loss was and although shed not opened her mouth during the whole visit she managed to ask its deafness caused by a problem with the auditory nerve deborah explained joanna nodded but still was unsure but she didnt pursue it instead she looked down at her hands they were trembling quickly she covered one with the other that helped considerably what she really wanted to do was to leave what else can i tell you about this little pumpkin mrs sard said proudly she lifted the baby off her shoulder and bounced him on her knee joanna thought he was cute like any baby but she thought he would have been cuter if hed been cleaner the footed pajamas he was wearing were soiled in the front his hair was dirty and some dried cereal was tenaciously clinging to his cheek well i think weve gotten the information we need deborah said she stood and an appreciative joanna immediately did the same how about some more coffee mrs sard asked with an echo of desperation in her voice i think weve overstayed our welcome deborah said mrs sard tried to protest but deborah was insistent reluctantly mrs sard walked her guests out the front door and stood on the porch while they descended the walkway when they got to the car only deborah looked back and when she did mrs sard was waving the babys hand to say goodbye lets get out of here joanna said as soon as the doors were closed purposefully she avoided looking back at the child im trying deborah said she got the car started and backed out of the driveway they drove for a few minutes before speaking both were glad to be away im horrified joanna said finally breaking the silence i cant imagine anyone who wouldnt be deborah said what amazes me is that that woman acts like she hasnt a clue joanna said maybe she doesnt but even if she does shes probably wanted a child for so long she doesnt care infertile couples have been known to be desperate did you know immediately joanna asked obviously deborah said i almost fell off the damn porch what was it that made the association for you it was the whole package deborah said but if i had to narrow it down i suppose id have to say the babys white forelock was the giveaway i mean thats pretty dramatic especially on a sixmonthold child did you notice the childs eyes joanna shuddered as if chilled certainly deborah said they reminded me of a husky one of my uncles had although the dogs were even more shockingly different colors what bothers me so much is that whats probably the first human clone had to be cloned from one of my eggs i can appreciate your feelings deborah said but i have to say what bothers me so much is who did it and whom he cloned paul saunders is not the kind of person the world needs another copy of cloning himself means hes more egocentric and conceited and arrogant than i could have ever imagined although ill wager hed try to argue he did it for science or mankind or some other ridiculous justification at least theres none of me in that child joanna said for the moment she couldnt see beyond the personal aspect of the calamity i hate to tell you this but thats probably not true deborah said the egg contributes the mitochondrial dna the child has your mitochondria im not even going to ask what mitochondria is joanna said i dont want to know because i dont want to believe theres anything of me in that child well we now have an explanation why the success rate with your eggs was so low cloning by nuclear transfer is like that on the positive side it was better than the people got who cloned the sheep dolly i think they went through two hundred attempts or so before getting one positive youve got four positives in less than three hundred are you trying to make a sick joke joanna questioned if you are im not finding it funny im being serious deborah said they must be doing something right their statistic is more than twice as good im certainly not going to give them any kudos joanna commented the whole affair makes me sick i wish i hadnt gone in there thats how terrible i feel i would never tell you i told you so deborah teased id never do something like that it would be too cruel joanna smiled in spite of her distress it was amazing how deborah could always buoy her up no matter what the circumstance but i do have another suggestion if you think youre capable i hate to ask what you have in mind joanna said i think we should visit the second child to see if our fears are justified they drove in silence for a while as joanna considered the suggestion its not going to make it any worse deborah said eventually weve already experienced the shock it might help us to decide what were going to do about all this if anything thats a conundrum weve studiously avoided joanna nodded in that regard deborah was totally correct not only had they not discussed what they were going to do joanna herself had purposefully avoided even thinking about it short of just turning it over to the media who would undoubtedly implicate them whom could they tell the problem was theyd gotten the information by committing a felony joanna didnt know a lot about the law but she knew that obtaining evidence criminally affected its utility on top of that she didnt even know if human cloning carried out by a private clinic was against the law in the state of massachusetts all right joanna said impulsively lets try to see the second child but if its the same situation lets not go in she reached for the second sheet of paper and pulled out her cell phone the surname of the second child was webster and the websters lived in a town a number of miles closer in toward boston than bookford joanna placed the call the phone rang more than five times she was about to disconnect when the call was answered by a woman who was out of breath the conversation with mrs webster was almost identical to the one with mrs sard except for mrs websters breathlessness she explained shed had to run for the phone since shed just taken stuart out of the bath most important she welcomed the women to stop by and gave explicit directions at least the baby will be clean joanna said as she put away her cell phone a half hour later the women pulled into the driveway of a home that was the antithesis of the sards the websters was a comparative mansion in brick colonial style with massive chimneys sprouting up like weeds in a garden the women eyed the house and the carefully tended grounds a rash of blooming magnolias and dogwoods graced the lawn ill have to say that dr saunders is eclectic about his choice of stepparents deborah commented that is if this child is another clone come on joanna said lets get this over with the women proceeded up the flagstone walkway with reservation neither was entirely sure they wanted to go through with the visit yet both felt compelled joanna pushed the doorbell once again both joanna and deborah knew instantly that the child was a clone of paul saunders the baby looked identical to the sards child with the same white forelock the same heterochromic irises and the same broadbased nose mrs webster was as gracious as mrs sard without mrs sards apparent starvation for company she invited the women into her home but the women declined and insisted on remaining on the front stoop since joanna had had time to adjust emotionally from the initial shock she was able to participate more in the brief conversation with mrs webster than she had with mrs sard also confronting a clean child in an environment more auspicious for the babys wellbeing made the episode more tolerable out of curiosity joanna asked if the baby had any hearing problem she was told that he did and it sounded equivalent to the sard babys problem after leaving the webster house the women were silent each absorbed in their own troubled thoughts it wasnt until they got onto route and got up to highway speed that deborah spoke up i dont mean to beat this issue to death but you can see now why i was disappointed we couldnt get into the wingate research files my intuition tells me theyre doing something really wrong out there and this cloning weve stumbled on is just the tip of the iceberg with the kind of arrogance dr saunders undoubtedly has the skys the limit cloning humans is bad enough i dont think its bad enough to get saunders et al closed down deborah said in fact if it gets out in the media that theyre offering cloning there might be a stampede of infertile couples to their doorstep what can i say joanna muttered as i told you i did the best i could in that server room im not blaming you yes you are all right maybe a little its just so frustrating they lapsed into silence again the engine droned in the distance the boston skyline appeared along the horizon wait a second deborah blurted suddenly causing joanna to start the shock of discovering the cloning has made us forget about the eggs what are you talking about joanna questioned the number of eggs they supposedly got from you deborah said how could they get hundreds unless deborah paused and stared out through the windshield with a horrified expression unless what joanna demanded under the circumstances she found it more irritating than usual that deborah was up to her old tricks look in the donor file deborah said quickly and see if there are any more donors who have supposedly given hundreds of eggs muttering under her breath joanna reached into the backseat and with a grunt brought the heavy file onto her lap she started at the beginning and didnt have to go through many pages there are plenty and heres one thats even more impressive anna alvarez is down for having given four thousand two hundred and five you have to be joking im not joanna said heres another multithousand donor marta arriga and yet another maria artiavia they sound like hispanic names they certainly do joanna agreed heres another even more astounding mercedes avila reputedly donated eight thousand seven hundred twentyone look and see if it suggests that all those eggs were individually implanted like with your eggs joanna turned to the next page of mercedes avilas file and ran her finger down the column it seems to be the case then they probably were all destined to be nuclear transfer clones deborah said are they all followed by paul saunderss name most of them joanna said although there are some with sheila donaldsons name as well i should have guessed deborah said it means theyre working together but tell me when you leaf through the names do there seem to be quite a few hispanic names in general or was it just a fluke with the as joanna did as deborah suggested it took her several minutes yes there seem to be quite a few and all of them are listed for having donated thousands of eggs i wonder if thats the nicaraguan connection deborah questioned with a shudder how so female embryos have the maximum number of eggs in their ovaries for an individuals entire life deborah explained someplace i read that at a particular point in embryonic development the female embryo has close to seven or eight million whereas when it is born its down to a million and by puberty down to three or four hundred thousand some distorted souls like paul saunders and sheila donaldson might think of the female embryo as a virtual gold mine i dont think i like what you are suggesting joanna said i dont either deborah said but unfortunately it stands to reason these nicaraguan women could be allowing themselves to be implanted and then subjected to abortions at twenty weeks just to get the eggs joanna averted her eyes and stared out the side window as she shuddered through a wave of revulsion what deborah was saying was as horrific as the cloning with its implications about the role of a woman and the lack of sanctity of human life with difficulty she suppressed a caldron of emotion that threatened to bubble to the surface she found herself wishing shed never had anything to do with the wingate clinic having been involved as a donor made her feel like an accomplice the problem with that scenario if it is going on is that its legal it might be a pr disaster to be happening at an infertility clinic but it would be hard for anybody to do anything about it as long as the women were not being coerced paying them is a type of coercion joanna snapped these women are poor and come from a struggling third world country hey calm down were trying to have a discussion here im not going to calm down joanna spat and what was that thought of yours that you didnt finish about my eggs i hate it when you leave me hanging like that oh yeah sorry deborah said the nicaraguan connection got me sidetracked the only way i can imagine they got that many eggs from you is if they took your whole ovary joanna swayed as if deborah had slapped her she had to shake her head to refocus her mind with a tremulous voice joanna asked deborah to repeat herself in case joanna had misunderstood deborah took her eyes off the road to cast a quick glance at her roommate she could hear from joannas voice that she was momentarily on thin emotional ice im just thinking out loud here deborah explained dont get yourself in a dither i deserve the right to get upset if youre suggesting they took my ovary joanna said slowly and seemingly in perfect control then you come up with an alternate explanation for all the eggs deborah challenged this is a brainstorming session to try to make up for not having much information joanna got a grip on herself and tried to think up another explanation as deborah had suggested with only highschool biology and girls locker room chatter as her reproductive technology sources she couldnt think of a thing the most eggs ive ever heard of being harvested in an ovarian hyperstimulation was around twenty deborah said retrieving hundreds suggests to me some kind of ovarian tissue culture is it possible to culture ovarian tissue joanna asked deborah shrugged you know i havent the slightest idea im a molecular biologist not a cellular biologist but it sounds reasonable if they took one of my ovaries joanna asked how would it affect me lets see deborah said screwing up her face as if thinking deeply with half your usual ovarian production of estrogen your adrenal testosterone level would be relatively doubled that means youll probably grow a beard lose your breasts and go bald joanna looked at her roommate with renewed horror im just kidding deborah cried youre supposed to laugh im afraid i dont find any of this funny the truth is thered probably be very little effect if any deborah said maybe there could be a slight statistical drop in your fertility since youd be reduced to ovulating from one ovary but im not even sure of that still having your ovary ripped out is an awful thought joanna said hardly mollified its like rape but maybe even worse i totally agree deborah said why just me and not you thats another good question deborah said my guess would be because i refused to have general anesthesia to take an ovary theyd have to use a laparoscopic approach as a minimum and certainly not just an ultrasound guided needle joanna closed her eyes for a moment she found herself wishing shed not been such a coward about medical procedures when shed donated she should have followed deborahs advice i just thought of something deborah said joanna stayed still she vowed to herself she wasnt going to ask they drove in silence for almost two minutes arent you interested deborah asked only if you tell me joanna said if we can prove they took your ovary then we might have something im not saying they did take it but if they did we might have some legal recourse i mean taking your ovary without consent is technically assault and battery which is a felony yeah well how could it be proved joanna said without enthusiasm what would they have to do open me up and look thanks but no thanks i dont think theyd have to open you up deborah said i think they could tell by ultrasound what i suggest is that you call carlton explain as little or as much as you want and tell him you need to find out if you are missing an ovary its a bit ironic for you to be suggesting i call carlton joanna said im not advocating you marry him for goodness sakes deborah said just take advantage of the fact that hes a medical resident residents know other residents its like a fraternity im sure he could arrange for an ultrasound ive been home for three days and havent called him once joanna said i feel guilty about calling him up out of the blue and asking for a favor oh please deborah groaned your houstonian upbringing is reasserting itself how many times do i have to remind you that men can be used just like men use women this time instead of using him for entertainment youre using him to get an ultrasound big deal in her mind joanna went over what she thought the conversation with carlton would be like from her perspective it wouldnt be as easy as deborah suggested at the same time joanna wanted to know whether shed been internally violated or not in fact the more she thought about it the more she had to know all right joanna said she reached for her cell phone ill give him a call good girl deborah said fifteen may o oo o pm louisburg square was up on the slope of beacon hill reached by heading up mount vernon street and turning left either into the squares upper roadway or lower roadway technically it wasnt a square but rather a long rectangle bordered by a collection of mostly bowfronted brick town houses with multipaned shuttered windows the center of the square was a patch of anemic trampled grass ringed by a tall threatening castiron fence and covered by a canopy of oldgrowth elms which had somehow survived the ravages of dutch elm disease at either end were modest copses of shrubbery with a single weathered piece of garden statuary kurt had found the square without difficulty despite his unfamiliarity with boston in general and the profusion of oneway streets on beacon hill in particular but parking was another matter the squares parking was discreetly labeled private with the admonition that whoever tested the ban would be towed kurt did not want to be towed he was driving one of the wingate clinics unmarked black security vans with a lockable compartment in the back in the compartment were the various and sundry things he might need as well as ample room for uncooperative passengers kurts plan had been sketchy from the start other than knowing hed be bringing the women back to the wingate he thought hed first locate the women and then improvise and at present he was still reconnoitering the area it was his third pass through the square on the first pass hed located the building it was the first on the upper right hed paused long enough to note that it was five stories tall with the top dormered and another story partially below grade whether there was a basement below that he did not know it had one entrance in the front at the top of five steps he assumed there was another door in the back but the first story in the back was obscured by a brick wall on the second pass hed noted the degree of activity in the area a lot of renovating was going on so there were a number of workmen and construction vehicles within the square there were several children ranging in age from four or five up to eleven and twelve a few nannies were either chatting with each other or absorbed with their charges now on the third pass kurt was trying to decide where to put the van most of the construction workers had now departed so that had freed up spaces he decided the best was at the mount vernon end despite the private parking sign after all the construction vehicles hadnt been towed and rounding the block again he pulled up to the fence turning his head to the right gave him an unencumbered view of the building in question by that time kurts only concern was that he had not yet sighted the chevy malibu hed memorized the license number when hed run the trace so he was not worried hed confuse it with a similar vehicle hed assumed hed come across it either as he drove around the square or in the nearby streets but it hadnt happened despite the adrenaline flowing in his veins kurt maintained his calm exterior he knew from experience that it was dangerous to give in to the excitement of such a mission it was important to be slow and methodical to avoid making mistakes at the same time he had to maintain his vigilance like a coiled snake ready to strike when the opportunity presented itself reaching round to the small of his back kurt pulled out the clock and again checked its magazine satisfied he reholstered it he then checked his knife strapped to his calf in his right pants pocket he had several pairs of latex gloves in his left a ski mask in his right jacket pocket he had his collection of lockpicking tools with which hed practiced until hed become adept in his left pocket he had several automatic injection devices containing a powerful tranquilizer after sitting in the van for almost a half hour kurt decided the time was right the level of activity in the square had diminished but was not so quiet hed stand out as a stranger kurt got out of the van and locked it after a final casual glance around the area kurt set out for number one louisburg square with his van keys in his hand kurt went up the steps to the buildings front door holding the keys as if he were having unexpected trouble with the lock kurt went to work with the lockpicking tools it took him longer than hed anticipated but the cylinder finally yielded to his efforts without looking back kurt pushed in the door and stepped inside the building the squeals of the children still playing in the square died away as the door closed without rushing kurt put away his tools and started up the stairs he knew from the doorbell panel that deborah cochrane and joanna meissner occupied the fourth floor he assumed that joanna meissner was prudence heatherly but he intended to confirm that assumption with each flight kurts excitement built he truly loved the type of action he was anticipating in his minds eye he could see georgina marks dressed in her disgustingly provocative dress he wanted her alive for sure and he wanted her back in his villa on the wingate grounds cresting the third flight kurt pulled on a pair of the gloves he then reached around and gripped the clock with his right hand but kept the gun holstered with his left hand raised he was about to knock when he heard the front door to the building open on the first floor below kurt did not panic as a lessexperienced man might have he merely stepped over to the railing and looked down the stairwell he thought it might have been the women but it wasnt instead it was a solitary man trudging up the stairs after a day at the office kurt couldnt see the individual except for his arm gripping the banister kurt prepared himself for whatever confrontation was going to occur his plan was to start down as if on his way out if the individual began to climb the third flight but the ruse wasnt necessary the man stopped on the second floor keyed open a door and disappeared the hallway lapsed back into its sepulchral stillness kurt went back to the door to the fourthfloor apartment he knocked loud enough for the occupants to hear if they were home but not loud enough to disturb other people in the building he waited but when no one responded and he could hear no sounds from within he went back to work with his lockpicking tools as was typically the case in kurts experience the interior apartment door was more of a challenge than the outer door mainly because it had two locks a regular lock and a separate deadbolt the regular lock was easy but the deadbolt took patience finally it gave way and opened in the next instant kurt was within the apartment and had the door closed with speed that belied his earlier slow and deliberate movement kurt dashed through the apartment to make certain it was empty he didnt want to give anyone a chance to make a call to be complete he checked every room and every closet he even peered under the beds once he was satisfied he was alone in the unit he checked the alternate exit it was a fire escape that zigzagged its way down the back of the house its access was through the window of the rear bedroom walking back through the bedroom kurt caught a glimpse of a photo of a young couple the woman looked similar enough to prudence heatherly despite the longer hair for kurt to be certain the two women he was after were roommates and that joanna meissner was prudence heatherly passing out of the bedroom and down the hall kurt entered the living room going over to the desk he searched for any papers suggesting an association with the wingate clinic he didnt find any but he did find some material relating to the two aliases the women had used kurt carefully folded these sheets and pocketed them continuing on kurt found a photo of georgina he preferred to relate to her as georgina rather than deborah in the photo georgina had her arm around an older woman kurt assumed was georginas mother he was astounded how different georgina looked in dark hair and chaste attire her lascivious transformation was clearly the work of the devil kurt put the photo down and opened up the top drawer of the bureau reaching in he pulled out a silky pair of lace panties despite the latex gloves that dampened his sense of touch there was something about the feel of the lingerie that excited him leaving the second bedroom kurt walked back through the living room and into the kitchen opening the refrigerator door he was disappointed hed expected a cold beer and the fact there was none irritated him immeasurably returning to the living room kurt removed the clock from i small of his back and placed it on the floor then he sat down the couch he checked his watch it was well after seven and he wondered how long hed have to wait for georgina and prudence to return its called waardenburg syndrome carlton said he nodded as if agreeing with himself then sat back with a proud expression on his youthful face he and the women were sitting at a formica table in the middle of the mgh basement cafeteria where hed brought them for a quick bite of supper since nor of them had eaten carlton was on call that night and had warned them he could be paged for some emergency at any moment what in gods name is the waardenburg syndrome joanna asked impatiently carltons response suggested hed not been listening to what shed been saying shed just finished describing the shock she and deborah had had in discovering the two cloned children waardenburg syndrome is a developmental abnormality carlton said its characterized by white forelock congenital sensorineural hearing loss dystopia canthorum and heterochromic irises joanna glanced at deborah for a moment deborah rolled her eyes indicating she had the same reaction it was as if carlton was on another planet carlton listen joanna said trying to be patient were not on hospital rounds like youve described to me in the past were not grading you so you dont have to spout off with this medical minutia its the forest thats important not the tree i thought youd want to know what this doctor youve described has carlton said its a hereditary condition involving the migration of auditory cells from the neural crest its no wonder the cloned kids have it his legitimate kids would have it too are you trying to suggest that these kids weve described arent clones joanna questioned no theyre probably clones carlton said with the normal genetic shuffling that would occur in a normally fertilized egg there would be variable penetration even of dominant genes the kids wouldnt look exactly the same thered be significant variation of the same characteristics are you trying to be abstruse on purpose joanna demanded no im trying to help but you still think these children are clones am i right deborah chimed in absolutely from how youve described them carlton admitted doesnt that shock you joanna questioned were not talking about fruit flies or even sheep were talking about cloning human beings to tell you the truth im not all that surprised carlton admitted he sat forward again as far as im concerned it was just a matter of time once dolly was cloned i thought human cloning would happen eventually and it would happen in the kind of environment youve described a nonuniversitybased infertility clinic many of the infertility guys particularly the mavericks have been bantering around about cloning and threatening to do it since dolly was announced im shocked to hear you say that joanna stated before carlton could respond his pager went off after looking down at the lcd display he scraped back his chair let me make this call ill be right back both joanna and deborah watched him wend his way through the mass of empty tables toward one of the wall phones your analogy about the forest and the trees is marvelously apropos deborah commented joanna nodded by his own admission hes so isolated in here with his mind cluttered up with trivia like waardenburg syndrome its no wonder he hasnt the inclination to think about whats going on in the world or about ethics hes taking this cloning in stride he wasnt even all that incensed about what we told him concerning the nicaraguans deborah said or even about you for that matter joanna nodded reluctantly carlton had not been particularly empathetic when theyd first arrived joanna had been concerned about his feelings and had made it a point to apologize for not having called during the three days shed been in boston although carlton had been gracious about the lack of contact joanna had still felt guilty about asking him for a favor but that feeling had passed with carltons lack of reaction to her fears the women had decided it best if they told carlton the whole story from the egg donation onward hed listened with rapt attention and without interrupting until they got to the part where they got jobs at the wingate with assumed names and disguises wait a second carlton had asked hed looked at deborah is that why you bleached your hair and youre wearing that wild skimpy dress i hadnt thought youd noticed deborah had said resulting in a suppressed chortle from carlton as if not having noticed would have been impossible at that point joanna had asked carlton what he thought of her disguise to joannas chagrin hed asked what disguise the only part of the whole story that had truly captured carltons interest was the egg quandary when he learned the reputed numbers of eggs involved his response like deborahs was to suspect that the wingate had developed a successful ovarian tissue culture technique along with the ability to maturate extremely immature oocytes he had told the women that such an advance would be an exciting scientific development when the women had revealed that the reason they were there was to get an ultrasound on joanna for fear shed been shorn of one of her ovaries hed agreed to see what he could do and had made some calls the fact that hed not had more of an emotional reaction was a surprise to both women i dont want to speak out of school deborah said as she and joanna watched carlton talking on the phone but im even gladder now than i was before that youre not still engaged to that man youre not speaking out of school joanna assured her carlton finished his conversation hung up the phone and started back as he approached he flashed a thumbsup sign its a go he said reaching the table he made it a point not to sit down that was one of the radiology residents who is on call shes arranged to do the ultrasound when deborah asked right now carlton said the machines all fired up and ready to rumble the two women got to their feet and gathered their belongings ive never had an ultrasound joanna said is this going to be an ordeal im sure i dont have to remind either one of you i hate needles youre not going to mind it at all carlton assured her there are no needles involved the worst part is the gel but thats only because its a bit messy the good part is that it is watersoluble they crowded into the elevator and rose up to the radiology floor carlton held the door to allow them to exit and pointed in the proper direction down the hall after making a series of turns in the mazelike department they came to the ultrasound unit the waiting room was deserted a janitor with a power buffer was doing the floor should i wait out here deborah questioned no not at all carlton said the more the merrier he led them back behind the checkin desk into a hall with numerous doors lining both sides each door opened into a separate unoccupied and darkened ultrasound unit the women followed carlton almost to the halls end where a light spilled out from one of the side rooms inside a woman in a short white coat stood up and introduced herself before carlton could do the honors her name was dr shirley oaks she had bobbed hair not too dissimilar from joannas both in style and color in contrast to carlton she was sympathetic about the potentially missing ovary and said so joanna thanked her but then cast a concerned look at carlton shed urged him to be as discreet as possible i didnt tell the whole story carlton said in his defense but i had to say what we were looking for nor do i want to know the whole story shirley said she patted the ultrasound couch to encourage joanna to climb onto it shed covered it with fresh paper from a roll of paper at the head weve got to be expeditious about this she added ive got another procedure i was about to do plus i could get called away for an emergency at any moment joanna started to comply but shirley restrained her it might make it considerably easier if you slip off your skirt and unbutton your blouse sure joanna said ill wait outside and give you some privacy carlton said its not necessary on my behalf joanna said as she slipped out of her skirt and passed it into deborahs waiting hands theres nothing you havent seen before joanna climbed up onto the couch and shirley exposed her lower abdomen by pushing away her shirttails and lowering the top edge of her panties the three tiny puncture sites from the egg retrieval laparotomy were just barely visible do these scars appear normal for a laparotomy shirley asked carlton as she prepared to put on the ultrasound gel carlton bent over and took a closer look they sure do theyre the usual size and theyve healed normally could an ovary be delivered through such a small incision shirley asked certainly carlton said young healthy skin like joannas is surprisingly elastic it wouldnt be any problem at all lets get this over with joanna said of course shirley agreed she squirted out a generous dollop of the gel onto joannas bare abdomen ahhh thats cold joanna cried oh yeah sorry shirley said i forgot we usually warm this stuff or at least the nurses and the technicians do shirley turned the lights out with a foot pedal and applied the probe to joannas abdomen the monitor was on an arm and it was positioned so that everyone could see including joanna okay there we go shirley said speaking to herself theres the uterus it looks good and completely normal both joanna and deborah marveled how anyone could make anything out of the squiggly white lines on a dark background now well move laterally shirley said we can see the ligaments and the tubes and there theres the left ovary i see it carlton said it looks normal very normal shirley said now lets move back to the uterus thats good now to the right joanna kept watching the screen hoping to see something she could say she recognized but in truth she knew little about her inner workings and she preferred it that way as long as everything functioned normally shirley moved the ultrasound probe around in a tight circle in joannas right lower abdomen then she began to press in on it to the point of discomfort ah joanna complained thats starting to hurt just a second more shirley said then she stopped and straightened up and looked at carlton well as near as i can tell the right ovary is not there it couldnt be retroflexed or anything like that carlton asked its not there shirley said id be willing to put money on it is it all right if i get up joanna asked oh of course shirley said she gave joanna some tissues to help wipe up the gel from her abdomen shirley lent a hand as well joanna slid off the couch and buttoned her blouse what are the chances that joanna only had one ovary to begin with deborah asked thats not a bad question carlton said he shrugged i dont know call one of the gyn residents shirley suggested they should know good idea carlton said if i can help any more give me a buzz shirley said ive got to go the group thanked the radiology resident who then left joanna grabbed her skirt and shook out the wrinkles come out to the main desk when you are ready carlton said ill page the gyn resident from out there he stepped out into the corridor and disappeared down the hall well our worst fears have been corroborated deborah said she held joannas arm while joanna stepped into her skirt now that she was alone with deborah joanna felt a surge of emotion and even suffered some tears she wiped them away with the back of her hand i dont know why im crying now she said with a short emotional laugh i guess its just that ive had a long intimate relationship with that ovary and i didnt even know she was gone deborah smiled im impressed you can find humor in this as tired as i am laughing seems easier than crying well im mad deborah said the nerve of paul saunders and sheila donaldson and whoever else is in on all this using her fingers to count she said consider what they are apparently doing one stealing ovaries from unsuspecting women two cloning themselves to beat the band three impregnating poor nicaraguan women and aborting them for eggs and thats only what we suspect we have to do something about this joanna adjusted her skirt and her blouse and slipped into her shoes i know what im going to do im going to go home and go to bed after ten or eleven hours of sleep maybe ill be able to think up something appropriate for the wingate clinic do you know what i think we should do deborah said joanna picked up her purse she was in no mood to play deborahs game and didnt respond instead she walked out of the room deborah followed ill tell you what we should do even if you dont want to hear it i think we should go back out there to the wingate clinic tonight and see whats in that egg room there could very well be incriminating evidence in there hell we might even find your ovary and if that doesnt work we can get you back into the server room and get the research files at this time of night we wont have to contend with randy porter joanna stopped and turned around thats the craziest idea ive heard in a long time why in heavens name would we go back out there tonight because we can you must be just as tired as i am what kind of answer is that we still have access cards deborah explained we left early today and im sure they discovered it so were out of jobs but knowing bureaucracies the cards are probably still operative that will change tomorrow but id be awfully surprised if they didnt work tonight and we still have spencers card and thats not going to stay good forever either my only point is that if we dont go out there sooner there probably wont be a later weve got this narrow window of opportunity that we have to take advantage of i suppose you have a point joanna said wearily but were both way too tired she turned around and continued down the hallway deborah followed at her heels trying to convince her they had a moral responsibility when they emerged into the waiting area they were still arguing carlton had to quiet them so he could hear while he was on the phone what are you women arguing about he asked when his call was completed joanna and deborah were glaring at one another shes trying to talk me into going back to the wingate clinic tonight joanna explained she wants to break into what she calls the egg room and she wants me to hack into their research files do you ladies want to hear my opinion carlton asked it depends deborah said are you for or are you against against then we dont want to hear it deborah said id like to hear it joanna said i dont think you should break the law any more than you already have carlton said youre lucky to have gotten away with what you did let professionals take over go to the authorities like to whom deborah challenged the bookford police what are they going to do shoot themselves in the foot the fbi we dont have any evidence theres any interstate aspect to all this that would justify them getting a search warrant and im sure saunders and donaldson have contingency plans if there are any general inquiries medical authorities theyre not going to do anything because they never have for them infertility clinics are somehow beyond the pale what did you find out from the gyn resident joanna asked congenital absence of one ovary is a rare bird carlton said she said shes never seen it never heard of it and never read it but she thought it could happen they stole your damn ovary deborah rejoined the facts are written on the wall hell id think you should be the one trying to talk me into going back out there tonight rather than vice versa thats because i apparently have significantly more sense than you do carltons pager went off in the deserted waiting room it sounded louder than it had in the basement cafeteria he used the phone directly in front on him i dont think we should to lose this opportunity deborah persisted all right ill be right down carlton said he hung up sorry to break up this party but that was the er theres been a pileup on storrow drive and the ambulances are on their way in carlton accompanied the women down in the elevator while they kept up their debate in forced whispers in deference to the other passengers they even persisted quarreling all the way down the main corridor to the front door of the hospital this is where i have to leave you two carlton said interrupting the women and pointing toward the emergency department then looking at joanna he said great to see you and im sorry about that ovary thank you for arranging the ultrasound joanna said glad to be able to help ill call you later do that joanna said she smiled and he did the same then he waved selfconsciously before disappearing through the swinging doors deborah made the gesture she was sticking her finger down her throat to gag oh please joanna said hes not that bad says who deborah countered sorry about that ovary what a birdbrained insensitive thing to say its like you lost your pet turtle and not part of your identity as a woman the two women exited the hospital and headed toward the parking garage evening had turned into night and the streetlamps had come on approaching ambulance sirens could be heard screaming in the distance doctors see tragedies more poignant than losing an ovary every day joanna said he doesnt see it in the same way you and i do besides you said yourself one ovary will not physically affect me but you were his fiancée deborah said its not like youre just another patient but you know what just forget it hes your problem not mine lets get back to the issue at hand im going to go out to the wingate tonight whether you go or not i cant do anything about the computer part but i can get in that egg room and if theres incriminating evidence im going to find it youre not going out there by yourself joanna ordered oh really deborah questioned superciliously what are you going to do let the air out of my tires or lock me in my bedroom because youre going to have to do one or the other i cannot believe you are this adamant about such a stupid idiotic dimwitted idea of yours ah deborah cooed sarcastically im getting the impression youre sensing my commitment im impressed such clairvoyance feeling irritated with one another and the escalating sharpness of their comments the women lapsed into silence as they climbed to the proper floor in the hospitals parking garage found their car got in and drove out the silence lasted until they were heading up mount vernon street in sight of louisburg square joanna was the first to speak what about a compromise she said would you be amenable im listening deborah answered ill come with you but we restrict our sleuthing to the egg room or whatever it turns out to be what if theres no good evidence in there about what theyre up to thats a risk well have to take whats wrong with going back into the server room if were all the way out there because i think randy porter will have already made changes in his system which would mean going back into the server room would be a big risk with a low probability of a payoff he have detected the hack into the secure files from me downloading them and hell figure out how i did it through the server room console as soon as he does that hell beef up the security for the server room keyboard i doubt id get into the system why didnt you say this earlier because i think going out there is idiotic plain and simple joanna said but im not going to let you do it alone even if it is idiotic just like you wouldnt let me go out there and get a job by myself so do we have a compromise or what all right we have a compromise deborah said as she eased into a parking slot at the end of the square she cursed under her breath because the spot was so narrow she knew she and joanna were going to have a hard time getting out of the car the problem was a black van parked where she normally did im not going to be able to get out of this car joanna said eyeing the neighboring vehicle less than five inches away i was afraid of that deborah said she looked over her shoulder and backed out giving joanna the chance to exit unencumbered then deborah eased the car back into the slot but even tighter to the passengerside vehicle opening her door against the pesky black van she was able to squeeze herself out sixteen may o pm kurt felt a renewed squirt of adrenaline course through his body when he caught sight of an auspicious looking car coming up mount vernon street as the time had dragged on hed become concerned that hed made a false assumption about the women returning directly to their apartment by ninethirty hed been concerned enough to pace the room an activity that was foreign to his usual practiced serenity if hed been able to read the wait would have been more tolerable but he dared not turn on the light ultimately kurt had been reduced to looking out the front window at the gaslit square wondering what the womens absence meant and how long he should wait before coming up with an alternative plan hed only been at the window for five minutes when a chevy malibu had appeared and then nosed into a parking place right next to his van kurt was quite confident it was the women but he became certain when the car backed up to let off the passenger before nosing back into the slot the woman who emerged was prudence heatherly the chaste one kurt had gotten a fleeting but good look at her face from the glow of the gas lamp on the corner almost directly below him then he saw georgina squeeze herself out between her car and the van in the process one of her breasts spilled out kurt could see her laugh as she readjusted herself whore kurt whispered to himself with disgust the woman was shameless in his mind but he would soon be showing her the consequences of such lewdness but what kurt did not allow himself to acknowledge was that the brief flash of carnality had sexually excited him kurt was about to leave the window to finalize his preparations for the womens arrival when his attention was drawn back to the scene below instead of advancing toward the door the women had become engaged in a discussion that quickly escalated in its intensity even from as far up as he was and even with the glass in between he could hear bits and pieces of their conversation it had definitely become an argument fascinated by this unexpected turn of events kurt pressed his nose against the glass to give a fuller view of the scene georgina had come halfway from the car to the house but prudence was remaining by the car and pointing to it repeatedly suddenly georgina threw up her hands and returned to the car with as much difficulty as shed evinced getting out of the car she got back in kurt watched with growing concern as the car backed out when prudence climbed back in he inwardly groaned and then when the car took off down mount vernon street he swore kurt returned to his pacing a mission hed assumed would be easy was proving not to be and was now threatening to get out of hand where could these women be going at almost ten oclock at night he suggested to himself that they could be going out to dinner but then dismissed the idea thinking dinner had probably been part of what had kept them away for so long and how long would they be away and would they come back alone the last question was a particular concern kurt had no answers and the minutes ticked by he went back to the window the only people in sight were a few dog walkers with their pets the chevy malibu was nowhere to be seen kurt pulled out his cell phone although he was embarrassed not to be able to report success he felt it best to apprise the commander of the current situation paul saunders answered on the second ring can you speak freely kurt questioned as much as can be expected on a cell phone roger kurt said im in my clients home they returned briefly moments ago but drove away without coming in destination unknown paul was quiet for a moment how difficult was it to get into the clients home easy kurt reported then i want you back here paul said you can go back for the women later spencer is the problem at the moment i need your help ill be there straightaway kurt said not without disappointment it meant that dealing with georgina would have to wait kurt then thought hed spend a little time looking for a spare set of keys when he returned he wanted to be able to get in faster than he had earlier l still dont know why you wont let me go up in the apartment and change deborah complained it would only take me five minutes she and joanna were standing in one of the aisles of the twentyfourhour cvs which was more like a minimart than a drugstore drugs were only a small part of the merchandise available which ran from car products to industrial cleaning agents oh sure five minutes joanna said sarcastically when was the last time you changed clothes in under a half hour and its already after ten if were going back to the wingate i want to get it over with but i dont relish stumbling around in these high heels while we do our detective work then put on your sneakers joanna said you admitted your workout gear is in the trunk of your car im suppose to wear sneakers with a minidress were not going to a fashion show come on deborah have you gotten what you wanted here if so lets get on the road i suppose deborah said she was holding several flashlights batteries and a disposable camera help me is there anything else we should take i cant think if they sold some common sense perhaps we should take whatever they have very funny deborah said youre being a brat you know all right lets go at the checkout register deborah grabbed a pack of gum and a few candy bars when she paid for her items soon they were back in the car and on their way out of town having spent themselves arguing for the previous half hour they drove mostly in silence with no traffic they made the trip in slightly less than half the time that it had taken previously bookford appeared deserted as they drove up main street the only people they saw were two couples outside the pizza place the only other sign of activity was the floodlights over the little league field behind the municipal building im kinda hoping our cards will no longer work joanna said as they neared the turnoff such a pessimist deborah responded they drove up to the gatehouse which looked as dark and unwelcoming as it had the night before which card should we use joanna asked one of ours or spencers ill try mine deborah said she eased the car up to the card swipe and ran her card through the gate opened immediately just as i suspected no problem with the access cards the ironic thing is that i never thought id be appreciative of bureaucratic inefficiency joanna was not appreciative in the slightest after theyd driven onto the wingate grounds and started up the driveway she turned around and forlornly caught a glimpse of the gate closing now they were locked in and she couldnt shake the feeling they were making a big mistake when his cell phone rang kurt had been engrossed in his thoughts and the sound startled him hed involuntarily jerked the vans steering wheel and for a brief moment had to struggle to get the vehicle straightened out he was traveling close to eighty miles an hour heading northwest on route and closing in on the turnoff to bookford with the van under control he fumbled unsuccessfully for his phone in his jacket pocket while its insistent ring continued hastily he undid his seat belt at that point he was able to get the phone out and establish a connection we have a contact a voice said kurt recognized the voice it was bruno debianco kurts numbertwo man who served as the eveningshift security supervisor hed been in the special forces at the same time as kurt and like kurt had been discharged under lessthanhonorable circumstances im listening kurt responded the chevy malibu with the two women just came through the gate a shiver of excitement passed down kurts spine the mild despondency he was feeling at having been ordered back to the compound to deal with spencer wingate vanished in a split second having the women on the grounds would make apprehending them as easy as a turkey shoot do you copy bruno questioned when kurt hadnt immediately responded i copy kurt said matteroffactly to cover his excitement follow them but do not make contact i want the pleasure do i make myself clear tenfour bruno answered theres one proviso kurt said as an afterthought if they try to meet up with wingate detain them and keep it from happening is that understood perfectly bruno said i should be there in another twenty minutes kurt added tenfour bruno said kurt disconnected a smile spread across his face the evening that had started out so promising but had turned bleak had become rosy again now it was a given that within the hour both women would be locked in the holding cell hed had constructed in the basement of his living quarters and they would be tantalizingly at his disposal keeping one hand on the steering wheel kurt used his speed dial to call paul good news kurt said when paul came on the line the women have returned to base on their own accord excellent paul said good work thank you sir kurt said he was willing to take credit if paul was willing to offer it handle the women then well face the wingate problem paul said call me when you are free yes sir kurt said like a conditioned pavlov dog kurt felt the almost irresistible urge to salute this is not what i suspected deborah said i didnt know what to suspect joanna said the women were sitting in the car in the wingate clinics parking area the vehicle was pointing toward the butt end of the buildings south wing with its engine still running the parking spot was slightly east affording a view along the buildings rear all the secondstory windows of the rear of the wing were ablaze with light the whole lab is lit up deborah said i thought the place would be like a graveyard after hours i wonder if they are working around the clock in a way it makes sense joanna said if things are going on out here they dont want people to know about it would be best for them to be happening when the crowds of clinic patients arent here i guess deborah said well what are we going to do before deborah could respond both women saw car lights appear at the base of the driveway and start up uhoh deborah said here comes company what should we do joanna demanded in a minor panic stay calm for one thing deborah said i dont think we should do anything for the moment other than scrunch down as best we can bruno saw the car he knew to be the womens even before he could tell it was a chevy malibu it was parked in a spot pointing toward the clinic entrance what had caught his attention was that although the front lights were out the brake lights were still on someone was sitting in the car with their foot on the brake as brunos black security van crested the lip of the parking area and his headlights strafed the car in question he was able to make out the tops of two heads in the front seat bruno didnt even slow much less stop he continued across the parking area and descended the road on the other side as if he were on his way to the living quarters of the compound as soon as he knew he was out of sight bruno pulled to the side of the road killed the headlights turned off the engine and jumped out dressed in black like kurt he was invisible in the darkness he sprinted back up the road then skirted the edge of the parking area within only a few minutes he had the chevy malibu in sight and he could make out that the two women were still in the front seat im a nervous wreck joanna admitted why dont we just leave you admitted yourself that you didnt expect this place to be in operation like it is now were bound to run into people if we go in there what are we going to say calm down deborah ordered youre the one who insisted on coming along that was only a van that passed by it didnt stop it didnt even slow down everythings cool its not cool joanna said now were trespassing to add to our list of offenses i think we should go im not leaving until i have something concrete on this place deborah said you can stay in the car if you want but im going in although first im putting on my sneakers deborah opened the door and stepped out into the crisp night air she went around to the trunk got out her workout shoes then returned inside the car i just saw someone at one of the secondstory windows joanna said nervously big deal deborah said she pulled on her sneakers and laced them up this is going to look hilarious with this short skirt but who cares i cant believe youre not worried about running into someone joanna said enough of this deborah snapped are you coming or not im coming joanna said reluctantly what do you think we should take with us as little as possible joanna said considering we might have to make a run for it maybe we should turn the car around so that at least we could get out of here fast if need be i suppose thats not a bad idea deborah said she restarted the car did a threepoint turn then backed back into the spot happy saying i was happy would be a gross exaggeration lets just take the flashlights the access cards and the disposable camera deborah said fine joanna said deborah reached around and got the bag from the drugstore off the backseat she gave one of the flashlights to joanna and kept the other for herself plus the disposable camera ready i suppose joanna said without enthusiasm wait a minute deborah said i just got an idea joanna rolled her eyes if deborah expected her to guess what was on her mind under the circumstances she was insane you dont want to know what my idea is only if its something like you think we should leave deborah flashed joanna an exasperated expression no smart aleck the first time we came out here to donate we left our coats in a cloakroom there were long white doctors coats in there i think we should borrow a couple it will make us look more professional especially me with this miniskirt finally the women got out of the car and hurried up the walk they were mildly surprised to find they needed an access card to get into the building but like at the gate the card worked fine inside they found the large reception area dark and deserted they ducked into the cloakroom and once the door was closed they turned on the lights deborahs memory had served them well there were plenty of white doctors coats although few in small sizes it took a few minutes to find two that were reasonably appropriate they used the pockets for the flashlights access cards and disposable camera thus equipped they turned out the light and reemerged into the reception area ill follow you joanna whispered deborah nodded she skirted the empty receptionists desk and started down the darkened main corridor passing the patients changing room on the left where a year and a half earlier theyd donned hospital johnnies prior to their eggretrieval procedures deborahs destination was the first stairwell and they made it without encountering anyone the only noise they heard was their own footfalls both breathed a sigh of relief once inside the stairwell it felt safer than the open hallway at least until they got down the three flights and opened the fire door into the dark dank basement no lights deborah said its a good thing were prepared she pulled out her flashlight and switched it on joanna did the same and the moment she shined it into the mausoleumlike basement hallway she caught her breath whats the matter deborah questioned my god look at all the old creepy hospital paraphernalia joanna said she shined the light over a profusion of disabled wooden wheelchairs dented bedpans and broken hospital furniture an antiquated portable xray machine with a bulbous head stood out in joannas flashlight beam like a prop for an old frankenstein movie didnt i mention this stuff deborah asked no joanna said irritably you dont have to get mad about it deborah said it seems that the whole rest of the building is filled with all sorts of gear from its previous mentalinstitution tbsanitarium days its spookylooking joanna complained you could have at least prepared me for it sorry deborah said but dr donaldson told us about it back when we first came out here she said the place was a museum of sorts remember no joanna said well come on anyway deborah said its just a bunch of trash she led the way out into the corridor and headed north almost immediately the corridor twisted to the right and then turned again smaller arched openings led off on either side do you know where you are going joanna questioned she was following close behind deborah not really deborah admitted the stairway we came down wasnt the one i came down earlier today but i know were at least going in the right direction why did i allow myself to be drawn into this joanna mumbled just prior to letting out a muffled scream deborah wheeled around and shined her light into joannas face joanna averted her gaze from the glare and got her hand between deborahs light and her face dont shine that thing in my eyes what the devil is the matter deborah demanded angrily through clenched teeth once shed seen joanna was in one piece a rat joanna managed i saw an enormous rat with bright red eyes right over there behind that old desk jeez joanna deborah complained get a hold of yourself this is supposed to be a clandestine exercise were trying to be stealthy here im sorry im on edge in this junkyard dungeon i cant help it well pull yourself together you scared me half to death deborah set out again but only managed a few more steps when joanna reached out and grabbed her pulling her to a stop what now deborah complained i heard something behind us joanna said she shined her light back the way theyd come expecting to see the rat again she saw nothing but the junk theyd just passed for the first time she looked up into the tangled mass of pipes and ducts were going to be here all night unless you cooperate deborah said all right joanna snapped back they walked for another five minutes along the twisting corridor before coming to a large oldfashioned kitchen mixer attached to its own wheeled stand it was covered with a layer of dust a few assorted kitchen implements stuck out of the mixing bowl the top of the mixer was tilted back and the beaters pointed off at a fortyfivedegree angle we must be getting close deborah said the door im looking for was on the other side of the kitchen and we must be close to the kitchen now rounding the next bend proved deborah to be correct soon they were passing through the old kitchen with the help of her flashlight joanna gazed into the yawning filthy ovens and the huge soapstone sinks overhead the light played against a line of blackened and dented pots and skillets hanging over the countertop there it is deborah said she pointed ahead the stainlesssteel door stood out in the dark dingy environment as if it were glowing its polished surface reflected back most of deborahs flashlight beam you were certainly right when you described it as out of place down here joanna said the women moved over next to the door deborah placed her ear against it as shed done earlier same sounds as i heard before she said she then told joanna to put her hand against the door its warm joanna said she then handed spencer wingates access card which shed been carrying to deborah my guess is that its somewhere close to ninetyeight point six degrees fahrenheit deborah said she took the card but did not run it through the card swipe well are we going in or what joanna asked deborah was just looking at the door of course were going in deborah said im just trying to prepare myself for what were going to find finally after taking a fortifying deep breath she ran the card through the swipe there was a slight delay followed by the sound of air escaping as if the space beyond was at a slightly higher pressure then the thick heavy door began slowly to recede into the wall seventeen may o pm cursing under his breath from having smacked his shin against an unknown metal object bruno stumbled back along the corridor in the darkness using his fingers against the brick wall to guide him he tried not to trip over any more of the trash cluttering the floor but it was impossible and he winced every time he collided with something more from the sound it made than from any pain it caused as soon as his fingers detected a corner he eased himself around it only then did he venture a look back the way hed come in the distance the stainlesssteel door of the culture room suddenly snapped back into place a hundred times faster than it had opened but in the brief interval bruno was able to catch sight of the two women standing within the lighted space beyond quickly bruno got out his flashlight switched it on and stuck it in his teeth to hold it he directed the beam into the recess hed eased into rather than back out into the corridor he didnt want the women to suddenly look back and see the light if they happened to open the door next he struggled to get his cell phone out of his pocket as quickly as he could he used the phones internal directory to find the culture room number the moment it popped onto the screen he pressed the talk button although cellphone reception in the wingates basement was not good he could hear the phone ringing through static come or answer he urged out loud finally a voice came on the line culture room cindy drexler speaking this is bruno debianco can you hear me just barely cindy answered do you know who i am of course cindy said youre the security supervisor then listen up bruno said talking as loudly as he dared two women have just come into the culture room how they got an access card i have no idea do you see them there was a pause not yet cindy said coming back on the line but im nowhere near the entrance this is important bruno continued keep them occupied for fifteen or twenty minutes be creative tell them whatever they want to know but keep them there do you understand i guess cindy said tell them everything anything and everything it doesnt matter bruno said just dont alarm them kurt hermann is on his way and hell personally be taking them into custody they are unauthorized intruders ill do what i can cindy said thats all i ask bruno said well be in there as soon as he gets here bruno disconnected from cindy then speeddialed kurts number there was even more static when kurt answered than when bruno had spoken with the cultureroom technician can you hear me bruno asked well enough kurt answered whats going on im outside the culture room in the wingate basement bruno said the women had a card to get them inside i called the technician and told her to keep them in the room youll be able to nab them with ease did they see you no theyre unsuspecting perfect im just entering bookford ill be there in ten minutes fifteen tops do you have handcuffs with you thats a negative bruno said get some from the gatehouse kurt ordered and meet me at the gate well grab the women together tenfour bruno said for several minutes the women stood still absorbing the surroundings in keeping with the starkly modern door theyd just passed through both had expected a futuristic netherworld instead they were in a maze of rooms with the same general decor as the rest of the basement separated from one another by the same brick archways the difference was the bright light coming from banks of newly installed fluorescent fixtures the ambient temperature and the contents instead of discarded hospital and kitchen material the room they were in and the others they could see were filled with modernappearing laboratory equipment mostly in the form of large incubators brimming with tissue culture dishes most of the incubators were on wheels i expected something a bit more dramatic joanna said me too deborah said its not even as impressive as the lab upstairs it feels like the tropics what do you think the temperature is close to body temperature deborah said she turned back to the stainlesssteel door a laminate box was mounted on the wall just to the right of the door the box had a central protruding red panel on the panel in block letters were the words openclose before we take a tour i want to make sure we can get out of here deborah said the way this door snapped shut i want to reassure myself its going to open again she pushed the red panel the door slid open just as it had a few moments before then when deborah pushed the panel again the heavy insulated door closed in the blink of an eye and its silence was as impressive as its closing speed deborah was about to comment about the door when joanna frantically grabbed her arm and blurted out in a whisper we have company deborahs head snapped around in the direction joanna was looking in one of the archways stood a smiling middleaged woman with a narrow deeply tanned face displaying prominent crows feet and smile creases she was dressed in a superlightweight white cotton outfit her hair was contained in a hood of the same material a surgical mask was tied around her neck and hung down over her chest welcome to the culture room the woman said my name is cindy drexler and what might your names be joanna and deborah exchanged a brief confused and panicky glance were new employees deborah managed to say after a few false starts how nice cindy said she came forward hand outstretched and shook hands with each of the women and your names she repeated looking directly at joanna whose hand shed just shaken joanna stuttered for a moment desperately searching for some rational way to decide whether to use her real name or her alias prudence she blurted out remembering they were trespassing georgina deborah quickly mimicked nice to meet you two cindy said i suppose youve come for a tour joanna and deborah exchanged yet another rapid glance although now out of auspicious surprise rather than panic wed love a tour deborah said we were so mesmerized by the door we had to see what was in here deborah gestured selfconsciously at the stainlesssteel door im not accustomed to giving tours cindy said with a selfdeprecating laugh but ill give it my best shot here in this room which by the way was the old pantry for the kitchen back in the cabot days we have the eggs ready for nuclear transfer tomorrow they will be going up to the lab in the dumbwaiter which is just around the corner theyre in the incubators with the red tags we use a colorcoding system down here the incubators with the blue tags are the fused cells which will be going back into the embryo room what kind of eggs are they deborah asked i mean what species human eggs of course cindy said all of them yes the animal eggs are handled in the animal culture room down at the farm where do so many human eggs come from deborah asked they come from what we call the organ room cindy said can we see deborah asked of course cindy said just follow me cindy gestured toward the archway through which shed arrived and motioned for the women to follow joanna and deborah fell in behind her what luck to run into her deborah whispered leaning her head close to joannas this is almost too easy youre right joanna whispered back it is too easy shes being too gracious i dont like it if it were up to me wed leave now oh for gods sake deborah complained always the cynic lets enjoy our good fortune find out what we can and then split after passing through several rooms of proportions and contents similar to the first room they came to a room considerably larger behind a row of incubators was a bank of more than fifty aged wooden doors each about three feet square with heavy latches like meat refrigerators deborah hesitated excuse me cindy she pointed toward the timeworn doors are these what they look like cindy stopped on her way into an even larger room beyond she followed deborahs pointing finger are you asking about those old ice compartments was this area the morgue in the buildings former life deborah asked it was indeed cindy said she walked back and with a bit of effort rolled one of the large incubators to the side to expose the doors she opened one and slid out the wheeled stained wooden tray its interesting isnt it they had to load the ice in the other side i wouldnt have wanted to be down here if they ever ran out of ice can you imagine she laughed uneasily deborah and joanna looked at each other joanna shuddered lets get this visit over with would you like to see the rest of the morgue cindy asked the old autopsy theater with a grandstand is still intact back in the nineteenth century it must have substituted for entertainment out here in the sticks she laughed again this time more hollowly than anxiously in those days it took a whole day to get to boston by carriage and there wasnt much for the staff to do when off duty let me show you cindy took off in a direction opposite to the way shed originally been heading deborah followed after her vainly trying to get her attention joanna took up the rear not wanting to be left behind cindy deborah called quickening her pace wed really rather see the organ room undeterred either not hearing or just ignoring deborah cindy continued on to a set of leathercovered double doors with small oval windows pushing one open she leaned into the darkness and snapped on a light switch the sound was a lowpitched thud and large oldfashioned kettle drum shaped lights came on they were high in the ceiling and acted like spotlights to illuminate an old metal autopsy table joanna whod come up behind deborah took in the scene and caught her breath the setting with the rows of spectator seats rising up into the gloom was even more like the gruesome anatomylesson painting than the operating room upstairs where shed had her procedure this is very interesting deborah said with a sarcastic overtone after taking a quick gander into the room but if you dont mind we much prefer to see the organ room how about checking out the old autopsy tools cindy questioned myself and a couple of the other techs were joking the other day about sending them out to hollywood for a horror movie lets see the organ room joanna stated flatly fine by me cindy said she turned out the light and started along the hall again she glanced at her watch a gesture joanna noted but deborah didnt it was the third time joanna had seen the woman do it deborah was busy looking back the way theyd come isnt the organ room the other way deborah called out to cindy who was a dozen paces ahead we can get to it either way cindy said over her shoulder but this route is shorter as deborah caught up to the others she saw ahead a pair of horizontally oriented doors like dumbwaiter doors in an opening the size of a small garage as the group walked past deborah asked about them thats the old freight elevator cindy said coming to a stop the dead bodies used to come down in it from the upper floors thats a cheery thought joanna commented lets keep moving its actually been handy for us cindy said she tapped the doors appreciatively with her knuckle weve used it to get most of the equipment down here would you like to see how it works wed prefer to see the organ room joanna said i think we know how a freight elevator works fine by me cindy said again after passing through a twentyfootlong narrow vaulted passageway which cindy explained penetrated the foundation support for the buildings italianate tower the women found themselves on the threshold of the largest room theyd seen in the subterranean complex it was at least one hundred feet long and fifty wide in it were row upon row of voluminous plexiglas aquariumlike containers approximately six feet long three deep and two wide each contained multiple glass spheres approximately a foot in diameter that were submerged in fluid from the top of each sphere sprouted a tangle of tubes and electric leads on the surface of the fluid floated a continuous layer of tiny glass spheres for a moment the women just took in the spectacle although the walls of the room were still exposed brick the scene was more like what they had expected when theyd first passed through the stainlesssteel door even the ceiling was higher in this space than in the other rooms due to an absence of the overhead piping and ductwork the lighting was also less harsh but with the addition of an apparent ultraviolet component while deborah was transfixed by the vista joanna caught cindy again checking her watch what made the repeated gesture remarkable to joanna was the womans otherwise apparent hospitality if she were so concerned about the time as suggested by her constantly looking at her watch why was she spending so much of it with them it was a question for which joanna had no immediate answer but it progressively bothered her what exactly are we looking at here deborah asked this is the organ room cindy explained these tanks are constanttemperature water baths the small floating spheres are to keep the bath water from evaporating the larger spheres hold the ovaries so deborah commented youre able to keep entire ovaries alive by i assume perfusing them etcetera thats pretty much the story cindy said weve mimicked their accustomed internal environment with oxygen nutrients and endocrine stimulation of course removing waste products is also important at any rate when we do it right the ovaries are constantly ovulating mature oocytes can we see closer deborah asked cindy gestured ahead by all means deborah walked down an aisle between two rows of the tanks and stopped to gaze within one of the spheres the contained ovary was about the size of a flattened walnut with a ragged pockmarked surface reminiscent of the moon tiny perfusion cannulas were connected to the major ovarian vessels various sensing wires were attached at other points on the small organ we have more traditional cell cultures of oogonia as well cindy said i can show you them if youd like some of these spheres contain two ovaries rather than one deborah said thats true but most are single as you can see how about we move on to the oogonia room what does it mean when there are two ovaries joanna asked thats dr donaldsons department cindy said im just one of the many technicians who monitor and take care of them joanna and deborah exchanged one of their signature glances as familiar as they were with each other each generally could tell what the other was thinking i see each sphere is labeled alphanumerically joanna said does that mean you know the origin of each ovary for the first time during their visit cindy appeared clearly uncomfortable with the question she hemmed and hawed and again tried to change the subject back to the oogonia cultures but joanna was insistent we have a vague idea of each ovarys origin cindy admitted finally what does vague mean joanna persisted if i were to give you a name of an ovarian donor could you locate the ovary i believe so cindy said evasively she looked at her watch and switched her weight from one foot to the other the name im interested in is joanna meissner joanna said joanna meissner cindy repeated she glanced around the area as if unfamiliar where things were located wed need a computer workstation theres one right behind you joanna said oh indeed cindy said as if surprised she turned unlocked the keyboard with her password then typed in joannas name the screen flashed back jm cindy scribbled the code on a scrap of paper and then set off the women followed behind two rows over and two tanks down she stopped and pointed jm was written on the glass spheres surface with an indelible marker both joanna and deborah stared in at the small organ it was significantly more pockmarked than the first one theyd seen and joanna asked about it its one of our older specimens cindy explained its nearing the end of its useful life i have a donors name deborah said kristin overmeyer okay cindy said agreeably as if reconciled to the situation she retraced her steps back to the computer workstation having recovered her previous poise she typed in the name without hesitation and the computer immediately produced the code ko this way cindy said waving for the women to follow she skirted the periphery of the room before turning into the first row joanna held deborah back and whispered i know what you are thinking its a good thought deborah merely nodded here we are cindy said almost proudly stopping at a specific tank she pointed at the middle glass sphere ko its a double specimen interesting deborah said after a quick glance the specimen has a lower number than the previous one but looks younger how can that be cindy glanced in at the two ovaries it was apparent she was flustered again she stuttered a moment before saying thats something i know nothing about maybe it has to do with the way the specimens are taken but i really dont know im sure dr donaldson would be able to explain it i have one more name deborah said rebecca corey are you sure you people wouldnt like to see the oogonia cultures cindy asked we feel thats the arena where we have made the biggest advances the oogonia cultures are soon going to make these full ovary cultures passe this is the last name deborah promised then well move on to the oogonia cultures after another check of her watch cindy repeated the procedure for getting the code number she then led them to the tank immediately adjacent to the one containing kristin overmeyers ovaries and pointed at the appropriate sphere once again it was a double specimen both joanna and deborah peered in at the ovaries which like kristins appeared younger than joannas both women trembled with the realization that they were looking at the ovaries of a woman who was supposed to have disappeared along with kristin overmeyer after picking up a hitchhiker the oogonia culture room is immediately adjacent cindy said how about we head over there joanna and deborah simultaneously raised their eyes from the ovaries and looked at each other the horror reflected in their eyes made it instantly apparent they shared the same thoughts they had uncovered significantly more than theyd envisioned and it was terrifying as well as horrifying i think weve already taken too much of your time joanna said she gave cindy a crooked smile its true deborah chimed in its been interesting but its time we moved on maybe you could point us in the right direction toward the entrance and well get out of your hair ive plenty of time cindy said quickly its no problem trust me ive enjoyed the break in my routine and i think you should see the whole setup before you go come on well see the oogonia cultures she tried to take deborahs arm but deborah pulled free we want to leave deborah said more emphatically youll be missing the most significant part cindy said i have to insist like hell youll insist deborah spat were outta here well find our own way joanna said she started back the way theyd come although she knew it might not be the shortest route from what cindy had said earlier she didnt care at least shed be passing recognizable landmarks i cant let you wander in here by yourselves cindy stated its against the rules she grabbed joannas arm with more force than shed used with deborah pulling joanna to a stop joanna looked down at the womans hand clasped around her arm were leaving she said assertively take your hands off me i cant let you be in here unattended cindy repeated then take us to the exit deborah snapped she snatched cindys hand from joannas arm and pushed the woman back where she stumbled against one of the plexiglas containers the slight jolt set off a beeping alarm along with a flashing red light at the tanks control panel when cindy reached for the button to disengage the alarm joanna and deborah took off running as fast as the narrow row between the tanks would allow when they broke free of the tanks deborahs athleticism came to the fore and she passed joanna urging her on behind they could hear cindy cry out for them to stop i knew we shouldnt have come in here joanna panted trying to keep up with deborah shut up and run they ran through the arched tunnel past the old freight elevator and darkened autopsy pit and into the series of rooms with the incubators suddenly deborah stopped joanna had all she could do to keep from bumping into her which way deborah demanded i think that way joanna said pointing due south through a succession of archways i hope youre right deborah said they could hear the echoes of cindy approaching and calling their names but the echoes made it impossible to tell the direction a second later she appeared at a run from around an archway and collided with them she grabbed onto joannas and deborahs clothes as best she could good god woman deborah cried with significant force she ripped herself free of the womans grasp only to have the woman use both hands to clench joanna deborah swung around behind cindy and grabbing her around the chest pulled her free from joanna then with a slight twisting motion she threw cindy to the floor where the woman hit up against one of the incubators the unmistakable but muffled sound of breaking glass came from within without waiting to check on the womans condition deborah grabbed joannas hand and dashed in the direction joanna had suggested to their relief after theyd passed through several arches they caught sight of the stainlesssteel door quickly running up to it deborah slapped the openclose panel the door began its painstaking glide to the left both women glanced over their shoulders in fear that cindy was on her way and she was turning back to the door deborah tried vainly to speed its movement with muscle power the moment the gap was wide enough to squeeze through deborah propelled joanna to the opening so that deborah could deal with cindy oh no joanna cried as she pulled back after starting through the widening crack of the door deborah whod momentarily turned to check how close cindy was spun around to see what had caused joannas cry and halted her progress out of the room what she saw over joannas shoulder brought an involuntary cry to her own lips two large smirking men dressed in black were coming toward them through the dilapidated but now lighted kitchen they had handcuffs in one hand guns in the other the blond man in the lead seeing the door opening and seeing the women had started to run deborah recognized him it was the man who had been leering at her in the dining room and who she assumed was the security chief eighteen may o pm deborah responded by instinct again slapping her hand against the raised openclose button closing the heavy steel door in the face of the onrushing men at the same time she was assaulted by cindy from behind who grabbed her around the neck and tried to pull her away from the door deborah resisted keeping the button depressed get this banshee off me deborah cried cindy was screaming that the door had to be opened joanna peeled cindys fingers from around deborah and shoved her stumbling backward but the woman quickly recovered and lunged back at deborah joanna hold the damn button deborah yelled while fending cindy off with one hand as soon as joanna had the panel depressed deborah brought both hands to bear on the persistent technician although deborah had not hit anyone since clocking a bratty male fellow fifthgrader she hauled off and punched cindy on the left cheek after four years of varsity lacrosse deborah was significantly stronger and more of an aggressor than shed been in the fifth grade and the blow stunned cindy into sudden silence and immobility a second later she sagged to the floor in slow motion first sinking to her knees and then sloshing prostrate like a melting ice cream cone deborah cried out from the pain in her hand which she flapped wildly for a moment forcing herself to regain control she grabbed the nearest incubator and rolled it over to the door joanna immediately comprehended what deborah had in mind and helped guide the incubator so that its weight continued to depress the button which both women recognized was keeping the door closed to be sure the incubator wouldnt move joanna and deborah continued to hold on to it to maintain its position whats your plan joanna demanded in a panicked forced whisper the only way out is the dumbwaiter or the freight elevator what do you think the freight elevator joanna we know exactly where it is and we know well fit a few paces away cindy pushed herself up into a uncertain semisitting position she had a blank unfocused expression in her eyes like a boxer hit too many times all right deborah said after casting one last glance at cindy who was now struggling to get to her feet lets do it both let go of the incubator in unison and made a dash back through the maze of rooms unfortunately they made a wrong turn and ended up in a blank room they had to retrace their steps before getting back on track behind them they heard the unmistakable sound of an incubator clunking up against another followed by deepthroated shouts by the men heaven help us if that freight elevator is not running deborah managed between gasps they rounded the final bend ran past the doors to the autopsy theater and literally collided with the freightelevator doors a heavy canvas strap protruded through the chesthigh horizontal gap deborah grabbed it first but joanna lent a hand as well with their combined weight the doors gave way with the lower door opening downward while the upper door rose when the gap between the two doors was large enough the two women climbed in the elevator itself was a heavy wiremesh cage eight feet square to the right at chest height was a control panel with six buttons the floor was made of rough wooden planking above the supporting cables disappeared up into blackness the only light was coming from the hallway through the open doors in the near distance heavy footsteps could be heard running toward them and closing quickly the doors deborah yelled as she reached up and grabbed the canvas strap attached to the inside edge of the upper door joanna reached up and grabbed it as well once again with their combined weight the women succeeded in getting the heavy doors to move slowly at first and then with increasing speed they began to close but before they did the men arrived outside a hand was thrust between the narrowing gap and grabbed a handful of deborahs doctors coat yanking it back through just as the doors came together and thrust the women into blackness with her hands still grasping the canvas strap deborah felt herself roughly hauled against the door hit one of the buttons deborah screeched to joanna without taking her weight off the strap she could feel someone outside was now trying to open the doors but to do so they would have to lift deborah in the process like a blind person joanna groped for the control box shed caught a glimpse of before the closing doors had extinguished the light hurry god damn it deborah yelled she could feel herself being lifted off the planking frantically joanna widened her blind search over the surface of the wire mesh finally her hand knocked against the control box in the blackness she pushed the first button her fingers encountered a highpitched screeching sound erupted like chickens being tortured and with a lurch the old freight elevator began to rise deborah let go of the strap shed been gripping and falling to her knees and twisting she managed to yank her arms free of the doctors coat which was still caught between the closed freight elevator doors a second later with an agonizing tearing and crushing sound deborah felt the coat disappear into the narrow gap between the front lip of the rising elevator and the stone elevator shaft wall what the hell was that noise joanna demanded through gasps for breath deborah shuddered in the darkness she knew the crushing sound could have been her body had she not gotten out of the coat she too gasped for breath it was my flashlight and car keys being crushed in my doctors coat weve lost our car keys joanna moaned with her chest heaving thats the least of our worries at the moment deborah managed thank god this elevator worked those men almost got us i mean that couldnt have been any closer joannas flashlight snapped on she shined it at the control box the button that was depressed was the third floor what should we do joanna asked tensely were heading for the third floor should we see if we can change that this is hardly a highspeed elevator deborah complained the third floor is probably better than certainly the first and maybe even the second i dont want to run into those men again obviously joanna said with her breathing coming under a semblance of control it was her turn to shudder now we have proof this place is capable of murder and they probably know we know and that cindy bitch knew the men were coming the whole time we were in there thats why she was being so nice to us we should have suspected something was wrong the minute she offered a tour whats wrong with us thats all easy to say now deborah said still panting we were under the delusion they were violating ethics here not commandments murder for eggs makes this a completely different ball game we have to get out of here true deborah said but without car keys were not driving anyplace at least not in our own car i think our best bet is to get to a telephone in the wingate clinic on the first or second floor the problem is thats probably what they are expecting joanna said at least thats what i would expect if i were them what do you say about hiding for a time to give ourselves a chance to think what we should do and come up with a plan maybe we should hide until morning deborah suggested my guess would be that a very small minority of the people who work here know what they are really doing and if they did theyd be as horrified as we are we could approach someone for help my guess is that they are going to search until they find us tonight weve got to get out of here but how those men had guns for chrissake thats why we have to find someplace to hole up we have think we cant be rash the one thing in our favor is the size of this building and the fact that its so cluttered with stuff deborah said theres got to be safe places to hide for a time unless they call in a lot of help its going to take them most of the night to search with any thoroughness exactly joanna said my guess is that theyll do a rapid superficial search and if that proves futile theyll go back for a complete one by then we have to be out of here or well be caught deborah shook her head and took an uncertain breath im sorry i brought us out here its all my fault this is no time for recriminations joanna said and just for the record you didnt make me come here i came here on my own accord thanks deborah murmured joanna switched off the flashlight i think wed better let our eyes adjust to the darkness we cant be running around with the light on youre right deborah managed trying to get a hold of herself a few minutes later with a final jolting screech the elevator stopped pure silence returned in a smothering rush the women leaped to the door as quickly as they could they got it open only to be confronted by an impenetrable wall of darkness theres no choice ive got to turn on the light joanna said the click sounded loud in the silence she rapidly ran the beam around the small windowless room it was the freight elevator vestibule with a wide double door theyll quickly figure out the elevator is here on the third floor deborah said so theyll be here soon lets find a stairwell and get up to the top floor thats where we should find a place to hide until we figure out what were going to do agreed deborah pulled open one of the doors to the corridor and joanna stepped through quickly joanna beamed the light up and down the hall even though she was now forewarned about all the medical paraphernalia cluttering the old hospital she was still taken aback by the scene she hadnt expected to see framed prints still on the walls nor a laundry cart with folded sheets still on its shelves its like there was a fire drill and everybody ran out and then never came back she said theres an exit sign deborah said pointing toward the south that must be a stairwell lets go joanna kept her hand over the flashlight lens she wanted to limit the light to just what she and deborah needed to avoid the gurneys supply carts and old wheel chairs they moved quickly arriving at the stairwell deborah cracked open the door for a second they listened all was quiet come on deborah urged pushing into the stairwell they started up the stairs at a run but slowed immediately because of the noise they were making the stairs were metal and reverberated like kettle drums in the confined space they got only as far as the intermediate landing before both women froze in place theyd heard a door somewhere below burst open and slam against the wall joanna recovered enough to switch off her flashlight in the next instant booming footfalls resounded against the metal treads accompanied by a flickering glow that filtered up the stairwell one of the men was running up the stairs clutching a flashlight joanna and deborah edged to the rear of the landing and pressed themselves up against the bare brick as the sounds and light rising from below rapidly reached a crescendo simultaneously one of the men in black appeared on the thirdfloor landing more than twenty feet away he was so close to the women that labored breathing was clearly audible luckily he did not look up but rather concentrated on getting into the thirdfloor corridor and down to the freight elevator as quickly as possible the instant the stairwell door closed behind the man joanna and deborah restarted their climb to the fourth floor too scared switch on the light they had to move slowly by feel while the struggled against succumbing to their renewed panic the fourth floor landing was particularly difficult to navigate in the darkness due to stacks of empty cardboard cartons once they were in the fourthfloor corridor joanna again switched on the light keeping her hand over the lens they started out heading north and moving as fast as the cluttered hall allowed both instinctively felt that the farther they were from the part of the building occupied by the wingate clinic the safer they would be they also tried to be as quiet as possible on the aged wooden flooring in deference to the man searching for them on the floor directly below they reached the fire door leading to the tower without discussion they traversed the tower and passed through the opposite fire door into the north wing except for an occasional creak of a floorboard they were silent each consumed by her own fears the wards in the north wing were a mirror image of those in the south wing arranged lengthwise along either side of a central corridor each ward was separated from its immediate neighbor by side rooms and each ward had twenty to thirty beds most of the beds were covered with bare mattresses although a few also had motheaten blankets any ideas about where we should hide joanna whispered nervously not yet deborah said i suppose we could climb into cabinets in one of the many storage rooms but that might be too easy we dont have a lot of time unfortunately i think youre right deborah said she directed joanna to shine the light into the room between the last two wards on the northwest corner of the building instead of being a storage room like most of the others it had been set up as a minor procedure room with an iron examining table and a sink the opposite wall had a large glassfronted instrument cabinet pushing through a connecting door they found a small storage room for linens and dressings along with a large oldfashioned sterilizer deborah quickly went over to the sterilizer and while joanna held the light on it she pulled its door it resisted at first but then slowly creaked open what about this deborah asked the sterilizer was about three feet in diameter and about five feet deep joanna shined the light inside there were a number of stainless steel boxes sitting on a metal grate only one of us would fit even if we took the stuff out joanna said and even that would be a squeeze i guess youre right deborah said she let go of the sterilizer and hurried over to the connecting door leading to the end ward joanna followed her with the light continuing to keep the lens mostly covered when deborah pushed open the door joanna turned out the flashlight a meager amount of moonlight filtered in through the windows enough to illuminate the larger objects in the room the ward was the same size and decor as the others but differed by having in it a sixfootlong horizontal cylinder mounted on legs it stood about waist height in place of one of the beds lining the interior wall of the room now theres a possibility deborah exclaimed what that cylinder deborah said pointing at the large object remember reading about them they were called iron lungs and were used for people who couldnt breathe like patients in the nineteenfifties with infantile paralysis the women walked as quickly as they could through the dark ward and approached the oldfashioned ventilator it had appeared light gray but as they got closer they could tell it was yellow along its sides were small round glass viewports the end facing out into the ward was hinged and contained a central black rubber collar to fit around a patients head to make a seal just above the collar was a small mirror oriented at a fortyfivedegree angle below the collar was a platform for the patients head while deborah unlatched the front cover joanna nervously glanced around she was concerned about too much time passing they needed a hiding place and they needed it sooner rather than later as deborah pushed the iron lungs door open it squeaked but not as loudly as the sterilizer shine the light in deborah said deborah we cant be fooling around here joanna complained shine the light in deborah repeated the moment joanna did as deborah suggested a distant fire door banged against a wall followed by the flickering of a flashlight beam out in the main corridor oh god joanna voiced she turned off the light well this has got to do deborah said were hiding in here she grabbed a side chair from between the beds and shoved it under the front lip of the iron lung she gripped joannas arm quick you first and feet first the play of flickering light increased in intensity through the open doorway to the main corridor quick deborah repeated with some reluctance but feeling she had little choice joanna climbed up on the chair holding on to the upper edge of the cylinders rim she got one foot inside with deborah supporting her backside she got the other one in as well she then slid her body in deborah grabbed the chair and returned it to where shed found it where are you going joanna demanded in a whisper when deborah disappeared from her view deborah didnt answer but reappeared almost instantly ive got to get in without the chair she said it would be too much of a giveaway using the strut between the iron lungs two front legs as the first step deborah rose up so her chest was above the iron lungs top finding a narrow toehold in the top of the leg where it was welded to the iron lungs body she draped herself over the top then by swinging around she was able to get her feet into the cylinders opening but then she ran into trouble she couldnt figtire out how to get the rest of her body in without falling to the or even if joanna tried to hold onto her legs this is not going to work deborah said she twisted to thee and dropped back to the floor youve got to hurry joanna rasped in a whisper the light in the hall was brighter still and was now accompanied by voices it was the two men coming all the way to the end of the corridor deborah stuck as much of her upper body head first into the iron lung as she could grab onto me and pull she told joanna out of desperation with a little leap and joannas help deborah managed to get herself into the iron lung but not without scraping the front of her thighs and shins on the front lip of the metal cylinder she had to claw herself into the depths because of the tightness of the space the two women ended up on their sides pressed against each other head to toe try to close the door as much as you can deborah whispered from the recesses of the ventilator joanna reached out and grabbed the rubber collar and pulled the door slowly began to close but as soon as it squeaked she stopped it was none too soon a flashlight beam came into the room and moved about for a brief moment the beam came directly inside the iron lung through the three glass side ports on the side facing the door then the beam dropped and arced around the room beneath the beds searching out the recesses both women involuntarily held their breaths one of the men quickly walked up and down the center of the ward passing within ten feet of the halfopen iron lung not once but twice he was bent over and swinging the light from side to side beneath the beds to illuminate their undersides particularly up under the heads and along the sides of the intervening tables see anything the man suddenly shouted causing both women to start from the ward across the hall the other man answered with a negative a moment later the man whod come into the womens ward could be heard in the connecting room rapidly slamming open cabinets and cursing loudly the flicker of his flashlight could still be seen by deborah through one of the viewports until he moved beyond the procedure room and on into the next ward almost in unison the women let the air out of their lungs and took in deep breaths for deborah it was hardly fresh that was almost as close as the freight elevator joanna whispered they must be sweeping the building as you suggested deborah said lets stay put for a while in case he comes back joanna said and wed better start thinking about what were going to do to get ourselves out of here time dragged by especially for deborah who began to feel claustrophobic wedged down in the base of the narrow cylinder designed for one person for her the situation was hardly conducive to thought the smell of the old bare mattress was ripe and the dust bothersome on several occasions it took sheer will for her merely to avoid sneezing eventually she began to perspire and experience a progressive shortness of breath after almost a half hour deborah couldnt take it any longer have you heard anything or seen any lights she asked the only light ive seen has been some flickering through the windows joanna said theres a light outside that wasnt there before nothing inside the building not a thing joanna said ive got to get out of here deborah admitted push open the door and try to do it without making any noise joanna pushed on the door it swung almost fully open without making a sound im coming out deborah said if i put my hand someplace youd rather i didnt ill apologize in advance with a lot of wriggling and grunting deborah managed to ease herself back out of the iron lung her eyes scanned the room noticing that the ambient light had increased as joanna had mentioned then she mopped her forehead with the back of her hand and ran her fingers through her damp shoulderlength hair she felt bedraggled and exhausted yet she knew the night was still young with more trials ahead in her minds eye she could picture the razorwiretopped fence and she knew that even if they managed to get out of the building leaving the premises was not going to be easy how about getting that chair joanna said oh sorry deborah said shed been distracted by her worries she dragged the chair over to the mouth of the iron lung did you come up with any ideas about getting out of here joanna asked as she extracted herself from the ventilator i didnt deborah confessed jammed in that tube the way i was i couldnt think what about you something did occur to me joanna said the power plant could be the way to get out of this building how so deborah asked if theyre creating heat over there to heat this building its got to get here joanna said theres got to be a tunnel youre right deborah said i noticed that the freight elevator control had six buttons joanna said i hadnt given it any thought until i started thinking about a tunnel this building must have a subbasement maybe that should be our goal the more i think about our trying to get to a phone in the wingate clinic the more risky i think it would be but i havent seen access to a subbasement deborah said there wasnt any in the stairwell we used tonight when we got here or the one i used this afternoon lets check out the freight elevator joanna said we cant use that deborah said its too noisy im not talking about using the elevator itself joanna explained usually they have a ladder in elevator shafts i dont know why i guess for maintenance where did you learn this deborah questioned she was impressed its thanks to carlton joanna explained mindless action movies are his favorite and at one time or another ive had to suffer through watching most of them thereve been dozens of scenes in elevator shafts i suppose its worth a check deborah said do you think weve waited long enough theres no way to know for sure but since we cant stay here all night we have to do it sometime let me check the hall all right you do that deborah said i want to see what this extra light is coming through the front windows while joanna cautiously made her way over to the archway leading out into the corridor deborah crossed the ward bending over at the waist to keep her head down deborah approached one of the windows slowly she raised her eyes above the sill and found herself staring into multiple automobile headlights positioned to illuminate the building although the cars were at a considerable distance down the lawn deborah quickly ducked out of sight to be sure not to be spotted shed caught a glimpse of several uniformed guards silhouetted against the lights they had large dogs on leashes the two men in black had called in reinforcements deborah quickly joined joanna who was waiting for her at the archway and told her what shed seen dogs are not good joanna said gravely these people really mean business i think we already knew that deborah said it also means leaving the building underground is suddenly a necessity joanna said she then opened her mouth to tell deborah the main corridor was clear when the sound of a bullhorn coming from outside startled her nineteen may am meissner and deborah cochrane a voice echoed against the front of the building there is no need to extend this charade dont make us come into the building with dogs which we will do if you dont come out on your own accord the bookford police are on their way i repeat come out immediately so much for our carefully crafted aliases deborah said if i thought theyd turn us over to the bookford police id walk out of here in a heartbeat theyre not going to turn us over to anyone deborah said thats my point joanna said come on lets check out the freight elevator before i lose my nerve gaining some familiarity with the building the women retraced their route back through the fourth floor to the stairwell theyd used earlier at first they tried to descend without turning on the flashlight but quickly realized the risk of knocking some of the unseen debris down the stairs was greater than the risk presented by the shielded flashlight they turned it off again before they entered the thirdfloor corridor while in the corridor they heard the bullhorn message again they had to turn the light on again in the freight elevator vestibule the elevator was exactly the way they had left it with the doors half open joanna shined the light into the car through the wiremesh of its back wall a ladder was visible attached to the brick of the elevator shaft you were right about there being a ladder deborah said but how do you get to it joanna moved the light beam to the side wall of the elevator attached to the cabs wall were ladder rungs the rungs led up to a wiremesh trapdoor in the elevators ceiling all we have to do is climb to the top of the elevator joanna said is that all deborah questioned sarcastically where are you finding this sudden chutzpah im pretending im you joanna said so lets do it before i revert back to me deborah gave a short derisive laugh the women stepped over the halfopen lower elevator door joanna held the light while deborah climbed the ladder rungs while holding on to the top one she pushed up the trapdoor just beyond ninety degrees it hit up against a stop and stayed open joanna handed up the flashlight and deborah placed it on top of the elevator before hauling herself up the elevator swayed slightly when she stood up forcing her to grab the supporting cables which were covered with grease the consistency of petroleum jelly a moment later joanna came up through the hole she stayed on her hands and knees rather than standing up the ladder ran along the back wall of the shaft and cleared the elevator car by only twelve inches well what do you think deborah asked i think we should give it a try joanna said she shined the flashlight down the shaft it wasnt strong enough to reach the bottom the ladder merely disappeared into a murky haze you first deborah said and you keep the light im not going to be able to climb and hold the light at the same time i know deborah said but you have a pocket and i dont okay joanna said with resignation she was accustomed to deborahs being the leader in such a circumstance joanna turned out the light plunging them into utter blackness she pocketed the flashlight then groped for the ladder when she got a hold of it she had to argue with herself to abandon the relative safety of the elevator especially when the elevator swayed slightly during the transition gripping the rung of the ladder tightly with both hands she tried not to think about being suspended on a vertical ladder four stories above a black hole are you doing okay deborah whispered in the dark when she didnt hear any movement this is harrowing joanna said are you on the ladder yes joanna said but im afraid to move you have to joanna lowered one foot to the next rung and then the other what she had more difficulty with was letting go with one hand finally she did it and then repeated the movement with the other hand slowly at first and then with building confidence she descended between the elevator and the ladder it was a tight fit which made the process more difficult can you give me a little light so i can see where the ladder deborah asked from above i cant joanna said i cant let go for that long deborah mumbled a few choice words as she reached blindly with one hand while maintaining the grip on the i cable with the other but the ladder was too far away eventually sat had to go down on all fours like joanna and creep over to the e of the elevators cab finally she got a hold of the ladder transfer herself onto it and followed joanna down the women moved slowly particularly joanna although she began to build up confidence a new concern emerged from feel corrosion on the rungs she began worrying that one of the rungs might have become so weakened from rust that it could give way under her weight before she put her weight on any rung she kicked at it to get an idea of its integrity the blackness of the shaft aided joanna especially after passing below the elevator cab without being able to see the height was only a mental problem not a visual one deborah had to slow herself down when she caught up with joanna after a quarterhour of climbing deborah was ready to reconnoiter can you see the bottom she questioned in a whisper the muscles of her arms were beginning to complain and she imagined joannas were as well you must be joking joanna answered i cant even see my nose maybe you should shine the light for a second you could hook your arm around one of the rungs i think i should just keep going until my foot touches the floor joanna said do you want to rest i really think i should keep going another ten minutes passed before joannas outstretched foot touched litterstrewn pavement she pulled her foot back were here she said hold up hooking her arm in a rung as deborah had suggested earlier she got out the flashlight and turned it on the bottom of the shaft was filled with debris as if it had been a garbage dump over the years can you tell if were at the subbasement or not deborah asked i cant joanna said come on down and well see if we can get the doors open joanna used her foot to push away some of the trash at the ladders base before stepping onto the pavement she waited for deborah to come the rest of the way down keeping her hand over the flashlight lens wow its freezing down here deborah said rubbing her arms once she got off the ladder it certainly feels like a subbasement the women gingerly made their way to the doors through the junk which was mostly paper rags and miscellaneous pieces of wood interspersed with a few cans while joanna held the light deborah reached up and got her fingers between the upper and lower doors try as she might they wouldnt open joanna put the light down on the floor and lent a hand still the doors wouldnt so much as budge this is not good joanna said deborah picked up the light and took a step back she shined the light around the periphery of the doors she stopped at a springloaded lever arm protruding out from the wall at the edge of the doors just above where they came together thats our problem deborah said i havent seen too many action movies but that has to be a failsafe mechanism to keep the doors locked until the elevator is in front of the doors meaning joanna questioned meaning one of us has to hold it down while the other opens the doors youre taller joanna said you get the failsafe mechanism ill try the doors a moment later the doors cracked open although it wasnt until joanna leaned her full weight on the lower door that they opened fully deborah shined the light into the space beyond its a subbasement all right joanna said the entire floor was just intersecting supporting arches through which ran a tangle of clay sewer pipes and insulated castiron heating pipes there were no doors or separate rooms the walls were brick like the basement above but the arches were flatter and the adjoining piers thicker a passageway with a vaulted ceiling higher than the rest of the subbasement led from the freight elevator to intersect with a similar corridor that ran the length of the building bare electrical wire looped along the peak of the vault to lighting fixtures but they were not lit the women stopped at the intersection and shined the light in both directions in each direction the view was a study in perspective with the arches marching off into the darkness as far as the meager light was able to penetrate which way joanna questioned id favor going left deborah said that will take us toward the tower section of the building thats the center but if we go right were going more in the direction of the power plant joanna said the power plant is off to the southeast she pointed fortyfive degrees off the axis of the main corridor how are we going to decide deborah asked looking in both directions shine the light on the floor joanna said she knelt down the floor of the passageway from the freight elevator as well as the main corridor was paved in clay tiles whereas the rest of the subbasement was paved in the same brick as the walls and arched ceiling theres definitely more evidence of traffic going to the right joanna said the tile shows a lot more wear in that direction which not only suggests to me the tunnel is to the right but also that the tunnel was used for a lot more than just heat my word deborah commented looking down i think youre on to something is this another trick you learned from watching those action movies with carlton no this is just common sense thanks a lot deborah said sarcastically the women commenced walking rapidly to the south deborah kept the flashlight trained ahead their footsteps echoed off the concave ceiling this is like a catacomb down here joanna commented perhaps i shouldnt ask but what were you thinking when you suggested the tunnel was used for more than heat it occurred to me that the tunnel was probably the way they transported dead bodies from the morgue to the crematorium now theres a cheerful thought deborah said uh oh joanna voiced maybe we spoke too soon it looks like our footworn corridor is coming to an end about thirty feet directly ahead the flashlight beam illuminated a blank brick wall were okay deborah said after theyd taken a few more steps the trail is just turning to the left when the women reached the wall they noticed that not only did the vaulted corridor take an abrupt lefthand turn around an arched pier but it also fell away relatively steeply also joining the descending corridor was a largediameter insulated pipe thanks to your sleuthing i think were on our way to the power plant deborah said as they began their descent now we just have to hope these batteries hold out good grief joanna exclaimed dont even suggest such a thing with a new worry of being lost underground in utter darkness the women picked up their pace to the point of practically jogging after several hundred yards the tunnel leveled out and became significantly more damp there were even occasional puddles and stalactitic formations hanging from the arched ceiling i feel like were halfway to boston deborah said shouldnt we be there already that power plant was farther away than it looked joanna said becoming winded the women hurried along in silence each harboring an unspoken worry about what they would face at the other end a locked stout door would spell disaster by forcing them back the way theyd come i see something up ahead deborah said she extended the light at arms distance as they walked a few moments later the women found themselves at an unexpected juncture the corridor and the heating pipe bifurcated the women stopped figuratively scratching their heads deborah shined the flashlight into both tunnels they appeared identical and all three tunnels intersected at approximately the same degree angle i wasnt expecting this joanna said nervously deborah shined the light at the corner between the tunnel they were in and the new tunnel to their left set into the brick at chest height was a cornerstone of granite using the heel of her hand she rubbed off a layer of mold beneath which were incised letters okay deborah said with renewed enthusiasm one mystery is solved the tunnel to the left goes to the farm living quarters which means the other one must go to the power plant of course joanna affirmed now that i look the pipe heading to the power plant is definitely a larger diameter wait a second deborah said reaching out and restraining joanna whod already started in the direction of the power plant with a choice here maybe we should think for a minute which might be a better destination assuming were going to be able to get aboveground at either location i think we dont even suggest that were not going to be able to get out joanna snapped okay okay deborah soothed lets think where wed rather be at the power station or at the farm once were out of the hospital building our problem has become getting off the grounds maybe being at the farm would be the best idea they probably get delivery trucks there like we saw the other day on a regular basis i thought we decided we have to get off the premises tonight joanna said that would be best but we have to have some alternatives in case we cant manage it i still think if we dont get off tonight well be caught do you have any ideas considering the razorwire fence i think our only chance is going through the gate if we could get a vehicle particularly a truck maybe we could just smash through hmm thats an idea deborah said so where do we have the best chance of getting a vehicle with its keys i suppose id say the farm joanna said but its just a guess id guess the same thing deborah said lets try the farm at least first with newly found resolve the women set out toward the farm they moved quickly avoiding the puddles as well as they could the puddles had become decidedly more plentiful in this section of the tunnel after only a hundred yards the tunnel bifurcated again another engraved cornerstone directed them to the right for the farm and to the left for the living quarters the women continued on the right fork seeing the sign for the living quarters makes me think of spencer wingate joanna said maybe we should give some thought to approaching him for help deborah stopped and joanna did the same with the flashlight directed downward deborah looked at her roommate joannas eye sockets were lost in shadow are you suggesting we go to spencer wingate yes joanna said we go to his house which were at least familiar with and we tell him what weve uncovered here we also tell him that the security people are trying to hunt us down and possibly add us to their ovary collection deborah let out a short scornful laugh this is a strange time for you to be developing a sick sense of humor at the moment its the only way i can deal with the reality were facing are you basing this idea of putting ourselves in spencer wingates hands on overhearing that argument between him and paul saunders that and his response to you asking him about the nicaraguans joanna said neither one of us thinks spencer truly knows whats going on around here if hes a normal human being hed be as horrified as you and i thats a big if and it would be taking a mighty big risk deborah said weve already taken a lot of risk just being here joanna said deborah nodded and stared off into the darkness joanna was right theyd taken more risk than theyd bargained for but did that justify taking the irreversible risk of going to spencer wingate lets check out the farm deborah said well keep the spencer wingate idea on a back burner at the moment finding some big truck that can take us out of here seems like the best idea to me do you agree i agree joanna said i just think we have to consider all our options to the womens relief the tunnel entered the farm complex the same way it left the hospital building it ran unobstructed into a basement area where the heating pipe splintered off in multiple directions before disappearing up through the ceiling also like the hospital the corridor which was continuous with the tunnel led to a freight elevator but the women did not try to open the elevator doors instead they searched for stairs they found a flight behind the elevator shaft at the door at the top of the stairs the women paused deborah put her ear to it and reported back to joanna only the quiet hum of distant machinery after dousing the light deborah cracked the door slowly the fact that they were in a barn was immediately apparent from the smell all was quiet deborah eased the door open enough to get her head through and take a look around there was a low level of illumination from infrequently spaced bare light bulbs on the ceiling of the postandbeam structure across the way numerous stalls lined the wall three deep to the left were a number of closed doors in between were huge stacks of cardboard boxes bales of hay and sacks of animal feed well joanna whispered from a few steps down the stairs do you see anything there are plenty of animals in the stalls deborah said but no sign of any people at least not yet deborah opened the door and stepped out onto the haystrewn roughplanked floor a few of the animals sensed her presence and grunted bringing others to their feet joanna joined deborah and the two continued to survey the scene so far so good deborah said if they have a night shift they must be sleeping what a smell joanna said i cant imagine how anyone could work in this kind of environment i bet its the pigs deborah said she found herself looking across the room at the beady eyes of a large pinkandwhite sow the pig seemed to be regarding her with great interest somebody told me pigs are clean joanna said theyre clean if theyre kept clean deborah said but pigs dont mind being dirty and their excrement is bad news do you see what i see on the wall behind you joanna questioned she pointed deborah looked over her shoulder and her face lit up a phone the women dashed for the phone deborah got it first and put the receiver to her ear joanna watched her with great anticipation until deborahs expression became one of disgust and she hit the disconnect button several times in a row deborah hung up no deal theyve turned off the phones im not surprised joanna said nor am i deborah admitted lets look for the truck joanna said leaving the stairway door slightly ajar the women skirted the animal feed and the hay and walked to the nearest door deborah opened it and shined in the flashlight my word deborah exclaimed what is it joanna asked trying to see over deborahs shoulder its another laboratory deborah said with amazement she had not expected a laboratory and the transition from a barn to super high tech over a single threshold was dizzying the lab wasnt nearly as large as the one in the hospital but appeared to be almost equally well equipped deborah let go of the door and stepped into the room joanna followed deborah moved her light from one piece of equipment to another seeing such things as dna sequencers a scanning electron microscope and polypeptide synthesizers it was a molecular biologists dream come true shouldnt we be looking for the truck joanna asked in a minute deborah said she walked over to an incubator and looked in at the petri dishes they were the same as shed been using that day in the main lab and she gathered they were doing nuclear transfer here as well then her light caught a large plateglass window dividing a separate room off from the main part of the lab deborah started back toward this room joanna followed to avoid being left in the dark deborah joanna complained youre sidetracking i know deborah said but every time i think i have a general picture of what they are doing at this wingate clinic it turns out they are doing a lot more i didnt expect another lab here at this farm and certainly not one this well equipped its time for professionals joanna pleaded we have enough information to justify a search warrant what we have to do is get ourselves out of here deborah put the lens of the flashlight directly against the plateglass divider to avoid the glare while illuminating the room beyond and heres yet another surprise this looks like a fully operational autopsy room like the ones they use for people but with a very small table what in heavens name is it doing in a barn come on joanna urged with growing irritation just let me check this out deborah said it will only take a second theres a refrigerated compartment like in a morgue joanna rolled her eyes in frustration as deborah pushed through the autopsy rooms door joanna watched through the glass partition as deborah walked over to the compartment and unlatched the door except for the light now coming back out through the glass divider from deborahs flashlight joanna was in the dark she glanced back at the door out of the lab and briefly entertained the idea of searching for a truck on her own but she decided it was foolish without the flashlight mumbling expletives joanna followed deborah into the small autopsy room with the intent of demanding that deborah come to her senses but that goal was quickly forgotten deborah had the tray in the refrigerated compartment pulled out and was transfixed by what was on it joanna couldnt see what it was but she could tell that deborah was trembling by the way she held the light what is it joanna asked come and look deborah said in a quavering voice maybe you should just tell me joanna said remember im not a biologist like you you have to see this deborah said theres no way i could describe it joanna swallowed nervously she took a breath and walked over beside deborah and made herself look down ugh joanna muttered as her upper lip involuntarily pulled back in disgust she was looking at five newborn infants with bloated umbilical vessels and extremely thick dark lanugo the faces were flat and broad and the eyes tiny the noses were mere stubs with the nares oriented vertically their appendages ended in paddlelike extremities with minute digits their heads were crowned with a shock of black hair accentuated with minute but definite white forelocks its paul saunders clones again joanna sneered im afraid so deborah said but with a new twist i think what hes doing down here for his stemcell research is cloning his own cells into pig oocytes and then gestating them in pigs joanna reached out and took a hold of deborahs arm she needed momentary support deborah had been right about the wingate clinic this new discovery indicated that paul saunders and his team were operating a quantum leap beyond the realm of reasonable or even anticipated ethics the egotism and intellectual conceit required were simply beyond joannas comprehension deborah slid the tray back into the refrigerated compartment and slammed the door lets find a damn truck with indignant anger helping to overcome the shock of their recent discovery the women retraced their steps back into the barn proper emerging from the laboratory their presence again caused a stirring among the animals previously it had been mainly the pigs close to the stairway door which had become aroused now it was more generalized with even the cows adding to the growing din the women went from door to door until they found a passageway leading to what they assumed would be a garage but it turned out to be something more with the light from two red exit signs they could see it was a hangar bathed in the ruby glow was an aerospatial turbojet helicopter theres our answer if we could only fly it deborah said she stood for a moment longingly admiring the craft come on joanna urged i think theres a garage beyond this building joanna turned out to be right and when they went through the next door they were rewarded to see a tractor and a dump truck both women headed for the truck keys be there deborah prayed out loud as she mounted the trucks running board and got the door open she swung herself up into the cab frantically her fingers searched for keys while joanna held the light deborah checked along the steering column then along the dash she found the ignition key slot but no keys damn deborah cursed and hit the steering wheel with the heel of her hand i suppose we could hotwire this thing if we only knew how she glanced down at joanna dont look at me joanna said i have no idea not the slightest lets go back to that office we saw in the barn deborah suggested maybe the keys are there deborah climbed out of the truck the women retraced their steps back to the barn giving the helicopter another longing look as they passed through the hangar as they came into the barn proper the animals became even more agitated they must think its meal time deborah commented the women reached the door to the office when they heard the unmistakable sound of a vehicle pulling up outside the barn theyd also caught a glimpse of the headlights briefly coming through the windows of the door as the car turned before coming to a stop oh no were going to have company deborah rasped get back to the stairs joanna cried the women bolted for the stairs but they didnt make it the barn door was rapidly keyed open and a figure burst within the first thing he did was snap on the all the lights catching the women more than twenty feet from their goal all they could do was duck behind the cartons hay bales and feed sacks and hunker down while the man made his rounds among the stalls they could hear him carrying on a continuous monologue with the animals demanding among other things who was the culprit for getting everybody riled up do you think we should try to get to the stairs deborah asked when it sounded as if the man was at a significant distance not unless you can see exactly where he is and whether or not hes adequately preoccupied slowly deborah raised herself until she had a view of the area of the stalls she couldnt see the man although she could still hear him talking to one of the animals then suddenly he stood up and deborah ducked back down hes not as far away as i thought deborah said then wed better stay put joanna said we could cover ourselves with some of this loose hay i think we should just stay still and quiet joanna said we should be okay unless he comes over here to get some of these supplies if he comes over to go in the office we might be in trouble wed just have to inch around the cartons joanna said that shouldnt be so hard and once he was in there wed be able to get to the stairs deborah nodded but she wasnt so confident it would work it was one of those things that sounded easy but would probably be difficult in reality suddenly the women heard the sound of a second vehicle arriving outside they exchanged a worried look one person was enough of a problem and two could be a disaster in the making the newcomer entered and the door banged behind him the women cringed as they heard him yell out for greg lynch hey keep it down greg called from one of the stalls the animals are restless as it is sorry the newcomer said but we have an emergency underway oh were looking for a couple of young women they got in under aliases hacked into the computer files and broke into the egg room now theyre somewhere out here on the premises i havent seen anyone greg said and the barns been locked what are you doing down here at this time of night ive got a sow whos nearing term through the monitor i heard the animals getting restless i thought maybe she was about to deliver but shes okay if you see the women when youre driving back to your place let security know the newcomer said they were over in the main building to start with but weve been through it they walked but they havent been back through the gate so theyre hiding someplace good luck well get them weve got the whole security team out searching including all the dogs and by the way the hardwire phone system is offline until theyre apprehended we dont want them calling out and causing us difficulties no problem greg said ive got my cell phone after the men said their goodbyes the women heard the barn door open and then slam shut this is going from bad to worse deborah whispered it sounds like they are combing the grounds i dont like the idea of dogs after us joanna said you and me both deborah said its a wonder they havent thought of the tunnel we dont know that they havent true deborah said but i have a feeling this fellow who just left would have mentioned it maybe the only way to the subbasement over in the clinic building is via the freight elevator and theyd never guess wed be stupid enough to climb down the ladder do we dare go back down there if theyve got dogs out looking for us i dont think we have a lot of choice fifteen minutes later the women heard greg loudly yawn and sigh then he spoke out as if he were dealing with a clutch of children all right you guys knock it off i want you all to settle down because i dont want to have to come back here tonight with that said greg began to whistle softly the women noticed the sound began to get louder and deborah hazarded a quick glance hes heading for the office deborah whispered urgently following joannas earlier suggestion the women crabbed along the floor in an attempt to keep the stack of supplies between themselves and greg it was an anxious maneuver as deborah had anticipated since they had to do it without looking the man was heading in their general direction once the sound of the office door closing reached them deborahs head popped up okay she whispered when she saw the coast was clear and the two women beelined for the stairway door it wasnt until joanna pulled the door closed that deborah snapped on the flashlight wordlessly they descended the stairs when they reached the bottom joanna motioned for deborah to stop both were mildly out of breath from tension and exertion weve got to decide what we are going to do joanna said speaking softly i thought we were going to the power station my vote is to go to spencer wingate joanna said there were no keys in the truck here at the farm if there were a truck out at the power station theres little guarantee thered be keys in fact common sense would say there wouldnt be and each time we poke our heads above ground we take the risk of being caught i think its time to take the chance with wingate deborah shifted her weight uneasily and chewed the inside of her cheek as she mulled over joannas suggestion she hated making decisions that left no alternative available if spencer wingate were in cahoots with the current wingate clinic hierarchy she and joanna would be sunk it was as simple as that yet their situation had become desperate the moment theyd originally been chased back in the egg room and was now rapidly becoming untenable all right deborah said suddenly lets throw ourselves at spencer wingates mercy for better or for worse youre sure i dont want to feel as if ive talked you into this im not sure of anything other than the fact that im still exercising my free will deborah stuck out her hand and joanna decisively slapped it onward and upward deborah added with a crooked smile the women returned into the heating tunnels with the unspoken concern that they could run into their pursuers at any moment but they reached the branch to the living quarters without incident other than noticing that the flashlight beam was noticeably dimmer approximately a hundred yards beyond the fork they encountered another on this occasion there was no cornerstone to direct them gripes deborah complained she shined the failing light into both tunnels have any ideas id say we go left we know that the village is between the detached housing and the farm so the village would have to be to the right deborah looked at joanna with puzzlement youre impressing me again where has this resourcefulness come from from my traditional houstonian upbringing that youve so shamelessly berated yeah right deborah said scornfully after another five minutes of walking the women came to a series of bifurcations all in a row id guess each of these tunnels are going to individual houses deborah said that would be my guess as well joanna added do you have any strong feeling which we try first i dont joanna said although it makes some sense to take them in order the first basement the women peered into after opening a simple paneled door clearly wasnt spencers since it had been renovated to some degree both women clearly remembered spencers basement from when theyd accompanied him down to his wine cellar backtracking they took the next tunnel this one terminated in a crude roughhewn oak door this looks more promising deborah said she shook the flashlight to encourage the brightness of the beam shed had to do it occasionally over the previous few minutes she handed the light to joanna before giving the door a push it scraped on its granite threshold instead of just pushing deborah tried lifting the door first it then opened with minimal sound deborah took the light back and after giving it a shake shined the faltering beam into the basement beyond the dim light revealed the wine cellar door with its lock still hanging unclasped this is it deborah said lets do it the women navigated the muddy floor to reach the basement steps up they climbed with deborah in the lead at the top of the stairs they hesitated a crack of light showed under the door im thinking we have to play this by ear deborah whispered we dont have any choice joanna said we dont know whether hes even awake do you have any idea of the time not really deborah said i suppose around one well a light is on i suppose that suggests hes still awake lets just try not to scare him too much he might have an alarm that he could push good point deborah said deborah listened through the door before turning the door handle slowly and cracking it open when there was no untoward response she slowly pushed it open revealing progressively more of the kitchen i hear classical music joanna said me too deborah said the women ventured out into the darkened kitchen the light theyd seen beneath the cellar door was coming from the chandelier in the dining room as quietly as they could they moved down the hallway toward the living room and the music with a view of the foyer directly ahead they could see that the corps of toy cavalry soldiers spencer had knocked off the console table the evening before in his drunkenness had been carefully replaced deborah was in the lead with joanna directly at her heels both women were intent on the living room which opened up to the left off the hall and where they expected spencer to be by happenstance joanna glanced to the right as they passed a dark intersecting corridor leading to a study there in the distance was spencer wingate sitting at his desk in a puddle of light from a library lamp he was facing away from the women studying blueprints joanna tapped on deborahs shoulder when deborah turned joanna frantically pointed toward spencers hunched figure deborah looked at joanna and silently mouthed the question what should we do joanna shrugged her shoulders she had no idea but then thought it best if they called out to the man she gestured by touching her mouth and then pointing toward spencer deborah nodded she cleared her throat dr wingate she called but her voice was tentative and it blended seamlessly with the chorus of beethovens ninth symphony emanating from the living room dr wingate joanna called more decisively and loud enough to compete with the music spencers head popped up and shot around for a moment his tanned face blanched and he stood up so quickly his desk chair tipped over with a crash we dont mean to frighten you deborah called out quickly we were hoping we could have a word with you spencer recovered rapidly he smiled with relief when he recognized the women then waved for them to join him as he bent down to right his desk chair the women started for the room both were acutely sensitive to spencers reaction to their presence which so far was auspicious his initial fear had changed to surprise with a hint of reassuring delight as they approached he slicked back his silvered hair and adjusted his velvet smoking jacket but as the women came into the light his expression changed to puzzlement what happened to you two before the women could respond he asked how did you get in here joanna started to explain about coming in through the basement while deborah launched into a capsule of their evening spencer raised his hands hold up one at a time but first do either of you need anything you look terrible for the first time since the ordeal started the women looked at themselves and at each other their appearance brought expressions of embarrassment to their faces deborah had fared the worst with her minidress torn and tattered and abrasions on her thighs and shins from the lip of the iron lung one of her dangling earrings was gone and her tiny heart necklace had lost all its rhinestones her hands were black from the elevator cable grease and her hair was a tangled mess joanna still had on the doctors coat which had protected her clothes to a large degree but the coat itself was a soiled mess particularly from crawling prostrate on the barn floor a few stalks of hay protruded from the pockets deborah and joanna then exchanged one of their knowing glances the combination of their appearances and anxieties brought forth a fit of laughter which took them by surprise and a moment to recover even spencer found himself smiling i wish i knew exactly what you women are laughing at spencer said its a combination deborah managed but probably mostly tension i think its mostly relief joanna said we were hoping youd be here and unsure if youd mind if we dropped by im pleased you came by spencer said what can i get you now that you ask i could use a blanket deborah said im freezing how about some hot coffee spencer said i could make it for you in a moment even something stronger if youd like i could also get you a sweater or a sweatshirt actually wed like to talk right away joanna said theres some urgency involved here she laughed nervously again this blanket right here will do deborah said she picked up a tartan throw from a velvet couch and tossed it around her shoulders well sit down spencer said he gestured toward the couch the women sat spencer grabbed his desk chair and pulled it over he sat across from them whats the urgency spencer asked he leaned forward glancing from one woman to the other the women looked at each other do you want to talk or do you want me to deborah said i dont care joanna responded it doesnt really matter i dont care either deborah said of course you know the biology better than i joanna said true but you can explain about the computer files better wait wait wait spencer said holding up his hands it doesnt matter who does the talking someone start deborah pointed to herself and joanna nodded okay deborah said she looked spencer in the eye do you remember last night when i asked you about the pregnant nicaraguan ladies i do spencer said then he laughed selfconsciously i might not remember too much else about last night but i remember that well we think we know why they are pregnant deborah said we think its to produce eggs spencers face clouded theyre pregnant to produce eggs i think you have to explain deborah took in a lungful of air and gave her explanation following that explanation which she admitted was supposition she went on to say that the wingate clinic was definitely obtaining eggs by an even more unethical and even unlawful manner she explained that the clinic was removing without consent the entire ovaries of unsuspecting women who thought they were only donating a few eggs finally deborah said that at least two women had been murdered because both ovaries had been obtained and the women had never been seen again spencers mouth had slowly dropped open during deborahs monologue when she finished he sat back clearly horrified by what hed heard how did you learn all this he asked with a raspy voice his throat had gone dry before either woman could respond he added i have to get a drink can i get anything for anyone else both deborah and joanna shook their heads spencer stood up on mildly unsteady legs and got himself over to a builtin liquor cabinet he opened it and poured himself a splash of neat scotch he tossed off a portion of it before returning to his chair the women watched him intently and noted the tremor in the hand holding the tumbler were sorry to have to tell you all this joanna said speaking up for the first time as the founder of this clinic to help infertile couples it must be disturbing to hear what has been going on disturbing is putting it mildly spencer said you have to understand that this clinic has been the culmination of my lifes work unfortunately theres more you should know deborah said she went on to describe the cloning and how once again unsuspecting women were being exploited then she told in graphic detail about the chimeric infants being gestated in pigs in the farm which she and joanna had just discovered after this final piece of shocking information deborah fell silent the women watched spencer he was clearly distraught running his fingers repeatedly through his hair and unable for a time to make eye contact he polished off the last of his scotch in a single toss and winced i appreciate your coming to me spencer managed thank you our motivation wasnt entirely altruistic joanna said we need your help spencer lifted his face and stared at joanna what can i do you can get us out of here joanna said the wingate security force is searching for us they have been chasing us since we managed to get into the egg room they have a pretty good idea what we know you want me to get you off the premises spencer said exactly joanna answered weve got to get out through the gate that wont be difficult spencer said well drive out in the bentley we want to make sure you understand exactly how much they want to catch us deborah said i mean this is a very serious situation we cannot be seen im sure theyd stop even you if they suspected i imagine you are right spencer said to make sure there will be no problem you two can squeeze into the trunk its not going to be comfortable by any stretch of the imagination but it would only be for about five minutes or ten at the most joanna looked at deborah deborah nodded ive always wanted to ride in a bentley i suppose the trunk will do joanna rolled her eyes she couldnt understand deborahs motivation for joking at that point i could deal with being in the trunk in fact under the circumstances id probably feel safer in the trunk when do you want to do it spencer asked sooner is probably better than later ive been known to go out for late drives on occasion but anything after two am would be suspicious im all for sooner joanna said im ready right now deborah added lets go spencer said he slapped his thighs as he got up spencer led the women back through the kitchen where he picked up his car keys off the countertop before entering the garage he went directly behind the bentley and keyed open the trunk the women were surprised at the small size its because of the storage for the automatic convertible top spencer explained deborah scratched her head i guess well have to spoon joanna nodded youre biggest so you get in first thanks a lot deborah said she climbed in headfirst and rolled onto her side joanna followed suit bending her body to fit in against deborahs spencer slowly closed the lid to make sure there was no problem with arms and knees and then raised it again its actually more comfortable than the iron lung deborah commented what iron lung spencer asked thats another story deborah said lets get this current chapter over with all right lets go spencer said now dont panic ill stop and let you out as soon as its reasonable okay button it up deborah said cheerfully trying to make the best of a bad situation the trunk lid came down with a thud and an expensivesounding click once again the women were thrust into darkness the next thing they heard was the garage door retracting followed by the car engine starting i guess we should have thought about coming to spencer earlier deborah said we could have saved ourselves some grief the women felt the car back out of the garage do a threepoint turn and then motor down the driveway to the street this is an ignominious way to be leaving this place joanna said at least were leaving i felt rather bad for the good doctor joanna said after theyd driven for a while what we told him certainly took him by surprise they drove in silence for the next few minutes while the women tried to guess where they were eventually they felt the car come to a stop with the engine still going we must be at the gate deborah said shush joanna said the trunk lid was so well insulated that the women couldnt hear anything until the engine revved again and even then it was more vibration than noise after theyd driven a short distance they could tell they were on gravel a few minutes later the car stopped again only this time the engine was turned off youd think he would have driven a bit farther away from the gatehouse joanna said i was thinking the same thing deborah said but hell at least were outside the gate so we might as well ride in style they heard the welcome sound of the key in the trunk lock followed by a poppingup of the trunk cover joanna and deborah looked up and their hearts leaped in their chests spencer was nowhere to be seen instead they were looking up into the sneering faces of the wingate security chief and his henchman epilogue may o am spencer looked out from his office window at the expansive verdant lawn beyond were the spire of bookfords church and a handful of chimneys sticking up through the budding trees it was a pleasant sight and it helped to a degree to calm his roiling emotions he couldnt remember the last time he was quite so overwrought to make it worse hed not slept in more than twentyfour hours and was still recovering from his recent alcoholic debauchery spencer cleared his throat what concerns me is not just what the women knew but how they found out spencer turned from the window and faced paul saunders and sheila donaldson who were calmly sitting in armchairs in front of his desk i mean i was blown away when those two women showed up inside my house especially since you supposedly had a small army looking for them if that doesnt smack of incompetence i dont know what does but more important if those two could find out in one day everything that you people have been doing around here so could someone else spencer calm down paul urged everything is under control under control spencer repeated sarcastically if this is under control i cant imagine what things would have to be like to be out of control he returned to his desk chair and sat down heavily were in full agreement paul said calmly we know we must find out exactly how the women managed to find out what they did they knew about gestating human clones in pigs spencer said you didnt tell me about that last night for chrissake whats that about anyway its to rid us of dependence on the nicaraguan women paul said as soon as weve perfected the technique that will be a major source of new eggs apart from the oogonia cultures well how the hell did they learn about it spencer roared well find out paul said trust me how can you be so confident spencer demanded kurt hermann and his bozos have been grilling those women down in the gatehouse since three am and you admitted yourself five minutes ago theyve learned nothing i beg to differ sheila said ive been doing the debriefing so far not kurt and its not true weve learned nothing youve been talking with the women spencer questioned absolutely sheila said it was under my specific orders that i be paged the moment they were apprehended as were trying to tell you were just as concerned as you about uncovering their methods and we are making progress for instance weve learned that it was your access card which got them into both the server room and the egg room oh i see spencer said glaring back at his two supposed subordinates so im to blame for this debacle allotting blame is not our intent in the slightest paul said thats not a lot of information after six hours spencer said they are extremely intelligent women sheila explained they recognize that the information they have is important they are not pushovers by any stretch of the imagination but im being patient were using the good cop bad cop routine paul explained exactly sheila said obviously im the good cop while were having our meeting kurt is having his first go at talking with them hes the bad cop as soon as we finish here ill go back down and intervene im confident well have all we need to know by noon at the latest once we have the information paul said well make the appropriate operational changes weve already started in regard to computer security from now on access to the server room will be limited to randy porter alone we should look at this whole unfortunate affair as a learning experience sheila said precisely paul chimed in and we should look at it as a further stimulus for us to move the entire clinic research labs and all offshore like we discussed last evening by the way spencer what did you think of the plans i gave you last evening for the bahamian center the plans looked good spencer admitted reluctantly and your response in general to the idea of moving offshore paul asked i must admit i like it spencer said i like the idea of having even less regulation than weve had to deal with here even if that hasnt been that much of a bother spencer nodded lets get back to the women whats to happen them after their debriefing i dont know paul answered what do you mean you dont know spencer demanded feeling his ire rise again i dont want to know paul said i leave that kind of problem up to kurt hermann thats what we pay him for you leave the problem to kurt hermann and yet retain the ovaries spencer sneered is that what you are telling me harvesting the ovaries was a mistake we made in the past sheila interjected theres no doubt we shouldnt have done it we realize it now and it will not be repeated as an explanation it happened back when we were struggling with a critical egg shortage a shortage which we no longer have paul added with the nicaraguan connection plus the progress weve made with our oogonia culture technique we now have at our disposal an almost unlimited egg supply hell we can probably supply the cloning needs for the whole country are you two trying to suggest to me that you are not disturbed by this episode spencer asked paul and sheila exchanged glances we certainly take it as a serious event sheila said its a learning experience as we said but it has been contained just like the episode involving the anesthetic catastrophe even if this episode with these two meddling women had not ended so auspiciously we would have been able to cope listen spencer paul said he leaned forward and rubbed his hands together and then held them up in a conciliatory gesture like i said last night during our discussion researchwise we are sitting on a virtual gold mine with what we are learning from our cloning work in terms of generating stem cells we will be the biotech leaders of the twentyfirst century cloning and stem cells are going to revolutionize medicine and were going to be at the forefront you make it sound so rosy spencer said thats exactly the same adjective i use to describe it to myself paul said it is rosy very rosy the latch on spencers office door clicked loudly spencer paul and sheila turned to look all were taken aback by the interruption the secretarys face appeared around the door what is it gladys spencer demanded i said we were not to be disturbed its mr hermann the secretary said meekly he needs to speak to dr saunders he said it was an emergency paul stood up a questioning expression clouded his face he excused himself and followed the distraught secretary out of the room one look at kurt caused a meltdown of all the nonchalance and composure paul had been studiously maintaining weve got a major problem kurt sputtered why are you out of breath ive run all the way up from the gatehouse paul snapped open the door to his office and motioned kurt inside paul closed the door behind them well theres a united states attorney down at the gatehouse kurt blurted running his words together slow down paul ordered whats he doing here hes got a search warrant and he and some federal marshals are going through the gatehouse plus theyre demanding entrance onto the grounds how the hell did he get a search warrant paul was stunned i asked apparently it was due to a complaint by a doctor by the name of carlton williams never heard of him his father is some texan big shot with connections to the justice department the problem is this carlton williams knows the women were here last night and didnt return home shit paul snapped where are the women now theyre still in the gatehouse basement has the us attorney found them i dont know i ran up here as soon as i was able to put them off for five minutes theyre threatening to bring in a swat team if we dont cooperate threatening is good paul said regaining some composure at least they didnt show up with a swat team that gives us a good half hour minimum lets activate a code red you get to randy porter have him put everything onto zip discs and then erase all the hard drives then get yourself and randy to the hangar and rev up the chopper ill get dr wingate and dr donaldson down there after we shred paper files here in the office and have the egg room destroyed okay roger kurt said he saluted before dashing out of the office and running full tilt down the corridor toward the fire door paul watched him until he disappeared paul then took a couple of breaths to bolster his gaining equanimity when he felt hed pulled himself adequately together he returned to spencers office spencer and sheila looked at him expectantly the moment he appeared well paul said it appears that were going offshore sooner than we expected
