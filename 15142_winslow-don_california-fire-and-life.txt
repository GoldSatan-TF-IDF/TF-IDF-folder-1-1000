don wilson california fire and life don winslow womans lying in bed and the beds on fire she doesnt wake up flame licks at her thighs like a lover and she doesnt wake up just down the hill the pacific pounds on the rocks california fire and life george scollins doesnt wake up either reason for this is that hes lying at the bottom of the stairs with a broken neck its easy to see how this might have happened scollinss little laguna canyon house is a freaking mess tools wood furniture lying all over the place you can hardly walk across the floor without tripping on something in addition to the tools wood and furniture you have paint cans containers of stain plastic bottles full of turpentine cleaning rags this is also the reason the house is a bonfire not surprising really not surprising at all california fire and life two vietnamese kids sit in the front of a delivery truck the driver tommy do pulls it off into a parking lot middle of freaking nowhere says tommys buddy vince tranh tommy doesnt give a shit hes happy to be getting rid of the load a truck full of hot stuff tommy pulls over by a caddy they love their caddies tranh says to him in vietnamese let em tommy says tommys saving for a miata a miata is cool tommy can see himself cruising in a black miata wraparound shades on his face a babe with long black hair beside him yeah he can see that two guys get out of the caddy one of thems tall looks like one of those afghan hounds tommy thinks except the guys wearing a dark blue suit that has got to be hot standing out there in the desert the other guy is shorter but broad guy wears a black hawaiian print shirt with big flowers all over it and tommy thinks he looks like a jerk tommy has him tabbed as the leg breaker and tommy is going to be glad to get his money unload and get the fuck back to garden grove as a general rule tommy doesnt like doing business with nonvietnamese especially these people except the money this time is too good two grand for a delivery job the big guy in the flowered shirt opens a gate and tommy drives through it guy closes the gate behind them tommy and tranh hop out of the truck blue suit says unload the truck tommy shakes his head money first he says blue suit says sure business is business tommy says like hes apologizing for the moneyfirst request hes trying to be polite business is business blue suit agrees tommy watches blue suit reach into the jacket pocket for his wallet except blue suit takes out a silenced mm and puts three bullets in a tight pattern into tommys face tranh stands there with this ohfuckingno look on his face but he doesnt run or anything just stands there like frozen which makes it easy for blue suit to put the next three into him the guy in the flowered shirt hefts first tommy then tranh and tosses their bodies into the dumpster pours gasoline all over them then tosses a match in vietnamese are buddhists he asks blue suit i think so theyre speaking in russian dont they cremate their dead blue suit shrugs an hour later they have the truck unloaded and the contents stored in the cinder block building twelve minutes after that flower shirt drives the truck out into the desert and makes it go boom california fire and life jack wade sits on an old hobie longboard riding swells that refuse to become waves hes watching a wisp of black smoke rise over the other side of the big rock at dana head smokes reaching up into the pale august sky like a buddhist prayer jacks so into the smoke that he doesnt feel the wave come up behind him like a fat dick dale guitar riff its a big humping reef break that slams him to the bottom then rolls him keeps rolling him and wont let him up its like thats what you get when you dont pay attention jack you get to eat sand and breathe water and jacks about out of breath when the wave finally spits him out onto the shore hes on all fours sucking for air when he hears his beeper go off up on the beach where he left his towel he scampers up the sand grabs the beeper and checks the number although hes already pretty sure who its going to be california fire and life the womans dead jack knows this even before he gets to the house because when he calls in its goddamn billy sixthirty in the morning and goddamn billys already in the office goddamn billy tells him theres a fire and a fatality jack hustles up the steps from dana strand beach to the parking lot takes a quick shower at the bathhouse then changes into the work clothes he keeps in the backseat of his mustang his work clothes consist of a lands end white buttondown oxford lands end khaki trousers lands end moccasins and an eddie bauer tie that jack keeps preknotted so he can just slip it on like a noose jack hasnt been inside a clothing store in about twelve years he owns three ties five lands end white buttondown shirts two pairs of lands end khaki trousers two lands end guaranteednottowrinkleevenifyourunitthroughyourcarengine blue blazers a rotation deal one in the dry cleaners one on his back and the one pair of lands end moccasins sunday night he does laundry washes the five shirts and two pairs of trousers and hangs them out to unwrinkle preknots the three ties and hes ready for the workweek which means that hes in the water a little before dawn surfs until showers at the beach changes into his work clothes loops the tie around his neck gets into his car pops in an old challengers tape and races to the offices of california fire and life hes been doing this for coming up to twelve years not this morning though this morning propelled by billys call he races to the loss site bluffside drive just down the road above dana strand beach it takes him maybe ten minutes hes pulling around on the circular driveway his wheels on the gravel sound like the undertow in the trench at high tide and hasnt even fully stopped before brian bentley walks over and taps on the passengerside window brian accidentally bentley is the sheriffs department fire investigator which is another reason jack knows theres been a fatal fire because the sheriffs department is there otherwise it would be an inspector from the fire department and jack wouldnt be looking at bentleys fat face or his wavy red hair turning freaking orange with age jack leans over and winds down the window bentley sticks his red face in and says you got here quick jack what you carrying the fire and the life yup good bentley says the double whammy jack and bentley hate each other that old thing about if say jack was on fire bentley wouldnt piss on him to put it out if jack was on fire bentley would drink gasoline so he could piss on jack croaker in the bedroom bentley says they had to scrape her off the springs the wife asks jack we dont have a positive yet bentley says but its an adult female pamela vale age thirtyfour jack says goddamn billy gave him the specs over the phone name rings a bell bentley says save the strands jack says what the what save the strands jack says shes been in the papers she and her husband are big fundraisers for save the strands a community group fighting the great sunsets ltd corporation to prevent them from putting a condo complex on dana strands the last undeveloped stretch of the south coast dana strands jacks beloved dana strands a swatch of grass and trees that sits high on a bluff above dana strand beach years ago it was a trailer park and then that failed and then nature reclaimed it and grew over and around it and is still holding on to it against all the forces of progress just holding on jack thinks whatever bentley says jack says theres a husband and two kids were looking for them shit they aint in the house bentley says i mean were looking for notification purposes howd you get here so soon billy picked it off the scanner ran the address had it waiting for me when i got in you insurance bastards bentley says you just cant wait to get in there and start chiseling can you jack hears a little dog barking from somewhere behind the house it bothers him you name a cause jack asks bentley shakes his head and laughs this laugh he has which sounds more like steam coming out of a radiator he says just get out your checkbook jack you mind if i go in and have a look jack asks yeah i do mind bentley says except i cant stop you right right its in the insurance contract if you have a loss and you make a claim the insurance company gets to inspect the loss so knock yourself out bentley says he leans way in trying to get into jacks face only jack dont bust chops here i pull the pin in two weeks i plan to spend my retirement annoying bass on lake havasu not giving depositions what you got here is you got a woman drinking vodka and smoking and she passes out spills the booze drops the cigarette and barbecues herself and thats what you got here youre retiring bentley jack asks thirty years its about time you made it official one reason out of a veritable smorgasbord of reasons that jack hates accidentally bentley is that bentleys a lazy son of a bitch who doesnt like to do his job bentley could find an accidental cause for virtually any fire if bentley had been at dresden hed have looked around the ashes and found a faulty electricblanket control cuts down on paperwork and court appearances as a fire investigator bentley makes a great fisherman hey jack bentley says hes smiling but hes definitely pissed at least i didnt get thrown out like me jack thinks he says thats probably because they dont realize youre even there fuck you bentley says hop in the back the smile disappears from bentleys face hes like serious now accidental fire accidental death bentley says dont dick around in there jack waits until bentley leaves before he gets out of the car to go dick around in there before the scene gets cold literally the colder the scene the less chance there is of finding out what happened in jargon the c ampo the cause and origin of the fire the c ampo is important for an insurance company because there are accidents and there are accidents if the insured negligently caused the accident then the insurance company is on the hook for the whole bill but if its a faulty electric blanket or a bad switch or if some appliance malfunctions and sets off a spark then the company has a shot at something called subrogation which basically means that the insurance company pays the policyholder and then sues the manufacturer of the faulty item so jack has to dick around in there but he thinks of it as dicking around with a purpose he pops open the trunk of his car what hes got in there is a folding ladder a couple of different flashlights a shovel a heavyduty stanley tape measure two mm minoltas a sony hi camcorder a small clipon dictaphone a notebook three floodlights three folding metal stands for the lights and a fire kit the fire kit consists of yellow rubber gloves a yellow hardhat and a pair of white paper overalls that slip over your feet like kids pajamas the trunk is like full jack keeps all this stuff in his trunk because jack is basically a dalmatian when a fire happens hes there jack slips into the overalls and feels like some sort of geek from a cheap scifi movie but its worth it the first fire you inspect you dont do it and the soot ruins your clothes or at least totally messes up your laundry schedule so he puts on the overalls likewise the hardhat which he doesnt really need but goddamn billy will fine you a hundred bucks if he comes to a loss site and catches you without the hat i dont want any goddamn workmens comp claims he says jack clips the dictaphone inside his shirt if you clip it outside and get it full of soot you buy a new dictaphone slings the cameras over his shoulder and heads for the house which in insurance parlance is called the risk actually thats before something happens after something happens its called the loss when a risk becomes a loss when what could happen does happen is where jack comes in this is what he does for california fire and life mutual insurance company he adjusts claims hes been adjusting claims for twelve years now and as gigs go jack figures its a decent one he works mostly alone no one gives him a lot of shit as long as he gets the job done and he always gets the job done ergo its a relatively shitfree environment some of his fellow adjusters seem to think that they take a lot of shit from the policyholders but jack doesnt get it its a simple job hell tell them when hes heard enough whining the insurance policy is a contract it spells out exactly what you pay for and what you dont what you owe you pay what you dont you dont so theres no reason to take any shit or dish any out you dont get personal you dont get emotional whatever you do you dont get involved you do the job and the rest of the time you surf this is jacks philosophy and it works for him works for goddamn billy too because whenever he gets a big fire he assigns it to jack which only makes sense because thats what jack did for the sheriffs department before they kicked him out he investigated fires so jack knows that the first thing you do when you investigate a house fire is you walk around the house sop standard operating procedure in a fire inspection you work from the outside in what you observe on the outside can tell you a lot about what happened on the inside he lets himself in through the wroughtiron gate being careful to shut it behind him because theres that barking dog two little kids lose their mother jack thinks least i can do is not lose their dog for them the gate opens into an interior courtyard surrounded by an adobe wall a winding crushed gravel path snakes around a zen garden on the right and a little koi pond on the left or former koi pond jack thinks the pond is sodden with ashes dead koi once gold and orange now black with soot float on the top note jack says into the dictaphone inquire about value of koi he walks through the garden to the house itself takes one look and thinks oh shit hes seen the house maybe a million times from the water but he hadnt recognized the address built back in the s its one of the older homes on the bluff above dana point a heavytimbered wood frame job with cedar shake walls and a shake roof a damn shame jack thinks because this house is one of the survivors of the old days when most of the dana headlands was just open grass hillside a product of the days when they really built houses this house jack thinks has survived hurricanes and monsoons and the santa ana winds that sweep these hills with firestorms even more remarkably its survived real estate developers hotel planners and tax boards this sweet old lady of a house has presided over the ocean through all that and all it takes is one woman with a bottle of vodka and a cigarette to do her in which is a shame jack thinks because hes sat on his board looking at this house from the ocean all his damn life and always thought that it was one of the coolest houses ever built for one thing its made of wood not stucco or some phony adobe composite and they didnt use green lumber to frame it up either in the days when they built houses they used kilndried lumber and they used real log shakes on the exterior and were content to let the ocean weather it to a color somewhere between brown and gray so that the house became a part of the seascape like driftwood that had been washed up on the shore and a lot of driftwood too because its a big old place for a singlestory building a big central structure flanked by two large wings set at about a thirtydegree angle toward the ocean standing there looking at it jack can see that the central and left sections of the house are still intact smoke damaged water damaged but otherwise they look structurally sound the wing to the right the west wing is a different story you dont have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that the fire started in the west wing generally speaking the part of a house that suffers the most damage is where the fire started you know this because thats where the fire burned the longest jack steps back and photographs the house first with one camera and then the other he has one loaded with color film and the other with blackandwhite color is better for showing the damage but some judges will only allow blackandwhite shots into evidence their theory being that color shots especially in a fatal fire are prejudicially dramatic might inflame the jury jack thinks jack thinks that most judges are dicks a lot of adjusters just take polaroids jack uses mm because the images enlarge so much better which is important if you need them as exhibits in court so some bottomfeeding plaintiffs attorney doesnt take your shitty polaroids and stick them up your ass polaroids are hemorrhoids another of goddamn billys pithy sayings so just on the odd chance the file might end up in court jacks covering all his bases which is why he keeps two s handy in the car because it would be a waste of time to have to reload and then go take each shot again he grabs shots of the whole house with each camera and then jots down a note describing each shot and giving the time and date that he took the picture he notes that he used minolta cameras notes the serial numbers of both cameras the type of film and its asa he speaks the same information into the tape recorder along with any observations he may want to have for his file jack takes these notes because he knows that you think youre going to remember what you took and why but you wont you got maybe a hundred losses youre working at any given point and you get them mixed up or as billy hayes poetically puts it its writ or its shit billys from arizona so jack says frame one shot of house taken from south angle august west wing of house shows severe damage exterior walls standing but will probably have to be torn down and rebuilt windows blasted out hole in roof the easiest way to the other side of the house is through the central section so jack lets himself in the front door jack opens it and hes looking straight out at the ocean like hes going to fall into it because there are big glass sliders with a view that stretches from newport beach right down to the mexican islands to the left catalina island straight ahead of you dana strands just down to your left and below that dana strand beach and miles and miles of blue ocean and sky youre talking two million bucks just for the view the big glass door opens onto a deck about the size of rhode island below the deck is a sloping lawn a rectangle of green in all this blue and in the green theres another rectangle of blue which is the swimming pool a brick wall borders the lawn trees and shrubs line the side walls and the trees and shrubs are edged by a border of flowers down to the left theres a pad with a clay tennis court the view is totally killer but the house even this main section that didnt burn is a fuckedup mess drenched with water and the allpervading acrid stench of smoke jack takes some shots notes the smoke and water damage on his tape and then goes out into the yard takes some shots from this angle and doesnt see anything to change his mind that the fire started in the west wing which must be the bedroom he walks to the outside of the west wing over to one of the windows and carefully removes a shard of glass from the window frame first thing he notices is that its greasy theres a thick oily soot on the glass jack makes this observation into the tape but what he doesnt speak into the record is what hes thinking what hes thinking is that a residue on the inside of the glass can mean the presence of some kind of hydrocarbon fuel inside the house also the glass is cracked into small irregular patterns which means it was fairly near the origin of the fire and that the fire built up fast and hot he doesnt say any of this either all he says into the tape is strictly the physical details glass shows greasy sooty residue and smallpattern crazing radial fracture of glass indicates that it was broken by force of fire from inside the house thats all he says because that cant be argued with the evidence is the evidence jack wont put his analysis or speculation on tape because if a lawsuit happens and it goes to trial the tape will be subpoenaed and if his voice is on there speculating on potential hydrocarbon fuel in the house the plaintiffs lawyer will make it sound like he was prejudiced that he was looking for evidence of arson and therefore skipped over evidence of an accidental fire he can just hear the lawyer you were focused on the possibility of arson from moment one werent you mr wade no sir well you say right here on your taped notes that you thought so its better to leave your thoughts out of it its sloppy work to start thinking ahead of yourself and anyway there could be other explanations for the oily soot if the wood inside the room didnt burn completely it might leave that kind of residue or there could be any number of petroleumbased products in the house quite innocently still theres that barking dog which is really going at it now and the bark is not an angry bark either not like a dog defending its turf its a scared bark more like a whine and jack figures the dog must be terrified and thirsty and hungry shit jack thinks he photographs the piece of glass labels it and puts it into a plastic evidence bag he keeps in a pocket of the overalls then instead of going into the house which is what he really wants to do he goes to look for the dog the dog probably got out when the firemen broke in and its probably traumatized the vale kids will be worried about the dog and anyway maybe itll help them feel a little better to get their dog back jack kind of likes dogs its people hes not so crazy about nineteen years seven with the sheriffs twelve with the insurance company of cleaning up after peoples accidents have taught him that people will do about anything theyll lie steal cheat kill and litter dogs however have a certain sense of ethics he finds the vales dog hiding under the lower limbs of a jacaranda tree its one of those little frufru dogs a house dog all big eyes and bark hey pup jack says softly its all right it isnt but people will lie the dog doesnt care the dog is just happy to see a human being and hear a friendly voice it comes out from under the tree and sniffs jacks hand for some kind of clue as to his identity andor intentions whats your name jack asks like the dogs going to answer right jack thinks leo a voice says and jack about jumps out of his geeky paper overalls he looks up to see an older gentleman standing across the fence a parrot sits on his shoulder leo the parrot repeats leo starts wagging his tail which is what yorkies do for a living cmere leo jack says thats a good dog he picks leo up and tucks him under one arm scratching the top of his head and walks over to the fence he can feel leo trembling theres that thing about people resembling their pets or vice versa jack always thought that applied to just dogs but the parrot and the older gentleman kind of look like each other they both have beaks the parrots being pretty selfexplanatory and the older gentlemans nose being shaped just like the parrots beak the man and the bird are like some interspecies kind of siamese twins except that the parrot is green with patches of bright red and yellow and the older gentleman is mostly white he has white hair and wears a white shirt and white slacks jack cant see his shoes through the hedge but hes betting that theyre white too im howard meissner the old guy says you must be the man from mars close jack says he offers his left hand because he has leo tucked under his right jack wade california fire and life this is eliot meaning the parrot which says eliot eliot pretty bird jack says pretty bird pretty bird jack guesses the parrots heard the pretty bird bit before a shame about pamela meissner says i saw the stretcher go out yeah meissners eyes get watery he reaches over the fence to pet leo and says its all right leo you did your best jack gives him a funny look and meissner explains leos barking woke me up i looked out the window and saw the flames and dialed what time was that four fortyfour thats pretty exact mr meissner digital clock meissner says you remember things like that i called right away but too late you did what you could im thinking pamela is out of the house because leo is leo leo leo was outside jack asks yes when you heard him barking yes youre sure about that mr meissner pretty bird pretty bird meissner nods i saw leo standing out there barking at the house i thought pamela did leo usually sleep outside jack asks no no meissner says like dismissively jack knows its a stupid question no ones going to leave a little dog like this outside at night hes always seeing signs for lost yorkies and cats and with all the coyotes around here you know its like b company aint comin back coyotes jack says of course jack asks mr meissner did you see the flames meissner nods what color were they jack asks red brick red light red bright red cherry red meissner thinks about this for a second then says blood red blood red would describe it how about the smoke no question about it no hesitation black mr meissner jack asks do you know where the rest of the family was it was nickys night with the kids he says a blessing theyre divorced separated he says nickys been staying with his mother where does she monarch bay he says i told this to the police when they were here so that they could notify except jack thinks bentley tells me theyre still looking i feel for the kids says meissner he sighs one of those sighs that come only from advanced age the man has seen too much in and out in and out meissner says chess pieces i know what you mean jack says well thanks mr meissner howard howard jack says then he asks do you know why they were separated what the issues were it was pamela he says sadly she drank so there it is jack thinks as he watches meissner walk away pamela vale has a night without the responsibility of the kids so she gets hammered at some point she lets leo out to go pee forgets hes out there and ends up in bed with a bottle and some cigs so pamela vale is drinking and smoking in bed the vodka bottle tips over and most of the contents spills onto the floor pamela vale either doesnt notice or doesnt care then with a burning cigarette still in her hand she passes out the sleeping hand drops the cigarette onto the vodka the alcohol ignites into a hot flame which catches the sheets and the blankets and the room fills with smoke normally it would take ten to fifteen minutes for the cigarette to ignite the sheets ten to fifteen minutes in which pamela vale might have smelled smoke felt the heat woke up and stamped her foot on the cigarette and that would have been that but the vodka would ignite instantly at a much greater heat than a smoldering cigarette enough to ignite the sheets and because shes passed out she never has a chance its the smoke not the flames that kills pamela vale jack can picture her lying in bed passed out drunk her respiratory system working even though her mind has shut down and that respiratory system just sucks in that smoke and fills her lungs with it until its too late she suffocates on smoke while shes asleep like a drunk choking on his own vomit so theres that small blessing for pamela vale she literally never knew what hit her they had to scrape her off the springs but she was dead before the intense heat merged her flesh into the metal she never woke up thats all the fire broke out her system inhaled a lethal dose of smoke and then the fire fueled by all her belongings and her home became fast and hot and strong enough to melt the bed around her an accidental fire an accidental death its one of those cruel but kind ironies of a fatal house fire cruel in the sense that it chokes you with your own life takes those crucial physical things your furniture your sheets your blankets the paint on your walls your clothes your books your papers your photographs all the intimate accumulations of a life a marriage a physical existence and forces them down your throat and chokes you on them most people who die in fires die from smoke inhalation its like lethal injection no more like the gas chamber because its really a gas carbon monoxide the old co that kills you but in any case youd prefer it to the electric chair the technical phrase in the fire biz is co asphyxiation it sounds cruel but the kind part is that youd sure as hell prefer it to burning at the stake so there it is jack thinks an accidental fire and an accidental death it all fits except you have the sooty glass and flames from burning wood arent blood red theyre yellow or orange and the smoke should be gray or brown not black but then again jack thinks these are the observations of an old man in bad light he carries leo back to the car opens up the trunk and digs around until he finds an old frisbee he left in there gets a bottle of water from out of the front seat and pours some into the frisbee sets leo down and the little dog goes right for the water jack finds an old killer dana sweatshirt in the trunk and lays it on the passenger seat rolls the windows halfway down figuring that its early enough in the morning that the car wont get too hot and then sits leo down on the sweatshirt stay jack says feeling kind of stupid uhh lie down dog looks at jack like hes relieved to be getting some kind of order and settles down into the sweatshirt and dont you know do anything okay jack asks classic mustang and jacks spent hours refurbishing the interior leos tail whacks against the seat what happened in there leo jack says to the dog you know dont you so why dont you tell me leo looks up at him and wags his tail some more but doesnt say a word thats okay jack says jack deals with a lot of snitches seven years in the sheriffs department and twelve in insurance claims and you deal with a lot of snitches one of the ironies of the game you rely on snitches and at the same time you despise them another plus for the dog column dogs are standup guys they never snitch so leo says nothing except for the fact that hes alive which sets off this sick little alarm in jacks brain what jack knows is that people will never burn the pooch theyll burn their houses their clothing their business their papers theyll even burn each other but theyll never torch fido every house fire jacks ever worked that turned out to be arson the dog was somewhere else but then again jack thinks so were the people and pamela vale was good people raising all that money to save the strands so let it go he peels off the overalls and the rest of it the house inspection will have to wait for a little while you got two kids going through a divorce then their mother dies and their house burns down better get them their dog small consolation for a shitty deal goddamn billy hayes strikes a match cups his hands against the breeze and lights his cigarette hes sitting on a metal folding chair in the cactus garden outside his office at california fire and life claim files in his lap reading glasses on his nose and a camel in his lips the cactus garden was billys idea since the peoples republic of california banned smoking in the workplace billy has been the company chairperson of cosa the california outdoor smokers association he figured since he spent most of his time out in the courtyard anyway it might as well be someplace he liked so he had it rebuilt as a cactus garden if you need to talk to billy and he isnt in his office hes outside sitting on his folding chair working on his files and sucking on a stick one time jack came in on a sunday night and moved billys desk out there billy thought that was just about as amusing as filtered cigarettes billy came from tucson twenty years ago to head up cal fire and lifes fire claims division he didnt want to come but the company said it was up or out and up meant coming out to california so here he is sitting out among the ocotillo and barrel cactus and the sand and the rocks amidst the aroma of sage tobacco and carbon monoxide coming oft the traffic streaming by on the goddamn billy hayes is a small man fivesix and so thin he looks like one of those dolls where theres just wire under the little clothes got a sunshriveled tan face a silver crew cut and eyes as blue as arctic ice he wears good blue suits over cowboy boots used to keep a colt holstered on his belt back when he had a few arson losses on some mobowned buildings in phoenix and the trescia family intimated that if he didnt pay up maybe hed have an accident heres how billy handles that goddamn billy walks into young joe trescias real estate office with the in his hand pulls the hammer back sticks the barrel up under young joes nose and says im about to have me one hell of a goddamn accident here five wise guys standing there scared too shitless to reach for their own hardware because its clear this little nut ball would splatter joe jrs brains all over the wall which would make joe sr very unhappy so they just stand there sweating and saying silent prayers to st anthony young joe looks up the blue steel barrel at those blue steel eyes and says ive decided to look elsewhere for our insurance needs but that was the old days and they dont let you do that kind of thing anymore especially not in california where it would be deemed inappropriate i mean goddamn it billy said relaying the story to jack one night over jack daniels with beer chasers in a state where they wont let you smoke you know they aint gonna let you splatter some greaseballs brains all over the wall so the pistol now sits on the top shelf of billys bedroom closet what we got now instead of guns billy thinks is we got lawyers not as fast but every bit as lethal and a hell of a lot more expensive only thing more expensive than having lawyers is not having lawyers because what insurance companies do these days in addition to selling insurance and paying claims is they get sued we get sued billy thinks for not paying enough paying too slow paying too fast but especially for not paying at all which is what you got to do when you got an arson or a phony theft or a car accident that didnt really happen or even a dead insured who isnt really dead but whos slurping pina coladas in botswana or some such goddamn place you gotta deny those claims say sorry charlie no money and then of course they sue you for bad faith insurance companies are scared shitless of bad faith lawsuits you end up spending more on lawyers and court costs than you would have just to pay the goddamn claim but goddamn it you just cant go around paying money you dont owe another goddamn billy dictum we dont pay people to burn their own houses down unless of course a judge andor jury disagrees with you finds that you unreasonably denied the claim or paid less than you should then youre in bad faith and youre also neck deep in a downwardly swirling shifter because they hit you with not only the contractual damages but also compensatory damages and if they really hate you punitive damages then you do pay your insureds to burn their own house down and you also pay them compensatories for the pain and anguish you caused them and you pay a few million in punitive damages if the scumsucking bottomfeeding goddamn plaintiffs attorney has managed to whip the jury into a froth about how mean and nasty you were to the poor insureds who burned their own goddamn house down in the first place so its entirely possible possible shit its happened to deny a theft claim and get popped for a cool mil in a bad faith judgment you get the right lawyer the right judge and the right jury the very best thing that can happen to you in your whole life is that your insurance company denies your claim which is why billy sends jack wade out on the vale loss because jack is the best adjuster hes got goddamn billys thinking these thoughts while hes looking through the vales homeowners policy and what he sees is that this loss is a beaut a millionfive on the house itself on personal property propped up with another in special endorsements not to mention a dead wife with a life policy on her all of which is why he handed this one to jack wade he knows jack so he knows that whatever else happens jack is going to do the job heres the story on jack wade jack grows up in dana point which in those days is a small beach town with a couple of motels a few diners and surf to die for in fact so many surfers actually die for the surf that the beach gets the nickname killer dana jacks old man is a contractor so jack grows up working jacks mom is a contractors wife so she gets it as soon as her little boy is big enough to hold a hammer hes on jobs with his dad after school weekends and summers jacks seven years old and hes holding the hammer for his dad until his dad reaches back and then smack that hammers in dads palm because little jack is on the job he gets bigger he gets to do bigger stuff jacks thirteen hes in there tacking framing hanging sheetrock toeing in footings hes sixteen hes on roofs nailing down the shingles jack works when he isnt working he does what every other kid in dana point does he surfs learns this from his old man too because john sr was one of the early guys out there on a longboard john sr was out there riding a dale velzy tenfoot wooden longboard in the days when surfers were considered bums but john sr doesnt give a shit because he knows he works for a living and bums dont this is what john sr tells jack like maybe only a million times on the beach or on the job what he tells him is theres work and theres play play is better but you work to earn the play i dont care what you do in this world but you do something you earn your own living yeah dad yeah yeah yeah john sr says but im telling you you do the job you do it right you earn your paycheck then the rest of your time is yours you dont owe anybody shit you dont owe any explanations you have paid your way so jacks father teaches him to work and to surf turns him on to all the good stuff innout burgers dick dale amp his deltones tacos carne asada at el maguey longboards the beach break at lower trestles the old trailer park at dana strands young jack thinks it might be the most beautiful place in the world this long ridge overlooking dana strand beach the trailer park has been closed for years all there is now is a few decrepit old buildings and some trailer pads but when hes up there among the eucalyptus and the palms that overlook the gorgeous stretch of beach that curves into the big rock at dana head well its the most beautiful place in the world young jack spends hours there hell days there on the last undeveloped hillside on the south coast hell surf for a while then hike up the ravine that leads up the bluff and slip under the old fence and wander around go sit in the old rec hall building where they used to have pingpong tables and a jukebox and a kitchen that put out burgers and dogs and chili for the trailer park patrons sometimes he sits there and watches the lightning storms that crash over dana head or sometimes he sits up there during the whale migration and spots the big grays moving north up the coast or sometimes he justs sits there and stares at the ocean and does nothing his dad doesnt let him do a lot of nothing john sr keeps him pretty busy especially as young jack gets older and can handle more work but sometimes when theyve finished a big job they take the truck down to baja and find some little mexican fishing village sleep in the back of the truck surf the miles of empty beach take siestas under palm trees in the ferocious midday heat in the late afternoon they order fish for dinner and the locals go out and catch it and have it ready by the time the sun goes down jack and his dad sit at an outdoor table and eat the fresh fish with warm tortillas right off the grill and drink icecold mexican beer and talk about the waves they caught or the waves that caught them or just about stuff then maybe one of the villagers gets out his guitar and if jack and his dad have had enough beers they join in singing the canciones or maybe they just lie in the back of the truck listening to a dodgers game through the crackle of the radio or just talk to the background of a mariachi station or maybe just fall asleep staring at the stars do a few days of this and then drive back to el norte to go back to work jack graduates from high school does a couple of semesters at san diego state figures that aint it and takes the test for the sheriffs department tells his dad he wants to try something different from sheetrock and by s for a while i cant blame you says his dad jack aces the written exam and hes bulked up from the construction work and the surfing so he gets on with the orange county sheriffs department does the usual gigs for a few years serves papers picks up fugitive warrants does car patrols but jack is a smart kid and wants to move up and theres no spot in major crimes so he applies for fire school figuring that if you know construction you got a jump on destruction hes right about this he rips fire school prometheus the little man in the tweed suit says jacks like prowho and what the hell does it have to do with fire the lecturer acknowledges the blank stares of the class read your aeschylus he says adding to the general puzzlement when prometheus gave fire to mankind the other gods chained him to a boulder and sent eagles to pick at his liver for all eternity if you consider what man has done with fire prometheus got off easy jack had expected fire school to be taught by a fireman instead he has this tweedjacket professor named fuller from the chemistry department of chapman mumbling about gods and eternity and telling the students in a thick irish accent that if they dont understand the chemistry of fire they can never understand the behavior of fire first thing jack learns in fire school is what is fire nothing like starting with the basics so fire is the active stage of combustion the professor tells jacks class combustion is the oxidation of fuel that creates flame heat and light so combustion is flame heat and light jack says the professor agrees then asks but what is flame the classs reaction is basically duhh its easy to describe flame its red yellow orange occasionally blue but defining it is something else fuller lets the class sit with this for a minute then he asks a very unprofessor like question are you telling me that no silly bastard in this room has ever lighted a fart ahhh says the class ahhh thinks jack flame is burning gas burning gases fuller says so combustion is the oxidation of fuel that creates burning gases heat and light which begs what question what is oxidation jack asks full marks for the surfer dude fuller says whats your name jack wade well master jack fuller says oxidation is a series of chemical reactions that occur when an atom that is matter forms a chemical bond with a molecule of oxygen now dont you all wish youd paid more attention in chemistry yes thinks jack definitely because fuller starts drawing chemical equations on the board while the chalk is screeching fullers saying in order for oxidation to occur a combustible fuel well talk about fuel in a few minutes and oxygen must come together this is called an exothermic that is heatproducing reaction he draws an equation h h heat a basic oxidation reaction fuller says when you combine hydrogen and oxygen you get two molecules of water and heat heat is measured in btus british thermal units one btu is the amount of heat that it takes to raise the temperature of one pound of water by degree fahrenheit so the more heat you have the greater the temperature youre going to get put simply the more btus the hotter the fire fuller continues look gentlemen to sustain a fire you need to have three things working together oxygen fuel and heat if you have no oxygen oxidation obviously cant take place no fire if you have no fuel there is nothing to oxidize no fire if the fuel doesnt contain enough mass of heat then the fire dies out he strikes a match observe he says we have oxygen we have fuel we have heat the match burns for a few seconds then goes out what happened fuller asks we had plenty of oxygen but not a lot of fuel and not a lot of heat he strikes another match i will now attempt to burn down the classroom he holds the match to the metal desk the flame makes a slight scorch on the metal then burns out what happened fuller asks we have oxygen we have heat its a big desk plenty of fuel where is our sustained fire most metals dont burn easily jack says most metals dont burn easily fuller repeats which is the lay persons way of talking about flammability some substances burn more easily than others witness he rips a page from a legal pad strikes another match and holds the match to the paper it ignites immediately he says he drops the burning paper into a metal trash can and puts a lid on it thereby depriving it of oxygen he notes look paper has a lower flash point than the metal of the desk flash point is the temperature at which a fuel ignites a simple match will ignite paper but doesnt have nearly the btus to create enough temperature to reach the flash point of the metal in this desk it simply cant sustain the oxidation reaction needed to set the desk on fire and keep it on fire now were we to add more fuel to the fire and developed enough btus to raise the temperature there is a point at which we could indeed melt the desk its a chain reaction gentlemen a chemical chain reaction difficult to break down into a description because it is a neverending cycle of chain reactions which are really quite fascinating in detail but for practical purposes its all about fuel the amount of fuel the flash points of that fuel and the conductivity of that fuel so the amount of fuel in proper terminology the fuel load or the fuel mass why is it important to establish a fuel load for a structure that has suffered a fire if for instance you find a melted metal desk in a burned structure where the prefire fuel load could not have produced sufficient btus to melt that metal you have an anomaly that you need to resolve youll want to be taking notes on this because youll need this terminology to pass the bloody test jack takes notes he doesnt want to pass the bloody test he wants to ace it so he has to learn certain definitions like fuel load fuel load is the total potential btus per square foot of the structure in question you calculate it by determining the total pounds of matter in the structure and multiplying the total weight by the total btus of the various materials in the structure btus per pound of wood btus per pound of plastic et cetera et cetera et cetera certain materials give off more heat than others wood about btus coal about flammable liquids somewhere between to btus another term heat release rate this is the speed at which a fire grows depending on the fuel upon which it is feeding some materials burn fast and hot others are slow hrr is measured in btus per second otherwise known as kilowatts a plastic trash bag filled with the usual garbage is going to have somewhere between and kilowatts a television set about a twosquarefoot pool of kerosene kerosene gives you a hot fast fire jack learns that fuel load isnt just fuel load but is divided into two parts dead load and live load dead load is the total weight of the materials in the structure plus the total weight of any permanent builtins live load is the total weight of the materials of items added to the structure furniture appliances artwork toys people and pets the irony of the phrase live load is that if they are found in the fire they are most likely dead conductivity that is to say the amount of heat a substance on fire transfers some materials retain most of their heat some transfer it to other materials in the structure jack learns for a fire to spread it has to encounter material that is conductive that transfers and adds to the btus paper for example is highly conductive water isnt it absorbs more heat than it transfers air is highly conductive being made up of about percent oxygen so most structural fires spread by convection meaning the transfer of heat by a circulating medium usually air fire burns up because thats where the air is its all about fuel fuller lectures you are what you eat and fire is no different you can determine its severity its origin its direction and rate of spread and how long it burned by the fuel in the structure jack aces the chemistry test fuller passes out the results which apparently launch him to new rhetorical heights so he asks what happens in a fire it has all the dramatic structure of your classic threeact play gentlemen it has the rhythm of a love affair oxidation occurs act one the smoldering phase the seduction if you will the chemical reaction between oxygen and solid molecules in which the oxygen tries to induce heat in the solid matter the seduction might take a fraction of a second in the case of a hot number like gasoline or kerosene or some other liquid accelerant the roundheels of the flammable street corner i might tell you switching metaphors liquid accelerants are the aphrodisiacs of the fire seduction they are the storied spanish fly the fine wine the manly cologne the american express platinum card left casually by the side of the couch they can get the passion ignited in a big hurry or the smoldering phase might last hours or even days the material the fuel wants to be wined and dined courted taken to dinner and the movies come to sunday dinner and meet my parents but fire is a patient seducer comrades if it can just hang in there long enough to generate a little heat if the affair is given a little air to breathe it lingers a kiss on the neck a hand under the blouse the steamy heat of the backseat at a drivein movie fellows working working trying to melt the fuel to liquid and then into burning gas a questing hand under the skirt trying to generate enough heat to reach the ignition point smoldering smoldering and then ignition act two the freeburning phase the flash point is reached open flames my boys passion heated gas is lighter than air so it rises witness your goodyear blimp it starts eating up the air and then it hits the ceiling if the fire is hot enough to ignite the ceiling materials you have more ignition the fire might even blast a hole in the roof to get to that easy tasty air the heated gases themselves become a source of radiation now spreading the heat downward to ignite material below this is why the ceiling might burn by the way before the furniture does it all depends on your fuel gentlemen is she an ice maiden with a high flash point and a tepid hrr the affair will die from lack of passion shes a frigid bitch my jolly boys do your worst she wont respond or is she a hot number a low flash point a steaming hrr then hold on buckoes you are in for a ride if shes hot enough and big enough your fire will reach a critical temperature the heat will radiate down from the ceiling hot enough to overwhelm the ignition point of all the materials underneath it and then the fairies start flying what do i mean by that esoteric and somewhat effeminate reference regarding flying fairies just before flashover boys you might see little pockets of gas in the air ignite little licks of flame dancing in the air that is the fairies flying and that is the time to put it in reverse gentlemen because if you see the fairies flying it is a prelude to whoosh act three the flashover phase all the exposed surfaces reach ignition point and now you have an outofcontrol fire an undeniable passion that sweeps everything before it nothing can resist it every substance opens its legs and joins the orgy the heat is transferred upward by the air downward by radiation and sideways by conduction it thrashes in passion in all directions the intensity doubles with each degree rise in temp it gets hotter and faster faster and hotter this is fires orgasm gentlemen the fiery consummation of the affair it roars and screams and groans and moans it howls like a banshee into the air it burns until it runs out of fuel or someone comes along and puts it out and now fuller says we shall have a cigarette he lights his cig and leans back against the desk in a parody of sexual satisfaction and exhaustion after a minute he says three phases of fire ye thirsters after knowledge smoldering free burning and flashover the first act often dies from its own lack of energy it suffocates from lack of air the second phase can be put out by prompt and appropriate action the third phase flashover well katie bar the door so what is fire a dry chemical interaction between molecules a threeact drama that often ends in tragedy a metaphor for sex which reveals itself in our language of love ie the heat of passion you get me so hot baby the stereotypical seduction setting of the bearskin rug in front of a roaring fire the heat that can only be extinguished by the emission of cooling exothermic fluids this is the chemistry that old prometheus instinctively understood fuller says he gave it to man and man has used it to warm his caves to cook his food and being human to incinerate his fellow man in all manner of nasty combustion well let the sparks fly let the eagles feast he finishes his cigarette tosses it into the trash can then says lets go dance with the bitch dance with the bitch the crazy bastard puts them into a burning building jack loves it fire school outrageous man the little irish dude walks them out onto this big concrete square where theres this twostory concrete building that looks like an air control tower designed by some sort of soviet architectural committee things got doors and windows and fire escapes all over it and theres firemen standing around looking at the students like they are meat firemen have these little smirks on their faces like good morning welcome to our world welcome to your hosing firemen standing in front of a stack of oxygen masks which makes the students a little you know apprehensive then one of the older firemen comes up and starts giving them a briefing about how to put on the masks and how to use them five minutes later jack is standing in a crowded mass of his fellow students on the second floor of the concrete building and its hot and sweaty and then its pitch black because the door slams some of the boys start scrambling to put their masks on but a voice comes over the pa screaming not yet theres something we want you to experience first gentlemen suffocation more properly asphyxiation first thing jack feels is like this intense heat then the room starts filling with smoke jacks like this is wild and wild it is because what you got here is a bunch of men crowded into a dark locked room part of which is on fire jack gets the game the game is you put your mask on before the order comes you are out of there out of the building out of the school so jack squats down as close as he can manage to the floor where theres still some air but its only a minute or so before his eyes start burning and tearing and then he starts choking and gagging and everyone is choking and gagging and jack feels this moment of absolute primal terror which is like panic man he feels it and appreciates it this is what they want me to feel this is the moment they want me to confront want me to give in freak out lose it which is what a couple of guys do theyre history theyre past tense but jack is like fuck that jacks been held under by a wave more than once in his young life hes already experienced not breathing so hes like bring it dudes i will fucking die in here before i reach for the mask but is nevertheless very pleased to hear fuller scream put your masks on you silly bastards except its no gimme putt in the dark with your elbows banging against other elbows and you cant see a damn thing and your brain is telling your hands to like hurry the fuck up and your fingers are telling your brain fuck you and then you get the mask on and its like aaaaaahhhhh a completely new appreciation for oxygen then the door comes open and a big beautiful rectangle of light penetrates this contrived little mock hell and some guys are standing and some are keeled over and jack sees this one guy crouched on the floor in bad shape man dude is still fiddling with his mask dude is going to be out in a second so jack pushes his down to the guy and holds the mask to the guys face and gets him strapped in and then fullers voice comes across the pa screeching get out of there you total idiots jack rips his mask off long enough to yell guys be cool the guy nearest the door stands at the side and plays traffic cop pushing guys through one at a time jacks boy is in bad shape though cant straighten up so jack gets a shoulder under his arm and lifts waits his turn by the door and carries the guy out onto the fire escape which is on fire of course just fucking outrageous jack thinks as he looks up and sees that the roof of the tower is a mass of flames and the railing of the fire escape is a line of flame and flames are bursting out the windows they have to get past jack spots fuller and the head fireman watching them from a nearby tower so he sets his boy down and gives him a little shove down the stairs which is too crowded for the guy to fall anyway and even if he does its better for him to be seen taking a header than getting carried out of there just to make things more fun the firemen are spraying them with a hose so by the time jack makes it down the stairs hes halfchoked semiblinded singed bruised and soaked the whole class is sprawled out on the concrete not caring that theyre lying in puddles just happy to be breathing and not on fire when fuller comes over and looks down at them fuller lights himself another cig has himself a long smirk and asks any questions jack raises his hand mr wade yeah jack says can i go again fire school what a ride better than knotts berry farm fire school jacks having more fun than a boy should have going to class studying his ass off hitting a few beers with the boys in the dorm after shutting the books fire school is very cool next thing they get into after fire chemistry is construction this time its no irish professor but a local goodoldboy contractor with a civil engineering degree who takes them through how a house is built this contractor is classic got that greasedback pompadour socal leftoverfromtheoklahomadays look white shortsleeved shirt with a pocket protector mechanical pencil and a protractor peeking out of the pocket and the boy knows his shit this is the easy part of fire school for jack because hes been there every piece of terminology that the guy writes on the board jack has like done theyre not talking chemistry drama sex and greek mythology now theyre talking dormers downspout straps cripples floor joists and headers talking newels and king posts and trusses and wall sheathing and these are all things that jacks dad taught him the hard way which is like carrying the shit around putting it in putting it in wrong and having to rip it out and do it all over again so jack knows whereof the contractor speaks next thing they do is they go over to the shell of a building they got set up in a big old quonsethut hangar damn thing looks like a dinosaur in a museum a tworoom house with dormer windows half of it just the structural shell the other half finished out with walls shingles doors and windows and the rest of the enchilada first each student has to walk around naming every piece of wood in the skeleton half name it door buck stud collar beam then identify the size and type of the lumber pine by by so on and so forth once the whole class can do that they go over to the finishedoff side and now they have to get into window sashes types of glass chair rails balusters all the stuff that jack has come to know as dead load fuel for the fire jack aces construction next thing they look at is appliances go into a big empty warehouse with fire extinguishers all over the place and light fires under television sets blenders radios alarm clocks you name it they learn how these behave when introduced to varying degrees of heat which is like badly because these puppies dont want to burn i mean maybe if youve spent fortyseven minutes giving yourself carpal tunnel syndrome on the remote control box and still cant find anything worth watching you might want to set fire to the old panasonic twentyinch with pictureinpicture but what jack learns is that this is no easy task you want to toast the tv you have to bring some serious heat so all day theyre setting fire to stuff and at night jack humps the books no suds sessions now the works getting harder and all you have to do to get your locker cleaned out is screw up one exam guys are dropping like fat men in a marathon like timmmberrrrrrr so jacks up half the night cramming ohms law the current flowing through resistance is equal to the applied voltage divided by the resistance into his brain or trying to memorize the ignition temperature of magnesium f or the length of time it will take an inch of numbertwo lumber to burn at a temperature of f fortyfive minutes like all day theyre running electrical engineers at them fire investigators at them heating contractors at them theyre even running freaking lawyers at them so at night jacks not only boning up on the explosive properties of methane the ignition temperature of magnesium and the decomposition of cellulose under an open flame ch h c heat now he also has to learn the significance of michigan v tyler and the people v calhoun and he also has to master the federal rules of evidence regarding the collection and preservation of evidence at a fire scene for the purposes of an arson prosecution dig it this is the same jack wade who couldnt forcefeed himself two chapters of moby dick and now hes writing papers covering constitutional law this is the dude who punked out of algebra and now he can tell you how much carbon monoxide will be produced by a specific mass of polyurethane burning at a given temperature jack is hanging in there very strong learns how to document a fire scene how to draw a floor plan how to overlay the progress of the fire on that plan how to take photographs what photographs to take and how to light them how to take notes how to take samples how to collect and preserve evidence how to interview suspects how to interview witnesses when to make an arrest how to testify in court guys are washing out there are more empty desks in the classrooms more available stools in their rare sessions at the bar but jack is hanging tough surprising himself taking all they can give then they bring in captain sparky his real name isnt sparky its sparks you got a guy named sparks who becomes a fireman anyway you got a tough guy you got a guy who doesnt give shit one about what anyone else thinks its jack who hangs the nickname captain sparky on him because its kind of inevitable sparky has no apparent sense of humor captain sparky is as serious as a cat scan and he tells the students right off the bat that hes out to get them captain sparky stands in front of the class in his dress blues and says gentlemen the whole reason you are here the entire purpose for providing you with this multithousanddollar education is for you to be able to go to the scene of a fire and determine its cause and origin if you should pass this class that will become the sole purpose of your professional life looks at the class like hes jesus christ telling peter hes supposed to build the church looking at them like hes thinking fat chance you dim bulbs could find your asses with both hands lets not talk about building no church anyway hopeless as they are theyre all hes got so he carries on with peoples lives futures and financial wellbeing will depend on the accuracy of your determinations as to cause and origin your conclusions will be the basis for decisions to prosecute or not to prosecute to convict or acquit to hold individuals or corporations liable or not liable in civil suits so your competence or lack thereof will be very critical to individuals and societies i will do my level best to ensure that we unleash no incompetents upon the public you will not get the benefit of the doubt this is a passfail course you pass with a grade of a anything below that you fail which intimidates jack not at all because this is basically the way he was raised you do the job right or you do it again until you do it right or you just get out so jacks like bring it on captain sparky the first rule of cause and origin the captain says and i quote and you will commit this to memory is unless all relevant accidental causes can be eliminated the fire must be declared accidental the presence of direct evidence to the contrary notwithstanding that is to say that unless you can rule out all possible accidental causes you may not conclude that the fire was intentionally set you must classify the cause of the fire as unknown now lets look at the other classifications of accidental causes natural electrical and chemical natural your basic act of god lightning wildfire the apocalypse a gimme putt because when a house gets hit by lightning electrical a major source of accidental fires jack learns so major a source that for a few days jack thinks hes studying to be an electrician theyre running electrical engineers and electrical contractors through the classroom and jacks up late at night studying standard electrical plans for your basic twobedroom twobath model home theyve got the class examining burnedout cords was the cord burned by the fire or was it the source of the fire you need to know and electrical outlets and electric blankets and fuse boxes the class learns how to determine if someone tampered with a circuit breaker in order to give the appearance of an accidental electrical fire they learn how people can accidentally set fire to their houses by overloading extension cords or leaving them where the dog can chew on them or by splicing wires or by generally trying to get more electric power than their system was designed to handle electricity is heat jack learns subject to all the physical laws and consequences thereof it is in effect an incipient smoldering phase awaiting the kiss that will send it to ignition chemical propane natural gas methane explosions then youre looking for code violations sloppy installation mechanical breakdowns once again jack feels as if hes learning a new trade because theyre bringing heating contractors in and they break down oil heaters and pumps propane tanks and insertion systems nozzles ignition systems they learn what theyre supposed to look like and what they look like when things go wrong and another chemical cause smoking in bed one of the most common causes of household fires and a beaut a kingsize polyurethane mattress has an hrr of over three times that of a big dry christmas tree so if you light one of those up its going to transfer the heat to about everything else in the room including the inhabitants so those are the three basic causes of accidental fires to determine the precise cause of origin captain sparky tells them you have to identify the point of origin point of origin is the whole game you find the origin youre almost always going to determine the cause youre going to find the frayed wire the flawed heater the mattress that looks like somebody napalmed it cause and origin is the thing which is why they make it the final exam what they do is they burn a house the faculty goes out to a condemned twobedroom ranch house on the edge of town and sets it on fire captain sparky takes the class out there and says gentlemen heres the final exam do an inspection do an investigation and determine the cause and origin get it right you pass get it wrong sayonara jacks cool with this this is the way it should be get it right or get your feet in gear jacks ready then sparky says gentlemen you are all in the same boat work together turn in a collective report as to cause and origin the correct c ampo the entire class passes the course incorrect c ampo you all fail but no you know pressure you have until tomorrow gentlemen good luck sparky tosses down a notebook giving the names and addresses of the neighbors who get paid fifty bucks each for memorizing a set of facts in case theyre asked by the students same with a pair of owners sparky tosses this down and walks off leaving the students standing there looking at this burnedout shell and thinking oh fuck when jack says lets get to work he organizes the class decides someone better do that in a hurry before fifteen men go through like a herd of elephants and trample the evidence so jacks like first thing we do is a walk around the exterior and everyone take notes ferri start taking pictures garcia how about doing a diagram krantz and stewart canvass the neighbors myers interview the owners and get it on tape some of the guys stand there looking at jack like who made you god jack says hey guys i aint flunking this course so lets get after it four in the morning theyre back in the dorm talking it over fuse box fire is what they come up with overloaded circuit breaker they have heavy char around the fuse box and the worst heat damage in the area directly above the box a big vpattern with its base as wide as the fuse box a nobrainer as far as that goes the guys that did the digout report no pour patterns on the concrete slab no spalling no signs of accelerant owners were home at the time of the fire neighbors report nothing unusual burn patterns consistent with source materials burned and not burned consistent with hrrs theyre ready to go in a class c fire accidental fire of electrical origin i dont think so jack says to groans from fourteen exhausted men the fuck you mean you dont think so ferri asks hes like annoyed i mean i dont think so jack says i think this is an incendiary fire fuckin wade seems to be the general opinion dont be an asshole wade dont be such a pain a firestorm as it were of protest which ferri leads look weve been working this for fifteenplus hours were beat dont come in here with your cop bullshit and try to make an overloaded fuse box into a federal case someone tampered with the circuit breaker jack says the plastic sheathing on the calibration screw is missing far as im concerned wade ferri says the only sheathing that was missing was what your father forgot when he knocked up your mother jack says calibration screws always have plastic sheathing on them where is it it melted off it wouldnt melt off jack says it would melt on theres no sign of that someone recalibrated the circuit breaker to do that they had to break the sheath off the calibration screw id look at the owners we looked at the owners krantz said they looked all right to us did you call the mortgage company jack asks no krantz says why not we were looking at a fuse box fire are the owners employed yeah did you check with the employers no shit jack says like hes going to bust krantz one im sorry krantz says dont be sorry jack says do your fucking job chill out ferri says you chill out jack says these assholes had a job to do and look hotshot ferri says just because you want to show off explain the missing sheathing ferri jack says anybody no takers lets vote ferri says knowing its to vote my ass jack says what are you the dictator here im right your basic awkward silence finally one of the guys the guy jack had pulled from the concrete tower says shit jack youd better be right they write up the report electrical fire deliberately caused by tampering with the circuit breaker jack walks into the classroom with the weight of the whole class on his shoulders six weeks of eighteenhour days times fourteen men thats a lot of heat captain sparky walks in and picks up the report from the desk stands reading it as fifteen guys grip sparky looks up from the report and asks are you sure this is what you want to go with jack says were sure sir ill give you another chance sparky offers go out for an hour reconsider and redo jacks like shit i walked the whole freaking class off a cliff and now sparky of all people is throwing us a rope all we have to do is reach up and grab it ferri raises his hand yes sparky says ferris got balls ferris a man he points to the report and says thats our conclusion sir well stand with it sparky shrugs like suit yourselves losers says well i gave you a chance takes a red pen and starts slashing the report jack feels like shit feels thirteen pairs of eyes burning into his back ferri looks over and shrugs like win some lose some ferris a man sparky finishes the massacre looks up and says i never thought youd get the sheath just like captain sparky jack thinks you have the right answer and he tries to sell you the wrong one just so he can flunk your collective ass class dismissed sparky says good job gentlemen graduation ceremony tomorrow try to dress like grownups fire school what a ride all of which is to say that when it comes to fire jack knows what hes doing which is why goddamn billys not concerned when jack comes into his office with a dog under his arm actually out into his office because billys sitting out beside the giant saguaro he had imported from south arizona its a billy kind of a day jack thinks hot dry and windy kind of day that reminds you that southern california is basically a desert with a few tenacious grasses over irrigation and a freaking army of gifted and dedicated mexican and japanese gardeners so billy asks smoking in bed jack says i was just starting to set up the file save you the trouble billy says he hands jack a folder jack instantly turns to the declarations page the dec page is a onesheet detailing the types and amounts of the insurance coverage a millionfive on the house no surprise there its a large elegantly crafted house overlooking the ocean the mil and a half is just for the structure the lot is probably another mil at least on the personal property the max jack thinks you can insure your personal property at a value up to half of the insurance on the structure if you have personal property worth more than that you need to get special endorsements which vale sure as hell did holy shit jack says in special endorsements what the hell did he have in the house jack asks himself to come up with in personal property and how much of it was in the west wing when did the underwriters start smoking crack jack asks be nice these endorsements are very whacked jack says its california billy shrugs which is to say of course its whacked everything is whacked how much of this stuff is destroyed dont know jack says i havent been in the house yet why not i found their dog outside jack says i thought id better get it back to them first billy hears that the dog was outside and raises a significant eyebrow sucks on his cig for a second then says it got out when the firemen came in jack shakes his head no soot no smoke fur wasnt singed because dogs are usually heroes fire breaks out they dont run they stick the dog was outside before the fire jack says dont go off halfcocked billy warns im fully cocked jack says i figure mrs vale let the dog out to do its thing and forgot about it she was hammered anyway i want to get it to the kids well youll have your chance billy says vale called a halfhour ago say what youre kidding jack says he wants you to come over now jack asks his wife has been dead for what six hours and he wants to start adjusting his claim billy snuffs out the cigarette on the rocks the butt joins its dead brothers in an arc around billys feet theyre separated billy says maybe hes not all that torn up he gives jack the address in monarch bay and strikes another match then says and jack get a statement like he has to tell him billy knows that most other adjusters would just take the sheriffs statement attach it to their reports and start adjusting the claim not jack you give a big file to jack wade hell work it to death billy figures this is because jack doesnt have a wife or kids or even a girlfriend he doesnt have to be home for dinner or to the school for a ballet recital or even out on a date jack doesnt even have an exwife so he doesnt have his every other weekend or three weeks in the summer with the kids or ihavetogettojohnnyssoccergameorhellendupbackintherapy time demands what jack does have is his job a couple of old surfboards and his car jack has no life he fits the vale file like a custommade boot jacks walking back through the lobby when carol the receptionist calls and tells him that olivia hathaway is here to see him tell her im not in jack says olivia hathaway is all he needs right now she saw your car in employee parking the receptionist says jack sighs do you have a meeting room oneseventeen the receptionist says she requested it its her favorite she likes the painting of the sailboat jack says can you look after this dog for a few minutes whats its name leo five minutes later jacks sitting in a small room across the table from olivia hathaway olivia hathaway shes a tiny woman eightyfour years of age with beautiful white hair a handsomely chiseled face and sparkling blue eyes today shes wearing an elegant white dress its about my spoons she says jack already knows this hes been dealing with olivia hathaways spoons for over three years now heres the story on olivia hathaways spoons three years ago jack gets a theft file an eightyoneyearold widow by the name of olivia hathaway has had a burglary at her little house in anaheim jack goes out there and shes waiting for him in the kitchen with tea and freshly baked sugar cookies she wont discuss the loss until jack has had two cups of tea three cookies told her his entire genealogy and received a report on what each of olivias nine grandchildren and three greatgrandchildren is doing now jack has five other loss reports to do that day but he figures shes a charming lonely old lady so hes okay with spending the extra time when she finally gets down to it it turns out that the only thing that has been stolen is her collection of spoons which is weird jack thinks but hes looking out the window at a gigantic model of the matterhorn replete with fake snow the crystal cathedral and a gigantic pair of mouse ears on a billboard so like whats weird olivias just had an appraisal done im not going to live forever you know jack and theres a matter of a will and the spoons are worth about at this point olivia gets a little weepy because four of the spoons are sterling silver handed down from her greatgrandmother in dingwall scotland she excuses herself to get a tissue and then comes back in and asks jack if theres anything that he can do to help recover her spoons jack explains that he isnt the police but that he will contact them to get a report and that all he can really do sadly is reimburse her for the loss olivia understands jack just feels like shit for her goes back to the office and calls anaheim pd for the loss report and the desk sergeant just laughs like hell and hangs up so jack punches olivia hathaway in on the plr prior loss report pronounced pillar system and finds that olivia hathaways spoons have been stolen fourteen times while insured with thirteen different insurance companies they have in fact been stolen once a year since mr hathaways death olivias spoons are whats known in the insurance business as s social security supplement the amazing thing is that thirteen out of thirteen prior insurance companies have paid the claim jack gets on the phone and calls number eleven fidelity mutual and it turns out that an old buddy named mel bornstein handled the claim did you do a plr jack asks yup and you saw the priors yup why did you pay mel laughs like hell and hangs up jack tracks down adjusters number nine ten and thirteen and theyre each pretty much in helpless hysterics when they hang up the phone three long years later jack understands why they paid an obviously phony claim but he doesnt back then back then hes in a quandary he knows what he should do by law in fact hes obligated to report the fraud to the nicb national insurance crime bureau cancel her policy and deny the claim but he just cant bring himself to turn her in and leave her without insurance what if there was a fire what if someone slipped and fell on her sidewalk what if there was a real burglary so he just decides to deny the claim and forget about it right two days after he sends her the denial letter she shows up at the office they have the same conversation roughly twice a month for the next three years she doesnt write letters she doesnt go over his head she doesnt complain to the department of insurance she doesnt sue she just keeps coming back and back and back and they always have the same conversation jack youve neglected to pay me for my spoons i didnt neglect to pay you for your spoons mrs hathaway jack says your spoons were not stolen of course they were jack right they were stolen fourteen times she sighs the neighborhood is not what it used to be jack you live outside of disneyland like be on the lookout for a large rodent carrying spoons suspect is approximately five feet tall with large circular ears and white gloves i need you to pay me for my spoons olivia says your spoons have been paid for thirteen times she thinks she has him but they have been stolen fourteen times mrs hathaway jack says are you asking me to accept that on thirteen prior occasions the spoon thieves have returned your spoons to you and that theyve been stolen again and again and again and again no please dont haul out the cookies but she does she always does she always sits there looking lovely smiling speaking softly never raising her voice and she always brings a ziploc bag of sugar cookies i know how you like these jack i cant take any cookies mrs hathaway now she says reaching into her handbag and coming out with a stack of photographs little billy has gone to junior college to study computer programming jack lowers his head and thumps it repeatedly on the table as olivia continues her recitation of the daily lives and personal development of each and every child grandchild greatgrandchild and their spouses kimmy is living in sin with a motorcycle repairman from downey thump thump jack are you listening no now jack youve neglected to pay me for my spoons i didnt neglect to pay you for your spoons your spoons were not stolen of course they were dear right they were stolen fourteen i thought kimmy was living with an electrician that was last month oh cookie no thank you now about my spoons its fortyfive more agonizing minutes of the olivia hathaway water torture drip about my spoons drip about my spoons drip before he can get rid of her and head out to vales mothers house in monarch bay monarch bay aptly named absolutely primo real estate location on the south coast monarch bay sits on the border between the towns of laguna niguel and dana point and went through bosniaesque civil strife as to which town it would belong to to most peoples surprise the residents chose dana point over the more tony laguna niguel even though dana point in those days was just the harbor and a bunch of fast food joints surf shops and cheap motels on a strip of the pch the dana point that jack loved the choice pissed a lot of people off especially the owners of the ritzcarltonlaguna niguel just down the beach who never changed the resorts name even though its technically in dana point and not laguna niguel this is fine with jack who doesnt particularly want to be associated with the beautiful resort people as far as jacks concerned the resort is basically a place for the young surf bums to work as waiters and supplement their meager incomes by screwing the rich wives that theyve otherwise serviced at lunch more than a few of whom live in the exclusive gated community of monarch bay you roll up to the gates of monarch bay in a ford taurus youd better be there to clean something youd better have some ammonia and rags in the backseat otherwise this is a gate for mercedes and jags and rollses jack does feel a little uncool in the taurus but he switched to a company car because somehow it just didnt feel right to go to a house where people have lost a loved one and show up in a mustang with a hobie on top feels disrespectful getting the company car was a hassle to get a company car you have to go to edna edna has those glasses with the little metalbead chain hanging around her neck jack says edna i need a car are you asking or telling asking we dont have any with surfboard racks on them jack smiles it was my last call of the day three arch bay so you know i do know edna says i saw the crew vacuuming the sand out what jack doesnt tell edna is that he left two sixpacks with the pool car crew for the inconvenience something he always does the guys in the crew love jack theyd do anything for jack sorry he says company cars are not for pleasure edna says pushing the keys at him i promise i wont have any pleasure in it all of a sudden edna has these images of twisted carnal goingson in the backseat of one of her cars and her hand pauses on the keys tell me you boys dont no no no no jack says taking the keys not in the backseat anyway slip thank you so jack takes a taurus to monarch bay where the guard gives the car a long look just to make a point and then asks is mr vale expecting you jack says hes expecting me the guard looks past jack on the front seat and asks youre what the dog groomer thats right i groom the dog the house is a mocktudor mansion the lawn is as manicured as a dowagers hand and a croquet set has been meticulously measured out on the grass a rose garden edges the north wall hasnt rained in three months jack thinks and the roses are dripping with moisture fresh as a blush vale meets him in the driveway hes one goodlooking man hes about sixthree jack guesses thin with black hair cut unfashionably long except somehow it looks perfectly stylish on him hes wearing a beige pullover over faded jeans and loafers no socks wirerim john lennon glasses very cool he looks younger than fortythree the face is moviestar handsome and mostly its the eyes they have a slight upward slant and theyre the grayblue color of a winter sea and intense like when vale looks at you hes trying to make you do something jack has the feeling that most people do would you be jack wade vale asks theres the slightest trace of an accent but jack cant work out what it is russian vale explains the actual name is daziatnik valeshin but who wants to sign all those checks that way sorry to meet you under these circumstances mr vale nicky vale says call me nicky nicky jack says heres leo leonid nicky yells the little dog goes nuts starts twirling around and stuff jack opens the door and leo jumps out and leaps into nickys outstretched arms again jack says im sorry about mrs vale pamela was young and very beautiful nicky says which is definitely what you want to be jack thinks if youre going to be married to a rich guy and live in a house overlooking the ocean young and beautiful is the baseline qualification you arent young and beautiful you dont even get to fill out the application still its a weird thing to say at a time like this jack says i know she did a lot of work for save the strands i know you both did nicky nods we believed in it pamela spent a lot of time in the strands painting walking with the children wed hate to see it ruined how are the children doing jack asks i believe the expression is as well as can be expected one odd fucking dude jack thinks he must see it on my face jack thinks because nicky says lets cut through the pretense jack obviously you know that pamela and i were separated i loved her the children loved her but pamela couldnt decide which she loved more her family or the bottle still i had every hope of a reconciliation we were working toward one and she was young and very beautiful and under these circumstances that is what i seem to bring to mind a protective reflex of the mind i suppose mr vale nicky in all honesty i dont know exactly what i am supposed to be feeling right now or even what i do feel all i know is that i need to put my childrens lives in order because they have been in chaos for quite some time all the more so this morning i wasnt nicky smiles and says you werent saying anything jack you are too polite but inside you are offended by my apparent lack of grief i grew up as a jew in what your news readers like to call the former soviet union i learned to watch mens eyes more than their mouths ill bet that in your world jack people lie to you all the time dont they i hear some lies more than some nicky says people can get money from you and so they lie to get it even otherwise honest people will exaggerate their loss just to cover the deductible am i right jack nods and i will probably try to do the same nicky laughs big deal ill come up with a number then youll come up with a number and well negotiate well make a deal i dont make deals jack says i just carry out the policy everyone makes deals jack not everyone nicky puts his arm around jacks shoulders i think we can work together jack wade he says i think we can do business nicky invites him in i dont want to intrude jack says im afraid youll have to nicky says he gives jack a smile that makes him a coconspirator mother made tea well jack thinks if mother made tea mother is beautiful a small perfect gem sable hair pulled back tight against the whitest skin jacks ever seen she has nickys blue eyes only darker the color of deeper water head up spine sergeant major straight no not sergeant major jack corrects himself ballet instructor shes wearing augustappropriate white a midlength summer dress edged in gold she doesnt shop in laguna jack thinks too funky and too many gays but in newport beach come labor day no matter how hot shell lose the whites and go to beige and khaki the first of november shell switch to black jack starts mrs vale valeshin mrs valeshin jack says im sorry for your loss i understand that she was smoking in bed mother says she has more of an accent and theres this slight edge like pamela deserved to choke to death in the dark jack thinks like she had it coming thats the preliminary finding jack says and drinking mother adds theres some indication that she might have been drinking jack says wont you come in she asks now that ive paid admission jack thinks the inside of the house is a museum no do not touch signs jack thinks but theyre not needed you just know like do not touch the place is immaculate the floors and furniture shine no dust would dare settle dark too like a museum darkstained hardwood floors with persian carpets oak doors moldings and window frames big old dark fireplace in contrast the living room furniture is white white sofa white wingback chairs white like a challenge white white like nobody spills here or dribbles or drops white like a statement that life can be clean if everyone just maintains discipline and pays attention and tries furniture jack thinks as ethic nicky motions for jack to sit down on the sofa jack tries to sit without leaving an indentation you have a beautiful home jack says my son bought it for me she says youve been to the house nicky says just for a preliminary look is it a total loss nicky asks most of the structure is still there jack says although theres a lot of smoke and water damage im afraid the west wing is going to have to be torn down since the coroner called nicky says ive been trying to steel my nerves to go over there and see and of course the children are terribly upset sure nicky waits for what he feels is a decent interval then asks how do we proceed with the claim like weve done our sensitive moment lets get down to business jack runs it down for him the life insurance claim is simple jack requests a death certificate from the county and once he gets it bang he writes a draft for the fire claim is a little more complicated because youre looking at three different coverages under the policy coverage a is for the structure itself jack needs to examine the house in detail and come up with an estimate of what its going to cost to rebuild coverage b is for personal property furniture appliances clothing and nicky will need to fill out a personal property inventory form to tell the company what he lost in the fire i see you also have a bunch of special endorsements added to your coverage b jack says which is a humongo understatement jack thinks special endorsements to the tune of threequarters of a million bucks and nice fat premiums for california fire and life the perpetual circle jerk jack thinks my furniture nicky says i collect eighteenthcentury english mostly george ii and iii i collect i sell i buy im afraid the bulk of my collection was in the west wing is there jack shakes his head nicky winces jack says ill need to have you complete a ppif personal property inventory form so we can sort out whats destroyed and what isnt theres no hurry on that of course i have a videotape nicky says you do just a couple of months before the fire nicky says pamela and i decided we should finally follow our agents advice and videotape the house and our belongings would that be helpful yeah that would be helpful jack thinks sure jack says where is the tape here at mothers nicky answers then nicky says you mentioned a third coverage coverage d jack says additional living expenses thats for any expenses you incur while youre out of your home rent restaurant bills that sort of thing until you get settled i can also write drafts from that coverage to give you an advance on your personal property so you can buy clothes toys for the kids how thoughtful nicky says you have plenty of insurance jack says mother says nicky and the children will be staying here until the house is rebuilt thats great jack says im charging them a month in room and board those deep blues look at him like its a challenge like shes daring him to say something something along the order jack thinks of what kind of mother charges rent to her widowed son and her homeless grandchildren jack says actually is a little low for instance if nicky were to rent an equivalent home we would pay for that daziatnik is staying here she says of course he can stay where he wants jack says im just saying that wherever he decides to stay well pay the rent she says after all why should i subsidize the insurance company no reason jack says in fact i can issue an advance of on your coverage d jack says when nicky asks now another billyism get an advance in their hands pronto people been burned out of their home get some clothes on their backs kids lose their home at least they can get some goddamn toys to play with they feel better and if they lose their mom billy well i can bring them their dog silence mother has just figured out that shes lost face by winning a battle she didnt need to fight and she doesnt like it so while shes pissed off anyway jack says im going to need to get a recorded statement it doesnt have to be today a recorded statement nicky asks why routine with any fire jack says one of goddamn billys rules in this cynical world take a statement as soon as you can get their story on the record so they cant walk away from it if theyre not involved with the fire it doesnt matter if they are well billys right again get a statement get it in detail get it early another billyism if youre planning on getting in a fight with someone its a good idea to first get their feet stuck in concrete nickys looking at him with his charming smile did you bring a tape recorder he asks you bet this is jack wade from california fire and life jack says into the tape recorder the date is august the time is pm i am taking a recorded statement from mr nicky vale and his mother mrs valeshin i am making this record with the full knowledge and permission of both mr vale and mrs valeshin is that correct that is correct nicky says correct and will you validate the date and time for me it is correct as stated nicky says then we can proceed jack says if at any time i turn off the tape i will make a note for the record of the time we go off record and the time we resume now could you each state and spell your full legal names for me its a delicate thing taking a recorded statement on the one hand you have to observe the formalities so you get a useful record that will stand up in court on the other hand its not a sworn statement or a legal proceeding so you have to walk a fine line between the formal and the casual so after they state and spell their names jack flips back into talk show mode and says mr vale nicky nicky why dont you start by giving me a little background on yourself because jack knows that the first thing you do is get the subject talking about anything it doesnt matter the idea is to get them into the habit of responding to your questions and just plain talking also you learn something right off the bat if your guy balks at talking about himself hes going to balk at everything else and then you have to wonder what hes protecting theres a more cynical reason jack knows it like every other investigator knows it the more a subject talks the more chance he has to lie to fuck up give inconsistencies lie on the record get his feet stuck in the concrete most people hang themselves its a basic truth that jack knows if youre dragged out of your bed by the cops at four in the morning and they want to talk to you about the kennedy assassination the lindbergh kidnapping or aiding and abetting freaking pontius pilate what you do is you keep your fucking mouth shut doesnt matter if they ask you your height your favorite color or what you had for breakfast that morning you keep your fucking mouth shut if they ask you if night is darker than day or whether up is higher than down you keep your fucking mouth shut there are four words and only four words you can say i want my lawyer when your lawyer gets there hell give you some sage advice hell tell you to keep your fucking mouth shut and if you do that if you follow that sage advice you will in all probability leave the police station a free man there are usually three reasons people talk one theyre scared nicky vale isnt scared two theyre stupid nicky vale isnt stupid three theyre arrogant bingo nicky vale starts talking about himself he was born in st petersburg which was leningrad when he was born but now is st petersburg again this name thing matters like shit to nicky vale because it wasnt any more giggles being a jew in leningrad than it was being a jew in st petersburg you can change your name as often as you want i should know right nicky adds but you cant change your spots and those bolshevik bastards are the same and will always be the same czarist bolshevik stalinist or glasnostnik its all the same because theyre still and always antisemites we have served nicky observes as an indispensable factor knitting the russian social fabric we have done them an enormous favor over the centuries of conflict we have provided a unifying focus of hatred so nicky grows up as an outsider excluded from sports clubs social clubs and the young communist league young nicky lives in a physical and social ghetto what we had nicky says is what those bolshevik bastards will never have a legitimate culture we had god we had literature we had music we had art we had an immutable past jack that could not change and did not change with the tides of political purges and the shifting sands of doctrine what makes a jew is the jewish past so they excluded us excluded us from what well not the army nicky gets drafted greetings jewboy heres hoping you get smacked so if you think its fun being jewish in leningrad try being a russian jew in afghanistan they hate you twice they cant figure out if they hate you more for being a russian or for being a jew its like hatred squared or cubed or something nicky doesnt help matters i was stupid nicky says i wore a star of david on a chain around my neck for what so in case im captured they can torture me twice as long but when youre young nicky survives his tour in mullahland comes home to what the same old crap so what he wants is out glasnost comes nicky says and the bastards try to curry favor by opening the gates to release people they dont want in the first place the hypocrisy is stunning to nicky but all right with him while the gate is open hes determined to walk through it mother wants to go to israel but nicky well i have seen my war nicky says ive seen enough of people being blown up and israel well to be frank young nicky has other ideas young nicky has heard of the land of dreams the land of golden sands and golden hair the land where a young man with no money and no background and little formal education but energy smarts and determination can still make a splash young nicky wants to go to california they have some family here some cousins who made the escape and live in la and are doing all right they give nicky a gig driving town cars on the airport run a couple of years of this nicky buys his own car then two then three then a usedcar lot then a parts wholesale business then he goes in with several partners and buys an old apartment building fixes it up and sells it buys another then another now he has a fleet of cars two usedcar lots and his parts business leverages them to buy an apartment complex in newport beach converts them to condos and makes a killing leaves his money on the table so to speak and buys another pretty soon hes in the crazy s real estate market sometimes buying commercial property and selling it on the same day gets into development buying raw land and developing town houses condos country clubs orange county is booming and nicky with it the only problem with americans nicky says you dont appreciate what you have here every time i hear an american running this country down i laugh hes booming and blooming enough to get into a sideline which is his true love art paintings sculpture fine furniture especially fine furniture it is to use a hackneyed phrase the craftsmanship nicky says in those days they cared about quality about the quality of the wood the quality of the workmanship attention to the smallest detail devotion to the aesthetic of the whole they built furniture to be useful to be beautiful and to last they didnt just throw it together destined for the trash heap or the yard sale and there is something about wood isnt there do you know what i mean for the sacrifice of a beautiful tree something beautiful should be created to see those fine grains of mahogany and walnut shaped into something exquisite and lasting and something that you use every day a chair a cabinet a bed you have a relationship with the wood with the woodworker with the designer you become part of the continuum of history can you understand that jack yes he really can its why he spends half his free time sanding old wooden longboards in his garage so when i made my fortune nicky says i indulged my passion i bought georgian furniture some i sold some i traded most i kept to fill my home to create a space around me that fed my soul thats my story jack russian jew turned california cabbie turned english gentleman only as they say in america only in california why only in california come on you know nicky laughs it is truly the land of dreams thats why people come here they say its the weather but its really the atmosphere if you will in california you are unhooked from time and place you can untie yourself from the bonds of history nationality culture you can free yourself from what you are to become what you want to be whatever you want to be no one will stop you scorn you criticize you because everyone else is doing the same thing everyone breathing the same ether but from our own individual clouds endlessly floating shifting and changing shape sometimes two clouds drift together then apart and then together again your own life is what you want it to be like a cloud it is what you imagine nicky stops and then laughs at himself so he says if a russian jew wants the sunshine and the freedom and the ocean and the beaches and to be an english country gentleman all at the same time in california he simply loads his house full of expensive furniture and creates his own reality so much of it gone now gone in the fire not to mention your wife jack thinks which in fact you dont mention but the fire jack says not to be offensive but please tell me where you were the night of the fire now that were you know chatting here nicky tells him like its simplicity itself i was here and he shrugs like fate is an inexplicable thing and thank god mother says the children were here when did you pick the children up jack asks about three oclock nicky says was that the usual arrangement there was no usual arrangement strictly speaking nicky says sometime middle to late afternoon and were you here from three oclock on no nicky says i believe we went out to dinner around or where how is that relevant jack shrugs i dont know at this point whats relevant and what isnt we went to the harbor house the kids like that you can have breakfast all day they had pancakes he adds im sorry i dont recall what i had with just a whiff of sarcasm what time did you get home eightthirty it was closer to mother says eight fortyfive then nicky says big pancakes says jack they are in fact nicky says you should try them i eat breakfast there almost every saturday then you know im a denver omelet guy myself nicky says we went for a walk after dinner down around the harbor what did you do after you got home nicky says im afraid we watched television the children are after all americans do you recall no nicky says the shows are all the same to me i suppose you could ask the children not me jack thinks even i couldnt ask two little kids do you recall what you were watching the night your mommy died im hardcore but im not that hardcore what time did you put the kids to bed nicky looks to his mother it was she says with a hint of disapproval its a hint but nicky picks up on it like it fell on his head summertime he says they have no school to get up for so im afraid im a bit lenient she says children need a routine jack asks what did you do after the children went to bed i am an american now too nicky laughs i watched television a movie on hbo cinemax mother corrects cinemax nicky says with a look at jack that says mothers do you recall what the movie was something with john travolta nicky says about stealing an atomic weapon very postcold war did you watch the whole thing it was quite suspenseful thats a yes yes jack turns to mother did you watch it with him am i under suspicion of something she asks no ones under suspicion of anything jack says its just the rules you have a million claim i have to ask the questions mother says i was reading a book while daziatnik watched the film but i was yes in the room with him did you go to bed after the movie jack asks nicky yes what time was that about i suppose no mother says you went out for a swim and then sat in the spa nicky smiles shes right i took a brandy out with me so you went to bed around onethirty it must have been how about you mrs valeshin jack asks did you go to bed after the movie was over she answers yes i turned the light out at one oclock so much for the prelims jack thinks he asks nicky when did you get up when the telephone rang that was the the authorities calling to inform me of the of my wifes death im sorry to have to no you are performing your job nicky says i asked you to come do just that didnt i your next question is do i recall the time yes i do when i heard the phone ringing i looked at the clock you know what fool is calling at this hour it was i am quite certain this is not the sort of thing you forget i understand jack says then i went and woke up mother nicky says i told her and we discussed how to tell the children we decided to let them sleep for a while longer i believe it was around when we woke them up to tell them so you were in bed from roughly to jack says thats correct no mother says you got up to check on the children michael was crying and i was about to get up when i heard you that was at let me guess jack thinks that was at five oclock four fortyfive okay close mother is as usual right nicky says now that she mentions it i recall that i got up to check on michael he was back asleep of course by the time i got to their room i probably stopped to use the toilet on my way back to bed jack jack asks some more questions then tells nicky that hell need tax returns and bank statements why nicky asks because i want to see if you have a financial motive for burning your house down just part of the process jack says do you think i had the house burned down nicky asks a case of jewish lightning as ive heard said i dont think anything jack says under the gaze of nickys blue eyes mother says daziatnik why dont you go get the children daziatnik goes to get the children mother gives jack her iciest smile and says perhaps i should reconsider the room and board thats between you and your son mrs valeshin he watches while she thinks for a few seconds then she says perhaps three thousand jack cant wait to go surfing let a violent ocean pound his body and clean his soul do you have children mr wade she asks no jack says no wife no kids why not jack shrugs too selfish i work i surf i work on my longboards in my garage sunday nights i do laundry when you have children she says you will understand life when you have grandchildren you will understand eternity mrs valeshin jack thinks i dont know if i could stand it if i understood life never mind eternity nicky comes in with the kids heartbreakers jack takes one look at them and hears this cracking sound in his chest sevenyearold natalie and fouryearold michael they stand one under each paternal hand picture perfect the little girl has her fathers blue eyes red and puffy now from crying black hair done in a single braid a little skirt outfit of yellow and plaid the boys eyes are brown and enormous hes also dressed for company a little skyblue polo shirt and white tennis shorts museum pieces jack thinks say hello to mr wade mother tells them they mumble a hello and jack feels embarrassed that they even have to say hello to a stranger on the same day their mother dies all he can think of to say is i brought leo hes fine the kids start to smile and then stop jack adds hes outside they dont move not a muscle not an inch and it isnt daddys hands on their shoulders jack sees its grandmas eyes they are doing whats expected jack thinks except it isnt what id expect id expect them to go tearing out that door to go hug and kiss and make a big deal over that little dog but theyre as still as statues were having tea mrs valeshin says tea for the adults lemonade for the children she gets up and comes back a minute later with a tray a pitcher of iced tea another of lemonade and five glasses she sets the tray on the coffee table pours the glasses and sits back down natalie and michael sit next to jack on the sofa he notices that theyre doing the same thing hes doing sitting on the very edge of the cushion their butts barely touching the fabric looking straight ahead the tea is sweet jack notices strong and sugary and they all sit in silence like its some sort of weird summer sacrament jack thinks the first sip or something until mrs valeshin says im raising your rent daz like its some wonderful joke oh mother well she says why should the insurance company get off lightly right mr wade we pay what we owe mrs valeshin and what company are you with california fire and life perhaps i should consider switching to you she says im with chubb now theyre a fine company jack says he imagines trying to adjust a claim in this house and decides hed rather spoon a can of drano down his throat then michael spills his lemonade lifts the glass and just misses his mouth and the lemonade goes down his shirt his shorts and onto the sofa nicky yells michael and the boy drops his glass on the carpet pandemonium cool nicky loses it totally he screams at michael you stupid boy michael sits there paralyzed in a pool of lemonade while natalie laughs hysterically shut up nicky screeches at her raises his hand and the girl stops laughing mother yells resolve and it takes jack a second to realize shes talking about carpet cleaner not some moral exhortation then she and nicky hustle into the kitchen yelling at each other like the house is on fire jack thinks then feels bad because its a poor choice of words michael gets up walks to one of the wingback chairs bends straight over at the waist and starts to sob jack doesnt know what the hell to do then he sets down his papers and goes to the boy jack picks him and holds him michael sobs against his chest and holds him tight next time jack says to him ask for grape juice natalie looks up at jack and says daddy says mommy is all burned up in a singsong voice all burned up hector ruiz has done this a couple of dozen times so its no big deal another day at the office hes driving an aerostar van with six people in the back following martin up the grand avenue entrance ramp onto the he checks his rearview mirror octavios right behind him smack where hes supposed to be in a shitbrown skylark which is good because octavio is the crucial dude in this gig octavio fucks up it could get ugly but octavio he dont fuck up octavio is a player so is jimmy dansky who for an anglo anyway is pretty trustworthy danskys cruising or better be anyway in the righthand lane on the south in a black camaro and dansky is one terrific driver which is a happy thing because the timing on this is tricky hector checks his speedometer and eases it down to thirty sees martin kick up his toyota corolla to hit the highway just as danskys camaro swerves right into the entrance lane dansky hits the horn martin slams on the brakes hector stands on his own brakes cranks the wheel to the right and just nicks martins right rear bumper looks into his rearview and here comes octavio brakes squealing and bam octavios so good man octavio is the only dude hector ever wants to make his play with man because octavio makes this sound like the big bang but only hits them at about ten miles per hour octavio leaves skid marks like an f landing on a flight deck but the impact is like minimal like ive been kissed harder the two cars look like shit though this is because hector and octavio smacked the bumpers up pretty good in the garage before putting them back on the cars matched the paint jobs and everything but then again theyre pros hector hollers into the back its showtime hector slides out of the car starts screaming in spanish at octavio whos screaming back six dudes from sinaloa in the back of the aerostar moaning oh my neck oh my back oh my neck doctor will diagnose soft tissue injuries and treat them for months refer them to physical therapy man and bill for ultrasound and massage and chiropractic sessions and all that shit that never happens except on paper hector yells at octavio you better be insured man im insured octavio yells back whos your insurance company octavio whips out his insurance card like american express only better because you dont have to pay the bill california fire and life octavio yells just like theyve done it a couple of dozen times before just another day at the office mommy is all burned up jacks so bummed he doesnt know whether to drive the car or suck on it the totally downer picture of pamela vales death smacks him in the face marriage fucked up kids off at nightmare grandmas house a lonely woman hits the vodka and the cigs and gets a longer oblivion than she was looking for tough shit he thinks so what shes not the only person who died today so why do i care its just the whole damn thing he decides its drunk pam vale burning herself up in her bedroom its bentley taking about ten minutes to call her death an accident its the grieving husband hustling to the phone to ask about his money its the allstar anal retentive mother from hell charging her widowed son and motherless grandchildren bustout retail for room and board and its the kids with their alkie mother and their shiftingcloud father and a grandmother whos about as warm as a steel ruler and its daddy says mommy is all burned up and theres this thing this feeling this suspicion this paranoia this sick thing smoldering in the back of his cynical brain the sooty glass the dog outside the bloodred flame the black smoke daddy says mommy is all burned up call me nicky jack thinks call you a sick twist telling your kids that be honest jack tells himself the main reason you dont like nicky is because hes a real estate developer one of those classic s schlock artists who made the big quick dollar throwing up shit all over the south coast shaving off the hillsides pounding out building pads on bad soil tossing up condos and apartment buildings with cheap materials and shoddy construction thats your fucking california call me nicky you invent your own california and ruin mine reinvent yourself and invent me out and now he gets nickys involvement with save the strands a fucking developer fighting development of course the vale house looks out over the strands its just a nimby thing not in my back yard i got my milliondollar view dont fuck it up i got my california shit like youre any different youre the same guy without the money its not nicky vale its me jack thinks my pathetic fucking excuse for a life which mostly consists of sifting around in the ashes of other peoples lives trying to put things back together again like that can happen like that can ever happen putting ashes together again christ listen to yourself he says fucking pathetic selfpitying burnedout cold ashes jack the ace fire guy a burnout case now thats funny the cell phone rings i shouldnt be telling you this the voice says but the voice takes him back a long way back to the days when he graduates from fire school and goes back to the sheriffs department and they put him in the fire inspectors unit jack is a comer a real potential star he works his ass off takes every seminar offered goes to fires that arent even his the joke is that every firefighter in south orange county is afraid to barbecue a burger because theyre afraid jack will show up jack he figures he has life just about dicked he has a trailer across the pch from capo beach so hes ten minutes from trestles ten minutes from dana strand and twenty from three arch bay and he can always just go across the highway to surf capo if hes pressed for time hes got a primo mustang that needed only a little bondo and he gets a yellow paint job on that hummer wires the sound system himself and puts on a rack and he is rolling rolls out to a firebombing scene one day and everything else he could want in life is standing out in front of the jewish community center waiting for him letitia del rio its hard to look good in an orange county sheriffs department deputys uniform but letty gets it done black hair an inch longer than regulation golden brown skin black eyes in a face that is stunningly beautiful and a body that is pure sex this shouldnt be a tough one for you letty says to jack as he walks up she juts her chin at a teenage skinhead being loaded into an ambulance adolf jr over there threw a molotov cocktail and set himself on fire they think its the liquid jack says not the fumes thats because they sleep through their classes she says jack shakes his head its because theyre morons well that too two minutes later he hears himself asking her out what did you say she asks i guess i asked you to dinner jack says you guess she asks im not going out on a guess would you go out to dinner with me yes jack blows out the savings account on a meal at the ritzcarlton youre trying to impress me huh she asks yeah thats good letty says im glad youre trying to impress me next date she insists on mickey ds and a movie date after that she cooks him a mexican dinner that is only the best meal hes ever had he tells her so its genetic letty says did your parents come from mexico she laughs my family was living in san juan capistrano when it was still part of spain do you speak spanish white boy a little well ill teach you some more she does she takes him into her bedroom and jack thinks he learns not only a little spanish but the entire meaning of life when she steps out of her jeans and unbuttons her white blouse shes wearing a black bra and black panties and her smile says that she knows its sexy and she looks down at the bulge in his pants and says i make you hard huh yeah good she says then smiles and says what ive got for you baby shes not kidding you can take all those classroom definitions of fire jack thinks but you dont know about heat until you have letty del rio swirling on you he reaches up to touch her breasts but she grabs his hands and pushes them down on the bed and holds them down while she keeps moving on him shes focusing his attention to just where she wants it its like once you ve been in here youre never going to want to be anywhere else you are home baby and when hes about to come she reaches underneath him and lightly strums later shell call this her mexican guitar and while hes coming shes talking dirty in spanish shes not only gorgeous and smart shes tough and hardworking and ambitious and she gets it like theyre necking on his couch in the trailer when the scanner squawks about a fire on a houseboat and after a minute letty sighs go ahead because she knows jack has never done a boat fire before lettys so cool shes even there when he gets back and she lets him tell her all about it some of their dates they go to the shooting range together where letty invariably beats him and then busts his balls about it all through dinner telling him that because he lost and she won he has to do anything she says when they get home any thing she says touching his dick with her toe then she starts murmuring en espanol what she wants him to do to her and when he asks her what it all means she says you just start doing ill let you know when you get it shes so cool she goes down to mexico with him and sleeps in the back of the truck he borrows from his dad and when they get back she says sweetie that was wonderful next time a hotel pretty soon theyre spending all of their off time together they go to the beach to movies they go out to clubs and dance they make love and talk about cases they talk about marriage and kids i want two kids she says just two what im mexican im supposed to want ten she says im one of those modern mexican women i read cosmo i read ms i give head two kids you can help me make them no im one of those oldfashioned anglo men jack says you have to marry me first maybe she says but if you want to propose to me i want the dinner the flowers jack starts saving for a ring so he has a place a car a woman and a job he loves wakes up and goes to sleep to the sound of the ocean sometimes sweetened by the sound of lettys breathing then kazzy azmekians carpet warehouse burns down its a big freaking fire so they put two guys on it jack and a more experienced guy brian bentley the atlas warehouse fire is an arson jacks in there doing his inspection and what he sees are a bunch of cleaning rags left by a baseboard heater but hes also smelling enough gas fumes to get you through new jersey on empty the night watchman some poor old semi retired guy from a secondrate rentacop company doesnt get out probably asleep in there or something and of course the smoke detectors have been disabled so the guy dies from smoke inhalation so you got an arson and a murder maybe seconddegree but still a murder and so jack wants the arsonist bad jack and bentley are in the burnedout building doing their inspection when an old mexican gentleman walks up to them and says that he heard that a man had died and he wants to do the right thing jacks bowled over like here they are standing in the black hole of this usedtobeabuilding and this man walks up like a ghost white suit white shirt and carefully knotted tie jack figures the man must have dressed up to come talk to the police because he thinks its an important thing to do the man just walks up and introduces himself im porfirio guzman he says i saw what happened mr guzman lives in the apartment building across the street hears a noise about three in the morning looks out his window and sees a man come out of the warehouse throw gasoline cans into his trunk and drive off can you describe the man jack asks him guzman got a good look at him and the car and the license plate i see him toss the cans into his trunk he says a few moments later i see the flames jack learns that mr guzman is sixtysix years old takes tickets at a local movie theater pays his rent quiet voice distinguishedlooking a real gentleman are you willing to testify to this jack asks guzman looks at him like hes crazy si he says of course hell make a hell of a witness except the guy he fingers is teddy kuhl jack and bentley bring mr guzman in to look at pictures and he picks out teddy kuhl teddys the leader of a crew of white biker trash that does odd jobs for the socalled businessmen who own shit like the atlas warehouse teddy and his crew do the odd collections extortions vandalism protection arson and murder the second jack sees mr guzman point at teddys picture and nod his head jack knows that kazzy azmekian had his own place burned down he also knows he has a problem because if guzman makes a statement or takes the stand hes going to get killed a deadsolid lock we cant let him testify jack says to bentley he dont we have no case they have an arson but no arsonist he does testify jack says hes dead bentley shrugs jacks brooding on this all the time theyre going out to pick up teddy this is not a difficult thing to do if teddys not out actually committing some hideous form of nastiness hes on the third stool from the door at cooks corner in modjeska canyon either planning some hideous form of nastiness hes about to commit or celebrating some hideous form of nastiness he just did anyway jacks working on the situation as they go over there jerk teddy off his stool cuff him and take him back to the station by the time they have teddy in the interview room jack knows what he needs to do get a confession jack grabs a cup of coffee and then goes into the room to work him teddys a real asshole he even looks like a real asshole long blond hair thinning in front a purple sleeveless tshirt to show off his arm muscles couple of tattoos one of which appears to be an anatomically correct teddy bear in a state of arousal hes even got jailhouse tattoos on his fingers which when interlocked together spell out letslove jack turns on the tape recorder and asks is it kuhl like in cool or like in mule teddy cool jack says a warehouse burned down last night teddy cool teddy shrugs says thats a real bish man jack asks what did you say thats a real bish bish bentley asks you mean bitch you got a speech impediment there teddy yeah teddy says maybe i do you fat son of a bish jack asks where were you last night what time about am fucking your mother you were at the atlas warehouse jack watches teddy thinking mulling over that if they have him at the scene its either a snitch or a witness if its a snitch hes one of the crew if its a witness your moms a drag in the sack man teddy says gives lousy head but i guess youd know that you were at the warehouse your sister on the other hand you left a gas can behind jack says got your prints on it hed told this lie once to a young amateur who had blurted out bullshit i was wearing gloves teddy doesnt go for it though wasnt me he says dont be a dumb shit jack says we got you why take a hit for kazzy azmekian he wouldnt take one for you give us azmekian well get you some credit with the da bentley chimes in theodore you have priors unless you do something to help yourself you could be looking at doubledigit time here you could be dating rosie for ten twelve years or you could write us a statement jack says like now teddy lifts his middle finger sticks it in his mouth and sucks it then points it at jack out in the hallway jack says to bentley we gotta get a statement we cant let guzman testify man knew what he was getting into bentley says teddyll have him banged out im not losing an arsonmurder bentley says jack shakes his head either we get teddys statement or we just say fuck it bentley looks at the floor for a long time finally says you do what you think you have to do the selective use of the second person doesnt elude jack he asks were together on this they look at each other while bentley thinks it over then he says yeah they go into the room bentley leans against the wall in the corner as jack sits down across the table from teddy jack turns on the tape recorder says you dont know how to write you can give it to us on tape teddy leans over the desk gets into jacks face you dont got no fuckin gas can you dont got no fuckin prints he says what you got is a fuckin witness and by the time this thing gets to trial well dont you just hate it when bad things happen to good people aint it a real bish jack turns off the tape recorder takes off his jacket and lays it on the back of the chair jacks a big guy sixfour and muscled he comes around behind teddy says teddy coooool then cups his palms and slams them against teddys ears teddy screams and slumps down in the chair holding his hands over his ears and shaking his head jack picks him up and tosses him against the wall catches him on the rebound and bounces him off the other wall does this three or four times before he lets teddy fall to the floor you set the fire teddy no jack picks teddy halfway up then drives his knee into teddys chest the air comes out of teddys lungs with a grunt that makes jack sick but its like do the job and do it right so he knees teddy two more times then shoves him down so that his head bounces off the concrete floor he backs off and teddy goes fetal dont you just hate it jack says when bad things happen to good people youre crazy man teddy moans that would be a good thing for you to keep in mind teddy jack says now are you going to give it up or do we start again i want a lawyer jack knows he has to move him and quick teddy gets a lawyer hell find out theres a murder rap hanging out and then its over did you say something jack asks because youre really tripping man bouncing off the walls pcp teddy or did you get hold of some skanky meth jack stomps on him four times hard teddy balls up cmon jack says its an arson youll get eight serve what three you can do three teddys lying on the floor sucking for breath bentleys turned away his face into the corner or do you want to start again teddy jack asks because this time im really going to hurt you i go about two twenty so if i jump and land on your back maybe i did the fire maybe i did the fire teddy says but azmekian hired me to do it and ill say that in court jack feels the weight of the world go off his shoulders hes been carrying guzmans life and he didnt want to drop it about ten seconds later teddys in the chair writing like mad gives it up totally when hes done bentley says to him asshole a guy died in the fire you just wrote yourself a murder beef which just cracks bentley up jacks down the hall he can hear bentley laughing and teddy screaming you motherfuckers you lying asshole motherfuckers gets over that though and really starts laying it on azmekian giving up other fires all kinds of shit teddys digging like a fucking gopher man trying to tunnel away from that body in the warehouse jack hes in the can puking he never lit a guy up before end of the workday he goes and finds his dad and they surf until its black out tells letty he doesnt want company that night the story on jack wade part three jacks on the stand in azmekians criminal trial jack listens to the das question turns to the jury and says the modus operandi of the fire matched that of several known arsonists including mr kuhl we brought mr kuhl in for questioning confronted him with the evidence against him and he wrote a statement confessing to setting the fire and implicating mr azmekian what sort of evidence jack nods mr kuhl left behind one of the gasoline cans at the scene and we found fingerprints that matched mr kuhls jurys eating him up was mr kuhl under any duress to sign the statement jack smiles none the da calls kuhl who looks properly criminallike in jailhouse dayglo orange kuhls in county awaiting his own trial so he has a lot riding on his testimony he doesnt get the job done on azmekian he gets to carry the dead night watchman they get through the preliminaries and then the da throws the big fat pitch across the plate did you set the fire at the atlas warehouse no goddamn billys in the gallery and he about swallows his teeth because cal fire has denied azmekians fire claim based on teddy kuhls statement azmekian filed a lawsuit of course and theyre three months from the civil trial which will be a slam dunk if azmekian has to shuffle to the stand in ankle bracelets the da isnt all that thrilled either he gulps and asks a question that provides commuter entertainment in the greater orange county legal community for weeks to come he asks you didnt nope the da goes back to his table and starts scrambling through his papers comes up with kuhls statement and starts reading it out loud then asks didnt you write this statement and testify to its truth under oath yeah kuhl says and pauses with a jailhouse jokers perfect timing but i lied jack gets this sinking feeling his career going right through the floor and into the shifter as the da croaks no further questions azmekians lawyer has a few though you said you lied in that statement mr kuhl yeah why did you lie kuhl grins at jack then says because deputy wade there was beating the crap out of me he goes on with great glee to say that wade threatened to really hurt him if he didnt give up azmekian how he would have said anything to stop the beating how he doesnt even know azmekian no sir never set eyes on him before today jacks sitting there watching this performance and wondering who got to kuhl who was so scary that teddy would trash his deal and risk a murder conviction then he hears the lawyer ask do you recognize deputy wade in this courtroom sure kuhl says the cocksuckers sitting right there the predictable hell breaks loose the judge bangs his gavel the defense attorney moves for dismissal the da demands that kuhl be arrested for perjury on the spot the defense attorney demands that jack be arrested for perjury on the spot the bailiff whispers to teddy he better not fucking say cocksucker on the stand ever again or hell whale the living shit out of him in the van the defense attorney moves for a mistrial the da moves for a mistrial the judge says theres not going to be any mistrial not on his damn calendar anyway and the next thing jack knows the judge has sent the jury off and is holding an evidentiary hearing where jack is the star witness superior court justice dennis mallon is one pissedoff judge he has the dark suspicion that someone is jerking his leash here and he thinks that person might be deputy wade so he gets jack in front of him reminds him that hes still under oath and asks in no friendly tone of voice deputy did you coerce this statement from this witness jacks problem well one of jacks many problems is that he doesnt have time to think this through if jack were more experienced he would have taken the fifth which would have tubed the prosecution but probably saved his own ass jacks not thinking that way though what hes thinking is that he has to protect his witness hes also thinking that its career felon and allworld scumbucket teddy kuhls word against his and bentleys like theyre up against a guy whos got a teddy bear with a hardon on his arm so jack decides to gut it out no your honor is there any truth to what this man kuhl is saying none your honor me and him were lying motherfuckers your honor judge mallon scowls and then the defense attorney asks permission to approach the bench he and the da and the judge all whisper and hiss stuff that jack cant hear and when the huddle breaks its the defense attorney asking jack the questions deputy wade how did you come to suspect my client of this arson his modus operandi matched that of the fire thats not true is it yes it is you said you had a gas can with my clients prints on it is that your testimony yes and did you yes which strictly speaking is true because he and bentley went out and got a gas can jammed teddys hand onto it placed it on the site and found it you planted that evidence didnt you no sir did you beat up my client no you beat this socalled confession out of him didnt you no jack hangs tough billy hayes is watching this and thinking that deputy wade is a genuine tough guy judge mallon lets jack off the stand but instructs him not to leave the courtroom jack sits in the gallery sweating bricks while theres another endless huddle at the bench the clerk makes a phone call and twenty minutes later brian bentley walks in walks right past jack without looking at him and the back of his jacket is soaked he takes the oath and the stand and the judge asks him how the statement was obtained and bentley tells him that jack wade beat the confession out of theodore kuhl bentley is sweating like a sauna as he turns into a chatty cathy doll on the stand tells about how jack told him to leave the room and when he came back in wade was stomping on theodore kuhl and threatening to really hurt him how he had pulled wade off the suspect explained to the suspect that they had an eyewitness no no no jacks mind is screeching who could place him at the scene so he might as well try to help himself and how based on that kuhl had written his statement how jack had forced kuhl to put his prints on the gasoline can and then planted that evidence and it was all so unnecessary because they did have an eyewitness i want that witness produced judge mallon tells the da no no no no yes your honor whats the witnesss name deputy bentley mr porfirio jack stands up and yells no guzman jack he wants to race out of the courtroom and get to guzman first except hes in handcuffs because the judge orders him arrested for perjury teddys sitting there grinning at him azmekian is smiling at billy hayes whos calculating how many millions it will take to settle his lawsuit bentleys on the stand wiping his brow with a handkerchief as he reaches for his spiral notepad to give up guzmans address which he does in front of god the judge and the defense attorney and when the sheriffs go to pick up mr guzman surprise hes disappeared dropped off the face of the earth jack always hopes that hes in mexico somewhere in some village by the sea drinking cold beer to some sweet canciones he knows its far more likely that teddys crew took him out and its my fault jack thinks i didnt do the job i didnt do it well and i got that good gentleman killed as teddy kuhl walks as kazzy azmekian gets two million bucks from california fire and life as jack pleads out to perjury in exchange for unsupervised probation and his uncontested dismissal from the department all through this jack doesnt say shit doesnt rat out brian bentley doesnt say a word in his own defense doesnt offer any explanations just takes the ass kicking and goes worst thing is he cant get a job any job hes a lying felon a corrupt brutal cop and with that kind of reference he cant get a gig asking would you like fries with that sir and his dads retired so thats out and then a few months later his dad dies while on a sport boat fishing off catalina and jack disappears inside himself into his trailer across the pch from capo beach and drinks beer for breakfast and surfs but after a couple of months he stops surfing letty wants to stick it out with him letty is there man she aint going anywhere she is one hundred percent solid gold she walks the talk shell even walk down the aisle with him have kids do a life she tells him that and he looks at her like shes some freakedout skell and says married what are you drunk she starts to answer no asshole you are but she swallows her temper and says i thought you wanted to get married he laughs i dont even have a job she says i have a job what youll support us sure letty says until you find something theres nothing to find its not like youre busting your ass looking unless they got jobs at the bottom of budweiser cans what do you want from me jack asks i want us to get married letty says i want us to have a life i want kids jack says i wont bring kids into this shitty world jack you got beat letty says you lost a case i lost everything not everything i got a man killed not everything jack letty yells yeah jack says what are you doing here anyway what am i doing here go away letty i dont want to i want you to no you dont letty says dont throw me away jack im too good to throw away youre too good to hold on to letty dont give me that selfpitying shit if i didnt want to be here id what are you fucking deaf im telling you to get out leave go split pintale im gone first word in spanish he ever says to her and its go away im gone she repeats good yeah good she slams the door shut behind her two months later jacks unemployment has about run out when billy hayes trots his cowboy boots up jacks steps and into the trailer where jacks slumped on the sofa drinking a beer and watching the dodgers on tv jack recognizes him as the insurance guy he jammed up so jack asks what are you here to give me shit billy says no im here to give you a goddamn job jack stares at him for a long time then says mr hayes i did everything they said i did you have some construction background goddamn billy says and you already been to fire school so you save me some money right there i figure you can make a pretty decent adjuster basically its putting peoples houses back together you want the job or not i want the job seven oclock tomorrow morning goddamn billy says and leave the beer at home i will unless you bring one for me so jack goes to work for cal fire and life twelve years later hes sitting in nicky vales mommys driveway getting a phone call from the past theres no smoke in pamela vales lungs is what the woman whispers over the phone i shouldnt be telling you this but i thought someone should know the autopsy showed no smoke in her lungs dr winston ng is thrilled to see jack go away is what ng says when jack appears in his office ng has just taken a minute to sit down and have a cup of old rancid coffee and he doesnt want to be hassled and jack wade is a hassle you had a fire fatality in here this morning jack says mrs pamela vale no kidding jack says she didnt have any smoke in her lungs who have you been talking to i dont know jack thinks but he asks did you test for carbon monoxide ng nods i tested her blood for a level of carboxyhemoglobin carbon monoxide loves red blood cells co enters the body seeks out those red blood cells and goes there in the body of a person who dies from co asphyxiation youd expect to find for instance two hundred times more co than oxygen in the red blood cells youd find a high level of carbon monoxide in the blood what was the saturation level jack asks under percent ng answers which is negligible jack knows a charred body will absorb small amounts of co through the skin postmortem lividity jack asks blueblack should have been bright red jack says carbon monoxide turns the blood bright red blisters a few ng answers small filled with air jack nods its what hed expect on a body that was dead before the fire otherwise the blisters would be larger and filled with fluid he asks rings no rings same thing a live body in a fire develops inflamed rings around the blisters not so with a dead body she was dead before the fire jack says ng pours a second cup of coffee for jack hands him the styrofoam cup and says you know she was or you wouldnt be here busting my balls im not busting your balls yeah you are ng plops down on his old wooden desk chair slides open a drawer in the gray metal desk and takes out a file tosses it on the desk and says you didnt see this jack opens the manila file and about pukes photos of pamela vale half of her anyway her legs are pretty much burned off shinbones exposed her arms are bent and pulled up her fingers clawed as if shes trying to protect herself her face is intact violet eyes open and staring jack gags hey ng says you come here busting my balls you get what you ask for shit jack says indeed ng says any thoughts for me on why we have half of her intact the leg bones are exposed jack says it would take twentyfive to thirty minutes at f for an average structural fire to burn through to the shinbones except this fire didnt burn that long but he says falldown effect probably shielded her torso and face from the flames lucky girl ng says jack makes himself look at the photos again and says she went pugilistic hes not talking about boxing exactly except for the fact that when a human body is exposed to high heat its arm and leg muscles contract the arms pulling up into a classic boxers pose one reason that it wouldnt do this would be if rigor mortis had set in rigor no no smoke in her lungs no carbon smudges around her mouth low carboxy and she went pugilistic jack says ng says she died before the fire but not long before the fire faceup or facedown faceup most people who die in a fire are found facedown its not a situation where you lie down on your back and wait for it and this is an accidental death jack asks thats what the cops say ng says and the cops would never ever lie she had alcohol in her blood yup a lot she would have been considered legally drunk enough to pass out hard to tell ng says i also found traces of barbiturates so it couldve happened jack says shes drinking and taking pills and smoking she passes out the cigarette ignites the alcohol say she is unconscious ng says shes still breathing shes inhaling smoke no this woman was dead before the fire so how did she die they sit there for a second then ng says theres no bruising around the throat no ligature marks no apparent trauma to the trachea there are no signs of a struggle as they say on tv i wanted to talk to the husband about it but his lawyer shut me down the cops wont pick it up they say its an accidental fire accidental death now you know what i know it doesnt strike you as funny that a guy gets a call that his wife died in a fire and ten minutes later he has a lawyer jack asks im an me i dont analyze live behavior ng says yes of course it strikes me as funny jack asks sexual activity those parts were consumed by the fire ng says why some sicko rapes her sets a fire ng shrugs says i saved blood and tissue samples if theres interest i can send them off to a specialist get an opinion on violent suffocation can i see the body jack asks the bodys gone ng says already i released it ng says sees the look on jacks face and says jack what do you want me to do i have a fire inspectors report that says accidental smoking in bed i have a bloodstream juiced with alcohol and barbiturates she died before the fire ng nods she drops the cigarette loses consciousness and ods before the fire ignites its all consistent if youre fishing for reasons to not pay the claim fuck you winston im sorry ng says its been a long shift that was unworthy yeah its been a day so so im calling it an overdose an accidental fire and an accidental death thats cool winston i just wanted an explanation no need to apologize how are the kids fine ng says i think theyll be glad when school starts again i know ill be glad when school starts again elaine busy ng says i hardly see her shes in that ebd phase everything but dissertation tell her i said hello you got it ng says hey you want the end of a long day darkhumor special sure mrs vale ng says theyre going to cremate her jesus jack thinks again jack watches pamela vale walk around the house its pretty eerie hes sitting in an av room back at california fire and life watching the video that nicky had given him they had to scrape her off the springs now here she is pamela vale walking around the same room thats now full of cold black ash where jack saw her blood baked onto the melted bedsprings now shes looking into the camera and talking to him very weird almost voyeuristic hes seen pictures of her charred naked body right down to the leg bones and now shes walking around talking to him young and very beautiful is that how nicky had put it and no kidding because pam vale is was jack reminds himself a very beautiful young woman its sick jack thinks because if you didnt keep yourself aware that this woman is dead youd befalling in love with her shes wearing a print sundress that shows her body she has black satin hair framing a heartshaped face but her eyes are what really get to you purple violet some shade in there that hes never seen before they grab the camera they grab your eyes and hold them and her voice is pure sex even narrating this inventory that nickys walking her through hes holding the camera and whispering instructions but its not nickys voice softly telling her what to do its her voice describing the television the vcr the paintings the sculptures the furniture that gets to jack he expected it to be that highpitched beachgirl trophywife kind of voice but it isnt its a womans voice a woman who was a wife and a mother of two kids and a manager of an expensive complicated household its a voice with some real life experience behind it and its deeper than he expected and fuller its a mature womans voice and its pure sex even in this video of nickys basically saying dig my possessions and this sexy woman is one of them she knows it you can see in her eyes that she knows what hes about but shes above it how jack wonders maybe its the kids she has the status as their mother and maybe thats enough or maybe shes just loaded anesthetized into a pleasant zonk that gets her through the day he decides the question is unanswerable and irrelevant and tries to concentrate on what shes saying and on the room the video is invaluable to jack because it shows the room before the fire its huge of course with high peaked ceilings theres the center beam and the rafters coming down off it highly polished pine flooring the wallpaper is white and rich with gold pattern striping it shouldnt work thick red draw curtains come over the sliders that lead onto the deck outside the bedroom oval gilded mirrors and old english hunting prints in walnut frames complete the effect jack rewinds the tape takes out a notebook and stops and starts the tape as he jots down pamelas narration he has nickys inventory on his lap and hes trying to match the descriptions up with the listed items and prices of nickys precious furniture she poses by a desk gesturing with both hands show them what theyll win vanna at nickys prompting she says this is a george iii mahogany pedestal desk made in about it has fluted columns at the corners and note the unusual carved scroll feet the camera pans down to the unusual carved scroll feet jack scans the inventory and finds the desk evaluated at pam continues the mirror above it is a kent mirror of carved gilded wood with a shellbacked neoclassical head this piece was made in about jack thinks she sounds like jackie kennedy giving a tour of the white house the mirrors estimated at it goes on and on this side table is circa and is clearly inspired by the italian renaissance with its carved gilded wood and gesso motifs but also note that the carved acanthus leaves on the curved legs point toward the neoclassical these are a pair of george i gilt chairs this is a george i card table this is one of our real treasures pamela says a rare bombebased redlacquered and japanned bureaucabinet from about it has clawed and hairy paw feet also serpentineshaped corners with attenuated acanthus leaves a very rare piece true enough jack thinks fiftythree grand worth of rare the camera lingers over the cabinet and jack has to admit that he admires the workmanship its all fine furniture lovingly and carefully built to last the tour goes on a pair of mahogany george ii armless chairs a hepplewhite with prince of wales feathers a gilded matthias lock rococo console table jacks scribbling notes and prices and hes also noting what he should find when he does the sift he should find he thinks handles from the cabinets maybe some remnants from the thickest part of the wood furniture from the balled and clawed feet and bases some fragments should have survived and should be found in the deep char back to the tape georgian furniture even in the bathroom a george ii dressing table a bargain at a george iii silent valet a gimmick for the cabinetry in and around the twin sinks done in walnut to match the period expensive tiled cabinet tops in mock marble the freakin towel racks done in scrolled acanthus walnut then back to the bedroom for the piece de resistance the bed outrageous calling it a fourposter jack thinks is like calling the great wall of china a fence this bed has four posts all right but each post has a gilded walnut base with royalblue inlays the bases support cylindrical posts of gilded mahogany leading up to rectangular walnut pedestals with carved angels on top the top pedestals themselves are sheathed in heavy white silk with the coat of arms of what jack figures had to be some duke or lord or something the four posts support a frame from which hang two layers of heavy draped gold fabric very old and delicate judging from the video there must have been supports across the top of the frame because a cupola of sorts sits on top of the bed the cupola is ringed with carved gilded eagles and topped off with a carved castle tower which grazes the ceiling the bed canopy is tied off to each of the posts all of which jack thinks would explain why the top part of pam vales body wasnt burned in the fire doubtless the canopy burned early and dropped down on top of her smothering the flames and protecting the top part of her body at the head of the bed is a panel painted with the coat of arms this is a very serious bed pamela vale describes it this is the pride of our collection a neoclassical bed designed by robert adam in it is all the original piece except for the mattress and box spring because we need some creature comforts you know and some of the fabric which has been replaced this piece jack flips through the inventory to find the price for a bed which is now mostly char all that old wood all that gilding all that fabric would go up like a torch maybe it would blow a hole in the roof but it would also fill pamela vales lungs full of smoke as would the rest of nicky vales fine furniture even the stuff thats in the other two wings is going to be smoke and maybe waterdamaged but right now jacks interested in whats totally lost he punches the values of the destroyed items into the calculator and change jack checks the date handwritten on the label june on june jack thinks nicky vale videotapes an inventory of all his precious belongings less than two months later theyre all burned up including his wife who in terms of cold cash is worth another so before we even talk about the structure and the rest of the personal property were looking at no wonder nickys in a hurry to settle his claim were talking major bucks here hector ruiz is pulling a rare doubleheader or a double rearender to be more precise because he has a new old van in position on the katella onramp onto the in anaheim new fake license new cargo of wetbacks octavio behind him martin in front of him dansky on the freeway a doubleheader is rare because two of these things are hard not to mention tiring ese to pull off in one day but hector and his wife are moving into a new apartment and she has her eye on this bedroom set so and hector has never been afraid of work he checks his speedometer and eases it down to thirty sees martin kick up his dodge colt to hit the highway just as danskys camaro swerves into the merge lane dansky hits the horn martin slams on the brakes hector hits his own brakes cranks the wheel to the right and just nicks martins right rear bumper i am sooo good hector thinks looks into his rearview and here comes octavio hector blinks and looks again because it isnt octavio its a gas tanker and hes got to be doing sixtyfive and the driver is standing on the brakes and you can hear those big truck brakes compressing down but they aint gonna make it man its show time hector says to himself about a halfsecond before the fuel tanker crashes into the van and both vehicles explode in a fireball that reaches high into the soft california night channel eyewitness news gets lucky and has a helicopter out there doing traffic so they get a skycam picture of the multiplefatality crash and lead with it on the oclock news it makes a hell of a teaser blue suit leans over in his chair and asks is that one of ours could be one of ours when they see jimmy dansky out there explaining to some blond reporter that there was this flash in the sky and im just lucky to be alive they know its one of theirs standing near the wreckage the reporter says something about at least eight people dead all appear to be mexican americans flower shirt looks at the burning van and says hey refried beaners youre disgusting nicky vale says to him the funerals a riot it starts off well enough jacks sitting in the back of the surf jesus episcopal church which is not the real name of course but its what the locals call it because the steeple is a curved sweep of white stone that resembles a topping wave like jesus is hip jesus is cool jesus can tube a twelvefoot point break in his sleep pray for surf and surf jesus jacks a little surprised theyre holding the service at a christian church but then he finally figures out that while nickys jewish pamela was a shiksa which is probably another reason the motherinlaw was not exactly transported with joy when her son married pam the turnouts decent the church isnt packed its a big church but theres enough people that the place doesnt look empty the mourners are mostly south county money they look healthy and prosperous in that way that shows that they work at looking healthy and prosperous they have health club bodies and tennis tans and they all know each other jack thinks as he watches them greet each other and catches bits of subdued conversations a shame about pamela into spinning now graphite handle and ive lost twelve pounds nicky is devastated reclining bicycle which doesnt put so much stress on the knees so at least there wont be a custody fight now save the kids that agony anyway cardiokickboxing theres fair turnout from save the strands jack knows this because a number of the mourners sport save the strands buttons which jack thinks is very freaking weird at a funeral there are times when you just you know give it up the family comes in from a side door at the front of the sanctuary nicky mother valeshin and the kids all dressed in black the color jack thinks of fire nicky looks particularly and theres no other word for it jack thinks elegant wideshouldered narrowlapeled silk jacket over silk trousers white collarless shirt black suede shoes its like nicky has been flipping around in the special gq mourning edition a new look for hip young widowers and taken the pages into the armani store at fashion island he has a benign griefstricken butihavetobebraveforthechildren expression on his face and he looks jack has to admit just goddamn great the dozen or so divorcees in the crowd are doing everything but actually moaning jack thinks and if nicky doesnt get laid right after the coffee cake jacks missed his bet the kids look like something out of masterpiece theatre perfectly costumed exquisitely mannered ineffably sad the minister lays a kindly hand on the kids and then takes the pulpit waits for the organ music to fade and then smiles at the congregation jack thinks he recognizes him from television he has the official television minister combedback pompadour of silver hair except this isnt one of your crackersouthern greasedback jobs this is a seventyfivedollar styling from jose ebert he has the official minister skypilot eyeglasses the black robe edged in purple and the white collar that looks weirdly like nickys anyway he finishes smiling then says were here to celebrate a life then gives the usual god is a great guy but your loved one died anyway and i have no explanation for the seeming contradiction so lets not talk about death lets talk about life and didnt pamela have a wonderful life and a loving husband and two beautiful children and wasnt she a wonderful wife and mother and life is beautiful and now pamela is with my buddy god in a better place than even south orange county and were going to scatter her ashes over the ocean that she loved so much by the strands that she loved so much and every time we look at the ocean and the strands well think of pamela and jesus loves her and god loves her and jesus loves you and god loves you and we must all love each other every day because you never know when god is going to toss the banana peel under your foot and bang you out like that and of course the minister doesnt actually say that last bit its what jack is thinking no the good doctor whatshisname i know ive seen him on the tube begging for bucks goes on about how we must all form a community to help nicky and the kids it takes a village and thank god they have a loving grandmother to help care for them and jacks looking in the rack in the pew in front of him for a barf bag and he hears the woman across the aisle from him sort of snort and then the minister looks up at the tongueandgroove red cedar ceiling and says lord jesus we pray followed by a long prayer for the soul of pamela vale and that the healing process begin for nicky and natalie and for the first time jack realizes thats mother valeshins first name and the children and then the organ plays some horror movie background piece and when jack looks up nicky is at the pulpit asking people to share memories of pamela and they do one by one about ten or so mourners stand up and tell about a day they spent with pam at the beach how pam loved the sunset how pam loved her kids one woman gets up to tell about a shopping spree she and pam went on and another about a whalewatching trip they went on but nobody wants to tell about pam drinking about pam throwing up at a party about pam driving the lexus into the big pine tree by the driveway about pam so zonked on valium they find her passed out in her car outside a garden party nobody wants to talk about the screaming fights she and nicky had about the flying goblets about the time she threw her drink in his face at that party on the boat about nicky tapping every willing divorcee bored wife and ambitious cocktail waitress on the south coast all of that has faded into the sunset that pam loved so much so everything is going just skippy jack thinks when theres a lull and nicky mistyeyed but gently bravely smiling asks if there is anyone else who would like to say anything which is when a womans voice from behind jack yells you killed my sister you son of a bitch this is pretty much when the riot starts you killed my sister nickys jaw drops to where the collar would be on his collarless shirt and jack thinks well you asked the minister looks frantically around to see if there are any reporters there especially with cameras as the woman veils again you killed my sister you son of a bitch stands there in front of surf jesus and everybody and literally points the finger at nicky the other mourners freeze in their seats they dont try to stop her or calm her down or anything because this woman is clearly intent on mayhem and no ones going to risk a tenthousanddollar nose job getting in her way two security guys do jack didnt notice them before these two guys in black suits who come down from the back of the church to like quell the situation they reach the woman just before jack does get your damn hands off me the woman yells as one of the security guys lays a thick hand on her shoulder she knocks his hand off her and then both of them grab her and start to pull her into the aisle the woman looks at the crowd in the church points at nicky again and says he killed my sister he killed pam the heavyset security guy clamps his hand over her mouth and locks his forearm across her neck let her go jack says to him the lady needs to leave guy has a russian accent shes leaving jack says the other guy tall thin but wired turns to jack you want to get involved here same accent whatever jack says the guy wants to stroke him one its in his eyes but theres something else thats saying best behavior so he backs down jack can see him memorizing his face though for future reference jack looks at the heavyset guy and repeats let her go first guy nods and the other muscle releases his grip jack says to the woman come on he killed pam everybody heard you he reaches out his hand and takes her arm come on she comes with him jack can still hear the children in the background yelling for their aunt looks down there and sees michael in tears mother valeshins face set in stone nicky looking like he could kill so does the boss muscle guy he gives jack a badass look yeah its okay with me jack says well see yeah jack walks the woman out of the church into the front seat of his car jesus letty jack says you could have told me she was your sister i shouldnt be telling you this but i thought someone should know the autopsy showed no smoke in her lungs shes still a looker jack thinks shiny black shoulderlength hair dark mexican eyes a body that wont quit makeup perfect just enough jewelry clothes perfect its hotter than hell out but shes wearing a white blazer over her jeans jack knows she wears the blazer to disguise the clipped on her belt hes halfsurprised she didnt just shoot nicky my half sister letty says same mother different father i didnt even know you had a sister jack says she wasnt around much letty says in those days she didnt want to remember that she was halflatina christ i just lost it in there its okay its not okay im supposed to be a professional letty youre not working this are you she shakes her head ng finds no smoke in her lungs he calls over to us and im catching lucky me i get to the morgue and im like oh my god its pam but i keep my mouth shut that shes my sister because i want to stay on top of what happens jesus letty you know ng ng wants to go out and interview vale right away but we better contact the fire inspectors first so they dont get their panties in a wad he gets bentley on the horn and dont fuck up my fishing you got it letty says accidental fire accidental death i ask him how come theres no smoke in her lungs and he says superheated air superheated air jack asks what he thinks she dropped her cigarette onto a hydrogen bomb i guess letty says anyway ng is like fuck bentley he gets on the phone to vale to tell him hes coming over and vales lawyer conferences in says hes representing pretty simple jack thinks letty calls bentley bentley calls vale vale calls his lawyer so anyway letty says that ends any chance of interviewing vale i mean im about ready to bring him in anyway then my boss calls me in hes been getting his ass chewed on by bentleys boss and my boss tells me sorry i dont have the stroke right now to take on the sheriffs im like the fire inspector blew it and hes i know the fire inspector blew it but bentley already filed his report that says accidental and the sheriffs isnt going to put its guy on the stand and make him eat his own report and and nothing jack letty says thats it major crimes wont take over the file and i get assigned to a missing persons on two vietnamese punks with about thirtyseven priors each get thee out and find tranh and do teach me a lesson jack knows the lesson the lesson is you dont make another deputy look bad so you called me jack says bentley said youd been fucking around over there and you knew id pursue it letty shrugs he killed her jack i know he did jack takes her by the hand says your sister died from an overdose of pills and alcohol i saw the mes report letty shakes her head she didnt drink say what jack thinks say what i mean she quit letty says had quit like over a year ago theyre sitting outside at a table at harpoon henrys down at dana point harbor their table overlooks the channel so they can sit in the sun and watch the sailboats and sportfishing boats come in and out jack had heard that the yellowtail were running like crazy and so theyre fresh and thats why he takes her here letty says she you know went to rehab that famous place where they make you take your own garbage out like thats a big deal anyway she came out she was clean doing the meetings and all that maybe she had a slip that night jack says she didnt have a slip letty says she was doing great they stop talking because the waitress comes with food grilled yellowtail tuna with roast potatoes and yellow and red peppers a minute later bob the owner is at the table to say hello to jack hows the surf he asks pretty good jack says the waters warm i think thats why were hitting the yellowtail trunk water jack says trunk water bob agrees bob this is letty its still del rio letty says im bob hows your meal its great she says well let me know if you need anything bob says he smiles at jack and takes off bobs your buddy letty asks hes a good guy he always come around to get a look at who youre fucking hey letty sorry she says whats trunk water its water thats so warm you dont need a wet suit jack answers you can go in wearing just your trunks so youre still surfing she asks jack answers work to live and live to surf he says theres a purity to the ocean a cleanliness its an absolute wow she says only half making fun of him an absolute jack says the oceans going to do what its going to do what it has been doing for millions of years with you or without you so if you go into the ocean you just deal with its absolute power which i find soul cleansing she says good for you its a big ocean which makes them both laugh and they eat in silence for a while and look out at the boats and then he gets the guts to say letty isnt it possible that she was having a real rough night and hit the bottle and the pills again no letty she shakes her head youd have to know her tell me jack says tell me about pam she wanted to be a princess is what letty tells him my little sister pam always wanted to be a princess she would make crowns from construction paper and gowns from whatever old stuff was laying around the attic and she would talk me into pulling her around in the wagon like she was cinderella and we had to get back before midnight or the wagon would turn into a pumpkin which would have been about the only thing to grow on the place were growing up on a shitpoor farm outside perris what my stepfather is mostly growing is withered lettuce withered corn and a few withered tomatoes because he doesnt have the money to irrigate we have a few cows some sheep and dad even tried raising goats for the milk products but the dairy equipment is too expensive so that goes bust too im the tomboy and pams the princess i want the chuck taylor hightops and she wants the glass slippers i want to dunk she wants to dance stepfather drinks and mi madre works a workaholic and an alcoholic and its sort of a dysfunctional trickledown theory i catch the work thing but the taste for the booze trickles down to pam but i loved her letty tells him and this you must understand jack pam was a wonderful person a loving giving dear and wonderful person when dad and mom would fight like eight nights a week id be upstairs in our bedroom trying to block out the noise and pam would come up and tell me stories to get me out of there you know its like i took care of her physically she took care of me emotionally shed tell the greatest stories about princes and princesses and fairyland and monsters and dragons and wizards and handsome knights as we got older the details changed but the basic plots stayed the same shed say how we were going to go off to college and join the same sorority and meet these totally wonderful guys and get married wed get out of perris and come here letty waves a hand around the harbor and the ocean to the gold coast where the money and the good times are and wed have money and good times and looking at her youd believe her for one thing she was dropdead gorgeous have you seen any pictures of her she was so beautiful letty says the kind of striking looks that made you think she could come out here and get guys guys with looks and money and she did jack says she did letty agrees shes seventeen when she splits a junior in high school im already with the sheriffs when she takes off for a long time i blamed myself because i got my own apartment and left her alone out on that farm anyway she cant take it anymore so without a word to anyone she splits for la gets herself a shitty little place in santa monica she shares with four other girls and gets a job serving drinks at some yahoo bar gets hit on a thousand times a night but shes not about to go out with never mind go to bed with the young guys who take turns buying pitchers she saves every cent she can and buys one good bathing suit one good day dress one good evening dress and then she hits the beach she has that jetblack hair and liz taylor eyes and the big boobs and little butt and she goes out trolling for the alist guys shes on the beach in this little black number and she gets attention she gets invited to parties and if she likes the address she goes pretty soon shes hitting so many parties she cuts her work nights down to three a week and no weekends thank you very much all she needs is rent money really because shes eating at the parties shes going out to lunch shes going out to breakfast shes hitting parties in hollywood in brentwood in beverly hills shes sailing to catalina shes doing day trips on fishing boats shes cruising down for dinners in newport beach and laguna and the girls not putting out you gotta get this jack pams not giving it up for anyone and the guys put up with it theyre so smitten she has the face and the body and the personality and shes funny and warm she has the whole package so they keep chasing and shes not getting caught pams waiting for the real thing she wants the whole cinderella deal she wants the prince and the money and she wants love shes not a gold digger jack she has plenty of opportunities but she tells me i have to love him letty i have to love him shes at a party at las brisas in laguna beach when she meets nick the restaurant sits on the edge of a cliff overlooking the ocean the jacarandas are in full scented bloom lanterns glow from trees a mexican guitar plays love songs and the moonlight sparkles on the water nick sees her and walks her outside first words out of his mouth you look like a princess his mother didnt approve letty says no kidding says jack theyve finished lunch and theyre walking along the marina hundreds of sailboats and motorboats bob with the outgoing tide a twentytwoyearold high school dropout letty says from some farm mother russia hated her if you have to marry a shiksa you cant find a rich shiksa from an established family good thing she didnt know pam was half mexican letty says she would have had a stroke maybe it wasnt such a good thing anyway mother russia hated her but nick knows hes holding the trump card grandchildren jack says you got it nick is getting up there and mother russia is getting nervous that the family name will die with her bachelor son and also the usual rumors are going around hes thirtyfive and unmarried anyway mother russia summons pam and nick into the living room of the living dead and says my son is infatuated with you but thats just because he cant get into your pants pam says mrs valeshin if he ever does get into my pants hell be more infatuated than ever this makes mother choke on her tea and gives old nick a woody that lasts at least until the honeymoon huge wedding held outside at the house they have a rabbi and a minister who talk a lot about how they share a common cultural heritage and after all jesus was a jew its plain that nicks paid them not to step too hard on the religious thing so theyre a little vague on the details but very heavy on the humanism anyway nick and pam exchange rings and step on glasses and theyre pronounced man and wife wait a second jack says you were invited as her friend letty says im ashamed to tell you that i went mi madre had already worked herself to death stepfather too drunk to give a damn and i didnt want to ruin it for her she was happy christ mother russia was freaked she wasnt jewish if theyd found out she was half mexican they would have annulled the marriage and made her do the dishes or half of them anyway splashy reception of course right there at monarch bay and i was hoping for balalaikas and guys doing that dance where they squat and kick but there is none of that this party is so orange county money you could fall asleep standing but pam she is a princess to the manor born like shes taken lessons or something what i kept hearing as i wend my numbed body around the party where did he ever find her and its said in admiration envy pams a star if the movie ends there letty says you have fucking sabrina but the movie doesnt end there jack thinks it ends the way everything ends in ashes which the wind blows into their eyes theyre standing in the driveway looking at the house its against jacks better judgment but letty wants to see it and he figures its better if hes along what theyre doing now letty says theyre taking the boat out in the ocean to scatter her ashes he doesnt want any part of her around which has been true for years letty tells him after michael was born the son a valeshin i thought i was a princess pam had told her what i am is a broodmare shes still in the hospital with michael when nick nails a waitress at the salt creek inn she hears about it from a friend who comes with flowers and spite not to like stress you darling but it doesnt end there nick has god knows how much tied up in leveraged real estate balloon payments looming then the bottom drops out orange county goes bankrupt and you cant get a construction loan at any price even money cant buy money first real estate then the furniture people cant make their mortgages theyre not going to buy george ii side tables so what was an investment becomes a collection nick gets his ego wrapped up in it the damn furniture become his possessions even on the rare occasions when he gets an offer he wont part with them and they need the money theyre so stretched out he mortgages the house at god knows what psychic cost prime interest and his balls he takes it out in coke and fucking letty says the money goes up his nose and out his dick pam becomes the quintessential lonely south county wife and starts to drink first its liquid lunches after a while shes already primed by the time lunch rolls around sobers up in the afternoons for the kids gets them dinner bathes them puts them to bed then drinks herself to sleep letty jack says i know letty says but im telling you she was sober maybe not that night jack says you know nick has the kids hes going to divorce her letty shakes her head she was divorcing him oh pam finally gets tired of it letty tells him tired of his fucking around his coke his lying his smacking her when the real estate deal falls through or when she objects to him buying a fivethousanddollar sculpture with money they dont have tired of herself too tired of the way she feels and looks and horrified that shes starting to see her kids through the longdistance smoked lens of pills and alcohol so she checks herself into rehab i dont know what went on in there letty says but pam went in a faux princess and came out a real woman she must have dealt with stuff there because she comes out shes different more real somehow warmer she starts calling inviting me over even introduces me as her half sister we speak spanish together which makes nick crazy i spend time with the kids take them to the beach take them to the country what do you know about the country jack asks i live there now letty says i bought a little place up along the ortega highway cleveland national forest are we talking about me or pam pam pam comes out of rehab warmer and strong gives nick an ultimatum straighten up or the marriage is over she hauls him into counseling that works three weeks later she comes home to find him in their bed with some coke whore from newport beach she tells nick to pack his bags and get out nick storms out and comes back an hour later with a head full of blow and beats the crap out of her princess pam would have taken it but this pam goes into court the next day and gets a restraining order throws his ass out he runs to mommy she calls pam and tells her that shell never ever get the kids shes an unfit mother the vale lawyers will take her apart youll take my kids pam says get this jack over my dead body set on fire jack thinks melted into their bed cremated again and scattered over the ocean he was terrified of a divorce letty says hes already up to his ears in debt and shes going to take half and the house and the kids daddy says mommy is all burned up you have motive jack says but he told her he was going to kill her letty says hed break into the house when she was gone and take things leave her threatening notes call her on the phone late at night and tell her he was going to kill her jesus christ she called me the morning before she died letty says she starts to cry as shes telling this he came over to pick up the kids pam had said and he whispered in my ear im coming back tonight im coming back and im going to kill you i begged her to come out and stay with me that night but she wouldnt letty says the tears pour down her face now i should have made her i should have come and stayed with her i should have letty he has the kids jack she says that rotten bastard and that bitch are going to raise her kids looks like it over my dead body letty says then she starts to cry breaks down right there and would maybe collapse except he holds her asks her do you want to come home with me she nods as theyre pulling out of the driveway jack notices a car parked on the street two guys stand by the car same guys who were in the church nickys hired security jack lives in your basic southern california neofascist gated community a walledin cluster of tileroofed condos and town houses sitting like a castle on a shavedoff hill on the corner of golden lantern and camino del avion when did you move from the trailer letty says as she gets out of her car in the guest parking slip jack says when they tore the park down to build condos i couldnt afford so i bought this place this place is a onebedroom condo on the top floor of a threecondo unit there are two units below him sort of out and away as they slope down the hill as a matter of fact the two units get a little more out and a little more away every day because theyre literally moving downhill jack explains they built this back in the boom days in the s when they couldnt throw this shit up fast enough everybody and his uncle was a contractor all of a sudden and there was big money to be made so they cut corners with a chain saw they were in too big a hurry to compact the soil properly so every building pad is on shifting ground the whole damn complex is slowly sliding downhill the homeowners association is trying to sue the contractors but theyre long gone in the recession so now the association is suing the contractors insurance company and so on and so on anyway the complex is heading back toward the ocean i thought that was only supposed to happen when the big one hits letty says the big one being the earthquake the apocalyptic event that everyone in socal jokes about and dreads it wont take the big one jack says see those hills behind us those are about the last undeveloped hillsides on the south coast theres another stretch above laguna and another one above san clemente its fire season hot dry windy and those hills are covered with brush one spark on a windy day and well be fighting the fire from the beach again itll blow down these canyons surround all these complexes some will burn down others will make it after fire season comes the rainy season we havent had a serious one in a few years but were due so say we get a big fire and the brush is burned off those slopes then the rains come the mother of all mudslides all these hillsides that they shaved off and built this crap on theyre all coming down all these condos and town houses built on shifting soil theyll collapse from the bottom up because the ground will literally give out beneath them well slide down the hill in a flow of cheap materials bad construction and mud first mother nature burns it then she flushes it youd like that jack wouldnt you theyre standing in the street by his garage beneath a row of condo buildings that are all exactly identical jack says maybe i would maybe then they wouldnt get a chance to ruin the strands theres a note on his garage door owners of onecar garages are expected to park their vehicle in that garage not in parking slots on the street the garages are intended for vehicles not surfboard workshops the homeowners association surfboard workshop i have a couple of old boards in there jack says because of the cantilevered design of the building jacks garage sits directly below his kitchen he pushes a remote button on a handheld clicker and the garage door opens with a metallic groan a surfboard workshop isnt a bad description letty thinks jack has two old longboards on sawhorses and a couple more hung up on racks the garage smells of surf wax and wood finish there are posters from old surf movies on the walls you never change jack letty says this is the best one jack says he rubs a hand along an old wooden longboard stretched across two sawhorses it has three grains of wood dark wood blended into light beautifully jointed seamless a flawless piece of work made by dale velzy back in it was your dads yeah i remember these things i can see that youre stuck in the past she says it was better then jack says okay they go up the sixteen concrete steps to his door jacks condo is plan c the admiralty to the right as you come in is a small but functional kitchen with a window that looks out at the culdesac end of the condo complex and on a clear day has a view of saddleback butte to the east to the left is a dining alcove and then a living room with a fireplace the bedroom is off the living room to the left a sliding glass door off the living room leads to a small balcony mira letty says you have some view she steps out onto his balcony yeah jack says nodding to a strip mall that sits across golden lantern down to the right i can see hughes market burger king and the dry cleaners in a west wind i can smell the grease from burger king an east wind i get garlic from the italian place come on letty says because the view from the balcony is spectacular disregard the strip mall and the condos down the slope and look straight ahead and you have miles of ocean horizon you can see catalina island to the right and san clemente island straight ahead dana point harbor is behind a knoll just to the left and then its open coast all the way down to mexico you must have some great sunsets letty says its pretty jack says in the winter the ocean rises up like this big blue bar of color its two miles away but at least i can see it are you kidding this is a milliondollar view the place cost him cheap by local standards letty says i think im going to start crying again do you want someone with you or do you want to be alone alone hes about to say mi casa es su casa but thinks better of it the place is yours jack says i dont mean to kick you out i have things i can do downstairs he says if you need me stamp on the floor or something ill hear you okay he gets out quick because even saying okay her voice quivers and her eyes are full so he goes down in the garage and works on the board takes a sheet of sandpaper folds it over a block of wood and runs it up and down the length of the board slowly lightly he gets into a rhythm sanding the old balsa down to a high smooth finish upstairs he can hear her sobbing sobbing and yelling and throwing pillows and stuff and he half expects to get a call from the association telling him that his condo is a residence not a funeral home or a shrinks office and that open displays of grief are in violation of the cc amprs its an hour and a half before it gets quiet up there jack waits another twenty minutes and then goes up shes asleep on his couch her face is puffy and her eyes are slits but theyre closed anyway her black hair is splayed out on the pillow watching her sleep is something wonderful and painful letty asleep is like an underground fire placid and beautiful on the surface but something always smoldering underneath waiting to ignite he remembers that from when they were together and hed wake up earlier and look at her lying there and hed ask himself what he ever did that someone that beautiful and that good could be with him and twelve years later he thinks im still in love with you so what he thinks i threw you away like something tossed into the ocean and now a wave washes up on my little stretch of the beach life giving you back something you dont deserve dont get carried away he thinks take a step away from yourself shes not back because she loves you shes back because she needs you because there was a fire and her sister died he gets a spare blanket from the hall closet and puts it over her her story doesnt change a thing pam had a history of alcoholism a history of pills her blood tested positive for both nothing letty says can change that story the only thing that can really tell the story jack knows is the fire fire has a language its small wonder jack thinks that they refer to tongues of flame because fire will talk to you it will talk to you while its burning color of flame color of smoke rate of spread the sounds it makes while it burns different substances and it will leave a written account of itself after its burned out fire is its own historian its so damned proud of itself jack thinks that it just cant help telling you about what it did and how it did it which is why first thing the next morning jack is in the vales bedroom he stands there in that dark fatal room and he can hear the fire whispering to him challenging him taunting him like read me youre so smart ive left it all here for you but you have to know the language you have to speak my tongue its okay with me jack thinks i speak fluent fire start with the bed because bentley called it the point of origin and because thats just what it looks like they had to scrape her off the springs in fact jack can see the traces of dried blood on the metal can smell the unmistakable smell of a burned body and the bedsprings themselves twisted congealed it takes a hot fire to do that jack knows this kind of metal only starts to melt at f thats the fire telling you im bad baby im a badass fire and i did her in the bed then theres the hole in the roof whats known in the trade as a bleve a boiling liquid evaporation explosion also known as a chimney effect the fire ignites at the point of origin and the superheated gases rise and form a fireball the fireball hits the ceiling and boom which certainly means that something hot and heavy happened around the bed fire saying im so bad you cant even keep me in the room jack im so big and bad i have to fly break out baby show my stuff to the sky jack looks down and sees where bentley dug through the ashes on the floor by the left side of the bed and he can see the vodka stain the spalling literally burned into the wood floor he can see some shards of smoked oily glass including the neck of the bottle he can see where bentley got his theory but the lazy bastard just stopped there saw an instaanswer and grabbed at it so he could start packing for the big fishing trip so jack keeps looking not only because he thinks bentley is a cretin not only because of lettys story but also because its just laziness to repeat someone elses work thats where mistakes if indeed there is a mistake here get perpetuated one lazy bastard after another copying each others work a circle jerk of error so start again start from scratch with no preconceptions and listen to the fire the first thing that the fire is telling him is that it burned a whole lot of stuff in this room because jacks standing in char up to his ankles he clips his dictaphone inside his shirt and starts talking notes note ankledeep char jack says indicates the probability of heavy fuel load whether primarily live load or dead load i cant tell at this point the heavy char tells jack something else he isnt going to speak into the tape usually heavy char means a hot fast fire simply because it shows that fire had the chance to burn a lot of stuff fast before the fire department could get there and put it out so the next thing he looks at is the char pattern if fire has a language then the char pattern is its grammar its sentence structure its subjectverbobject and the sentences this pattern is banging out are like kerouac on speed because its like verbverbverb its talking about a fire that was moving man not stopping for periods or commas or nothing jacks thinking that this fire was rolling because jacks looking at whats known in the business as alligator char it looks like what it sounds like the skin of an alligator what happens is that a hot fire moves fast it burns quickly and moves on so it leaves sharp lines of demarcation between what it burns and what it doesnt turns out looking like alligator skin the hotter the fire the faster it burns the bigger the alligator you got jacks looking at one big alligator here he scans the charred remains of what had been the expensive whiteandgold wallpaper which is going to cost a bundle to replace and he questions whether this wallpaper pricey as it was was sufficient fuel to feed this hungry an alligator he doesnt say that into the tape recorder though he keeps those thoughts to himself what he says into the recorder is moving along the west wall of the bedroom i observe large alligatortype char observing its one thing recording its another because the room is black and black photographs like nothing so jack hauls out his portable flash unit and starts painting the room with the light he stands in one corner and looks through the camera viewfinder as he moves the light out from one wall toward the center of the room he observes where the light fades so he knows where hell need to start for the next shot he snaps his shots color and blackandwhite and then moves the flash in toward the center of the room then he moves to another corner and repeats the process and so on and so forth until he has the room covered he jots down a note for every shot he takes and speaks what hes doing into the tape recorder then he draws a rough sketch of the room and notes where he was standing for each shot and what part of the room the shot covered so when the smartass lawyer asks him you dont really know that you were standing in the southwest corner when you took this photograph do you jack can whip out the notebook and say actually i do counselor because its my practice to make notes of my location when because the point is jack thinks that you have to do it every time take your time do it right go on to the next task so the next thing he does is measures gets out a steel tape and measures the dimensions of the room and notes certain landmarks from which he can triangulate he has a number of marks to do it from because the big furniture in the room left heat shadows pale marks on the wall reverse silhouettes if you will where the heavy furniture shielded the wall from the initial flashover so he uses two of the heat shadows as triangulation points and moves on goes back to listening to the fire what else does the fire have to say the char on the rafters same thing alligator char on the wood sharp lines of demarcation between the bottom edge of the rafters which is heavily charred and the top edge which isnt nothing unusual there jack thinks fire burns up so youd expect to see the bottom edges of the rafters more heavily charred than the top and youd expect to see the heaviest char directly above the bed where the fire burned the longest what you wouldnt necessarily expect is what jacks seeing and that is that there are several areas of the rafters that are showing heavier char than others one over by the opposite wall one by the closet another by the door that leads into the bathroom note heavy char on rafters above bed jack says sharp lines of demarcation note also heavier char on rafters near closet and near entrance to bathroom jack takes out a steel ruler and jams it into the middle of a char blister on the rafter above the bed char is one and threeeighths inches deep on rafter above bed he says and then does the same for the other two areas one and threeeighths on area near closet one and threeeighths on area by entrance to bathroom then he measures two points in the rafters that look less heavily charred the char is an inch deep which is interesting jack thinks because there cant be three places where the fire burned the longest not accidentally of course there could be other explanations depends on what was sitting under those charred rafters maybe there was something really tasty for the alligator something that burned hot and deep and long that could explain the apparent anomaly then again the dog was out in the yard when it wasnt supposed to be and the flames were the wrong color and the smoke was the wrong color that combined with three hot spots on the rafters is starting to get jack pissed off jack knows what bentley did bentley looked at the hole in the roof above the bed looked at the heavy char on the rafters above the bed dug the ashes from around the bed and saw that the fire had burned into the floor saw the broken vodka bottle and the burned mattress and the twisted bedsprings and figured he had his point of origin because there should be only one point of origin and smoking in bed is the numberone cause of fatal bedroom fires which is good as far as it goes jack thinks but it doesnt go far enough so jack goes looking for vpatterns fire burns up and out like a v it ignites at the base of the v and flames up because fire burns up where the oxygen is and out as the atmosphere in the room tries to equalize the heat and pressure it burns up and out from its point of origin and often it leaves a vpattern mark in which case the fire points to where it started now when a fire starts in the middle of the room youre not going to see a vpattern because theres no surface for the fire to mark when a fire starts away from a wall what youd expect to see instead of a vpattern is a circular pattern on the ceiling above the point of origin which there certainly is above the bed theres not only a circular burn pattern theres a freaking hole blown through the roof but theres also ankledeep ash and deeper char on several places on the rafters and theres a hole in the roof and theres a dog barking outside jack starts in what used to be the closet the closet is a walkin or a hikein because this closet is maybe a little smaller than delaware and calfdeep in ash which jack would expect because theres a lot of stuff in closets thats the purpose of a closet right to put stuff in it and because this is a humongous walkin closet belonging to rich people youre going to expect that the alligator had a banquet in here especially if you have clothes hanging from a pole because fabrics are tasty to eat and you also have a lot of nice oxygen underneath them and youre going to have a lot of ash because youre going to have a lot of fall down fall down is just what it sounds like its stuff that burns and then falls down onto the floor again the basic principle of fire is that it burns up it burns up seeking oxygen and fuel insufficient oxygen the fire smothers insufficient fuel the fire burns out the situation a fire really likes is when it can burn upward and find fuel there fuel like clothing fuel like boxes stored on shelves and then the shelves themselves so the fire zooms up and consumes those things and the carbonized material char falls down on the floor a lot of times theres enough fall down to smother the fire on the floor thats why you can go into a fire site and the ceiling is burned but the floor where the fire started isnt see sometimes fire will go up and then across the fire isnt even burning across the floor its up along the ceiling where the fuel is it burns the nice fuel up there and gets hotter and hungrier and then you have whats known as the convection effect the fire up top generates so much heat that the heat not the flame ignites the material on the floor and then the floor goes up but it all has to start somewhere which is at the base of a v and the reason jacks looking in the closet is because jack is a cynical bastard a cynical bastard thinks that if someone is going to start a fire the closet is a good place to do it because its not immediately visible and the falldown effect often obscures the evidence so jacks down on his knees digging away the ash at the back wall of the closet and it doesnt take long before he finds what hes looking for a tall narrow v marking on the wall important that its narrow instead of wide a wide v is the fire telling you that it spread normally just the usual grazing on the usual feed a narrow v is the fire telling you something else the fire saying i was hot i was fast something else with this v the apex doesnt come to a point it looks like a v with the point cut off more like v which is the fire hinting to jack yo dude maybe i had a little help a little boost maybe i had me a little something to get me you know started in an accidental fire the v will be pointed but if the fire had a little help say if someone poured an accelerant on the floor then the apex of the v is going to be as wide as the pool of the accelerant because you dont so much have a point of origin as you have a pool of origin all of which ignites at the same moment so now jack thinks we have not just one point of origin we have at least two which is one too many if theres one thing jack knows about an accidental fire its that it has one count them one point of origin an accidental fire doesnt start accidentally in two places its not possible jack pushes aside the charred remains of what appears to have been some coats on the floor by the wall at the bottom of the v could swear he hears the fire laughing because theres a hole in the flooring as wide as the base of the v which makes jack think that maybe letty is right maybe pam was murdered letty del rio is standing in a chop shop in garden grove hip deep in cutup cars and shes got five vietnamese kids against the wall with plastic ties around their wrists and not one of the jokers will tell her anything about what she wants to know that is what were tranh and do up to when they did their duet houdini act and she doesnt really want to run these boys in for the cars because it is a major pain in the ass for little results but thats what shes going to do unless they start showing a marked improvement in their attitude letty says to the interpreter tell them theyll get five to eight on the cars she unwraps a stick of gum and pops the juicy fruit into her mouth as the interpreter translates her threat and gets a response they say theyll get probation he tells her no she says tell them ill personally fuck them with the judge tell them that he tells them that he gets their answer and says they say your sex life is your business cute boys letty says very cute boys tell the cute boys they better not have sheets because ill rattle their probation officers cage until he violates them tell them ill make sure they get into one of those toughlove juvenile boot camps where they do pushups till they puke no dont tell them that i know they speak english shit letty thinks these kids were born right here in little saigon which is technically in california but in reallife terms is still in the republic of south vietnam they all speak english until they get popped then they dummy up and go for the interpreter bit because they know its hard for a prosecuting attorney to work up any mojo when he has to wait for the translation it pisses letty off you speak english dont you she says to the kid who looks the oldest the kid whos been giving the other kids the shutyourmouths looks checks his id and the kids name is tony ky im looking for tranh and do and i know they were involved with your little parts dealership here so im going to bring the heat on you and im not ever going to stop bringing the heat until you help me out no dont say a word to the interpreter i dont need your smart mouth you just think about what im telling you like its going to do any good letty thinks this is a closed world little saigon and it aint going to open up for her so shes pissed off at these kids and shes pissed off at her boss for sending a latina into a closed asian male world like theyre going to talk to me she thinks and shes also pissed off that shes going to have to go talk to uncle nguyen who is the one person who could open up mouths for her and uncle nguyen just gives her a headache uncle nguyen used to be a cop back in big saigon the old saigon so he has this annoying wereallcops camaraderie bullshit and he also isnt going to tell her a thing or tell anyone else to tell her a thing shit if tranh and do have been whacked uncle nguyen would have had to okay them getting whacked so thats probably a dead end but its a street she has to walk down to make the boss happy but ill get a headache she thinks she tells the uniforms to take the kids in and then she starts searching the shop the thing you have to love about the vietnamese letty thinks is that they keep records here they have this beautiful scam going stealing each others cars and stripping them selling the parts and collecting the insurance and they just have to keep lists of whose cars they stole and how much they paid thinking like the oldtime bookies that they can flash the paper before the cops come through the door sorry you lose deputy del rio is faster than your average cop smarter too and much faster and smarter than your average fuckedup kid who doesnt have the cojones to at least try to get himself into a junior college or something and chops cars instead letty has no sympathy so lettys poking around the shop looking for the record books and she collects every slip of paper in the joint logs them in as potential evidence and has them translated tells the translator i want to see right away anything with the names tranh or do on it which letty thinks is kind of like standing down in chula vista and saying you want to see anything with the name gonzalez on it but what are you going to do fire burns up because thats where the oxygen is fire burns up unless it has a reason to burn down jack knows that theres a limited universe of possibilities as to what that reason could be anything poured on the floor to get a fire going in the lingo an accelerant seeps down as any liquid will down into the flooring and the fire follows follows down because now it has a reason the accelerant which is better fuel than oxygen the fire eats up that nice tasty accelerant gasoline kerosene styrene benzene and then burns up fast hot and mean so jacks looking at this hole in the flooring about two feet long and a foot wide where the fire burned through and hes wondering why he shines his light into the hole and onto the floor joist the top of the joist directly beneath the hole is charred the bottom looks unaffected jack leans over and shines the light onto the joist just beyond the hole sees what he expects to see fingershaped stains on the top part of the joist note splatter pattern on joist beneath hole in closet flooring he says into the tape thats all he doesnt say that this is what youd expect to see in an accelerated fire the splatter pattern where the poured accelerant has seeped through the flooring and along and into the joist fucking bentley jack thinks lazy fucking bentley sees his point of origin brushes some ash aside and pronounces cause and origin gets the poles out and goes fishing doesnt bother to look doesnt bother to do a digout you have to dig out the char before you can determine the cause of the fire at least this is what jack was always taught you have to do a digout and not just where you think the point of origin is but over the whole structure see its hard to burn a house most people think that its easy but most people are wrong a fire needs a lot of oxygen and a lot of fuel to get big and grow strong and in a lot of house fires there just isnt the oxygen or the fuel load to sustain a real hummer of a fire arson fires that jack has worked he goes in and finds holes punched in the walls to vent the fire or windows left open he once investigated a fire in a house that was under construction and theyd taken the frigging drywall out so that the fire would have enough oxygen to spread through the house and it isnt just a matter of oxygen and fuel load its a matter of time time before the fire trucks roll in in the old days it was different the country was more rural houses were farther away from the fire stations nobody had automatic alarms and sprinkler systems and all that happy crap but now especially in the southern california megalopolis everything is wired everybodys hooked in a fire goes off it trips the sprinkler system it trips the security alarm the fire department is at most ten minutes away and firefighters arrive in force you want to burn a structure down or burn out a wing of your house youre in a game of beat the clock you start the fire in just one spot youre bound to lose that game the unrelenting math of physics is just against you you have to reset the math you do it two ways first you accelerate the fire you generally take some fossil fuel and ignite a fire thats more hare than tortoise the other thing you do is you set more than one fire an arson fire is usually not a single fire but several fires because it has more than one point of origin you need more than one because even a highly accelerated single fire is not going to do the damage you need before it runs out of clock you need several accelerated fires to a get to the areas you want destroyed and b to increase the total amount of btus to get your convection effect working for you get enough heat going in the structure so that the flames dont necessarily have to spread the fire the heat will reach the ignition point of the materials in the structure and then whoosh flashover phase the fire out of control the alligator in a feeding frenzy orgasm as fuller would have put it of course jack knows that the convection effect doesnt always happen that way a guy sets two or three fires and one or two of them die out before they get the necessary heat going so what a lot of arsonists will do is connect the fires so the flames move through the structure so they pour accelerant from one place to the other or sometimes they make whats known in the business as trailers often bedsheets twisted up and run through the house from pool of accelerant to pool of accelerant a little highway for the fire to get up some speed and the evidence burns itself up unless you speak fire in which case the evidence is there like a hole in the flooring and a splatter pattern on the joists showing that the fire burned down instead of up physics jack thinks never lies the laws of nature are laws that even plaintiff attorneys and judges cant overrule you throw a ball up in the air it comes down you get under a wave it rolls you on the bottom fire ignites and burns up unless it has a physical reason to burn down jack kneels there sweating inside his white paper overalls the smell of ash penetrating his sinuses and part of him wishes he were out in the cold blue water under a cool blue sky instead of kneedeep in ash in a closed black room that smells like fire and death he goes through the whole photography process again lighting and shooting the vpattern the hole the joist and the closet as a whole in color and blackandwhite records the information on his notes and into the microphone when hes done with all that he takes out a plastic evidence bag from the overalls some guys like to use paint cans but jack worries that the metal in the cans could contaminate the samples likewise your basic grocery store ziploc bags so jack buys special evidence bags which have been treated and sterilized theyre more expensive but he figures that in the long run theyre a lot cheaper than having your samples kicked out of court he scoops some char out of the hole and places it in the bag seals the bag and then labels it giving the date time description and exact location where the sample was taken then he signs the label he records the same information into his notebook and speaks it into the tape recorder jack being a beltandsuspenders kind of guy he repeats this process several more times taking a small chunk of the joist the flooring itself and then a char sample from a different part of the closet away from the vpattern and the hole he takes material from an area he thinks will be clean in order to get a comparison sample hopefully one that doesnt contain an accelerant otherwise if the samples do test positive for accelerants the argument can be made that theyre inherent in the wood itself pine flooring for example can have a lot of turpentine in it so you try to get a clean sample to show the difference he takes samples from several locations around the room im going to have to do a digout jack thinks the whole room literally dig out all the char in the room to expose the flooring to see holes potential pour patterns spalling on the concrete slab below the floor all indicia as they say in the trade of an accelerated fire he picks up his shovel and starts to dig beginning in the closet figures hell start in that corner where he knows that theres a problem and then work his way out across the whole bedroom he scoops up char and tosses it into one of the large plastic garbage cans he brought with him hell need the char later when he goes to do the sift as he digs he sometimes scoops up larger pieces of material partially burned clothing pieces of appliances remnants of furniture he sets aside the larger pieces some brass cabinet handles copper hasps a claw handle foot but records all of them in his notes he sketches the location of the larger pieces on his floor plan photographs them and puts them into plastic evidence bags all of this takes time when hes done digging out the open floor space hes exposed whats left of the flooring stands back and takes a look and the fire is really talking the pour pattern that starts in the closet leads to the bed go figure jack says if bentley had done his fucking job he might have traced it back the other way from the vodka pour back to the closet but he didnt jack did and to jack what hes looking at now is like reading a book someone poured a great deal of accelerant in the closet jack knows this because the flooring is burned clear through exposing the concrete pad beneath then someone poured a trail of accelerant from the closet over to the bed jack can see the pour pattern a pale spalling on the wood here and there a hole where the fire burned the hottest but theres no hole beside the bed where the remnants of the vodka bottle were whoever poured the juice was careful not to pour it there jack lifts up the charred mattress and spring and moves them over what hed expect to see underneath would be a relatively undamaged floor again youre talking about the falldown effect if the fire started on the floor beside the bed it would have ignited the wood frame of the bed when the frame collapsed the mattress and box spring would have dropped down shielding the floor beneath but thats not what he sees not what he hears either because the fire is talking to him again yapping at him chirping at him i did her right here baby i did her right in her bed blew through the freaking roof baby because theres heavy ash where there shouldnt be jack digs through the ash underneath it theres a big hole irregularly shaped but roughly the size of the bed wider in fact on the side opposite the bottle remnants jack keeps digging digs right down through the flooring to the concrete pad beneath scoops the char off the pad and what he sees is a white stain where the concrete was scorched spalling its another sign of a set fire because once again fire burns up unless it has a reason to burn down you have spalling like this you have juice dripping down onto the concrete luring the alligator down for a snack so jacks standing there and he has the hole beneath him and above him theres the hole in the roof jesus christ jack says the fire is screaming at him feels like its coming from inside his soul whoever set the fire poured accelerant under the bed then doused pamela vale with it doused it from her hips down her legs then lit a match no professional arsonist does that jack thinks not on a strictly business fire anyway you douse a woman in a bed like that its personal its sexual it comes out of rage jack goes through his whole routine again photographs the floor in blackandwhite and color logs the photos videos the room then sketches the pour pattern onto a floor plan of the room belt and suspenders because he wants a lot of evidence to go in front of a jury the best thing would be if the jury could visit the site but he knows thats not likely to happen for one thing the chances of getting an injunction against demolition and reconstruction of this room are practically nil and two judges rarely allow a site visit especially when theres been a fatality it could prove to be too emotional and prejudice the jury what it could prove jack thinks is that nicky vale burned his wife up in their marital bed if i could walk a jury through this place and explain to them what theyre seeing but fat chance of that so he documents the scene the best he can photos video sketches then grabs samples from around the pour pattern and under the bed for each potential dirty sample a potential clean one for comparison he puts them into plastic evidence bags and logs them in the samples are everything now if the samples test positive for accelerants it makes total bullshit out of the smokinginbed theory then its not an accidental fire or an accidental death its arson and murder jack heads off to see accidentally bentley tell him he needs to reopen the vale file you got it wrong again you dumb lazy fuck is what jack wants to say to accidentally bentley but jack doesnt figure thats exactly diplomatic so he settles for i think you might want to reconsider your call on the vale fire get out of here bentley says hes sitting at his desk at the sheriffs office actually hes cleaning out his desk and what he means by get out of here is not youre kidding what he means is get out of here bentley jerks his thumb toward the door which looks good to jack too but he reminds himself that hes here to try to get bentley to reopen the investigation so he takes a breath and says brian the house has all the indicators such as deep char there was a lot of stuff in the house alligator char on the beams old wives tale bentley says he doesnt even look at jack hes busy putting stuff into a cardboard box could mean something could mean nothing spalling on the concrete pad same the damn bed frame was annealed bentley puts a coffee mug in the box jack if youre saying this was a hot fire okay it was a hot fire im telling you there was a fuel load in that place could have burned chicago now get out of here a couple of deputies standing at another desk look over i found a pour pattern jack says there was no pour pattern you didnt do a digout didnt need to do a digout the hell you mean you didnt need to do a digout the deputies are watching now ready to step in if this guy needs moving bentley yells back the deceased was smoking in bed the most common cause of fire fatality there is there was no smoke in her lungs jack yells less than percent co in her blood she was drinking bentley hollers she was bombed on booze and pills she odd but first she went around the room pouring accelerants jack asks gives herself her own viking funeral come on brian the fuck you talking about accelerants i took debris samples and theyre going to come up positive bullshit and i just want to give you a chance to back off your call first well youre a hell of a guy jack bentley says but im not backing off shit now go back to cheating widows and orphans you need to reopen you just cant stand being an insurance adjuster can you bentley says you still wanna be a cop well youre not jack they threw you out remember i remember jack thinks yeah he says i remember you going bellyup on the stand bentley grabs him by the shirt jack grabs back the two deputies move in to separate them so they have a real little scrum going when letty comes around the corner jack for christs sake hey jack bentley says maybe you can beat a confession out of him you dont do your job i told you not to dick around jack with shit you dont know any you dumb lazy jack letty takes him by the elbow and walks him up against the wall what are you doing she asks jack takes a deep breath i came to try to get him to back off his report she gives him a quizzical look the fire was an arson he says oh you two are together on this huh bentley says what are you jack doing her again jack starts for him but letty stands in his way let him go bentley says letty says like you want me to and you was told to stay out of this del rio bentley says she was my sister she was stoned and drunk and she torched herself bentley says jack says if youd do your fucking job for once get out of here bentley yells hes straightening out his shirt and patting his hair back into place hes leaving letty says she holds a hand up to the two deputies who are about to escort jack from the building she keeps her hand on his elbow as she walks him down the hall they can both hear bentley yelling youre an asshole jack he might have something there letty says probably probably letty chuckles then says arson i wont be sure until the sample tests but jack says then he asks could pam have done that letty could she have been so down shed take herself out and the house along with her pam would never have killed herself how the kids letty says she never would have left the kids she was very drunk letty shakes her head he killed her jack letty he killed her she says then youd better get out of here he gets into his car and drives off when she gets back into the office bentley asks her so hows the old boyfriend shut up you dumb lazy fuck letty says dinesh adjati looks like bambi not the older bambi jack thinks the one who kicks the rival bucks ass at the end of the movie but the younger bambi thumpers little buddy dinesh has these big brown bambi eyes and long eyelashes and hes slender and has brown skin however he also has a ph d in chemical engineering so to the extent that he resembles bambi hes doctor bambi dinesh works for an outfit called disaster inc disaster inc is the company you call when something goes very wrong you want to know why a train wreck happened a bridge collapsed a bus plunged into a river or a fire happened you call disaster inc any catastrophe theyll tell you why it happened disaster inc gives its clients a disaster of the month calendar every year but jacks never known anyone sick enough to actually have it on his wall the calendar features slick technicolor glossies of that months featured disaster along with a daily chronicle of past human tragedies like hindenburg explodes chicago school fire and a mockup of vesuvius erupts which goddamn billy amended to read vesuvius erupts and disaster inc not there to bill for it disaster inc has done some very serious billing in the s because the decade has been chockfull of disasters in california alone you had the fires malibu laguna sherman oaks and the good citizens of those towns wanted to know what caused the fires to spread so quickly and burn down so many homes then the mother of all disasters hit the northridge earthquake it took thirty seconds of january to drain a third of cal fire and lifes reserves and make the owners of disaster inc rich men dinesh got one whomper of a bonus because hes the fire guy at disaster and he billed a lot of hours figuring out the cause of fires that broke out in the aftermath of the quake a lot of people didnt have earthquake insurance but they did have fire insurance so a lot of buildings went up in spontaneous combustion that day jack himself knew a lot of insurance claims guys who had figured out how to get total earthquake coverage for a buck sixtyfive you set a gallon of gas on top of your furnace and when the shaking starts abracadabra kaboom earthquake coverage but most people hadnt figured that out and so were running around pouring accelerants all over their rubble and thats why dinesh adjati is twentyeight years old and has a porsche a house in laguna and a condo in big bear jack loves dinesh though he loves dinesh because dr bambi works his ass off gets it right and makes a wonderful witness he just turns those fawn eyes on the jury and explains the most complicated chemical analyses to them in plainold american english and they eat him with a spoon anyway jack drives straight from the vale house to disasters lab in newport beach overlooking the greenway he gets a most favored client pass right into dineshs lab where dr bambi is wearing a flameproof smock and a masked helmet and appears to be torturing a pickup truck with a blowtorch dinesh turns it off flips up the mask and shakes jacks hand a libel suit against a tv show he explains im working for the plaintiff jack tells him that he has a trunk full of samples in the car can you run the samples for me he asks double pronto somebody wanted something to burn someone to burn dinesh makes a face no shit no shit nasty i need it quick dinesh today cool jack says and i might need you to testify down the road well dinesh says i have good news and bad news tell the good news is that i can get it to you today dinesh says ill have to put a crew of techs on it and bill you accordingly but youll get it today and youll get it right whats the bad news the bad news dinesh says is that im not completely confident that i can testify say what what do you mean im not completely confident dinesh repeats that a gas chromatograph or even a gc with a mass spectrometer can accurately determine traces of accelerants jack feels the floor sinking under him weve always used the gcmass spec he says whats wrong with it we live in a plastic society dinesh says in more than just the symbolic sense the modern home is just chockfull of plastic products every one of which when they burn produces thousands of chemicals that can be confused with hydrocarbons with accelerants for example your basic gcmass spec reveals about two hundred chemicals in kerosene so so ive been working with something that shows two thousand two thousand jack asks yeah dinesh says lets say thats a little more effective at sorting out the chemical sheep from the chemical goats jack asks more expensive dinesh smiles the only thing more expensive than good science is bad science let me just say that i dont think i could get up in front of a jury anymore and swear under oath to the absolute accuracy of a gc even with a massspec chaser and with your new process you could its not new dinesh says ive been testing it for months something called a gc x gc or twodimensional gas chromatograph if you prefer maybe now is the time to trot it out do it its going to cost how much run you about another ten grand do it anyway jack thinks you dont want to get hit for a few million on a bad faith suit and then say yeah but i saved ten thou on the testing do it jack says this is why ive always loved you jack do it the old way jack says then do it the new way do it till youre satisfied but do it whatever it is lettys at the regular thursdayafternoon south coast meeting of alcoholics anonymous which because of its time and location is generally known by the sobriquet ladies who drank lunch this is not the kind of meeting lettys used to shes used to night meetings in church basements meetings with broken cookies and greasy coffee and stories about blowing the rent on beer and bourbon benders shes not used to a meeting in broad daylight in a togetherness space on a pier in a marina but thats where the ladies go to share their experience strength and hope and thats where pam went to do it with them and thats why lettys there thinking the ladies are gorgeous i mean for a bunch of drunks these babes are put together whatever boozy fat they put on in their sinful days these girls worked off on the treadmills and exercise bikes and spinners skin glowing with health eyes bright hair shiny full and sexy if aa ever wanted to do an infomercial theyd shoot it at the regular thursdayafternoon south coast meeting even women who werent alcoholics would go out and get hammered so they could come to the meetings and look like these ladies what twelve little steps and a few hundred thousand spare dollars cant do letty thinks anyway shes there and the ladies arent drinking greasy coffee theyre sipping frappuccinos decaf lowfat milk out of clearplastic gocups there are a few guys there not your ninetofive types but real estate brokers and insurance salesmen and other men who can take the middle of the afternoon off to share their experience strength and hope and maybe get lucky and as fortune and solid planning would have it theres a holiday inn within a hot fiveminute walk of the meeting there are so many pickups happening at this meeting that it could be called ladies who drank lunch and the men who lust after them letty thinks quit being such a bitch she tells herself its not their fault theyre rich and youre not theyre gorgeous and youre not get over it and get over jack wade twelve years is too long a time to be carrying a torch your arm gets tired twelve years and the son of a bitch never even called never would have called you never would have seen him again if you didnt need his help and youre such a bitch that youd use him like that but the truth is she has been carrying a torch for twelve years shes had a few boyfriends but nothing serious because in the back of her head in the back of her soul shes holding out for something she lost jack jack lost his soul and took yours with it so youre pushing forty and you have no husband and no kids and no life outside busting skulls and it isnt these ladies fault its your own so get over it girl so she sits and listens to the preamble and to the speaker and its the same stuff everywhere if youre a drunk youre a drunk no matter what the view is it turns to shit she makes small talk with a couple of the ladies during the break and when the meeting resumes and the chairperson asks if anyone wants to speak letty waits for a few people to talk about whats going on with them and then she raises her hand my name is letty hi letty blah blah blah im here she says to ask if any of you knew my sister pam she died three nights ago and they say shed been drinking she was about fiveeight black hair purple eyes i know she used to hit this meeting i dont know what other meetings she used to go to but im hoping you can help me amidst the oh my gods and not pams and a couple of sudden sobs about five hands shoot up turns out they can help her pam was sober that night letty says she and jack are sitting at an outside table at pirets beside the main entrance to south coast plaza she was at a meeting that night letty says between sips of her iced tea she picks up the glass and the paper napkin blows away in the hot dry santa ana wind she was sober then the meeting broke up at then she went out for coffee with eight other women she was sober then that doesnt mean jack says that she was sober at four the next morning jacks drinking a coke the good folks at pirets had to search long and hard to find a soda that didnt have the word diet in front of it they got it done though she told her aa friends she was scared letty says scared that nicky was going to kill her they told her to call the cops they begged her to stay with them she said it would just postpone things jack says so she went home and the fear and anxiety drove her to the bottle after nicky left she didnt keep any booze in the house she bought a bottle of vodka i checked every liquor store on her route home letty says i talked with everyone who worked that night nobody remembers her youre good im motivated forget about it jack says forget about what she asks she knows just what hes talking about about getting custody of the kids jack says if i get him convicted of murder jack shakes his head youre a long way from there say it is an arson how did pam die ngs got it as an od say you can make the next step say its murder you have nothing puts nicky there say you somehow manage to cross that bridge i dont know how but say you do say you get nicky convicted of murdering pam mother russia is still the declared guardian mother gets the kids she was in on it she provided an alibi jack says so theyll take the kids from her no they wont jack says besides which the murder conviction isnt going to happen even if you could develop enough information to embarrass bentley into moving off his call or enough that the sheriffs would have to reopen or enough to get the da interested its a long shot a long shot to get a criminal investigation a longer shot to get them to charge a regular nba threepointer to get a conviction because the evidence is getting colder every day and letty knows all this she just doesnt want to know it yet no nicky and mother russia keep the kids nicky gets away with murder so what are you going to do letty asks drop it no jack says im going to do my job im going to investigate the claim im going to see if nicky vale had the motive and opportunity to set the fire and kill his wife if i find sufficient evidence ill deny the claim and thats it thats it the worst that happens to nicky is he doesnt get paid for killing her im sorry but it works for you huh jack you dont care what happens to the kids all you care about is that the claim doesnt get paid right thats my job jack says its not all i care about its all i can do letty gets up says same old jack same old jack well sameold jack she says id like to tell you to go to hell but youre the only chance i have if you deny the claim maybe nicky will sue you for bad faith then maybe therell be a jury verdict that says that nicky killed pam a family court judge would have to take judicial notice of that verdict in a custody hearing thats a very long shot so do your job jack she says like hed do anything else she tosses her napkin down on the table and get a life she says right letty jack thinks tell me to get a life as you walk out take it with you dinesh adjati takes one of jacks samples a small piece of charred wood and scrapes a fragment into a glass flask he adds milliliters of pentane to the flask then pours the whole mess through some filter paper into a clean flask the result is a clear liquid he repeats this procedure for all of jacks samples labeling and placing the flasks in a metal rack as he goes through them a robotic machine then caps each flask inserts a syringe needle into each withdraws a cubic millimeter of liquid and lines up the samples to go through the gas chromatograph one of the allegedly dirty samples goes through first the sample gets shot into an injection port that is pressurized at about pounds per square inch of helium gas and heated to c which vaporizes the liquid the helium chases the sample vapor into the core of the gas chromatograph this is a capillary tube about meters long and onequarter of a millimeter in diameter the inside of it is coated with methyl silicone a thick viscous liquid heres how dinesh explains methyl silicone to juries he says if you put methyl silicone in a jar and tip the jar upside down and come back a day later perhaps half of the liquid will have flowed to the bottom of the jar if you come back another day later probably most of it will be at the bottom thats how thick this stuff is the capillary tube aka the gc column starts out at room temperature so the sample condenses into a liquid again but the column is gradually heated inside an oven that houses it to c the effect of all this is that the sample will gradually vaporize again and start a migration down the capillary tube different chemicals make this trip at different speeds separating from each other as a result some of the chemicals dissolve inside the silicone and take a long time to migrate down the tube other chemicals race through it licketysplit but one after the other the chemicals will emerge each time registering a blip on the computer screen the height of the blip indicates how much of that chemical is present at the end of the process youre looking at a forest of blips or peaks of various heights which together form a recognizable pattern called the gas chromatogram the way dinesh explains this concept to juries is to talk about cookie recipes look hell say a recipe might call for a tablespoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of sugar thats the composition of that particular cookie dough if you will it has cinnamon and sugar in certain defined intensities gasoline kerosene napalm any of the accelerants youre testing for are like cookie dough in this respect theyre made of many different substances each present in different amounts all the substances present in any given mixture will produce a unique and predictable gas chromatogram a characteristic signature of a given mixture dinesh watches as the samples start to sign in he starts getting a little ripple at around five minutes at ten a modest peak the trace drops way down then gives him a little hill at twelve minutes at fifteen the peak goes himalayan shoots up like a rocket down again at fifteen minutes ten seconds up again at seventeen big peak at eighteen and then it starts to settle modest peaks at twenty which gradually settle down at about twentyeight minutes its flat again dinesh watches this on a graph the sample signs in it signs in kerosene for his next magic trick hell analyze the sample through a gas chromatograph with a special instrument a mass spectrometer attached to the back what happens is that the gases flow out of the gc column into a vacuum port which sucks them into the mass spectrometer the mass spec is a steel cylinder about four inches in diameter and two feet long it has a glass port so you can see inside the guts which basically consist of vacuum devices steel plates cylinders wires ceramic tubes and turbopumps that are whirring at about rpm in the center of all this is a glowing filament that bombards the chemical vapors with electrons breaking them into electrically charged moleculesized chunks or ions in a microsecond these ions are weighed in a nanosecond theyre counted the size and number of these ions produce a characteristic fragment signature dinesh explains it to juries like this suppose you throw a flowerpot on the sidewalk it will shatter into random pieces it will break into different sizes and different numbers of pieces every time no two fragments will be alike but a molecule is a different kind of flowerpot one with predetermined grooves if you will every time you shatter it it will break into exactly the same size and number of fragments each substance has its own unique predictable fragment signature now the computer automatically compares the fragment signatures against the nist national institute of standards mass spectral library profiles of certain substances and comes up with a match kerosene which almost every analyst in the country would call a definitive match not dinesh not with a gcmass spec not with all those plasticizers out there gumming up the works so dinesh takes the samples and runs them through a gc x gc comprehensive twodimensional gas chromatography is the technical term dinesh doesnt think of it that way he thinks of it as looking into chemical mixtures through a hubble telescope it starts off simply enough dinesh runs the sample through a gas chromatograph same process the samples are vaporized and shot through a capillary filled with methyl silicone where they separate into about two hundred groups of chemicals instead of stopping there or running them through a mass spec dinesh shoots them through an interface device into a second gas chromatographic column see each peak comes out of the first column for about ten seconds every three seconds a little heater inside the oven is mechanically rotated it has a slot in it which rotates over the column it locally heats the column which drives all the chemicals in that area out as soon as they get beyond that hot zone they come to the unheated cold zone and get sucked right back into the methyl silicone this forms a sharp chemical pulse this pulse is swept along a short length of column about millimeters and eventually is launched down the tube by the heated zone into the second gc column once again they all travel down the tube and separate the trick is in the methyl silicone in the second column its been doped doped with chemicals that produce completely different separation criteria from the methyl silicone in the first column there are three chemical separation mechanisms dinesh will tell a floundering jury volatility polarity and shape volatility is how much vapor pressure a substance puts out at a certain temperature its boiling point put simply polarity refers to the electric property of molecules shape is simple its the shape of the molecule whether its say shaped like a chain or perhaps a closed loop now the first gc column only separates by volatility so two chemicals that have the same volatility will come out of the first column together unseparated even though they have different polarities andor different shapes but when they hit the doped methyl silicone in the second column they encounter a chemical mechanism that they havent seen before and they separate so polarity is an electrical property of molecules electrostatically the positive attracts the negative and vice versa the molecules tend to hug each other they can maintain this mutual affection through the first gc column but when they hit the second well love does not conquer methyl silicone doped with chemicals that have electric charges on their surfaces and they separate same with shape two very differently shaped molecules that have the same polarity but different shapes can travel down the first column disguised in happy unity as one but when they hit the second column they will have a different reaction to the stationary phase to the doped methyl silicone and theyll separate the performance then of one gc multiplies the other they dont add they multiply so if the first can separate one hundred peaks and the second can separate thirty then in combination they can separate not one hundred and thirty but three thousand the net result is that the chromatograms look like stalagmites rising up off a floor instead of shark fins coming up off lines its the difference between a graph and a kaleidoscope between a coloring book and a matisse between as dinesh likes to think the beer barrel polka and a charlie parker solo the gc x gc delivers a beautiful multicolored pattern which will always be exactly the same every time for a given mixture every time you set the kaleidoscope at the setting marked kerosene youll get the same beautiful complex pattern like a signature in d like a fingerprint in technicolor only better and thats what dinesh sees when he finishes running the first sample through the gc x gc a twothousandpiece jigsaw puzzle that portrays one image and one image only kerosene six hours later he and his crew have run all the samples the kaleidoscope is always the same kerosene he calls jack with the results maybe the best view on the south coast is the one from the patio bar at las brisas with its view of laguna bay and laguna town stretched out beneath you like some old mediterranean city with its white buildings and terracottatiled roofs especially at sunset with the sky turning from blue to lavender and the red summer sun starting to kiss the ocean horizon thanks for coming nicky says he tilts his vodka collins in a salute to jack thanks for the drink says jack raising his beer bottle nicky says well i wanted to thank you for intervening in that ugly situation in the church the other day no jack says you wanted to find out what letitia del rio told me nicky smiles that too she told me some disturbing things no doubt she did nicky says i am sure that she concocted some wild and wonderful tales for you i imagine at times she even believes them herself letty is a sick woman yeah well they came from the same dysfunctional family didnt they letty says that pam went to rehab yes nicky laughs would you like to see those bills and she stayed sober for about two weeks afterwards i think nicky says not a bargain they sit and drink and watch the progress of the sunset a spectacular southern californian light show gone from lavender to purple as the sky turns into a violent red this might be paradise nicky sighs then he says think about this jack the next beneficiary on the life insurance policy after me is letty in trust for the children of course it would be in her interest to make up stories wouldnt it jack watches the bottom of the sun melt into the ocean you know what i think jack asks he takes a long belt of his beer i wouldnt presume to guess jack easy relaxed maximum cool what i think jack says i think that you killed your wife and burned the house down around her thats what i think grinning at nicky who turns pale nicky stares at him for a long moment then forces his face into a condescending smile looks jack square in the eyes says prove it jack says i will behind nicky the sun the sky and the ocean are on fire this beautiful inferno jack thinks this dropdead gorgeous hell heres the story on nicky vale daziatnik valeshin grows up in leningrad his father a minor apparatchik his mother a teacher at the state gymnasium she feels that she has fallen in the world both her parents were professors and she did brilliantly at university were it not for one foolish unguarded night she would doubtless have become a professor as well but then she had a child to raise alone as dazs father splits early a divorce while young daz is still in the crawling phase mother he sees constantly oppressively shes raising him to be something most decidedly not a minor apparatchik they go meatless for weeks to afford ballet tickets the soup is thinned yet again for a tchaikovsky recording at a precocious age he reads his tolstoy of course and pushkin and turgenev and at bedtime she sits and reads flaubert to him in french not that he understands french but it is mothers firm belief that he will somehow absorb the meaning through the rhythm and tone mother teaches him to appreciate the finer thingsart music sculpture architecture and design she teaches him manners at the table in conversation with a woman they sit and practice an evening out at a fine restaurant sitting at the foldup table in their cramped kitchen she takes him through the various courses and scolds him into making conversation as if she were the young lady and he were the suitor shes as brutal about his grades as she is his manners nothing but a first will do the moment he comes home she sits him down in front of his books then has him review his work for her it must be perfect otherwise she tells him you will end up like the rest of the proletariat like your father stupid unhappy bored and with no future but to be stupid unhappy and bored when he gets to the age where hes interested in girls she chooses them for him or more often chooses against them for him this one is too silly that one too fat this one too clever that one a slut daz knows that her standards are high because she herself is so beautiful her face is perfectly formed porcelain her hair a blacksatin sculpture her neck so long and elegant and white her manners refined her intelligence sparkling how father could leave her he cannot understand and he obeys her he is first in most of his classes he wins the prize in english in history in literature in math not only that hes a sneaky mean underhanded intimidating little bastard so he catches the attention of the local talent spotters from the old state security bureau and the bit about afghanistan is true except daz doesnt go as some slogass foot soldier a reluctant warrior in someone elses war daz goes as a kgb officer attached to a military intelligence unit his job to interrogate the villagers to find where the mujahedin are hiding for the first few weeks daz goes about this job in a civilized way even though that gets him nowhere however after he has found out about the third russian soldier lying naked skinned alive with his genitals stuffed in his mouth daz takes a different approach his best routine is to have three villagers trussed up like hogs cut two of their throats and then offer the bloodspattered survivor a cup of tea and a chance for meaningful conversation if his hospitality is spurned daz usually orders an enlisted man to douse the holy warrior with petrol then when daz is done with his tea he lights a cigarette and tosses the match and warms his hands on the blazing fire then he has his unit torch the whole village waits a day or so for word of the incident to filter to the next village and then goes there to ask questions usually gets some answers all the time mother is frantic sick with worry that her son will be killed in this stupid futile war she writes him every day and he writes back but the soviet mail system being what it is there are brutal endless days of no mail when she is convinced that he is dead the next days mail brings a letter and with it a torrent of tears of relief daz finishes his tour spends his leave with mother in a state dacha on the black sea his reward for a good war there they go out for an evening to a fine restaurant on the shore a table on the veranda and the moon sparkles on the water they have an eightcourse meal and the conversation sparkles like the water back in the dacha that night she tutors him on how to be with a woman he needs an assignment and the kgb has one for him back in moscow his handler a kgb colonel named karpotsov takes him on a stroll through gorky park karpotsov is quite a number with a broad slavic face silver hair greased straight back on his head an easy way with the vodka and an easier way with women a real charmer karpotsov is a word painter and he works his brush on daz karpotsov knows talent when he sees it and he sees it in young valeshin valeshin is a ruthless sociopathic smart little wiseass who would probably torch his own mother if thats what it took and thats just the kind of sociopath karpotsovs looking for so he walks daz around the park for a while looking at women and talking about nothing of any great importance and then karpotsov buys two ice creams and sits daz down on a bench and says how would you like to go to america he sticks out his broad tongue and takes a lick of the ice cream that is almost obscene smiles a mephistophelian smile i think i would like that very much daz says having just been offered a chance at heaven the united states karpotsov says he continues the lecture between licks of ice cream is waging economic warfare against the soviet union reagan knows and we know that we cant compete we cant continue to build missiles and submarines at this pace and still maintain the economy required for a workers paradise the ugly truth daz is that they can win the cold war simply by outspending us he stops and stares off at the park as if at any moment it is going to disappear along with the soviet way of life he collects himself and continues we need cash hard currency and the soviet economy is incapable of generating any it is simply not to be found here then where america karpotsov says our expatriate russian criminals in new york and california are sucking dollars out of the american system like milk from a cow these are gangsters mind you and we have to believe that if common criminals can do this well what could a cadre of kgbtrained agents do its a brilliant idea really karpotsov says and it should be he thought of it it has a double benefit it takes from them and gives to us every dollar we make is a dollar they lose where better to attack a capitalist system than at its capital so my assignment would be in the realm of economic sabotage thats one way of putting it karpotsov says another would be to say that your assignment is to steal and steal and steal daz cannot believe his ears hes frozen his ass off in that afghanistan moonscape and winter is coming so hell be freezing his ass off in a soviet union that is clearly headed down the drain and the best he can hope for is sharing a onebedroom with mother forever and maybe one week a summer at a dacha on the black sea and part of him knows i must get away from her and this is my chance and the other part screams this is my chance to give her the life she deserves and now they offer him a transfer to america for the expressed purpose of making a fortune so whats the catch of course youll have to become a jew karpotsov says a jew daz asks why a jew how else can we get you in karpotsov asks christ the americans are always screaming at us release some jews release some jews fine well release some jews along with them a few of our agents trained in how did you put it economic sabotage but to become a jew its a sacrifice i understand karpotsov says perhaps too great a sacrifice to ask no no no no daz says quickly for a heartstopping second he sees his chance slipping away no of course i accept the assignment karpotsov finishes his ice cream and grins mazel tov he says so daz goes to jew school this is a little course the kgb sets up where jewish prisoners teach the torah the diaspora the holocaust and the whole catalog of russian outrages against the jews daz studies zionist history the history of israel jewish culture and tradition jewish artists writers composers for graduation they do a passover seder and daziatniks like done that hand me my airline ticket but karpotsov is like not so fast jewboy first theres a little matter of prison prison daziatnik asks you didnt say anything about prison well im saying it now karpotsov tells him on another stroll through the park daz we need you to infiltrate the mob the organizatsiya theyre the people who are sucking the money out of the states without being a member youd frankly be quite useless and sadly the qualification for membership is a stay in the system to establish your bona fides as it were daz is furious at karpotsov and at himself because he has let the man lure him into a trap step by step cant you just create a criminal record for me daz asks we will karpotsov says but that by itself wouldnt be safe for you no there is knowledge and experience and connections that you can only get in prison how much time daz asks not a long stretch karpotsov says eighteen months or so for petty theft i could order you but i dont want to do that dazs mind is reeling a year and a half in prison i dont know colonel and who knows karpotsov asks perhaps we could arrange exit papers for your mother karpotsov is a slick piece of shit like every other piece of shit who handles agents he knows exactly what buttons can be pushed and when to push them daz says how bad could a few months in jail be uhhuh daz is in the system for maybe ten minutes before a huge old zek called old tillanin jams him into the corner shoves the sharp point of a shiv against his ribs and by way of foreplay demands his blanket and his next meal daz is in the system for maybe ten minutes and seconds before he jams a finger strike into old tillanins left eyeball which hits the filthy concrete floor about one full second before old tillanin does hes rolling around howling in pain trying to reach out and grab his eyeball before someone in the crowded cell steps on it as if theyre going to send a team of crack surgeons to reattach it daz is in the far corner of the cell before the guards can get over to see who performed the eyeballectomy and most of the other zeks only get from hearsay that its the new guy daz two zeks actually witness the action though one is a barrelshaped mugger from moscow named lev the other a tall skinny extortionist from odessa named dani and theyre pretty impressed that a new zek is either brave enough or stupid enough to take on old tillanin who is the king of the heap in this cell the word on lev is that he has a way with a chain saw that you dont want to see up close lev has a reputation for his skill at performing the chicken chop which is organizatsiyas favored method of execution and is just what it sounds like not to put too fine a point on it they take a chain saw and cut you into parts and this is levs hobby he likes it the story on dani is that back in odessa his own brother ratted some guys out to the cops and the local mob boss the pakhan wanted to job out the hit but dani said no sweat ill do him myself dani gutshot his own brother dani is such a mean fucker hes doing guys in prison the guards come in in the morning and one or two zeks are tapped out their necks snapped or their intestines lying on the floor and danis standing there with his bowl waiting for his breakfast gruel dani is cold when lev and dani see the new zek take out old tillanin like that they mark him as a guy to well keep an eye on anyway one of the guards asks who did it hes no more expecting an answer than hes expecting fucking princess anastasia to descend through the ceiling on a trapeze and hes dead right about that because even old tillanin keeps his mouth shut so the guard grabs up dani figuring that mean little fuck had to have a hand in any piece of violent nastiness in the cell and hes hauling him out into the corridor to give him a goingover with the baton when this new zek a petty thief from leningrad named valeshin yells i did what the guard asks i did it which is just about the stupidest thing the guard ever saw any zek do in a population that is already subpar in the intelligence quotient the guard is so annoyed by this honoramongthieves bit that he takes a belt and straps this valeshin moron to the top of the cell door and whales at him with a piece of rubber hose until the dumbfuck dickhead passes out the guard gives him a few more shots to the ribs for good measure unties him and kicks him back into the cell there being no point in taking him to the infirmary because a they dont have any doctors there and b old tillanins comrades are just going to kill him anyway which is true daz is lying unconscious in the cell and what three of old tillanins buddies are waiting for is a little decent cover of darkness so they can hack him to death before he can wake up and do that finger strike number on one of them small chance of that even if he were conscious daz couldnt lift his hands past his bruised ribs and even if he could it would have the force of a noodle so daz is pretty much on the shortstay program if he doesnt die of the beating a very real possibility old tillanins friends are going to kill him and if they dont get him prison life will because hell be too weak for the foreseeable future to fight for his food or his blanket which in fact has already been snatched up or for his own body for that matter hell freeze starve and get raped to death and thats only if he makes it through the night when he comes to hes wrapped in two blankets his head in danis lap he can feel the tightness of bandages around his wounded ribs and a few minutes later dani tender as a madonna coaxes some tea down his throat where he got the wrappings tea and hot water daz will never know what he does know is that dani and lev spend the next three weeks nursing him back to a condition where he has a chance to survive which also means guarding him around the clock daz doesnt know it at the time but old tillanins comrades make three attempts on him three stabs at it if you will the first comes as dani and lev drag daz into their corner of the cell and wrap him up in danis blanket if you want him jewboy one of old tillanins crew warns you take all of him meaning the obligations that daz has accrued in wounding old tillanin thats fine lev says he headbutts the guy smashing his nose then shoves the guys face down as he brings his own knee up which ends the first attack the second comes later in the night when it looks as if dani and lev are asleep turns out theyre not when dani swipes his knife across the stomach of the lead attacker giving him a deep wound that will get infected and turn fatal some six endless weeks down the line because he doesnt have the price of a simple antibiotic that is for cash only at the infirmary the third attack comes in that deadly hour before dawn you cant say sunrise the sun doesnt rise on this windowless basement hole and this time its four of old tillanins gang at once lev and dani shove daz into the corner and just stand there and fight it out in front of him using the corner walls to narrow the lane of attack that they have to defend the first attacker lunges with a knife but he isnt quick enough and dani grabs his arm and snaps it at the elbow producing a sound like a tree branch breaking in the winter cold lev takes the second guy whos rushing him and smashes him into the wall using his own huge right hand to keep banging the guys head against the wall while with his left he jabs at the third attacker with his shiv dani drops down and shoves his knife upward into the fourth guys crotch but levs about to get done by number three whos reaching down into his shoe for his own shiv and is about to swing it up into levs ribs when somehow daz grabs the guys hand and holds on for dear life or levs dear life but anyway daz has crawled between levs legs and holds the shiv against the guys ankle then bites the guys hand and wont let go with his hands or his teeth even though his ribs are screaming and hes bleeding inside finally lev drops guy number two and raises his own hands like a club above his own head and brings them down on the third guys neck and daz suddenly feels the life go out of the man which it has because his neck is broken when the guards find the body in the morning anyway the guy is dead and his blanket is now wrapped around daz and when old tillanin returns from the infirmary things have changed he finds this out his first night back when his dreams are broken by a sharp pain in the chest which he at first attributes to a heart attack which is not entirely mistaken seeing as how theres a sharpened spoon buried in his chest planted there by one of his own guys because old tillanin isnt the king of the heap anymore that would be daziatnik valeshin but he doesnt get to ascend to the throne right away because when the guards come in and find old tillanin prepped for the dirt nap they reasonably conclude that valeshin was just finishing the job he had started and haul him away old tillanin after all had kicked in cash and goodies to the guards so they at least have to make a pretense at investigating his death in case one of his henchmen becomes the new top dog so they strip daz still sick and hurting from his beating and toss him naked into a cold isolation cell and he spends the next two weeks freezing and starving sitting in his own shit and piss but he doesnt talk hell freeze and starve to death but hes keeping his mouth shut about all that keeps him going is the fantasy america specifically california youre kgb youre privy to a few things television movies magazines so daz has seen images of california seen the beaches and the sunshine and the palm trees the sailboats the surfers the beautiful girls all but naked lying in the sun as if they wish to be taken right there and then hes seen the sports cars the highways the homes and its these images that keep him going two weeks later the guards decide that theyve made their gesture and haul him out blind as a mole naked and shivering he limps back to the cell which is something of an improvement except his guard a nasty piece of work from outside gorky tells him that hes just going to beat him to death anyway slowly on a daily basis there is only one way to stop it dani tells him you must show him that you can endure more pain than he can give out dani tells him of the old days of organizatsiya back in czarist days when it was known as vorovskoy mir the world of thieves in those days dani tells him the convicts were really tough knowing they had no recourse to revenge against the guards their only choice was to intimidate them not through acts of aggression but through acts of endurance they showed the guards that they could inflict more damage on themselves than the guards could inflict on them dani says it makes a certain sense to daz in a country of such long and deep suffering endurance is the ultimate power dani tells him stories of convicts who ran knives down their own faces who sewed their own eyelids shut stitched their own lips together to intimidate the guards out of beating them there is even a story about one spectacularly tough convict who nailed his scrotum to a workbench and waited for the guard to arrive the guard was impressed dani tells daz these stories and then he and lev sit back to watch daz waits for the guard to come on shift he borrows a nail and a cellmade hammer and sits on the end of the bench by the cell door when the guard comes to give him his beating daz stares at him takes a deep breath and drives the nail through his hand between the index finger and thumb and into the bench sits there sweating jaws clenched staring at the guard that night lev and dani initiate him into the vory v zakone the brotherhood of thieves not that theres one brotherhood of thieves in russia there are about five thousand maybe three hundred of which are serious players but the one that lev and dani belong to is as good as any and they all subscribe to the same basic code of conduct the vorovskoy zakon vorovskoy zakon the code of thieves makes most of the usual demands youd expect of a criminal code it has the russian version of omerta you keep your mouth shut you never help the authorities you never ever rat on another thief and it has a mafialike provision that allows a panel of brothers to convene to settle disputes and punish if need be the transgressor but it also has a couple of unique features one is a sort of catholic priest deal because strictly speaking the code forbids marriage you can have girlfriends boyfriends and pets you can date barnyard animals if you want but if it turns out to be a love connection you cant marry one then theres an almost jesuitlike commandment that demands a purity of effort a singleminded devotion to crime because the vorovskoy zakon forbids a member from making an honest living these are the points that dani and lev instruct daz in as they tend to his wounds and give him two new ones one is a jailhouse tattoo behind the left knee using a pin some ink and some smuggled grain alcohol lev carefully etches two attached crosses with stars of david hanging from the crosspieces the rationale of the two crosses gang being that while christ was the headliner on that friday in jerusalem there were two nameless zeks stuck up beside him both jewish thieves then they cut his wrist likewise open up old scars on their own wrists and touch them together as daz recites i will obey the demands of the vorovskoy zakon i will help other thieves whenever possible i will always come to the aid of my brothers i will never betray my brothers i will submit myself to the authority of my older brothers i will submit all disputes to a convocation of my brothers and abide by its decision i will carry out the punishment of transgressors if my brothers ask me to do so i will never cooperate with authorities somewhat melodramatic daz thinks but whatever it takes i will forsake my own family dani intones i will have no family but the two crosses daz balks dani repeats i will forsake my own family i will have no family but the two crosses forgive me mother daz says to himself i will make it up to you someday i will forsake my own family i will have no family but the two crosses if i transgress against vorovskoy zakon may i burn in hell for the rest of his stretch no one lays a hand on him having kicked old tillanin off the top the heap daz is firmly entrenched in his place especially with dani and lev as his bodyguards theres not a zek in the cell that wants to take this trio on knowing that a you are far less likely to kill than to be killed and b even if you should incredibly luck out somehow and take out all three of them youll eventually have to deal with the three hundred two crosses gang members who will either find a way to whack you in prison or whack you the second you step out into the sweet brief sunshine of freedom its just not something that anyone with any brains wants to fuck with so daz gets some breathing room a little living space and living large by russian prison standards gets himself a little extra gruel an extra blanket the odd cigarette a little homemade vodka brewed from potato skins in a back room distillery hes even offered the exclusive use of one of the prison fags who with a little makeup in dim light bears a passing resemblance to something female daz is like thanks but no thanks on this figures that for eighteen months he can keep his sexuality and selfrespect inside and intact saves himself for one of his fantasy iwishtheyallcouldbecaliforniagirls so he takes a pass on the surrogate and soothes his frustrations with the cigs vodkas and other little perks he gets from being connected and the king of the heap daz sees zeks drop from exhaustion and just lie there just left to lie there and die and hes seen zeks drop and the guards beat them half to death and then leave them for the weather to finish off daz sees this and swears its never going to happen to him not to him or to dani or lev because they are brothers and if one drops the others will pick him up and if the guards dont like it fuck the guards theyll have to kill us all before they kill one of us but daz isnt thinking about dying hes thinking about living and he keeps dani and lev thinking that way too daz knows its not just your body you have to keep alive you have to keep your head and your soul alive too so at night he tells them stories stories from the films and magazines hes seen stories about eternal sunshine and fast cars and beautiful homes and even more beautiful women i will take you to a new life he whispers to them i promise you my brothers you will join me in paradise the scene with mother is pure hell daz finishes his stretch and applies for an exit visa which karpotsov shoots through like a bullet theres no stroll in the park this time the two men dont meet at all those days are over it just wouldnt do for daz to be seen with a kgb colonel could cause the two crosses to have him chopped like a chicken so daz gets his instructions through dead drops and the orders are clear go forth and prosper go forth and steal heres where and how you send the money now go make mother watches daz pack his few belongings she screams and cries she wails she holds him pressed against her she whimpers you said you would take me i cant not yet why not he cant tell her that he is a sworn member of the two crosses that they would kill him for transgressing the code or uncover him as a fraud and either way he is dead and so is the dream of america so he just repeats im sorry i cant just now you dont love me i do love you she lays her neck against his how can you leave me i will send for you liar i will liar ingrate she throws herself on the couch and sobs refuses to look at him as he tries to say goodbye the last he remembers of her is her white neck stretched out on a small black pillow then palm trees daz spots them from the plane as it comes down at lax and thinks this is it california he steps out of the terminal onto the baked concrete of the sidewalk and into a phone booth he has the number of tiv lerner a brigadier in the usa west coast franchise of the two crosses and he has references and twentyfive minutes later a taxi drops him off at lerners home in las fairfax district lerner sits daz down in the tacky living room of his tacky house and over shots of vodka explains that the organization is set up just like in the old country the pakhan rules over four separate subgangs run by brigadiers the subgangs are broken down into cells which operate various scams like loansharking extortion fraud and just plain theft each cell has a number of street operators who do the actual crimes in addition to the brigades the pakhan has an elite group of advisers who help him rule and a separate security cell made up of the heaviest hitters to protect him youll start at the bottom lerner says and work your way up the american way sure daz says im your brigadier lerner tells him youll go to tratchevs cell what does it do theft lerner says you steal half of what you earn goes to tratchev ten percent goes into the obochek the russians are like mormons in this sense they tithe ten percent of their earnings goes into the obochek the fund that every pakhan maintains as a pool for bribes and payouts technically its not his money it belongs to the gang its there for the gangs safety and welfare its there to pay off cops lawyers judges politicians whoever needs to be greased the obochek is an inviolable fund the holy of holies because without the obochek the gangs financial welfare and physical safety cant be maintained the gang would be left floating without a life raft in a hostile sea so daz doesnt mind kicking in to the obochek but this percent to tratchev well that aint gonna last for long daz knows that a big chunk of that gets booted up to lerner and then to the pakhan and thats where the serious money is ronald reagan notwithstanding the cash doesnt trickle down it pours up and thats where daz intends to be whos our pakhan he asks lerner smiles you dont need to know that daz nods but hes thinking i do know that you arrogant cocksucker colonel karpotsov speaking of arrogant cocksuckers ran it all down the pakhan out here is natan shakalin one of the original migrs daz has seen the whole file shakalins photo criminal record the whole bit lerner laughs and says maybe when youre a brigadier youll meet the pakhan which is going to be sooner than you know daz thinks now that hes on the main chance next afternoon he starts as a limo driver in lerners fleet making runs back and forth from the airport daz says something like hold on didnt i take an oath not to do legit work to which lerner answers grow up kid the gig is that daz picks up businessmen at their homes and chats them up on the way to the airport finds out if theyre single or living alone or if they have a family what the familys schedule is then he tries to book a roundtrip when are you coming back mister i can pick you up be there when you step off the plane guaranteed also guaranteed that now he knows the businessmans address and when the house will be empty and he gives that info to one of lerners stooges and go figure the businessmans house gets robbed and they toss daz a cut of the take daz does this for a couple of months but knows that his cut from some cheap b ampes is going to neither destabilize the american economy nor make him rich so he talks lerner into letting him go on some car boosts daz spends his days driving to and from the airport and his nights boosting mercedes and beemers after a couple of years old lerner lets him buy in and daziatnik gets his own chop shop cuts up the mercedes and beemers and ships the parts back to russia where the kgb provides the market outreach and the protection daz is starting to make some good jack doing this but his real genius shines when he figures out that you can sell the same car twice once to the parts buyers and once to the insurance company just prearrange the theft with an owner who is behind on his payments the owner parks the car at a ball game an amusement park a concert and when he comes out surprise its gone the car is chopped up within hours shipped abroad within days the owner gets out from under daziatnik takes a commission from the insurance settlement and the price of the parts he kicks money to tratchev who kicks it to lerner who kicks it to shakalin daz brings in the bucks and gets rewarded with his own unit in lerners brigade which pisses tratchev off but daz isnt through because its a simple step from car theft fraud to car accident fraud daz nicknames the collective insurance industry the big cow because you just keep milking it and milking it and milking it so many nipples from which to suck daz becomes the impresario of staged accidents learns that soft tissue injuries mean hard cash from phony medical bills and accident settlements learns how easy it is to buy a doctor a chiropractor a lawyer a judge suck on the big cow for workmens comp pain and suffering compensation i hope you got insurance man and medical bills tests physical therapy consultations chiropractic visits the doctors bill the insurance company and then kick a cut back to daz in cash then daz takes the next logical step he figures out that you can make even more money if the treatments therapy and consultations never even happen you just have the doctor sign the documents the doctors bill the insurance company and then kick a bigger cut back to daz daz in turn kicks to lerner who kicks to shakalin daz also kicks back to karpotsov so the kgb is finally getting a taste from the dairy all this kicking means that daz is basically drawing the salary of a kgb major having been promoted in absentia but thats okay with him on the short term on the longer term he has different plans see now that he has two of his own cells car theft and insurance fraud hes bringing in serious money but no matter how much he sends home it isnt enough karpotsov is back in the old country where the economy is going downhill in a barrel so karpotsov is always sending messages the main thrust of which is more more more its like daz has to make more jack so the kgb can afford paper clips so both he and karpotsov are sick of having lerner never mind shakalin as a partner karpotsov is really putting the pressure on him so daz comes up with a new plan which he doesnt share with lerner daz is messing around with serious trouble because what he does is he goes outside the two crosses gang and contacts the armenians the armenians are the biggest gang in california theyre all over hollywood and glendale shaking down armenian merchants loansharking armenian immigrants forcing legit armenians into stealing their own merchandise and turning in insurance claims daz has his ear to the ground and knows that you have the same armenian carpets being stolen five six seven times all over the west so he has a sense that the armenians might be receptive to an insurance scam so he sets up a meeting where daz basically says why are we busting our humps with this little shit a piece here a piece there a car a carpet a whiplash if we work together we can take down the big chunks we can hit the main chance he and kazzy azmekian sit outside at a restaurant on sunset speaking russian and daz has come there alone if azmekian would rather whack him than do business theres nothing daz can do about it and they both know so the other thing that azmekian knows is that the young jew has big league balls kaz is drinking his coffee looking at this newcomer and debating whether to snatch him and sell him back to lerner or kill him or listen to him azmekian says what do you have in mind arson is what daz has in mind buy a warehouse fill it with overstock burn it collect the insurance money azmekians response is a bored been there done that and hes seriously rethinking the kidnap option except hes not sure he wants to start a war with the jews right now the problem with this kids plan is that its not a big moneymaker because you only gain on the inventory the fire insurance just pays the value of the building so you only break even on that so azmekian gestures the waiter check please as daz starts to explain whats nifty about his take on this old scam we set up investment companies daz says put them in other peoples names so they cant be traced my company buys a warehouse cheap you buy it for more another one of my companies buys it from you so on and so forth until the value of the building is inflated then you fill it with overstock theres a fire and we split the profits on the overstock and the profit on the building more coffee azmekian tells the waiter then to daz why come to me why not your own people too inbred daz says too easy to track plus i dont want to i want to make the hit and present it as a fait accompli and we do it outside la daz says we break new ground and we farm the arson out beyond our own organizations so there are no connections no traces azmekians into it he and daz set up their dummy companies and get ready to go first building they buy is the atlas warehouse there are a few bumps in the fast lane a security guard dies in the fire and then it turns out that theres a witness and the fire inspectors call it an arson and the insurance company denies the claim but the bumps get smoothed out and kazzy azmekian gets an unexpected bonus when he settles his bad faith suit and now that they know where the potential problems are they wont make those mistakes again and daz he takes in a cool which he doesnt share with lerner lerner gets word of it daz makes sure he gets word of it and lerner screams where is my fucking cut and daz pulls the vorovskoy zakon on him if you have a grievance he tells lerner call a convocation take it to the pakhan lerner would whack him right there on the spot except that this valeshin piece of shit is a brother so he needs permission lerner goes before the pakhan and the other brigadiers whines like a stuck pig to old natan shakalin valeshin went outside the organization valeshin went to the armenians valeshin set up his own operation most of all valeshin made a bundle and didnt give me any shakalin listens to all this nods his wrinkled head then says while lamer is an honored and valued old member of the organization blahsky blahsky blahsky this valeshin boychick is a producer a hotshot moneymaker so lay off and give the kid his shot in fact hes going to make valeshin a brigadier lerner about shits its instantly obvious now that valeshin has just bypassed him and laid a pile of money directly on shakalin and bought his promotion which is not the way its supposed to work its supposed to work like an amway distributorship and you just dont bypass a stone on the pyramid lerner is so pissed he thinks for a second about taking on old natan himself except the ancient fuck is sitting there flanked by his two bodyguards straight from the old country and the new talent has a serious reputation as very nasty people handy with the old chicken chop so lerner bides his time and they bring daz in and lerner gives daz his blessing and they kiss and hug and all that happy crap and make a vodka toast to their eternal friendship and mutual prosperity well the friendship is total bullshit but as for the prosperity daz gets his own brigade and the money rolls in like waves on the california shore its not enough daziatnik wants something more wants something different hes living in fairfax in the middle of thousands of other russian immigrants and it might as well be leningrad with palm trees he speaks russian he works with russians he eats with russians he sleeps with russians he makes his money and gives most of it to russians to shakalin and karpotsov so theyre happy but daz is wondering when he gets his piece of paradise daziatnik reads so he knows his history the irish the italians the jews the grandfathers gangsters the grandsons lawyers and bankers and politicians and judges and businessmen its a threegeneration turnaround but daziatnik wonders why why not one generation why not if a man can go from spy to zek to driving a limo to stealing cars to running a chop shop to insurance fraud to brigadier in four short years why cant he make the leap to legitimate businessman in as short a time in this land of opportunity in this floating cloud of a land where a man can invent and reinvent himself can burn the pages of his history behind him and then his past disappears into the blue california sky like so much smoke daz has a plan to do it he knows its out there that ineffable thing the open arms and legs of california and thats what he wants he wants freedom and style he wants away from his grim migr comrades the dull the stupid the boring the mindnumbing soulstunning sameness of it he wants to become nicky so he looks for the opportunity which isnt hard the opportunity is so blatant so transparent so clear it would take an idiot not to see it the sweet heavy ripe pear virtually dropping from the tree real estate any fool could see that in california in the mids real estate is the golden stream put money in real estate and watch your investment turn around sometimes literally overnight diversify with longerterm investments apartment buildings and condo complexes all the more profitable if you could use your mob outreach to cut a corner here or there cheaper materials quicker construction it was rare they had to twist or even bend an arm everyone was in a hurry in those days get them up get them sold get your money into the next one his real estate investments make money and that gives him the freedom to stretch the code out even more he leaves the tight ethnic community in la and moves south to the gold coast where he can reinvent himself as nicky vale daz changes his name daziatnik valeshin is just too heavy a moniker to carry around to sign on all the real estate papers too hard for customers to remember when they have a good deal and are looking for investors to phone call me daz says in fact call me nicky thats his next break with the code but nicky says he isnt leaving hes colonizing taking the business down to the lucrative gold coast going where the money is where theres virgin ground for development where dig this people enter a lottery to determine who gets a chance to buy a condo in the new complexes you couldnt nicky recalls put the things up fast enough nicky keeps buying up land putting up buildings leveraging it all like hell but who cares the market outgrows the debt and nicky flourishes new house new clothes new style new persona nicky vale real estate player its dazs next violation of the code of the vorovskoy zakon which states in no uncertain terms that making money in legitimate enterprise is like outsky right strictly nyet and some of dazs soldiers do grumble about it he tells them to shut their mouths make money and be happy lerner sees his shot and gets on the horn to shakalin to rat daz out telling the old boy that daziatnik has gone american and is pissing all over vorovskoy zakon shakalin agrees the ties are loosening too much like the soviet union two crosses could crumble apart it is time to make an example of nicky vale hes strapped to a wooden chair the whole ruling body sits in a semicircle in front of him the brigadiers several lieutenants old natan shakalin and his bodyguards one of whom holds a silenced automatic pistol and the other of whom brandishes a chain saw looking at the saw nicky can feel his balls tighten lerner gets up and recites a litany of nickys transgressions against the code nickys been doing legitimate business hes been withholding profits from the organization in short nicky vale has broken faith with his brothers hes broken the vorovskoy zakon nickys still not too worried he points to the corruption in the real estate business the subpar materials the payoffs to inspectors the tax dodges the occasional arson scheme his basic response to that is legit hell as to not paying his share nicky offers to make restitution it is just an accounting problem as soon as the books are straight he will pay his due perhaps lerner says the reason that you cannot pay the money you owe is that you send so much to your bosses in kgb excuse me major valeshin oops now nickys worried he can practically hear the chain saw warming up its not pleasant this chicken chop first they cut off your hands then your arms then your feet then your legs then your privates and even though youre probably dead by then they cut off your head just for a sense of aesthetic unity it is major now isnt it lerner says congratulations mazel tov our brothers inside kgb informed us of your promotion lerner demands the death penalty fire up the old mccullough shakalin gets to his feet he stands in front of nicky and says years ago you took an oath to the two crosses the two crosses protected you nurtured you took you from a miserable zek to riches beyond your knowledge you came here as nothing and now you are a rich man how do you thank us you cheat us you turn your back on us you spit on our traditions and laws you think you are too good for the two crosses now that you are nicky vale and then we learn that you are a traitor an informer he spits in nickys face without turning around he asks the board for its verdict guilty a huge surprise nicky thinks seeing as they already have the chain saw out and realizes jesus sweat is pouring down my back like a river shakalin asks what punishment should be rendered death death death death death death right down the line death by dismemberment i validate the verdict and the sentence shakalin says staring down at nicky burn in hell daziatnik valeshin he calls back to his bodyguard execute the sentence lev starts up the home depot special of the week and slices it through shakalins neck his head topples to the floor just as dani puts three silenced rounds into tiv lerners face dani holds the gun on the rest of them as he unstraps nicky lev puts the chain saw to one of the brigadiers necks as nicky says all in favor of my becoming pakhan please raise your hands hes unanimously elected were in america now daziatnik kindly explains when theyre done pissing their pants california and things are different here different from russia or brighton beach look outside and see the sunshine feel the warmth contemplate natan shakalins head on the floor dig it men real estate is the main chance against the code true but the heart of the code is in making money da da and this kgb accusation is nonsense but who cares anyway fuck the kgb in case you missed it the union of soviet socialist republics is no more the cold war is over theyre not the enemy anymore because theyre out of business which seems to be true nicky tested it out stopped sending money to karpotsov stopped answering messages stopped sending messages just completely went off the radar screen and what happened nothing nothing happened the vaunted kgb is impotent its a new world order you are all reborn in me nicky tells them over the buzz of the saw as lev chops lerners body into readily disposable pieces nicky makes his speech hes into it dude thinks hes pacino in the godfather i will remain pakhan for seven years after which each brigadier will be free to start his own independent organization i will use that time to completely legitimize my enterprise i would recommend that you do the same but that is your business parts of the old code are good and we will keep them other parts have served their purpose in the past but are now obsolete i will have a family i will have a wife i will have children to inherit what ive worked for how can we have a dynasty without heirs do we work to establish an empire that goes to the grave with us that is foolishness if anyone disagrees speak now there is no sound but the saw then were agreed nicky says i am restructuring the organization tratchev seeing as how tiv lerner is no longer capable of performing his duties youre promoted to the command of his brigade you will do auto accident fraud exclusively rubinsky your brigade will be auto theft schaller arson and extortion and brothers reach out to other ethnic groups the mexicans the vietnamese the white trash make them your operators insulate yourselves i do not want to read about the russian mafia in the papers or see your faces on television i will keep my security cell i loaned them to the late natan shakalin for a while for purposes that should be apparent but now i am taking them back you will report to them not to me you will pay percent not to me and percent to the obochek which i will maintain and control make money and invest it in the economy your sons will be senators nicky likes this last line came up with it when he was rehearsing this speech going over it and over it to maintain his nerve as he hoped that his plan would pay off that his foresight in persuading karpotsov to give exit visas to dani and lev would work the way they planned it that dani and lev would stay faithful to the vows they had made to each other in prison you will join me in paradise there is another promise to keep he sends for mother in collapsing cashpoor russia her exit is easier to arrange than a table at wolfgang pucks their reunion is cold at first shes hurt shes angry shes bitter at the six years of separation she barely speaks on the limo drive from lax to dana point she starts to brighten when they arrive at the gates of monarch bay and the guard trips over himself welcoming them in she starts to positively warm when she sees the house daziatnik it is barely furnished she says i thought you would like to do that mother he says and i count on your taste anyway it is yours mine although i have kept a room for myself if you find that acceptable she kisses him on both cheeks and then fleetingly on the mouth it is acceptable to me nicky separates himself from the two crosses except for his security cell he never sees his lieutenants lets them run their operations kick in the money to him hes satisfied to manage the obochek and run his real estate investments and collect his furniture he goes to his first auction with some of his new friends just as a way to kill a cloudy january saturday ends up falling in love not with any of the rich svelte women he sees there but with a george ii dressing table that calls out to him im yours more than that calls out to him im you and before he knows it nicky has his hand out and hes plunking down fifteen k on a big piece of walnut which he loves there is love that passes and love that lasts there is love that satisfies the body and the heart and which is passing and there is love that nourishes the soul and which is lasting the furniture is the only thing that nicky has ever found that nourishes his soul at first it was a class thing he bought it because he could buy it because the ability to pay that kind of money symbolized his triumph over the ghetto because the purchase of art as opposed to cars or horses for instance gave him an entree into the world of the beautiful people it made him not just one more real estate tycoon but a man of culture polish and yes class nicky is too smart not to acknowledge to himself the truth of all that but in time and not much time at that it became more than a status symbol it became a true love was it nicky wonders the art itself but that somewhat begs the question doesnt it perhaps it was the purity of effort that a work of art represents the genuine desire to create something that is truly beautiful a purity of effort in such contrast to a corrupt world or is it the beauty itself could it be that simple he wonders that i am irresistibly drawn to possess beauty engaging again in cheap psychoanalysis ah i have become an american it is not difficult to imagine that a boy raised in poverty would wish to own beauty if he could it has been let us face it for the first thirty or so years an ugly life the dreary flat the hideousness of afghanistan the horror of the jail cells dirty ice dirty snow mud blood shit and filth he wakes up from time to time with nightmares from the war a hateful stereotype that he finds embarrassing and it helps to turn on the lights and sit for a while with a fine piece of art to admire its beauty study its form and design to let it take him away from the images of bloated corpses mutilated comrades or the recurring dream of the mujahedin fighter hit by the flamethrower staggering forward on fire literally a whirling dervish twirling in agony under the swirling flames it helps nicky at such times to look at his artworks other nights sleep takes him back to the jail cells the filthencrusted freezing concrete floors the stench of sweat and shit and piss the smell of fear the screaming psychos the violent sodomites the quick deaths by homemade blades or garrotes or simple beatings skulls cracked against walls heads crushed onto floors faces beaten to mush by clubwielding guards not an inch of space to call ones own not a moment of privacy not a single instance of beauty to be seen anywhere at any price hell so to stand in ones own house in the clean lovely serenity of ones own home and contemplate beauty in the form of art whenever and for however long one wishes well it nourishes a soul in need of nourishment and it is passive nicky thinks it is simply beauty there to be enjoyed once purchased it makes no other demands has no other requirements except to be admired and enjoyed and it tells him that hes risen above it all risen above the cramped walkup he shared with mother above the dirt cold blood and fire of afghanistan far above the filth and stench and cold of the prison above the monotonous kitsch of the two crosses the cabinet tells him that hes arrived that hes not even a parvenu newmoney california real estate shark but a gentleman he starts buying books visiting dealerships attending more and more auctions and its not long before hes a major collector of antique english furniture he buys he sells he trades he makes a new set of friends he gets a new identity nicky vale real estate mogul and collector the turnaround inside one generation he makes the new friends that come with money and from the friends he absorbs the south coast style discovers the shops at south coast plaza and becomes a regular at armani brooks brothers giuducce et al becomes a standard figure at the good parties in newport beach corona del mar and laguna gets himself a boat and hosts his own parties out on the blue ocean daziatnik becomes nicky and everyone loves nicky why not hes charming rich and funny and has the most wonderful taste in art hes handsome hes exotic and inside a year hes on the a list for the best parties on the south coast at one of them he meets pamela incendiary origin opportunity and motive also known as the tripartite proof whatever its called you need these three elements to prove arson by an insured in court and if you deny a claim based on arson youd better be able to prove it in court same with the murder jack thinks to deny the life insurance claim i need to prove that it was a homicide and that nicky had motive and opportunity incendiary origin is just a fancy way of saying that someone intentionally set the fire what you need to satisfy this one are such things as traces of accelerants the remnants of an incendiary device maybe a timer you also want the indicators of a hot fastmoving fire big vpattern alligator char deep char on the floor crazed glass a pour pattern most important of all these is traces of accelerants and now he has them dr bambi will come into court and testify that he found heavy traces of kerosene in the flooring and the floor joists hell show the jury his charts and graphs and the jury will go back into the room believing that someone poured kerosene around that bedroom so jack checks off incendiary origin and pushes it out of his mind opportunity that is did the insured have a chance to set the fire or cause to have it set it goes a little deeper than that the actual standard is exclusive opportunity was the insured the only party to have access to the house during the critical time when the fire was set opportunity is a tricky mother its why you look to see if doors and windows were locked its why you talk to neighbors to see what and whom they might have seen its why you take recorded statements to pin the insured down to where they were at the time of the fire its elusive one reason being that arsonists unless theyre really stupid tend to use timing devices for one thing there is a matter of getting out of the place without setting yourself on fire you pour some gasoline around and strike a match you stand a good chance of becoming a human torch what a lot of amateurs dont know is that its the fumes that ignite not the liquid so they pour the gas step back toss the match and then run out flaming into the night for another thing a good timing device gives you the time to establish an alibi you were somewhere else at the moment of ignition so you didnt have the exclusive opportunity to set the fire a timing device can be very simple or very sophisticated as simple as a series of twisted sheets tied together to form a giant wick which gives you the chance to light it and get away by the time it hits the big pool of gas and goes phwoom or it can be a simple timer wired to strike a spark into a well of accelerant at a certain time and that gives you even more space jacks personal alltime favorite for a sophisticated timer though was on the file where the couple was definitely in las vegas the weekend their house burned down they had receipts and eyewitnesses for a fiftysomeoddhour period and there were no remnants of timers found in the house but the fire was sure as hell of incendiary origin because it had all the indicators and someone had gone to a great deal of trouble to make the house fireready holes had been punched in the walls to improve circulation fire eats oxygen windows had been left open same and floor samples tested positive for accelerants the security system was intact and there were no signs that anyone had come into the house so how was the fire set jack puzzled over it hell agonized over it for weeks he visited the site again and again finally he found a hot spot on the floor in the upstairs family room right below the charred remnants of the vcr jacks favorite alltime timing device a videocassette timed to eject and tip over a burner into a pool of accelerant the couple got away with it of course but jack was relieved to have figured it out anyway all this is to say that generally speaking opportunity has to do with time which often has to do with some kind of timing device this is true even if the insureds have hired the arson out jacks experience is that this is more often the case in commercial fires because it really takes a pro to burn a warehouse down but there have been cases where homeowners have hired an arsonist and then gone off on vacation to establish an alibi but jack doesnt think that nicky hired this one out you burn up your wife in your bed its personal so jack asks himself did nicky have the opportunity to go into the house kill his wife and set the fire not if his mothers story is true but jack thinks that mothers story is bullshit then jack considers the question given opportunity did nicky have the exclusive opportunity to set the fire well the doors were locked the windows were cracked open there were no signs of forced entry so who besides the owner had access to the house but its tricky its weak and unless he can catch nicky in a lie proving the opportunity issue is going to be tough which brings jack to the subject of motive there are three basic motives for arson insanity vengeance and money and the greatest of these is money take insanity first though here youre talking about your storied pyromaniac that specifictype freak who is simply and hopelessly enamored of fire the sad fact is that there is a striking coincidence between childhood sexual abuse and pyromania there is something about the allconsuming heat that is evocative of sexuality and at the same time cleansing it both brings up the heat and makes it go away this kind of fire though doesnt come up much in insurance fraud anyway because pyromaniacs tend to burn other peoples stuff and they tend to get caught doing it so you pay the claim and move on then theres revenge a little more common but still unusual because generally people who are really pissed these days just shoot the object of their pissedoffedness but there are white supremacist nut jobs who like to lob molotov cocktails at synagogues and theres the occasional fired no pun intended cleaning lady who cleans the floor with charcoal starter and a match and theres the husband about to lose his house to the exwife and who burns it to the ground by way of saying live in this bitch so theres revenge and there is something about a fire thats cathartic no question but its not a choice that most people make so theres insanity and revenge but they both pale compared to the numero uno motive for arson may i have the envelope please money money honey to the tune of some billion a year nationally jack knows that there are about eightysix thousand arson fires a year thats about one for every hour of the day and the motive for most of them is money or more properly the lack of it fire makes all things new again a fire in nature burns off the old to make way for the new same thing in business it burns off the old investment to make way for the new its an ancient cycle and the fact is that the incidence of arson directly corresponds to the economic cycle in boom times arson goes down in a recession it goes up in boom times people buy a lot of stuff on credit because theyre making the money to service the debt then the recession hits the money aint coming in like it was but the debt is the same its the same thing with homes most people buy more house than they can afford they buy the house when things are fat thinking theyre going to stay fat forever then things get lean but the mortgage is still fat the mortgage doesnt go on any damn diet most people walk away from the house say goodbye to their equity and try to start over others say like fuck that and get proactive let their insurance company pay off the mortgage it happened a lot in orange county jack thinks in the reagan years everyone was fat the whole economy was betting on the income then reality hit and what everyone bought on credit during the reagan years they burned down during the bush administration the orange county treasurers got caught on the slide and the county went bankrupt so the real estate market collapsed the building trades went down the chute and the only industry that was booming was the arson business out with the old in with the new natures eternal cycle sometimes nature does it on her own its weird to contemplate but jack knows the reality is that the eventual southern california economic recovery was fueled by disasters first fire then earthquake its and the economy sucks the real estate market and building trades are moribund and everything else comes to a standstill with them then the fires hit laguna malibu thousand oaks big outofcontrol fires that rise up out of the dry ground and the hot dry wind and burn thousands of acres and hundreds of houses a lot of people are burned out of their homes and the insurance companies pay out hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits which is where the economic recovery comes in because the fires restore the building trades the insurance companies provide the cash to rebuild the burned homes contractors get hired they hire workers they buy materials from the suppliers the suppliers start hiring people the people take their salaries and buy stuff the cycle goes on an upswing then the earthquake hits nature comes to the rescue because it forces the insurance companies to lolly up billions billions of dollars of new money gets pumped into the socal economy and it gets things started again so sometimes nature touches off the cycle more often though its people touching off their own economic renewal with a match and jack wonders if thats what nicky vale did strictly speaking you dont always need motive to prove arson the textbook example jack learned in fire school was suppose a person sets fire to his building at noon on main street in front of a hundred witnesses five of whom videotape the event in that case you dont need to establish motive because you have ample direct evidence that your man did the fire jack thinks this example is very useful because in his experience nothing like this has ever ever happened and its never ever going to happen the closest jack has come to that slice of heaven was the case of the husband who is coming home from work and sees a plume of smoke rising from his town house complex fire trucks roar past him sirens wail the whole nine yards the husband pulls up to the security gate only to see his wife sitting on the lawn a bottle of jack daniels in one hand and a gasoline can in the other and she looks up at him and says i always hated that damn house that is what is known in the claims business as a slam dunk and jack has always retained an awed sense of admiration for the husbands honesty because it was the husband who told jack the story so i guess im fucked on my claim the husband says after relating the story to jack theyre standing beside the charred ruins of what had been the mans very nice town house im afraid so jack says jack almost wants to pay the claim he feels so bad for the guy who was after all honest about what happened but the law says that if any permanent resident of the house intentionally sets the fire the homeowner is shitoutofluck but jack offers a suggestion you can try saying that your wife is mentally ill and therefore her actions cant be intentional jack says you think that would work hey its california to his credit the guy doesnt try it he does file for divorce though anyway absent that kind of rare event you need motive today is motive day as to the murder well in a weird way the murder piggybacks the arson the motive and the opportunity are the same the homicide version of incendiary origin comes with the coroners report proving that she died before the fire then if the fire was intentional well its virtually impossible to conclude that the death was accidental prove it you bet your ass nicky so the money first cherchez la buck as simple as picking up a phone twentyfour hours a day seven days a week you got a name and a social security number and you can find out whether someones servicing debt and for how much jack punches in the number gets put on hold and tries not to listen to the elevator music coming over the phone three annoying minutes later he has an answer though nickys maxed out on every piece of plastic in his wallet hes on the verge of having his card jerked by the next person who says hi my name is diane and ill be your server today like nicky has karl maiden telling him dont leave home with it nicky vales credit rating is in the realm of suck call me nicky owes plus to the credit card companies that aint all nicky has another creditor uncle sam theres a lien on the bluffside drive property for next jack hits the internet gets a service called ameridata punches in nickys social security number and date of birth and in a matter of seconds he gets a rundown on everything nicky owns theres the house on bluffside of course mortgaged to pacific coast mortgage and finance mother russias house is also in his name also mortgaged to pacific coast he has five cars three bought for cash two with payments in arrears no airplanes no boats but he had a boat jack remembers what happened to the boat and when he makes a note to check it out gets off the net to take a look at nickys bank balance nicky is tapped out he has a few thou in the account enough to make your everyday living expenses not enough to keep current with the bigger bills back to the computer tap in a few numbers and hook in to the california secretary of states office database does the old namessdob drill again and then comes out with a list of any corporation in which nicky is a principal sees what he expects to see nicky is president and ceo of vale investments which must be his real estate development operation jack thinks theres also valeart the precious furniture and thats it jack taps out of the state database then taps in to the countys types in vale nicky dba and comes out with three partnerships and two limited partnerships south coast management cote dor management and sunset investment transpac holding and transnat holding jack jots down the names and then hits dun amp bradstreet and moodys and also does a credit check it all comes out the same nicky vales businesses are drowning in the red sea nicky as a business entity is about to go down for the third time and there is no life raft in sight he has apartment buildings that are halfempty buildings that are under construction with no funds to complete them and creditors howling at the door motive jacks about to head over to pacific coast mortgage and finance when carol buzzes him and tells him to get into billys office goddamn it jack billy yells what jack asks like he doesnt know theyre standing in billys cactus garden outside the office billys sucking on a cigarette like its an oxygen mask the vale file thats what billy says he tosses the butt on the ground and lights another has to cup his hand to get it lit because the wind is blowing like crazy this puts him in an even worse mood you have a little chat with the insured last night well that didnt take long jack thinks i wanted to see his reaction jack says and hes a cool customer well let me tell you about his reaction billy says vale called his agent roger hazlitt yes and rattled his cage about you hazlitt took time from his busy day humping his secretary to call his agency manager who called the vp for agency who called me and rattled my cage vales personal property coverage is way over guidelines billy so are his endorsements what are you saying im saying his personal property coverage is way over guidelines and so are his endorsements dont try to wind me up over agency jack like most insurance companies cal fire and life is organized into three basic divisions agency underwriting and claims in theory the three divisions are equal each has a vice president who reports to the president but in reality its agency that swings the big hammer every guy who plunks his butt down in the executive dining room upstairs on mahogany row has come out of agency every suit on the board of directors has come out of agency because its agency that brings in the money jack thinks youre not going to make money from claims jack knows all claims does is pay money out and youre not going to see any money from underwriting the best underwriting can do is try to set the rates so that you charge the right amount of premiums to make a profit but agency thats the golden goose man thats the pipeline you have this force of agents out there selling life selling auto selling fire taking their commissions percent on fire and auto percent on life thats serious money and it regenerates itself the agent sells the policy once and all he has to do is keep the policy and he gets his commission every year on renewal so he wants to keep that customer and he doesnt really care what claims has to pay out if that customer has a loss the agent wants claims to pay it just pay it baby because the money doesnt come out of the agents pocket or his commission it comes out of claims claims gets it of course from the big pool at corporate but even mahogany row doesnt care all that much how much money is going out as long as a lot more money is coming in so as long as people are buying california fire and life everythings cool just keep the money coming in of course its a little hard to sell to someone when some lunchbucket from claims has called him an arsonist and murderer then the customer threatens to yank all his policies and he tells all his friends how hes being fucked by his insurance company and the next thing you know you have guys flooding off the eighteenth hole to jerk their policies away from you and then its over then you have to go back to sitting in mom and pops kitchen trying to sell them a homeowners policy thats maybe going to net you a hundred a year so before any of that bad shit happens you reach out for the telephone and you scream for the big hammer to come down on somebody in this case goddamn billy hayes who tells the socal agency vp we dont pay people to kill their wives and burn their own houses down so he doesnt in fact need jack winding him up about agency or about underwriting underwriting jack asks yeah they called too billy says they want to monitor how we handle this claim what the hell does underwriting have to do with it jack asks since when do we report to underwriting thats what i told them billy says but if youre keeping score thats agency underwriting and oh yeah the sheriffs department winding my crank about the vale file sorry you been over to the sheriffs i advised deputy bentley that he might want to reconsider his evaluation of the vale fire goddamn it are you trying to get us sued billy yells you deny a claim based on arson when the sheriffs already called it an accident and well get sued for bad faith we might be in bad faith if we even continue to investigate the cause of a fire after its been deemed accidental we have positive samples from disaster jack says and nicky vale is up to his ears in debt then he tells him about the funeral and lettys story when hes finished billy says hearsay what do you want jack asks pamela vale to testify it would help billy says maybe you have incendiary origin and maybe you have motive but you dont have a goddamn thing on opportunity vale was draining the lizard and checking on his sleeping kids the mothers lying jack says or maybe he hired the job out prove it says billy i need some time jack says i dont know if you got the time billy says what do you mean he asks they want me to take you off this file jack whos they they everybody billy says agency underwriting the sheriffs shit i dunno anyone else you pissed off on this jack no but the day is young keep it up jack billy youre not telling me they want to pay this fucking claim jack yells of course they want to pay it billy yells back what the fuck do you think they want to do they got a millionaire businessman with a load of juicy policies a goddamn camel couldnt carry they got a guy can put heat on the presidents office if he wants to and by the way thats his next phone call agency knows they fucked up underwriting knows they fucked up you think they want to see that in court you think they want a fight over this not when they cure it with the old green poultice the green poultice billys phrase for throwing money at a problem claim is the green poultice going to bring pamela vale back jack asks goddamn it jack billy says thats not your job its the cops job they wont reopen the investigation billy taps jack on the forehead helloooo good morning doesnt that tell you something tells me theyre not doing their job and you are right billy asks jack wade is always right everyone else is fucked only jack wade does the right thing no matter what it costs other people grow up you cant always be the lone cowboy riding your surfboard into the sunset what am i supposed to say to that billy because its true jack stands there with the wind blowing into his face blowing the greengray mudge from the cars on the into his eyes and nose billy says just take care of the claim the claim is your business the claim is wrong prove it i need time to prove it you aint got the time two old friends standing in the middle of a mock desert screaming at each other they realize it billy sits down says shit sorry billy jack asks can you take my back on this one billy blows out a puff of air and says yeah for a while for a while jack because im telling you im getting heat thanks billy and dont you ever talk to an insured like that again billy says and keep adjusting the claim another badfaithphobia demand the california fair claims practices act demands that an insurance company has to keep adjusting the claim while at the same time its investigating the reason is that if the company spends months investigating without adjusting and then decides to pay the claim the payment to the insured is unfairly delayed right jack says ill start working up an estimate meaning that hell do a scope determine what was damaged or destroyed then a comp an itembyitem estimate of what it will take to replace and repair just what hed do if he thought this was a righteous claim just do your goddamn job billy says if i have enough evidence jack says im going to deny the claim its your call billy says just do it right which is what billys counting on jack hates golf but the old links are where you want to be if you want to find an insurance agent depends on the time of day of course between seven and eleven in the morning you check the golf course lunchtime you check the country club early afternoon after lunch you check the links again late afternoon you dont check anywhere unless you want to be a witness in a divorce case jacks on the course to buy himself some time he finds roger hazlitt on the seventeenth hole in a foursome with two doctors and a real estate developer see you dont get to be a millionaire insurance agent selling individual policies to mom and pop you get to be a millionaire insurance agent by selling policies to condo complexes gated communities and the occasional wealthy individual homeowner like nicky vale which of course is what jack wants to talk about roger hazlitt is less enthused you sell a boatload of insurance and the house burns and the wife dies it completely fucks your loss ratio for the entire year not that its rogers money it isnt but if youre in the top forty on loss ratios at the end of the year cal fire and life sends you and your wife to rome or hawaii or paris or someplace and roger hates missing those trips and hes not all that thrilled to see jack wade come striding over the green in his cheap blue blazer and khaki slacks and white shirt and tie because the two doctors and the real estate developer are putting up a massive condo complex in laguna niguel and roger figures that all he has to do is tank eighteen and blow a putt and he has the policy and percent commission on the premiums but he puts on a big smile and pumps jacks hand and says guys meet jack wade best damned insurance adjuster in this great land of ours and that is no shit jack hes thinking that its all shit but he smiles and shakes hands as that asshole roger hazlitt says god forbid guys that something should happen with your buildings but if it does you know you can call jack personally and it will get handled right jack now jack feels like an asshole but he says you bet didnt you bring your clubs jack i work for a living is what jack wants to say but what he says instead is a quick word with you roger tell you what roger says let me hit my tee shot and then while these guys are in the rough looking for their balls we can have a chat okay sounds like a plan there we go roger has a sweet swing which he should because he plays maybe seven times a week plus lessons with his pro so he hits a long ball and then takes jack aside im going to lose five hundred bucks to these jamokes he says then make a couple hundred k on their premiums so lets keep this quick jack what are you doing out here couldnt you have come to my office youre never in your office well isnt this something one of the gals could handle the gals being the women who work in rogers office youre nicky vales agent jack says guilty you sold him a shitload of special endorsements jack says art custom furniture jewelry so way over guidelines roger underwriting okayed it roger says starting to get defensive starting to sweat now who at underwriting i dont know roger says ask underwriting come on roger jack says that kind of overage you must have a sweetheart in underwriting fuck you jack jack puts his arm around rogers shoulders says into his ear roger i dont begrudge you a living you go get as much money as your greedy little hands can grab i know you have a wife three kids and two girlfriends to support plus business expenses roger is like mister community for the annual dana point festival of the whales parade roger rents the elephant in the annual festival of the tall ships one of the tall ships flies a flag that says hazlitt insurance agency on it these things cost money so do tennis bracelets and cosmetic surgery so i know jack continues that you need to be bringing it in thats goddamn right jack cool jack says and i dont give a rats ass that you have to give a taste to someone in underwriting to okay an overage now and then i dont care claims doesnt care unless you know i need to go digging and rooting through underwriting and then maybe even mahogany row might wake up and hear about it youre an asshole or should i go over to the guys there jack says nudging his chin at rogers golf partners and tell them that by all means they should buy their insurance from you now today while you still have your license a real fucking asshole just give me a name jack says someone i can talk to i dont give a damn about the money roger yeah you do roger says all you joe lunchbuckets from claims youre jealous how much do you clear jack thirtyfive fortyfive maybe fifty i shake that much off my dick at the urinal jack good for you roger but its true jack thinks all us joe lunchbuckets from claims we are jealous about the money bill reynolds roger whispers a black guy black guys dont need money roger says i kicked him a grand how can you make i dont make on the endorsements i make on the home on the life on the cars see this is why youre rich roger roger says i had to write the endorsements or vale wouldnt give me his business on all the other shit you know what those commissions stack up to year after year plus vale owns three apartment buildings i get the policies on those plus i get to solicit the tenants on their renters insurance and their auto you know how much money that is i dont want to know jack says id only get jealous its serious money jack looks down on the green rogers partners are standing there looking back at the tee i guess they found their balls jack thinks he asks are you and nicky like buddies or something screw buddies roger says i dont have time for buddies maybe we have a drink now and then lunch okay maybe once or twice i go out on his boat with him for some blow and some babes dont look at me like that jack i think your buddy killed his wife rog jack says for the insurance benefits and he burned his house for the insurance benefits so fuck his boat and his blow and his babes and roger dont you be making any more calls to my boss or your boss or anybodys fucking boss to get this claim paid just keep me out of this jack yeah you make the bucks and now you want out of it when theres the mess and the dead bodies and the hell to pay then you just stay out of it rog jack says you stick your dick in claims again ill see that it gets cut off so shake that jack drops in at pacific coast mortgage and finance tworoom office shares a building with a swimwear store and an erotic novelty shop on del prado in dana point big glossy photographs of ocean scenes dominate the walls handsome guys and sleek girls windsurfing flecks of ocean spray flying off their bodies glistening in the sun big beautiful sloops cutting through eightfoot swells a gang of surfer dudes and wahinis carrying their boards against the background of a fiery sunset like life is beautiful life is short borrow money and get yourself a taste of it before you croak guy sitting behind the desk is a young cool dude with pat riley slickedback hair a pink polo shirt and a blue blazer its like one of those financecanbecool deals you know lets get the paperwork over with and go surfing dude nameplate on the desk reads gary miller jack introduces himself and shows him the authorization form that nicky had signed jack asks youre carrying the paper on the vale house which is just pro forma the name of the mortgage company is on the declaration page of the policy and the loss report but jack wanted to say it to see if garys eyes lit up they do you can see right in those inane baby blues that the boy is carrying a ton of paper on the vale house and the payments havent been coming in guy is sphinctergripping on the paper and now he sees a shot that the insurance company might ride into town and save his ass man like god bless california fire and life something happen he asks trying to keep the hopeful note out of his voice it burned down jack says no shit and mrs vale was killed jack adds what a shame gary says hes not an evil guy he does feel bad about pamela vale who seemed very nice and was one of the most completely righteous babes he had ever seen on the other hand it does seem like nicky vale is tapped out and california fire and life has some deep pockets yeah jack says a shame what happened gary asks he doesnt want to come right out and ask the sorry burning question he has on his mind was it a total loss please let it be a total he thinks a total loss would pay off the whole loan jack says the official report is that mrs vale was smoking in bed gary shakes his head a nasty habit very uncool jack agrees would you show me the paper please oh yeah sure the paper is heavy this is not paper you would like to carry across say death valley but nicky was carrying it what nicky had done was he originally bought the house for cash who the hell jack thinks has million in cash turns out nicky really didnt because six years later he mortgages the house with pacific for million hes carrying a sixkamonth payment hes missed uh three payments gary volunteers he just cant help himself somewhere inside burns the ember of a hope that jack is just going to whip out the old checkbook and say oh well here if the vale loan goes down the shitter gary goes down after it three payments jack asks we looking at foreclosure its a consideration gary says i mean you know we dont want to no but what are you going to do youre going to try to carry the guy jack thinks at least until the real estate market improves otherwise you eat the loan and you have a house you maybe cant sell and even if you can youre going to take a bath on it jack asks six k is a little light for that kind of balance isnt it read on jack reads on doesnt take long before he sees what hes looking for prima facie motive for arson a balloon payment due in six weeks no wonder nicky was in a hurry to start the claim did you write this loan gary jack asks seemed like a good idea at the time gary says different times jack says he has this image of cool gary on nickys boat blowing coke getting some chucha chatting a little business with nicky whats a mil and a half between friends party on so what do you think jack asks is he going to make the balloon i mean if you were a betting man gary laughs i am a betting man thats no shit hey maybe i covered gary says eyes getting a little angry a little fuck you now you gotta pay the loan yeah well before you get too skippy jack says consider this nicky owes fiftyseven thou to the irs and the california department of revenue the blood drains from garys face liens he asks oops jack says you make the drafts out to us gary says well to you and vale jack says because thats what the law says a draft on a claim gets made out to the homeowner and the mortgagee let them work it out of course in this case they have to deal with each other and the irs and sacramento thatll be fun come on gary whines jack shrugs its the law fucking nicky you have a relationship yeah we have a relationship gary says he fucks me the partys over jack asks you have other bad paper with him gary gary wants to tell him jack can see it in his eyes then gary backs away nothing youre carrying he says meaning nothing he can tell me about jack thinks he has other paper but because cal fires not the insurer on the property he cant disclose it to me i have authorization jack says you have authorization on nicky vale gary says staring at jack like good morning duhh get it yet jack gets it garys carrying paper on a company that nicky has an interest in you want to shoot me a couple of copies of this jack asks handing the loan papers back gary comes back with the copies asks so how long before you write the draft if we issue a check jack says what do you mean a genuine sphincter moment just that the claims process isnt finished yet jack says smiling he gathers the papers and gets up pray for surf he says jacks at dana harbor boat brokerage he goes up the stairs of the wooden building he knows the building well like every stick because he and his old man built it anyway he goes into the office of the brokerage and jeff wynands sitting there where hes always sitting at his desk on the phone looking out the window at the thousands of boats in the marina about half of which hes sold over the years he sees jack and smiles and motions for him to sit down jack waits while jeff gives out the details on a thirtyeightfoot racer jeff looks like a yacht broker hes dressed in just about the same casual clothes as gary miller but on jeff it looks good not a statement just his clothes and it goes with the sailboats and motor launches in the harbor jeffs been wearing the same clothes since jack was delivering him his newspapers when jeff hangs up jack asks can i buy you lunch chez marsha sounds good chez marsha is actually a little snack shack down by baby beach on the west harbor when jack was a kid the shack sat out at the end of the pier that stretched way out into the harbor jack used to dip a pole in the fishing contests marsha held for the local kids then they built the dock for the brig pilgrim and built the orange county marine institute and cut the original pier way back so now marshas sits on the walkway near the base of the truncated old pier the shacks not on the water so she doesnt do the fishing contests anymore but she still has hot dogs with steamed buns and chopped onions so jack and jeff grab a bench at one of the steel picnic tables beside marshas shack jack goes up to the window miss marsha jack whats up she asks is that jeff wynand with you yup marshas had the place for thirtysomeodd years so she knows everyone worth knowing at the harbor if shes not too busy sometimes she sits down with jack at one of the tables and they discuss the latest idiocies of progress theyre redesigning the harbor tearing down the old to make place for the new going to build a twostory concrete parking structure and push out the old stores and restaurants to bring in the chains so the harbor will look like everywhere else two hot dogs please jack says mustard relish and onions on one mustard and onions on the other two bags of plain chips and two medium cokes please you got it she puts the dogs in the steamer and asks so hows life good yours busy she says too busy i dont want to be this busy id give it up except i dont know what id do for a social life is this a business lunch sort of i wont join you then she says sevenfifty jack miss marsha do you know you have a big plastic owl on your roof marsha rolls her eyes the county put it there to keep the pigeons off they take turns sitting on its head jack looks up again and sure enough theres a pigeon perched on the owls head jack goes back to the table and sets jeffs mustardrelishandonions in front of him says youre a cheap date theres no better lunch on earth jack tends to agree sitting there in the sun beside the building thats been there for a while with the woman inside whos been there a while looking at the boats looking at the water you sit long enough at one of these tables you can find out everything thats going on in dana point business politics real estate as well as important stuff like what fish are running where and what bait theyre hitting on so whats up jeff asks nicky vale the love boat captain is that right jeff laughs lets just say that nicky had a lot of second mates on board did you handle his boat jeff sold it to him jeff says sold it for him i didnt know he sold it i can check on it jeff says but im going to say it was about six months ago whyd he sell it jack asks did he tell you you know what they say jeff says the two happiest days of your life are the day you buy your first boat and the day you sell it he was sick of it let me put it this way jack do you own a sixtyfoot cabin cruiser no why not for one thing jack says i dont have that kind of money there you go the other thing jack thinks is that if i had the money for a boat i wouldnt buy that boat id buy a boat you could do some serious fishing with a boat you could have a shot at making a living with a working boat you got the impression he needed the money jack asks i didnt get the impression jeff says he took a bath on it the boat market is slow jack even slower six months ago nicky sold it for about fifty grand less than it was worth i advised him to wait but he was in a hurry insisted i make the sale jack notes the frown on his face jeffs been in business a long time hes made a ton of money selling boats for what theyre worth not a lot more not a lot less its not the commission its the idea boats are expensive jeff says its not just the cost of the boat hell nicky bought that boat for cash but its insurance its fuel its maintenance repairs the slip fees alone on a boat that size in this harbor youre looking at two and a half a month and nicky threw some parties on that boat so youre talking booze food coke you hear rumors you ever hear that he used to slap his wife around jeff blows a long sigh you know how to take the fun out of a nice lunch sorry look kid jeff says sometimes youd hear some arguing from the boat you know how sound bounces off water she drank he had a temper once or twice maybe the harbor cops were called did he beat her i dont know i know most people around here were pretty happy when he sold the boat except maybe the liquor store guys why are you here jack vales house burned down and she died in the fire jeff says common knowledge i used to love this harbor when i was a kid jack says i wish they hadnt messed with it progress jack you think nah now theyre going to ruin dana strands jack says fucking great sunsets well we stopped it for a while jeff says hell of a battle too save the strands mobilized a lot of the local people got some councilmen on their side some environmental groups raised money for ads circulated petitions even forced the great sunsets corporation into court over environmental impact issues and won but theyll be back theyll get better lawyers a few councilmen you cant fight money jack they sit and stare at the boats for a while then jeff balls up his paper wrapper tosses it into the trash can and says so its a good thing i got nickys boat sold huh last thing we need is a fire in the marina im not saying anything jeff and i hear you jack he says i have to go sell some boats thanks for your time thanks for the lunch they start to leave but hang out chatting with marsha for a while talking about progress dr benton howard dr howard slides into a redupholstered banquette at hamburger hamblet in westwood already sitting there is a skinny guy with a bad haircut and an equally bad blue suit i asked for nonsmoking howard says dani shrugs and sips his iced tea howard says im a doctor after all just barely thinks dani he takes another drag of his cigarette and blows it toward the doctors face howard coughs dramatically and waves his hand through the air that stinks howard says and you stink he thinks but doesnt say he wants to give dani the name of his dry cleaner but hes afraid to but jesus the suit needs cleaning badly it smells no stinks of stale sweat and old cigarette smoke and whatever the hell it is that dani puts on his greasy hair some sort of russian bear grease howard decides he signals the waitress for an iced tea i was expecting a different person howard says viktor tratchev who although somewhat rough at least has a basic appreciation for personal hygiene youll be meeting with me from now on dani says is that all right with viktor howard asks sure dani says or at least it will be dani thinks when tratchev finds out about it and if it isnt fuck him anyway you have money for me dani asks fifteen thousand howard whispers in the briefcase dr benton howard is fortyseven years old and has had a medical career you might charitably describe as undistinguished secondtolast in his class on grenada he did his residency at a county hospital in louisiana and then went into private practice in sports medicine dr howards practice kept him very busy mostly in court defending himself against malpractice suits because unfortunate things tended to happen to dr howard not to mention his patients x rays got reversed for instance resulting in the removal of cartilage from the wrong knee or reconstructive surgery on an ankle that was already perfectly constructed then there were a couple of unfortunate incidents involving disc surgeries missed it by that much and dr howard is that close to delicensing and bankruptcy when the russians seek him out howards sitting in his office one day dodging subpoena service when the russian fellow comes in and suggests that dr benton howard set himself up in a subspecialty soft tissue injuries the wonderful thing about treating soft tissue injuries howard discovers is that he doesnt have to actually see any patients never mind treat them which is after all where all his problems came from in the first place no all dr howard has to do is meet viktor in restaurants sip iced tea and sign diagnoses treatment reports and recommendations for chiropractic treatment massage therapy and rehabilitation therapy not that the patients dont come to his office they do they come straight from a lawyers office to howards office sit in the lobby and read magazines until the nurse calls their name then they go into a treatment room and read magazines until howard comes in and tells them to go home or to the chiropractor masseur or rehabilitation specialist and the money rolls in and all his problems go away the malpractice suits are settled or dropped the bill collectors quit leaning on his doorbell his wife fires her lawyer and crawls back into his bed all because of soft tissue injuries as long as howard signs reports that verify that patient x is suffering from severe pain and moderate to complete disability from a fivemileperhour rearender fenderbender the money train makes regular stops at howards station and its so easy because someone else has already written the reports all howard has to do is slip into a banquette in a dark restaurant and sign until his wrist gets sore dr benton howard actually receives honesttogoodness physical therapy that actually occurs for carpal tunnel syndrome from signing so many forms which is whats happening today dani pulls out a stack of medical reports and benton starts signing they have a real system going a factory these guys can poop out medical reports like a xerox machine theyre that slick in fact theyre going so fast benton is in a hurry to get away from danis offensive odor that he unwittingly signs treatment reports for seven people who are dead killed when a fuel tanker slammed into a van on a highway onramp howard doesnt realize it of course neither does dani but its a potentially ugly fuckup even benton howard would have a tough time explaining why he prescribed three months of neck massages for a man who is not only deceased but actually incinerated jack heads over to laguna beach the fifteenminute trip south along the pacific coast highway is one of jacks favorite drives skirting the edge of the coastal plateau the pch is a mild roller coaster that takes you past dana strands and salt creek beach and the ritzcarlton past monarch bay and then up a hill that eventually drops you again by aliso pier if you walk out onto the concrete structure around dusk youll see a spectacular sunset and aliso creek beach then it climbs up another hill into south laguna where the hotels and restaurants and art shops really kick in and you can see the roofs of expensive houses tucked away on the streets that lead down to the ocean a few more minutes of this and you hit laguna beach laguna beach got its start in life as an artists colony bunch of painters and sculptors fled la back in the s and came down to the thenpristine bay and put up their artists bungalows and painted seascapes and carved wooden statues of the fishermen who still lived around there it was a great choice for an artists colony because laguna beach is truly beautiful shaped around a crescent of coastline which rises to bluffs and cliffs a narrow plateau where the town sits and then up to the steep green laguna hills the whole thing madly lush with palm trees and bright flowers and an array of aloes and when you look at it from a height it brings to mind a painters palette so the artists settled there and a few tourists would come down and buy a few paintings and sculptures so the artists set up some openair markets where they could put up stands and still paint and carve while they waited for the customers to drift in it was a natural step from openair stands to galleries from galleries to restaurants from restaurants to hotels and after about fifty years the town became a tourist destination it boomed with everything else in the s got overbuilt got perhaps a little yuppie but never quite lost touch with its bohemian origins when south coast locals think of laguna beach they still think of painters and sculptors coffee shops and bookstores and before it got trendy bookstores with coffee shops writers and poets hare krishnas and gay men laguna beach being the primary locus of gay life on the south coast which is why and it is no less true for being stereotypical the service in the restaurants is so friendly and so good and the zoning is vicious and the town has a style you wont find elsewhere on the south coast laguna has its own certain sensibility which is why jack like most other oldtime locals treasures the town so it was particularly heartbreaking when the fire swept through it jack was actually on vacation that day taking his vacation in october when most of the tourists were gone but the sun was still hot and the weather dry too hot and too dry as it turned out because the winds blew the fire across the brown brittle grasses on the bare hills above laguna canyon jack was out on his board when he saw a thin plume of smoke rise on the hills east of town and then the wind came up like a giant trying to fan the embers and the weirdest thing was that he could hear the crackling of the dry grass burning over the crashing of the waves he saw the orangeyellow flames burst up over the hills then race down into the canyon and the fire trucks race up to meet the fire before it could get into the populated canyon below but jack could see from his vantage point in the ocean that that wasnt going to happen because the fire leaped across the canyon just jumped laguna canyon road which runs perpendicular to the ocean and leads into town and then climbed the opposite slope like it was nothing winds whipping around like a madman wind like gods temper tantrum and jack saw that the fire was moving up and over the hills parallel to the coast and right down the canyon toward the heart of town and jack was thinking why laguna of all the crap and schlock and shit they threw up on the coast why laguna he paddled in threw on his clothes and ran to help fight the fire by nightfall they were fighting it at the waters edge then it stopped the wind changed and blew the flames back over charred ground already denuded of fuel just like that jack thought it had us beat and it let up had us down and let us up like god changing his mind like some kind of warning of what jack wondered a glimpse of the apocalypse a preview of hell something about this california fire and life jack stood there in the water wondering this as he watched the fire recede he was hunched over sucking for air along with strangers and guys he surfed with women hed gone to school with german tourists who just happened to have been there that night black guys who shilled b ball on the public courts of main beach glorious queen headwaiters and their partners millionaires whose hillside homes were now smoking rubble and they all stood there like soldiers who have stood before an overwhelming attack watching the enemy give it up and retreat and there were no cheers or whoops they were all just too damn tired but what jack remembers about that moment was that there was no talk of loss or defeat or whatifthishappensagain all the talk was about one thing rebuilding what people were saying was basically we got out safely with the catdog with our pictures a few of our things the rest of it is just stuff its just a hassle thats all but shit no were not leaving well live in a hotel in an apartment in a trailer until we rebuild and jack remembers thinking like fucking a nobody who really loves this place would leave not for an earthquake not for afire not for anything the other thing jack remembers about that night is goddamn billy goddamn billy leading a veritable convoy of trucks right behind the fire trucks and ambulances and the like comes billy in the passenger seat of the lead truck the road is closed to private vehicles but billy leans out the window to the cop and shouts these aint no goddamn private vehicles i got hoses in here face masks and gloves i got pumps and generators i got blankets and pillows and food i got teddy bears and shit like that for the kids they let billy through billy comes roaring into laguna like general patton what happened is that billy was monitoring the radio early in the afternoon when the fires broke out and billy looked at the wind and the weather and figured this could be serious shit so billy mobilized his major disaster plan which hed been working on for years because you just had to know this was gonna happen sometime every dog in claims was immediately called in from whatever he or she was doing every adjuster maintenance person lunchroom worker supervisor whatever who wasnt already fighting the fires cal fire and life had some trucks of its own but billy also emptied every ryder and uhaul lot in costa mesa and within a couple of hours trucks were loaded with supplies and heading toward the fires waiting like benign vultures by the sides of the roads until all the fire trucks had arrived and then billy gave the order to get in there so jack knows that while a lot of the supplies that went to the shelters and to the people fighting the fire was brought in by the red cross and the national guard that day a lot of it also came from cal fire and life and when he was standing on the beach thinking the fire was going to blow them all into the water or worse goddamn billy was right down there with him working a pump and grumbling that they better get this goddamn fire out soon so he could light a goddamn cigarette you have to love goddamn billy jack thinks as he pulls into laguna this particular day hes remembering that night because he cant help remembering that night anytime he comes to laguna itll happen again jack thinks here or somewhere else he parks in the public lot behind fahrenheit bookstore and walks down pch to vince marlowes gallery the marlowe gallery which jack thinks is a lot better than some cutesy name like ages past or bouantique or something vince marlowe sells furniture antique expensive furniture vince furnishes items to the milliondollar homes with ocean views jacks used him maybe twenty times to evaluate losses in the aftermath of the big fire jack walks into the shop which smells of wood polish place is just jampacked with old wooden cabinets desks tables chairs dressers mirrors vince himself early sixties gray hair a salmoncolored polo over white slacks and sockless pennyloafers sits behind one of the desks punching numbers into an adding machine uhoh he says when he sees jack something burned voice as smooth as old scotch he gestures jack into a seat at the desk do you know nicky vale jack asks know him vince says i named my pool after him the nicky vale memorial swimming hole oh god its not memorial is it his wife pamela vince slumps in his chair pamela you really hadnt heard vince is very wired into the south coast elite ive been out of town vince says as if it needs no explanation like laguna in august please she died in the fire jack says the children they werent there jack says only pamela they were having problems vince says he mimes a glass tilting toward his lips hows nicky doing hes concerned about his furniture jack hands vince a copy of nickys inventory and asks could i buy some of your time to take a look at this tell me if the values are in line vince scans the pages says ill run it in detail but i can tell you right now that theyre about right hell jack i sold nicky half of these pieces so theyre the real thing oh very real vince says nicky knows his stuff sometimes i think he spent more time in this shop than i did not lately though things have been a little flat all over vince says did he try to sell you some pieces some vince says not the better pieces he was too attached but yes he wanted me to buy some of the lesser works did you no consignment vince shakes his head space is money its a business for me people want to sell when the economy is flat but of course then no one is buying you either have all sellers or all buyers depending on the times how are the times now picking up thank you so you could sell them now probably for these values jack asks pointing at the inventory i dont want to harm a customer and a friend vince says are you talking about me or nicky both relax jack says if these prices are roughly in line with what he should have paid for them at the time of purchase well pay those numbers im not interested in playing hardball here then assuming i could sell the pieces the prices would be a little lower vince says call it a market correction did he try to sell the bed noooo vince says i might have bought that piece for myself the bed is ashes a real shame so run these for me vince of course vince says give me a day or two or three whatever you need to do it right can i buy you a cappuccino doesnt anyone drink just coffee anymore jack wonders i have to run he says rain check keep it in your pocket jack gets up and shakes his hand starts to leave and then asks hey vince you remember the night of the fire vince actually shudders who could forget did you think it was going to be the end of the world i dont know about the whole world vince says i think i thought it was going to be the end of our world yeah the end of our world letty del rio has a headache she has a headache for precisely the reason she knew she was going to have a headache shes sitting in uncle nguyens den talking to uncle nguyen from one policeman to another nguyen is saying i know how these things are hes a handsome old dog she thinks full

nguyen will be twanging peoples wires letty del rio is smart enough to know that nguyen was not going to tell her word one the purpose of her visit was to light a firecracker under his smug butt and then watch what happens give him a headache for a change jack pulls into the monarch bay shopping plaza and looks for a drugstore theres only one so its easy and a minute later hes at the pharmacists counter im here jack says to pick up a prescription for pamela vale asks this with a question mark at the end because thats the southern california way of being polite while making a demand sort of an unspoken if its okay with you are you a family member the pharmacist asks shes young and pretty and her shiny red hair looks great against her white lab coat the tag on her chest says her name is kelly im kind of a personal assistant jack says hold on kelly says and she consults the computer monitor behind the counter then she asks which prescription is it sleeping pills valium kelly says but

gives him an empathetic frown then asks has she tried melatonin whats that overthecounter puts you right out and its totally natural cool you should try it kelly says me sure jack shakes his head i sleep like a baby that must be so cute then kelly says i dont want to bum you out but i dont think youre her only personal assistant no kelly leans across the counter the last guy was hunkier than you uhoh but not as goodlooking which doesnt describe nicky vale jack thinks nicky vale is a lot betterlooking than me kelly adds real big shoulders and he wore this dorky hawaiian shirt the kind you get at like every store in catalina he looked like a florist shop with hair had a foreign accent what kind of accent kelly asks do you watch the cartoon network i think its on when i work no its on

bay ignores the guard and does a uturn at the gate comes to a complete stop he checks his watch says go stomps on the gas pedal and leaves a satisfying streak of rubber behind him pulls out on the pch takes a right and heads south toward dana point hits the red light at ritzcarlton drive fuck you ritzcarlton you get your own friggin traffic signal then stomps on it again makes it clear down to where the pch south splits and becomes del prado and turns right on blue lantern takes blue lantern to the top of harbor drive and takes another right and bingo hes at the vale driveway bluffside drive eight minutes fifteen seconds jack sits back and takes a little breather go the reverse route left onto harbor left on blue lantern wait for the light and then left onto the pch a straight shot back to the gate nine minutes flat the guard comes out of the kiosk this time may i help you sir is what he says what he means is what the fuck do you think youre doing maybe jack says hi im jack wade

woman with two little kids think it over huh give me a call derochik puts the card in his pocket jacks about to drive off when the guard says i didnt see him go out okay it was worth a try but i saw him come in whoa what time jack asks about a quarter to five the guard says gotcha call me nicky caught you in a lie incendiary origin motive now opportunity now if i can just buy a little more time jacks waiting in the parking lot of cal fire and life waiting for bill reynolds the executive from underwriting who okayed a million bucks in coverage for the vales personal property to leave for the day jacks waiting in the parking lot because he doesnt want to go to bills office and embarrass the guy or get the gossip going jack doesnt want to hurt bill reynolds he just wants the time to finish his investigation reynolds comes out of the building tall guy has to go sixsix and heavy in fact overweight wearing an underwriters gray suit and carrying a briefcase guys from underwriting take work home jack steps up bill im jack wade from claims bill reynolds reynolds has a what the hell is this look on his face as he peers through his glasses down at jack bill you okayed some personal property coverage for roger hazlitt on the vale risk id have to look in the file jack lays the vale policy on the hood of reynoldss blue lexus come see me in my office reynolds says im not standing out here in the parking lot its degrees you dont want to do this in your office there are channels you dont want me to go through channels jack says youre taking bribes from agents channels is not the way you want to go reynolds looks down at him both literally and figuratively what are you an m he asks citing pay rankings m m reynolds says im an m you dont have the weight to throw around jack nods roger says he slipped you a thousand bucks to okay this coverage which might add to the weight quotient a little bit get away from my vehicle is it true i said get away from my vehicle look typically youd lay some of that risk off wouldnt you jack asks work with the customer to get one or two other carriers to pick up some of the coverage isnt that the way youd normally do it if the risk was too high but you wanted to keep the customer those are underwriting decisions which is why im asking you you dont understand the business educate me reynolds takes off his glasses looks down at jack for a long time before he says i dont have the time to explain to you things that you dont have the education to understand so leave it alone cant whats your name again jack wade large claims thats billy hayess unit you know it is jack says you had your boss on the phone banging at him first thing this morning well jack wade from large claims reynolds says im going to tell you once drop this understand i

down it goes up heat rises so dont drop any more heat on billy hayes because ill send some up your way from m to m the window rolls up reynolds disappears behind blue tinted glass smoked glass jack thinks the parking lots a rough place today jacks walking into the building when he sees sandra hansen heading toward him sandra jack says jack jack knows this conversation can only be trouble because sandra hansen is the socal head of cal fire and lifes siu siu stands for special investigative unit which means its the fraud unit every big insurance carrier has one a unit that specializes in handling potentially fraudulent claims cal fires siu functions as more of an intelligence organization it doesnt bother with the small shit its major job is to track fraud rings the specialized ripoff operations that suck millions of bucks a year in phony claims as a former cop jack would have been a perfect candidate for siu except jack doesnt want to be a cop of any kind anymore even a pseudocop another reason hes not interested is because siu also functions as the companys internal affairs unit you got a claims guy taking kickbacks for recommending a contractor or an auto adjuster splitting overcharges with a body shop or say an underwriter taking money from an agent to write bad book thats sius turf and jack would rather be a dog than a rat were you staking me out sandra jack asks her as a matter of fact i was hansen says jack you have a file were interested in olivia hathaway jack asks hansen doesnt think its funny she gives jack her professional siu hard look and says the vale file surprise surprise jack thinks what about it we want you to back off it whos we siu like im supposed to get all watery in the knees jack thinks fucking siu thinks its the cia and the fbi except it doesnt have to answer to anybody well fuck that why jack asks why does siu want me to back off the file does it matter to me hansens pissed generally speaking she says lay off a file the adjuster lays off it youre walking into something hansen says you dont know where youre walking this is true jack thinks this is really interesting tell me jack says your guys have something here for gods sake tell me sandra i could use the help youre going to trip over so shine me a light jack says seriously show me the way shit thats too big for you to handle jack says maybe i should decide whats too big for me to handle sandra pulls out the big gun dont make me take this file away from you fucking siu they can do that they can walk in and take the handling of a file so why hasnt she already done it jack thinks if she wants the vale file so badly why doesnt she just take it nice big juicy arson file lotsa glory for siu im trying to do this nicely jack sandra says im telling you back off youre saying pay the claim im not saying anything youre working vale already arent you jack says shut up jack you must have a blind file and vales name has dont say another word come up in there somewhere and youre afraid im going to trip over it and blow your investigation siu has no such file come on i never said that hansen says and this conversation never happened officialpronouncementtype voice and youre going to pay the claim sandra says im tired of everyone and his fucking dog telling me to pay this claim jack says agency underwriting now siu whats going on who is this vale guy the king just pay his claim a woman was murdered this is bigger than that jack stands there and stares at her youre crazy he says if you force us totally whacked if you force us to take over this file hansen says i promise you a world of trouble the rest of your short career will be nothing but one long shit shower she can do it too jack thinks all she has to do is get one contractor to say he gave me money and im out on my ass she can do it and she would do it because sandra hansen is a tough cookie standing there in her white business suit with blond hair like a helmet attractive sexy a killer thirtyfive or so and already the head of socal siu her career a bullet and im standing in the way think about it jack she says stay out of my file sandra hansen decides to give it one more try get on the team jack what team you want to be a claims dog the rest of your life sandra asks with your background you could be siu mayhews retiring at the end of the year therell be a slot open you offering me a deal sandra whatever i dont do deals this pisses hansen off youre either with us she says or youre against us jack takes sandra by the shoulders gets right in her face if you want to pay this claim he says im against you he lets her go and walks away thats not where you want to be she yells after him that is not where you want to be jack keeps walking as he flips her off over his shoulder leaving sandra hansen thinking what a big brainless dumb stud jack wade is shes thinking that jacks surfboard has landed on his head once make that twice too often and that shes going to have to take him down three years she has three years and god only knows how much of her budget sunk into a longterm investigation of russian organized crime and shes not going to let one stubborn m of an adjuster flush it down the toilet dead woman or no dead woman she feels bad about that it makes her sick that vale gets away with murdering his wife but thats the way it is pamela nickys biggest break from mother russia a break with the old code but nickys inaugurated the new code and the brothers are marrying now but not california girls russian women women of the same culture and language usually with family ties in the mob these are wives who understand the way things work who help bind their husbands to the mob and the code whose families back home in russia can be used as hostages if hubby suddenly develops a desire to transgress against the mob not american wives not california girls who dont know the code who ask questions who make demands who cant keep their mouths shut who get unhappy and when they get unhappy get divorces marry a russian girl dani tells him when he sees pamela on his arm two three four dates in a row i want children nicky argues have russian children dani advises he whips open a catalog of russian wouldbe brides eager to immigrate pick one out any one and shes yours there are some real beauties here and there are nicky agrees stunning russian women but thats the point he doesnt want a russian woman he wants an american woman he doesnt want to strengthen the bond he wants to break it and they dont get it mother does she sees exactly whats happening it is a slap in the face she says no it isnt you are a russian im an american nicky vale the turnaround in one generation but to make that a reality he needs to regenerate to have children american children besides which he has to have her shes driving him insane he knows she dresses to provoke him shows him the tops of her white breasts her long thighs wears perfumes that make him hard the second she walks into the room kisses him with full warm lips and swipes her tongue across his in a way that makes him feel that tongue on his cock and then she breaks away and smiles at him to let him know that she knows exactly what hes thinking and laughs at him or shell press against him press her breasts into his arm or his back or worse no better no worse press her pussy against the front of his pants and say oh baby i wish we could we can hell say no shell say frowning then a little whimper her lips in a frustrated pout its against my beliefs then she rolls against him sighs pouts and steps away sometimes even touches herself over her dress and looks at him with sad eyes and he knows what shes doing knows that she is a cockteaser extraordinaire knows this but cant help himself maybe because she represents to him everything that is so close but just out of reach america california a new life a turnaround inside one generation and he can see her as the mother of his american children she is beautiful free happy in that careless california way that just doesnt carry the long tragic burden that russians bear and if his children come from her in his mind they come somehow cleansed of all that history and besides he has to have her then have her as a mistress mother says if you absolutely must have the little tease then set her up in an apartment give her money give her presents screw yourself silly until youre tired of her then give her more money and say goodbye but dont marry her if you marry her mother says she will take your heart your money and your children because this is america and in america the father has no rights she will ruin you shes a gold digger marry this piece of trash she says and she will leave you in the rubbish in her place which of course cuts it nicky gives pam a ring that night they marry two months later on their honeymoon on the lawn of the private villa on maui she sheds her flowered dress for him invites him inside her where she is hot sweet honey liquid gold nicky remembers her neck the smell of vanilla in the nape of her neck as he stood behind her and put his lips and his tongue against the sweetsmelling white skin below her ear below her black hair how she moved against him so he ran his hand down the scooped neck of her dress and felt her breast felt the flimsy bra give way and then he rolled her nipple between his thumb and finger and she didnt object so he slid the dress down over her breasts then held them in his hands and slid his thumbs back and forth across the nipples and how she brought her hand around to stop him he thought at first but she just held her palm to the back of his head so he took one hand and ran it down her stomach and down and she was wet he remembers the sound she made mmmhmmm a sound of unashamed pleasure and he rubbed her with a finger and she sank back into him its funny what you remember he thinks again because what he remembers most is the smell of her neck and the flowered dress what it looked like as he pushed it over her breasts and down around her hips and how it looked lying rumpled at her feet as she stepped out of it and laid down on top of it and held her arms up to invite him to come into her strange he thinks but that moment was america to him was california to him that openarmed openlegged invitation to unabashed pleasure the sound of california to him is and always will be mmmhmmm and he remembers her wide purple eyes when later she wrapped her legs around him and pushed him deeper in and held him there as she climaxed and then he did and then he laid his face into her neck and how she said kiss my neck and i cant stop you why didnt you tell me this much much earlier because then i couldnt have stopped you then she scratched his back with the diamond of the engagement ring hed given her mmmhmmm for quite a while theyre happy in their california life the money rolls in as they ride the top of the real estate boom she becomes a south coast housewife mornings in the gym lunch with the ladies afternoons harassing the interior decorators who come to make the house a showpiece or getting her hair her face her nails done at this salon or that usually with the same ladies with whom shed lunched parties in the evening lovely friends beautiful people she becomes pregnant quickly as he sensed she would her body a lush field of spring wildflowers natalie is born with daddy in the delivery room doing that american thing coaching his wifes breathing but little coaching is needed pamela was serenely pregnant cheerful relaxed happy the birth is as easy as births can be i am a russian peasant woman she jokes the next baby ill just drop in a wheat field you are hardly a peasant nicky says she reminds him that she grew up on a farm knock me up again she tells him hes delighted to michaels birth is also easy pamela nicky thinks is made to be a mother she is inseparable from the children he has to cajole her to get a sitter and go out even once a week he feigns annoyance but secretly it pleases him that his american wife is a homebody content to be with her children to take them on long walks play with them in the backyard gym that he has constructed she paints when they take naps in the little studio he has built for her beside their bedroom she stands by the easel and looks out the window and paints watercolor seascapes her paintings are not very good but shes happy and it leaves him free to fuck around he has a wife now he starts collecting mistresses he still finds pamela attractive but now that she is a mother she has lost a certain erotic edge he seeks it elsewhere finds it everywhere pam is all curves and bosom and hips he goes for sharp edgy women at the tennis club takes them to the laguna hills resort or the ritz for sweaty postmatch sex pamela is sweetness and goodnight moon he picks up hard cocktail waitresses and gives them coke and fucks them sometimes on top of the car hood parked at dana strand beach he takes an especially perverse delight in seducing her friends not that the seduction is generally a difficult matter thank you so while pamela is committing her mild offenses against art in the sunny room while the children sleep he is in one of her friends bedrooms in one of her friends in point of fact and they seem to delight in asking does pam do this for you does pam do this for you and then doing this and this and that and the other thing and then one of pams friends decides to have the ultimate thrill and tell her all about it he arrives home that evening and all is well until she puts the kids to bed and then she walks up to where hes sitting and slaps him across the face and that would be for he asks leslie she says if you ever do it again ill divorce you and take the children he grabs her by the wrist forces her to her knees on the floor and patiently explains that there have been are and will be a lot of leslies and leslie again if he has a stirring in that direction and that she will most definitely not divorce him here is the deal he says you have the house the children and all the money and luxuries you could want all this comes with your position as my wife enjoy it be happy listen to me there will never be a divorce you will never take my children you will be their mother and my wife and my lover and i will have other women as i wish how about me she asks angrily do i get to have other men which is the first time he hits her a ringing slap across the face then he tells her to go up to the bedroom change into something sexy and be in bed when he gets there he sits and looks at a furniture catalog for a while and then goes up shes on the bed as he told her in a blue corset as he told her looking almost defiantly sexual stunningly beautiful truly black hair shining on her white shoulders her neck long and inviting her breasts pushed up and glowing white in the soft light her black pubic hair naked for him as if she could take him back with pure sexual power like have your other women youll never have anything like this and that beautiful face with those violet eyes shining with anger and fear and defiance he lifts her up and flips her over places her hands on the headboard and then takes her in the way he saw convicts take the scared young zeks in prison does pam do this for you pam does what i tell her pam starts drinking shortly after that and things fall apart they thought the boom would last forever in the land of sunshine and blue water where only good things happen to beautiful people but the real estate market slows then comes to a halt and nicky is leveraged to his eyeballs nothing is selling nothing is even renting nobody is investing and the creditors want their cash which nicky doesnt have hes

for a few minutes all the while his own wife is drinking like a fish taking pills and causing scenes at parties how many people here have fucked my husband a show of hands please they get into fights he knocks her around his kids start looking at him like hes some sort of monster he hits them once or twice dont you ever open your mouth to me he spends more and more nights away from home none of this escapes the attention of tratchev rubinsky and schaller you listen closely at night you can hear the wolves circling pam goes to rehab and comes back a raving bitch sober and the first time nicky lays a mitt on her she goes to the authorities and lays a tro on him gets his name in the court system i have stolen millions of dollars in this country nicky thinks i have robbed and killed and stolen millions and this is the first time my name appears in court and my wife does that to me my own wife not for long pam files for divorce i told you i would kill you nicky says i mean it i dont care pam says i cant live this way if you leave you leave the way you came with nothing but some cheap dress on your ass i dont think so pam says ill take the children and the house and half of everything ill even take your precious furniture nicky it could happen nicky thinks in this godforsaken country where a man has no rights theyll give the drunken bitch the kids theyll give her the house theyll launch a fishing expedition through my finances that could prove not only costly but dangerous it would endanger the plan a plan of such simple elegance such balanced design such perfect symmetry that it only confirms in him his own sense of genius crime as artful construction a plan that if it works will achieve his goal of the turnaround in one generation and pamela could stop it take his dream and his identity with it in a particularly cruel argument one night she snaps my son will not be a gangster no he will not nicky thinks in despair he goes to mother goes into her room in the small hours of the morning sits on her bed and says mother i could lose we could lose everything you have to do something daziatnik what you know daziatnik she says she takes his face into her hands you know what you have to do yes i know nicky thinks as he lies back i know what i have to do take back control of my organization protect my family hes at home taking a walk on the lawn when it hits him hes looking down at dana strands hes thinking about great sunsets and the idea comes to him the perfect symmetry of it the beautiful balance perfectly structured poetry like the finest furniture everything all in a master stroke he watches the sun set over dana strands more likely than not is the phrase thats running through jacks head as he sits in his cubicle more likely than not more likely than not is the phrase that applies to the standard of proof in civil cases in criminal cases the standard of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt and the distinction is important to jacks consideration of the vale file if i deny the claim jack thinks we will far more likely than not get sued at the end of the trial the judge will instruct the jury as to the burden of proof and hell tell the jury that the critical question is is it more likely than not that mr vale either set the fire or caused the fire to be set thats the way the law reads in reality its far more complicated the civil burden of proof is more likely than not so technically if its even percent to percent that your guy did it the jury should come back and find for the insurance company thats the way its supposed to work but jack knows thats not the way it does work how it does work is that the jury is perfectly aware that arson is a crime no matter what the judge instructs them they are not going to apply the civil standard more likely than not as the burden of proof theyre going to apply the criminal standard beyond a reasonable doubt so jack knows that if youre going to deny a claim based on arson you had better be damn sure that you can persuade a jury that your insured set the fire or caused it to be set beyond a reasonable doubt so jack asks himself is it more likely than not that vale set the fire or caused it to be set yes it is more likely than not beyond a reasonable doubt jack takes out a piece of legal paper and a ruler and draws two straight lines down the paper creating three columns at the top of the columns he writes incendiary origin motive opportunity nickys up to his ears in debt hes about to lose the house he has a balloon payment coming up and no apparent resources to pay it he owes money to the feds and to the state his companies are in trouble too he sells his beloved boat at a loss to try to get some cash he has a bundle sunk into antique furniture and according to vince marlowe he cant sell the furniture he wants to sell but he doesnt even try to sell the pieces hes attached to his wife is about to divorce him and that would split his meager resources at least in half motive jack thinks is a dead solid lock so motive is a win opportunity is a push incendiary origin is a comer unless accidentally bentley hangs in with his ciginthevodka theory jack draws a dotted line down the center of each column then alternates plus and minus signs so that each category of proof is divided into pros and cons when he finishes the chart it looks like this incendiary origin motive opportunity accelerant bentley mortgage doors locked alibi pour pattern cigvodka balloon windows locked points of origin fuel load taxes distance to house low income dog outside alligator char annealed bed divorce reconcile seen at am lied in statement hole in roof pebbled glass red flame contents jack thinks about the chart for a few minutes then draws a horizontal line across the bottom subtitles the new section murder and starts again incendiary origin motive opportunity all above plus no smoke in lungs carboxyhemoglobin pugilistic cigvodka alcohol co location of body all above plus hatred all above alibi no witness okay jack tells himself take the arson first start with incendiary origin what are your three strongest points the rule of three billy says always try to present your evidence in sets of three its the way juries like to hear it its always a minister a priest and a rabbi in the rowboat so what are my three strongest points well the positive char samples make bullshit of bentleys cigaretteinthevodka hypothesis so that would be number one number two the pour pattern theres no way to reconcile that with an accidental fire number three multiple points of origin again inconsistent with an accidental fire now what are the points against the counterargument is that certain contents in the room might have burned hot leaving an erroneous implication of multiple points of origin and bentleys point about the fuel load is correct as far as it goes there was a lot of stuff in the bedroom and its possible that the heavy fuel load burn could explain away the other indicators of an accelerated fire it could provide reasonable doubt anyway but not with the positive samples with a positive sample jack thinks everything falls together motive deadsolid lock the three strongest points the balloon payment the lack of income the missed payments its an embarrassment of riches no reverse pun intended and therell be no problem proving that nicky had a motive to torch the house the arguments against there really arent any opportunity three strongest points locked doors and windows with no sign of forced entry leo the pooch outside and derochiks statement having nicky coming in at and now nicky has lied you have him on tape saying he never went out that the phone call woke him up and i guess that just fucks you arguments against no witness to put nicky on or near the actual fire scene no snitch to connect him directly to the fire two mother russias alibi but derochiks statement is going to shoot that down so opportunity a tougher call but when you put it together with incendiary origin and motive it plays move down to the murder because its all connected a jury will never believe the coincidence of a murder with an accidental fire conversely theyll never buy an accidental death with an intentional fire we have a combo plate here jack thinks strongest points that pamela vale was murdered one she was dead in time proximity to an arson two her bloodstream showed alcohol and barbiturates but witnesses will say that she wasnt drinking and someone else probably an associate of her husbands picked up her valium prescription arguments against primarily theres the mes conclusion of death by overdose second is bentleys call of co asphyxiation accelerated by acute inebriation the alcohol reduces the amount of oxygen in the lungs making co poisoning rapid and deadly its possible jack thinks if she was drinking and if there was no accelerant and if jack thinks you hadnt looked into nickys eyes and just known that he killed his wife and if the arrogant bastard hadnt lied on tape jack goes in to see goddamn billy viktor tratchev is one tres pissed gangster valeshin wanted to be a real estate developer tratchev says to his head enforcer an obelisk of a human specimen known simply as bear so hes a real estate developer fine what does he think that he can just stroll in when he feels like it and be the boss again bear shrugs bear may not know the term rhetorical question but he knows one when he hears one tratchevs working himself up what does he think tratchev asks that im going to lie down and just take this shit im supposed to lie down on my belly and let him fuck me this is pretty much exactly what hes supposed to do actually according to dani and lev who drop by tratchevs house that afternoon for a glass of tea and some browbeating youve been shorting the pakhan on his share dani explains by about percent danis thinking bullshit tratchev says not bullshit dani insists what do you think youre playing with children here dani holds up a hand to stop him dont add insult to injury keep your lies inside your mouth listen viktor between you and me ill admit that things have gotten pretty loose so you take advantage all right you take advantage human nature maybe the fault then is on both sides but im here to tell you today viktor tratchev that the free and easy days are over the pakhan is the pakhan again from now on until trust is restored we will take the payments and give you your proper share you will run a tighter operation that doesnt end up on the evening news and viktor tratchev if you cause any more problems i will personally cut off your head and piss into your gasping mouth thank you for the tea they get up and leave and tratchev is about to throw a rod ill kill him he says dani bear asks him too tratchev said who he has in mind is nicky he starts working the phones tom caseys in with billy let me get this straight jack casey says you want to deny a fire claim because a poodle had to take a piss a yorkie jack says because a yorkie had to take a piss casey turns back from the window and smiles at him with beatific menace are you fucking with me jack he asks i wouldnt fuck with you tom this is definitely true because not only are jack wade and tom casey good friends but tom casey is the meanest man in california this isnt just jacks opinion its an official title casey won by unanimous vote at a california defense bar association meeting after he gave a now infamous lecture on the fine art of crossexamination caseys lecture was a joke literally and it went something like this this accountant goes to prison for embezzlement casey tells the audience and the second he gets to his cell his cell mate an enormous weanlooking guy says now here in this prison we like to play house which would you rather be the husband or the wife the accountant who is terrified doesnt want to be either of course but when he considers the various options he decides hed rather be the husband so he manages to croak the husband ill be the husband okay husband the cell mate says now get over here and suck your wifes dick after the subsequent horrified gasp and burst of laughter casey tells the crowd and that joke tells you everything you need to know about crossexamination to wit when you get to the ultimate question it shouldnt matter whether the witness says yes or no after which casey is officially named the meanest man in california goddamn it jack goddamn billy hayes says hes irritable because casey has insisted that they meet in the airconditioned office and theres no smoking in there whatever the fuck kind of dog casey says jack gazes on caseys sartorial splendor today hes wearing a pearl gray halbert amp halbert db with a twotoned white shirt and red silk tie caseys famous for his clothes especially his ties the joke around the office is that you can actually take a tour of his walkin closet at home and that the bus stops for lunch at the shirt section before setting out for the shrine that is the tie rack he lifts his hands in his trademark shrug and asks jack the same question he often asks rhetorically of juries i mean am i missing something here youre missing a lot jack says enlighten me casey says then he sits down and crosses his legs his eyes widen in mock innocence please teach me like make your case convince me and maybe you can convince a jury dont convince me and ill advise goddamn billy to pay the claim jack knows the drill he takes out the chart he made and lays it on billys desk bentleys whole overdose theory relies on pamela vale smoking in bed and drinking jack says i have eight witnesses who will swear that she was sober at least as of pm that gives her half the night she didnt keep booze in the house she bought not anywhere in dana point go ahead casey says the same witnesses will testify that pam was terrified that night jack says that she told them nicky was going to kill her hearsay you can get it in casey smiles maybe youll get it in even if i do casey says so what pamela vale was afraid and alone sadly she fell off the wagon and went back to the one solace she had the bottle she drank herself into unconsciousness the cigarette slipped from her hand she died of co asphyxiation or overdose before the flames hit her a tragic accident but before she passed out jack says she poured kerosene from the closet across the floor over the bed and under the bed he hands casey dineshs report the formal report will be here in a day or so jack says dinesh faxed me the charts you sandbagged me jack casey says kerosene jack says volume two to five gallons casey says bentleys fucked motive jack lays it out for him its enough for me billy says not so fast cisco casey says you have incendiary origin you have motive but opportunity you have nothing to put your insured on the scene theres nothing that indicates anyone else had access to the scene jack says a boyfriend casey asks a lover vale says they were going to reconcile she tells the boyfriend sorry charlie it was beautiful but now its over the boyfriend is forgive me inflamed with rage decides ill show you over bitch strangles her and lights her up perfect revenge on her and the husband so this phantom lover kills her sets up the fire gets a key and locks the doors on his way out jack asks why besides which theres no indication anywhere of any phantom boyfriend and then theres leo the poodle the yorkie jack says nicky waits until the kids are asleep until everything is dead on the streets then he leaves mother russias and drives to the bluffside drive house he lets himself in the dog doesnt bark because its daddy of course daddy has a can of kerosene with him but what does a dog know what time is it now casey asks jack shrugs three threethirty okay go on nicky goes into the bedroom jack says maybe he has a gun maybe he has a knife but he forces her to drink maybe he rapes her i dont know but he smothers her on the bed then he takes the kerosene and pours a big pool in the closet trails it across the room and pours a bigger pool under the bed and over her body why casey asks if shes already dead rage jack says he pours it from her waist down go ahead but he just cant barbecue the pooch just wont torch little leo so he puts leo outside and shuts the door were talking about now he goes back inside and lights the match timing device billy asks im guessing he uses a cigarette tucked into a book of matches that gives him five to ten minutes before the flame touches off the kerosene its a nineminute drive back to monarch bay the guard sees him come back in around one minute after meissner sees the fire casey says and the same time mother sees him checking on his kids jack says convenient will the guard testify casey asks when you subpoena him jack says proving that he could do it casey says isnt the same as proving that he did do it he lied on tape jack says short of pamela vale coming back to testify this is the strongest case we could have casey says i agree the issue is is it strong enough the three of them stand there and look at jacks chart after a few minutes goddamn billy says jack deny the claim tom i think youre taking a big risk he cites bentleys report and the coroners conclusion if vale sues casey says youll have to bring two public officials to the stand and make them eat their own reports juries dont like that jack says if we give ng the rest of this evidence hell be happy to modify his report as for bentley fuck him casey says jack shrugs i still dont know casey says what about you billy jack asks where are you on this billy is suddenly fuck it on the no smoking rule he draws a camel from the pack jams it between his lips lights it takes a long draw then exhales saying its your call jack yeah yup then we deny the life claim and the fire claim jack says void the policies and sue to get the advance back write the denial letter goddamn billy says inform the insured of our decision oh yeah jack thinks ill inform him sandra hansen knocks on the door of room at the ritzcarlton waits while the fbi agent inside checks her out the door slides open she steps in and the door closes quickly behind her the agents name is young and shes known him for three years theyve been on the same antifraudring task force with the two others

anymore get out jimenez says well let you know when and where our next rendezvous is you bring records well bring recording equipment itll be fun hansen says she takes howards arm and helps him out of the chair walks him to the door and says thank you for coming she sits back down and young says hell do that doctors a corpse banner says tough shit sandra hansen says in an operation of this magnitude you have to expect some casualties dingdong nicky comes to the door hes holding a glass of champagne grieving jack asks him to each his own i know youre anxious about the resolution of your claim jack says so as part of california fire and lifes continuing commitment to excellent service i thought id come personally to inform you of what precisely jack can see mother russia standing a few feet behind nicky youll be getting a certified letter tomorrow jack says informing you that were denying both the life insurance and the fire claim on the grounds that youve violated the terms of the policies by intentional acts to wit we believe theres sufficient evidence to indicate that you were involved in the death of your wife and in the fire at your home jack watches nickys eyes go narrow and hard youre making a very serious mistake nicky says yeah well ive made them before and you didnt learn i guess not cool nicky shrugs and sips his champagne jack looks over his shoulder and asks arent you going to ask me in for tea the door shuts in his face i guess thats a nyet jack says he feels better than hes felt in twelve years like a long nights finally ending the sun comes up like its been waiting all night to burn somebody jacks out on the water watching the dawn when the sun hits his face its personal like good morning wake up dream time is over right behind the sun is the wind blowing wild as a miles davis break jack knows its going to be a hot day in southern california doesnt take long three hours later paul gordons standing in tom caseys conference room pointing down at jack shouting and red in the face jack thinks that paul gordon is maybe going to be the firstever witnessed event of selfcombustion which would be okay theres not a claims dog in california who wouldnt like to see paul gordon go up in a ball of flame paul gordon ignites your basic claims guy is going to spring up and write a letter to the fire department to get over there right away they used to say that paul gordon sits at the right hand of god then the lawyer hit fidelity mutual insurance for million in punitive damages on a bad faith suit now they say that god sits at the right hand of paul gordon gordon has the looks for it too tall silver hair iceblue eyes craggy features hes standing by the window in caseys office hes got newport beach harbor as a dramatic backdrop and hes telling jack tom and goddamn billy that hes going to take cal fire and life down for the biggest punitive damages award in the entire history of bad faith litigation mans gonna break his own record make the fidelity mutual verdict look like a church bingo pot is part of what hes screaming what he did what he did gordons saying pointing at jack he told my client one day after his wifes funeral that he thought my client killed his wife and burned the house down around her then he came to my clients home to hand deliver a denial letter did you do that jack asks goddamn billy yup why billy instantly regrets asking this because jack turns to nicky whos sitting there with this little smile on his face and says because he killed his wife and then burned the house down around her see see gordon yells hes doing it again jack keep your mouth shut please casey says hes sitting in his chair sipping coffee and acting like theyre all just hanging out discussing the dodgers chances of winning the division heres a story about tom casey casey goes to a settlement conference with goddamn billy and he has draft authority for in his pocket plaintiffs attorney comes in and asks for five grand casey stands up slams his fist on the table and yells what do i look like santa claus the plaintiff settles for two thousand so even though casey has paul gordon the biggest baddest plaintiffs attorney in southern california in his office yelling about armageddon casey is not exactly pissing his pants this is because casey is the biggest baddest defense attorney in the southern bear flag republic what you got here if youre a connoisseur of multimilliondollar bad faith litigation is you have the heavyweight championship of the world gordon v casey you could make a mint from the payperview rights just selling to attorneys whod watch it in the hopes that theyll actually kill each other funny thing is theyre in the same office complex both casey and gordon have their offices in the black boxes a marvel of modern architecture black glass and hubris that sits astride the newport beach greenway theyre called the black boxes because thats exactly what they look like except the bottom right corner of each building is cut away so they look like black boxes that are about to topple over which is where the marvel of modern architecture bit comes in casey calls them the there isnt going to be any fucking earthquake buildings because one good temblor and you got to believe that these babies are coming down precariously balanced as they appear to be so you got casey in one and gordon in the other both on the twelfth floors and they actually face each other if they have their curtains open they could exchange friendly morning waves which is just about as likely as oj and fred goldman sitting down over a fondue anyway casey says jacks conduct was inappropriate no dispute paul gordon nods with some satisfaction but he knows a punch is coming in here somewhere casey throws it but paul do you think that if a jury concludes that your client is an arsonist and a murderer its going to give a rats ass about some dumb thing jack did the jury wont conclude anything of the kind tom maybe not tom says shrugging but just to add a jalapeno to the chili i will tell you right now if you push this to a trial i will make sure that its monitored by the federal prosecutors office to consider potential criminal charges against your client casey turns to smile at nicky and explains arson can be considered a federal crime at the discretion of the us attorney nicky shrugs an exact imitation of caseys patented shrug like you can stick your us attorney up your ass and waddle nicky says you have no evidence mr vale to use a technical term casey says i have evidence up the wazoo lays it all out for him incendiary origin motive and opportunity especially opportunity because he has him in a lie on his whereabouts that night the guard has you coming in at casey says so ohsocool call me nicky so youre hosed jack says seeing if he can you know set paul gordon off he does gordon goes totally off it takes casey a good ten minutes to get him to sit down what casey does is he sends an intern racing to the trendy little coffee shop downstairs to fetch a cappuccino grande with lowfat milk and a dash of nutmeg decaf casey stresses to the intern its well known among the greater legal community of southern california that gordon has a serious cappuccino jones that in fact he keeps an associate whose entire job consists of making sure that the attorney has two of them on the table before any meeting begins so gordons sitting in caseys office huffing and puffing face all red little droplets of sweat bubbling on his forehead its beautiful and casey gets a clue as to how hell take gordon in the courtroom if it comes to that whip him into a froth and let the jury see it the decaf cap arrives gordon takes a long soothing sip and then says to nicky go ahead jacks like go ahead and what go ahead and jump out the window it isnt what nicky has in mind nicky just lays his cool look on jack and says as to one of my employees picking up pamelas prescription thats ridiculous as to this alleged statement by the gate guard i dont know with whom you talked or whether you talked to anyone all i can tell you is that i was home with my children and my mother that entire evening and morning just as i told you on the recorded statement gordon lays a document on the table this is the signed and notarized affidavit from mr michael derochik the guard who was on duty the night of the fire in which he affirms that he did not see mr vale leave or enter the gate after that evening jack starts getting this feeling that nickys not going out the window its opportunity that just went out the window nicky continues as to my finances i advised mr wade that because i am in an international business there is great flux in the liquidity of my assets the tide as it were ebbs and flows if mr wade would bother to check my accounts today he will see that i have the money to meet both my personal and commercial responsibilities as for losing my home my mortgage payments are current and i have ample funds to meet the upcoming payment on my home motive is on the ledge but i still have incendiary origin jack thinks long as this is an arson fire everything else follows and i still have io for about five seconds your samples that showed traces of accelerants gordon asks deputy bentley took samples and sent them to the state crime lab and the samples came up negative oh theres traces of a little class o combustible which is probably the turpentine youd expect from pine flooring but kerosene now i dont know where mr wade got his socalled samples but it wasnt from the vale house i can tell you that so there it is jack thinks that if he looks out the window to the ground hell see the smashed remains of incendiary origin motive and opportunity lying on the sidewalk im filing suit today gordon adds breach of contract failure to reasonably investigate and bad faith if youd like to settle come with million in your pocket or dont come fifty goddamn million gordon smiles and nods over and above what you owe on the policies thats just goddamn extortion is all that is like a church bingo pot paul gordon tells casey youll have your witnesses well have ours theyre standing out by the elevator when gordon says oh just to add a jalapeno to the chili as to this story about dr ng trying to contact my client and being rebuffed by an attorney we have a signed statement from dr ng denying that anything of the sort ever happened so i dont know where mr wade got his information but you can bet that well sure as hell ask him under oath but seeing as how mr wade is a convicted perjurer with a history of planting evidence well mr wade you be thinking now about which youd rather be the husband or the wife gordon starts to get into the elevator but does a dramatic aboutface instead oh i almost forgot he says mr wade is sleeping with ms del rio who stands to gain insurance benefits if theyre denied to my client we have investigators photographs of them leaving his condominium together rather early in the morning which smacks of collusion to me we also know how to make prosecutors aware of testimony in a civil trial fifty million to settle gordon says over and above of course the claim itself the offer is good for fortyeight hours gentlemen give you some time to get the money together gordon steps into the elevator has to push the hold button though because nicky vale stops and puts his arm around jacks shoulders whispers into jacks ear you should have learned the last time which is when jack realizes hes been set up big time is what jacks thinking as he races back to the vale house hoping hes not too late the setup nicky vale wasnt happy just to collect on the claim nicky wanted the big bucks the winning ticket to the california litigation lottery so he put out just enough bait to lure you into denying the claim and then snap the hook and reeled you right in you are very stupid jack wade he is too late they bulldozed it jack pulls up to the house he can see that the west wing is down the only thing standing there in its place is accidentally bentley with a uniformed deputy thought you might show up jack bentley says when did this happen this morning bentley says i advised mr vale that the burned portion of the house represented a safety hazard and that he needed to take care of it you wouldnt want a liability claim would you jack so the evidence is gone jack thinks the holes in the flooring the splash patterns on the joists he says i have two sets of photos and videotape you asshole yeah you have samples too bentley says get out of here jack youre trespassing whered you get your samples from the house bentley says before you came how much is nicky paying you get out jack before i arrest you no whats your cut jack asks how much pension do you get off the dead woman walk away now jack you set me up brian you set yourself up bentley says you always do i tried to tell you dont dick around with this thing you just couldnt help yourself could you this isnt over believe me jack its over jack gets back in the stang and drives over to monarch bay pulls up to the gate may i help you sir wheres derochik guy who usually works this shift yeah jack says do you know where he is no do you the guard asks he just calls up says he isnt working anymore puts us all in a jam do you know where he lives where i could get hold of him you find out you let me know jack knows hell try to find out but he also knows that hes not going to find mike derochik derochik is probably in another state already jack drives over to the monarch bay shopping plaza to the drugstore he already knows what hes going to find or what hes not going to find which is kelly theres another chemist behind the counter is kelly here jack asks the woman smiles at him another broken heart no kelly quit very suddenly do you know where she went where i could get hold of her yes and no the woman says yes i know where she went no i dont know how you could get hold of her jacks not in the mood for games whats that supposed to mean sorry the woman says its just that ive had my fill of kellys if you were smart so would you kelly flew off to europe last night met a great guy whos going to give her the world so unless you can give her the world i think youre out of luck kellywise i dont think luck has anything to do with it jack thinks they knew every move every move i made he drives over to pacific coast mortgage and finance hes not even out of the car when gary comes bopping out hey nicky came through gary says paid the balloon early is that right yeah dude we were worried for nothing yeah dude like very fresh surf on jack finds ng at home a nice tract house on a culdesac in laguna niguel the house newly painted a pale blue basketball hoop bolted to the garage at the end of the driveway the medical examiner comes to the door in a tshirt and pajama pants i was sleeping jack he says can i come in why not jack follows him into the house ng leads him into a small room that must be the doctors study antique wooden desk walls lined with bookshelves more full of books than knickknacks ng sits at the desk chair and motions for jack to sit down in a big leather chair by the window anyone else home jack asks wifes at work ng says kids are at school what do you want you know what i want ng nods he reaches under the green blotter on the desk pulls out a small stack of polaroid pictures and hands them to jack two asian kids walking out of a playground a boy and a girl each in their little soccer uniforms you dont need an identakid packet to know that theyre ngs children jack hands the pictures back he killed his wife he says probably and hes going to get away with it probably and hes going to make million doing it jack stands up and says okay ng nods back in his car jack knows that road is closed knows that the blood and tissue samples are already parked at a hazardous waste disposal somewhere it isnt just money because if money wants to intimidate a coroner money sues the coroner or calls his boss or otherwise leans on him money doesnt threaten to hurt his kids no thats a gangster thing jack goes back to cal fire and life does the whole computer and phone run again and its the same story nickys accounts are solid credit card payments up to date money in the business accounts and i am one dumb claims dog jack thinks nicky set me up left evidence out there waited for me to deny the claim and then jerked the evidence set me and california fire and life up for a gigantic bad faith suit and he knew every move i was going to make jack pushes in the door marked no admittance he blows right past the sign that says authorized personnel only and one of the siu guys lays a hand on jacks shoulder to stop him jack brushes him aside and shoves open the door to sandra hansens office shes sitting behind her desk jack leans over it you been reading my file sandra most of the siu guys are excops and this one a slab of meat named cooper asks her you want me to take him out of here sandra jack doesnt turn around as he says yeah why dont you take me out of here its all right sandra says she gestures for cooper to leave and shuts the door behind him she says i told you that we were going to monitor this file you didnt tell me that you were going to tip vale off to every move i was going to make youre paranoid jack yeah jack thinks im paranoid fucking a im paranoid he says vale knew every move i made then youd better get some new moves he wants million now you should have settled it before she goes back to shuffling papers hes mobbed up isnt he jack asks what makes you say that jack says he intimidated three witnesses and did a magic act with his money he set me up and you guys helped him and i want to know why you had your chance to play hansen says too late now jack slams his hand on her desk im not playing thats my point jack sighs okay what do you want i dont want anything now hansen says you cant give me anything now before i wanted you to back off you wouldnt now theyre going to make you back off so you have nothing to trade give me what you got on him sandra jack says im dying hansen shrugs says we didnt give vale any information and we dont have any information on vale to give you he killed his wife thats what you say and burned the house down thats your version hansen says another version is that youve got an ancient hardon for the sister and that she sold you a bill of goods along with the chucha and you are going to back off now jack youre going to lie down like a good dog and die you gonna make me sandra thats right she pulls some papers from her drawer and lays them on the desk a sworn statement from a restoration contractor claiming that he paid you to recommend him to policyholders heres another from a homeowner admitting that he gave you a kickback to look the other way on an overcharge the da will give them both immunity its up to you jack i can stick them back in my desk or i can send them up to mahogany row why dont you stick them in your ass and then take them up to mahogany row same old jack she says you know what theyre going to put on your tombstone jack he never learned so how much is nicky paying you sandra as usual youre a hundred and eighty degrees wrong i hope its enough to retire on jack says because ill never quit on this quitting is the last of your worries sandra says is there anything else i can help you with jack or can you just haul your dumb ass out of here now jack hauls his dumb ass out of there pauses just long enough to exchange a bad look with cooper then heads back to his cubicle now knowing two things for sure one nicky vale is mobbed up two sandra hansens on the take one more thing jack thinks unless i take a dive on the vale file im finished at california fire and life which is pretty much what casey is telling goddamn billy hes got him on the horn and hes saying it might have been nice if someone over these past twelve years had told their old friend tom about a perjury conviction jack wades a good man jack wade is a good man casey says which makes it all the more of a shame that hes going to get fucked jack walks into the office and billy flips the phone to speaker so jack gets to hear casey say if gordon wins on the vale case and he will win on the vale case then hell tie that tail to cal fire and life and use it on the next case and the next and the next hell dig up every claim jack ever denied every arson every fraud and hell find a judge wholl let him bring them to trial except now he not only has jacks testimony to use forever he also has the example of the vale trial hell tell the next jury that cal fire and life has already been hit for x million and that didnt change their ways so youd better hit them for xplus and so on and so on the tail just keeps getting longer until the company either buys all the cases or goes out of business and it wont be just paul gordon either every shark in town will smell the blood and swarm in for the feeding frenzy every plaintiffs attorney in california we ever beat in court will be coming in asking for a retrial claiming that theres at least a chance that cal fire lied and cheated in their case ill file a truckload of motions to stop it but some judge in the peoples republic of santa monica will think its his ticket to the supremes and seeing how the ninth circuit is basically made up of politburo members anyway well get hammered on the appeal and jack will be everyones favorite witness hell get called to recite a litany of his sins in every bad faith trial for the next ten years theyll run him right out of the state i bet hell leave california hell get so tired of being subpoenaed of course if they move a case into federal court hes screwed nationwide you along with him because theyll put you on the stand right behind him to confess how you knowingly hired a corrupt cop fifty million is a cheap price to stop the bleeding and save jacks ass i dont want my ass saved jack says well i want your ass saved jack casey says there is no point dying in a battle you cant win we can win it jack says youre going to beat paul gordon on the stand casey asks with no evidence and your baggage come on give me some time to get the evidence jack says we dont have the time casey says mahogany rows already banging on me to settle they have rate hearings coming up they dont want a highprofile bad faith case especially one they cant win they want to settle they cant settle without me goddamn it company rules the regional director of claims in this case billy hayes has the last word on a claim this is to save the corporate mucks from being subpoenaed to testify in every bad faith case the director makes the call he takes the fall only this director aint going down easy theyll take you out if they have to casey says theyre blowing smoke billy says where theres smoke they know about jacks checkered past i havent told them casey says i was hoping id get your agreement to just lay the green poultice on this then nobody has to know all wounds billy has said can be healed with the green poultice i dont want it to go away jack says you dont have the choice jack casey says i do goddamn billy says and we aint paying this cocksucker a dime let me offer ten casey says theyll have a hard time walking away from ten not a goddamn dime billy why because he did it and we know he did it you think you can persuade a jury of that casey asks yes jack says walking right into it because casey answers you got yourself a deal well do a focus group tonight rentajudge jury the whole nine yards you testify jack and ill crossexamine you when did you schedule this tom billy asks this morning casey says the deal i made with mahogany row trying to save your asses its winner take all you win we dont settle you can investigate all the way up to the trial you lose we start settlement negotiations first thing in the morning its the best deal i could get guys a terrific deal jack thinks death death by focus group were dead translated from russian this is basically what dani is telling nicky theyre taking a walk out on the lawn of mothers house as far from the house as they can get because the scene in the house is driving nicky crazy its the kids its the dog its mother actually its an unholy troika of the kids the dog and mother because the kids love the dog and mother doesnt the kids want the dog in the house and mother doesnt the dog wants to jump up on the couch and mother has a stroke the dog wants to sleep with the kids and the kids want to sleep with the dog but mother wants the dog to sleep outside which is the same as mother saying she wants the dog dead which she does and last night nicky experienced the sheer absurdity of making leo sleep in a doghouse outside and then posting an armed guard by the doghouse so the kids would stop crying and so that little michael wouldnt as threatened sleep in the doghouse with his rubber knife to protect leo from the coyotes next nicky thinks ill be stringing barbed wire around the living room sofa and mother will not get off little michaels back natalie she ignores completely looks right through the girl as if she were a ghost but michael she suffocates with attention most of it negative poor little michael cannot do anything right all day its michael use the napkin not your sleeve michael its time to do your scales michael a little gentleman walks with his head up a broken record nicky thinks an oldie but goodie as the american djs would say driving the boy crazy driving me crazy so its good to get away from that scene take a walk on the lawn even if it is to hear that you are more likely than not dead tratchev is demanding a meeting dani says for tonight tonight they dont want us to have time to get ready dani says but theyll be ready yes tell him no then were at war so were at war dani shakes his head given our present strength compared to his we cant win the war nicky can hear the unspoken rebuke in danis voice and its deserved in my obsession to be a california businessman i let things deteriorate to a point where now we are in mortal danger very uncool so we meet nicky says dani shakes his head again at this meeting he says theyll kill you tratchev is selling it to the others and its an easy sale nicky vale is taking my business hell take yours next unless we stop him and soon tratchev will accuse you of looting the obochek dani says a serious violation of vorovskoy zakon and this meeting wont be like the last theyll be ready nicky takes a moment to inhale the scent of bougainvillea the luminescent color of the fuchsia the bright blue of the ocean and sky beautiful all i ever wanted was this he says i know dani says ill go to the meeting nicky says alone you cant why should we all die pakhan nicky puts up his hand enough i will do what has to be done i will deal with tratchev and all the rest dani says theres something else wonderful the sister what about her nicky asks shes been asking about the two vietnamese what nicky asks how do you know this shes been making a noise in little saigon dani says putting real heat on how did she make that connection you think youre safe you think youve used all your skill and cunning to steer through the rapids and the shoals and then this cunt of a sister well do what we have to do nicky says shes a cop i know that an honest cop i know that too its too much for a coincidence dani says two sisters goddamn it will you do as i say i know its a risk its all a risk but i didnt kill my beautiful pamela and make my children motherless just to lose everything anyway we will do what we have to do however regrettable and we will do it soon and the day after tomorrow we will have our share of million more than enough to start again from ashes come new shoots of grass life from death the ritual sacrifice of jack wade starts with peanut m ampms jack stands in the observation room behind the oneway mirror gobbling peanut m ampms and watching the jury file in jacks been in a couple of dozen focus group facilities and it seems like whatever else they have or dont have they always have bowls of peanut m ampms for nervous chomping they always serve dinner too except jacks too edgy to enjoy the lasagna bubbling in the heater trays the meals at these things are usually pretty good but tonight its really good in addition to the lasagna theres roast basil chicken fettuccine alfredo a caesar salad and profiteroles for dessert also real plates real silverware and linen napkins the quality of the meal is a good newsbad news joke the good news is that its a highquality meal the bad news is that the reason its a highquality meal is because the mucketymucks from mahogany row are there casey ordered the menu casey knows that the mucks tend to take their meals very seriously so its prudent to at least feed them well especially when the bills going to be million not counting the tip jack watches them eat half of freaking mahogany row bellied up to the trough twelve years with the company and jacks never seen these guys in the flesh before just on a few motivational closedcircuit tv presentations the boys can eat so there they are vp claims vp legal and vp public relations goddamn billy runs it down for him phil herlihy vp claims billy says pointing to a sixtyish guy with a shock of white hair and a paunch came out of agency of course doesnt know a claim from a blow job hes an administrator billy gestures at a tall thin guy in his fifties dane reinhardt vp legal couldnt buy a verdict in a goddamn courtroom so now hes telling us what to do jerry bourne vp public relations billy says pointing to a short fortyish guy with curly red hair and a red nose basically in charge of arranging hookers for the visiting firemen and hiding the bills in his expenses hes a fucking idiot but at least he knows it sos reinhardt except he doesnt know it all he knows is its a lot safer to settle claims than to take one to trial and lose last thing that noballs socalled lawyer wants to see is another courtroom herlihys the one to watch out for he swings the big stick in the presidents office herlihy looks over at them billy he says arent you going to eat im watching my figure herlihy looks at jack are you this jack wade ive heard so much about today guilty herlihy says you claims cowboys from socal like hes so disgusted he cant even finish jack figures it doesnt require a real answer so all he says is yippiyiyokyay and walks away which doesnt score him a lot of points with phil herlihy vp claims from the start of this thing the observation room itself is shaped like a slice of a lecture hall a bunch of desks bolted onto the floor slanted down toward the observation window the dining table is off to the left on the five feet of flat floor by the window and the door on top of the room a videographer is getting his camera ready to record the whole mess for the boys at corporate who couldnt make the live show at the bottom a table runs the width of the window seated at the table are two jury consultants with laptop computers and stacks of questionnaires what the two jury consultants also have is a monitor thats hooked up to each of twelve procon machines on the desk of each juror the procon machines are simple little devices that measure how the juror is feeling generally pro or vaguely con at any given moment its basically a joystick attached to a base and the juror is supposed to keep his or her hand on it at all times the jurors feeling con about something he pushes the joystick down a little con a little down a lot con a lot down same with the pro feelings a little pro the juror pulls a little back on the joystick a lot pro she can whip that puppy all the way back its basically a hightech version of the old roman thumbsupthumbsdown gladiator deal what it does is it allows you to instantly measure the jurys ongoing instinctive reaction on a scale from negative to neutral to positive to any witness question or answer theyre carefully instructed that they dont need a reason for their reaction they should just react if theyre feeling bad they should push the stick down if theyre feeling happy they should push it up jack knows this is only for the gut reaction that theyll get the rational response from the questionnaires and the actual decision from a verdict but he also knows that the jury will rationalize its gut reaction onto the questionnaire and then onto the verdict doesnt matter what a lawyer or a judge says any jury will decide a case on its gut reaction so the procon machine is an important little fucker in this proceeding everyone in the observation room is going to have their eyes on the procon monitor not inside the actual courtroom inside the actual focus group room on the other side of the window the jurors are seated in a mock jury box with individual little tables for their procon joysticks theres a witness stand tables for the plaintiff and defense and a judges bench where the rentajudge for the focus group will sit the two jury consultants a yuppie guy and a yuppie gal and the moderator a slightly older male yuppie are all from tsi trial science inc and this is what they do for a living theyre all a little frantic at the moment because this is a rush job theyve spent the afternoon assembling a demographically correct focus group that would be an accurate sampling of a potential orange county jury age gender race education profession have gone into the mix plus they had to figure in the attorneys preference how do you want this one to come out the older yuppie had asked casey because the attorney is the one they have to keep happy so they need to know if the attorney wants a real focus group or a dogandpony a lot of times the attorney is trying to use the focus group to persuade a client to settle or to go to trial and because the tsi people already know the demographics that tend to be prodefense or proplaintiff they can slant their recruiting the lawyers way they can also slant the questionnaires and the live discussion and while they cant guarantee an outcome they can take a lawyer a long way down his or her chosen path hence the question how do you want this one to come out accurately casey answered one because hes not about to set up a potemkin village for old friends like billy hayes and jack wade and two he already knows how this ones going to come out anyway hes going to kick their ass which is what jack thinks too when he sees the rentajudge walk in and take the bench dude is wearing black robes just like this is the real thing dude also looks very familiar were dead jack mutters to goddamn billy because the rentajudge is none other than retired justice dennis mallon from the atlas warehouse trial mallon bangs on a gavel which gets the expected chuckle from the group and he asks them to finish filling out their prestimulus questionnaires and then he tells them that theyre going to hear about a lawsuit involving a fire youll hear a brief statement from the plaintiff then one from the defense then youll be asked to fill out a questionnaire based on what youve heard then youre going to hear testimony from a witness for the defense who will be examined and then crossexamined after which youll fill out yes another questionnaire and then youll discuss the case just as you would if you were on a real jury then ill ask you to render a verdict for the defense or for the plaintiff and if for the plaintiff how much you would award i encourage you to take notes just please be aware that your notes will be collected at the end of the evening during all of this please manipulate your little procon joysticks so the people in the observation room know how youre feeling which gets another appreciative chuckle from the jury can you believe jack whispers to goddamn billy that with all the law all the science everything we do on a file that a multimilliondollar decision is going to be made by twelve people who show up for fifty bucks each and all the cookies they can eat i can believe anything billy says sorry you got dragged into this jack says you didnt drag me billy says i walked casey gets up from the plaintiffs table looks at the jury for a few moments and says this is a story about how a gigantic insurance company lets call it great western insurance cheated a policyholder how it lied cheated bullied and oppressed a man who had lost his wife and his home jack looks up at the monitor negative how casey says great western insurance took his premium money for years assuring him that in his time of need they would be there for him and then when that time came when tragedy struck instead of being there for him accused him of fraud arson and murder and denied him the millions of dollars in benefits that he is due this is a story about how a big corporation thinks that its above the law because even though the authorities declared that the fire was accidental and the coroner said the death was accidental and even though the police have not even investigated let alone charged let alone convicted my client of arson or murder great western insurance accused him of burning his house down and murdering his wife and convicted him of the crimes of arson and murder without even the benefit of a hearing let alone a public trial negative s across the board and this is a story about a man an individual my client well call him mr white who came as an immigrant to this country with only an old suitcase and the clothes on his back who through hard work and application and diligence lived the american dream became a millionaire and fulfilled his dream a dream that is now shattered by a sudden accident and the deliberate malicious and oppressive actions of a greedy powerful corporation that would rather slander a good man and destroy his life than pay what it owes my clients only hope to restore whats left of his life is you his wife is gone his children bereaved his house lies in ashes you cannot bring back his wife you cannot comfort his small children but you can restore to him his home and property and punish the large and callous corporation that perhaps even more than the fire has destroyed my clients life you can rebuild a home for him and his children to live in you can send a message to the boardroom of great western insurance that they must never ever engage in this kind of despicable behavior again my client rests his fate in your hands i know that you will see the truth for what it is and act on that truth thank you positive s and s the jury jack sees is happy jack hears herlihy mutter im glad that son of a bitch is on our side its the standard paul gordon opening reinhardt says just fill in the blanks shit emily peters one of caseys partners gets up to respond go emily jack whispers its not easy following that kind of speech she says that was a great speech a real tearjerker a real appeal to your emotions but ladies and gentlemen a lawsuit should not be decided by emotions it should be decided by the law and by the facts and the law says that if a person burns down his own property the insurance company cannot by law cannot pay that claim and when you listen to the two witnesses that i will bring on ladies and gentlemen i am confident that you will recognize that sadly those are the facts maybe yes maybe no jack sees the monitor is hovering around a lot of neutrals a few s and s on either side of the line the jury doesnt like emily as much as they do tom she goes on anyway mr white as were calling him is rather like the man who murders his parents and then asks for mercy because hes an orphan not a laugh or a murmur or a chuckle from the jury uhoh jack thinks theyre pissed at us already yup negative s and s because that is the sad fact of this case now my esteemed colleague mr casey has told you correctly that the authorities ruled the fire an accident and the death an accident that is true what he didnt tell you is that those findings are not binding upon an insurance company great western doesnt think itself above the law the law states that an insurance company has the right indeed the obligation to independently investigate a claim and render its own decision and the law further states that the insurance company may deny a claim if it reasonably concludes that it was more likely than not that an insured set fire to his own property that is the law more likely than not and when you hear our witnesses and carefully consider the facts that they present i am confident that you will also conclude that it is far more likely than not that mr white is an arsonist and a murderer and that far from awarding the millions of dollars that he is asking for you will be asking why isnt this man in prison why isnt he the defendant in this trial now mr casey asked you to send a message so do i send a message that you are not going to be swayed by cheap dramatics you are not going to be swayed by emotion that you are instead going to consider the facts and send the message that far from being rewarded mr white should be charged convicted and punished thank you as the jury starts filling out their questionnaires jack hears reinhardt say she came out too strong i liked it herlihy says it was strong jack thinks but thats what she had to do you come out halfassed in an arson trial all you do is get your halfass totally kicked jack sees the tsi consultants typing like mad typing and waiting like vultures for the responses to the opening statements to come in jack knows that the responses are key if casey wins the opening its going to be damn hard to convince the jury otherwise the tsi people would say that percent of jurors have their minds made up after the opening statements its also going to be damn hard to convince mahogany row not to settle the jury finishes writing and one of the consultants rushes in to get their papers peters says calling to the stand mr smith which is me jack thinks now jacks in an interesting position here if he goes in there and does a good job and wins sandra hansen drops the hammer on him if he goes in there and does a bad job and loses then he gets to keep his job but nicky vale gets away with arson and murder sort of your basic dilemma he walks in a negative he cant see that of course but jack can look into the jurys eyes and know they already dont like him its one thing to look at a jury even a focus group panel from behind a oneway mirror its a whole different deal jack thinks to be eyeball to eyeball with them them staring at you like youre some sort of zoo animal a bad animal anyway he does his best to do what peters advised him make eye contact speak a little slow and a little loud and answer the questions directly be calm be cool be confident right jack thinks even as he sits down he can feel the sweat starting to bead on his forehead and mallon staring at him like ive seen you before a long time ago judge in a galaxy far far away peters starts him off with his background his education his experience level then asks and how many fire claims would you say youve handled for great western i would estimate hundreds as many as a thousand thats possible and of that thousand she asks how many were eventually denied for arson very few can you give me a number a handful nine ten its rare isnt it objection leading sustained could you give us an idea peters asks of the frequency of arson denials its rare a low chuckle from the jury is it difficult to prove arson by an insured it can be why arson is a crime that consumes its own evidence jack says its also a crime in which the perpetrator tends to leave the scene before the event for obvious reasons jack feels himself flush because he used the word crime not once but twice a supposed nono in civil arson litigation but then he thinks fuck it i cant play for a tie here well peters says how do you prove arson by an insured as i understand the law jack says you need three elements incendiary origin motive and opportunity she takes him through the meaning of the tripartite proof then asks him did you conclude that the white fire was of incendiary origin yes i did what led you to that conclusion a number of things could you tell the jury what they were oh yeah jack thinks i sure could i could also take a dive because this is the moment to do it this would be the place to fumble mumble get my shit out of order just generally look like a dooms do the old twoandahalf triple gainer with a twist and land headfirst in a pool with no water crack jack says it would be easier to explain using a chart and some photos i brought he gets up and walks over to a tripod stand flips the cover over to reveal a big blowup of his incendiary originmotiveopportunity chart and runs it no mumbling no fumbling shit totally together jack runs the jury through the tripartite proof runs down all the evidence the kerosenesoaked samples the holes in the floor the hole in the roof above the bed the pour pattern he matches each item with a blownup photograph and he talks to the jurors as if theyre in the house with him when he took the pictures peters lets him go you got a thoroughbred you give it its head you let it run and jack is running like freaking secretariat his procon numbers shoot up into the positive range jack is amped he starts in on motive runs the column tells them how he concluded that whites motives were both personal and financial walks the jurors through the whites marital problems their public fights her drinking and rehab the restraining order the separation and the upcoming divorce then he takes them through whites finances the balloon payment on the house the tax debts the flat real estate investments the tappedout bank account the delinquent credit card bills the expensive furniture collection the threat of alimony and child support the threat of losing half of his meager assets to his wife the jury is tripping on jack theyre pulling back on their joysticks like theyre triggering a cocaine drip there are s and s lighting up on the old monitor like jack is some sort of eightyfivepound adolescent girl on the uneven parallel bars did all this lead you to reach any conclusions peters asks yes jack says that he was about to lose his home his business and his furniture you seem to think the furniture is important why is that it represented a very considerable investment jack says also it was one of the first things mr white asked me about the day of the fire the day of the fire yes mr white called you about his claim the same day his wife was killed peters asks looking at the jury an incredulous little tremor in her voice yes jack says matteroffactly better to let the jury get indignant so the fact that he was about to lose all these things peters says still shaking her head a little did that mean anything to you yes it meant to me that he had sufficient motive to set the fire and murder his wife casey launches up objection jack says its hard to reach the conclusion that the fire was intentional and the death accidental there is also forensic evidence to indicate that she was dead before the fire broke out which is probably beyond the scope of this inquiry tonight mallon quickly tells the jury suffice to say that a coroner has ruled that mrs white died as the result of an overdose of drugs and alcohol and thank you very much your honor jack thinks mallon gives jack a dirty glance because pam vales death was supposed to be outofbounds jack gives him an innocent look but hes thinking fuck you casey brought it up in his opening and hes not playing by the rides so im not playing by the rules in fact mr casey told the jury we accused his client of murder jack says we didnt were not the police but i thought the jury should know why we denied the life insurance claim youre out of order mr smith mallon says sorry jack looks over at casey who is working albeit none too hard to suppress a smile the jury is grooving on this little spat winging happy numbers back to the observation room mallon says ms peters if you would continue your direct gladly peters says lets talk about opportunity she says this giving jack a look like get back on the leash claims dog he does and she leads him through his testimony on whether white had the opportunity to set the fire jack takes the jurors through the points on the locked doors and windows the burglar alarm not going off the time it would have taken white to drive from his mothers house set the fire and drive back then peters asks did you talk to whites mother about his whereabouts that night yes what did she tell you that her son was home watching a movie that night and that she saw him at her house during the time the fire was being set did you believe her no why not the guard at the gate told me he saw mr white come back in at am jack says to a little ahhhh from the jury and the combined weight of all the other evidence argued against her alibi jack says she had a vested interest in protecting both her son and her own home which mr white had mortgaged to raise capital to cover other debts any other points on opportunity the dog the dog she looks at him with feigned puzzlement the jurors dont their puzzlement is genuine jack looks at them and explains the whole thing about the dog he finishes with i came to the conclusion that mr white let the dog out before setting the fire peters cant help herself he loved his dog more than his wife objection sustained did you consider whether there was anyone else who had the opportunity to set this fire peters asks no facts came to light to indicate that there was anyone else jack answers did you reach a conclusion as to the issue of opportunity yes what was your conclusion that mr white had sufficient opportunity to have either set the fire or known that the fire was going to be set earlier you testified about there being three elements necessary to deny a claim based on arson peters says do you recall that testimony he does and she knows he does she wants the jury to recall it before she goes on i do jack says did you reach a conclusion whether those three elements were sufficiently proved so that you could reasonably deny mr whites claim i did and what was your conclusion jack says based on the totality of the facts we learned i concluded that there was sufficient evidence to deny the claim beyond a reasonable doubt i dont know if i could describe it in those words jack says let me just say that id have to be damn sure and were you damn sure that mr white was involved in this fire jack looks at the jury says damn sure no further questions thank you goddamn billy breaks into applause turns back to the corporate mucks and points to the monitor solid s across the board jack wade had killed paul gordon is making his case in front of judge john bickford actually hes not so much making his case as he is leaving his case the case in question being a halliburton attach with twenty k in cash inside see theyre seated at this banquette at the rusty pelican in newport beach and gordon has the case underneath the table by his leg and he and bickford are discussing an element of the law ill be filing suit against cal fire and life gordons telling him youre going to get the case if it comes up in my rotation bickford says it will come up in your rotation gordon says the assigning judge having been on three fishing trips down on the mexican coast on gordons boat fishing trips dodgers tickets a legal seminar in italy compliments of gordons firm the case will get assigned where its supposed to get assigned gordon says tom caseys going to come whining to you about a discovery issue involving a claims adjusters prior record hell ask you to exclude all discovery prior to the adjusters handling of the file in suit and and id like you to consider denying that motion bickford sips his scotch hes sixtyfive years old retirement looms and judges do not make the kind of money say plaintiffs attorneys do mrs bickford has skin cancer bickford asks are you writing me a brief its in the case how many pages twenty bickford sets his glass down thats not very long standard gordon says but this is a big case for you paul bickford says i would think youd want to write more nail down every point twentys always been good enough in the past gordon says like dont jerk me around at this stage of the game i own you you old bastard the past bickford says is a fleeting dream an insubstantial thing like twenty large of my money is now insubstantial gordon asks himself you know gordon says you might be right maybe another judge will catch this case bickford sighs its one thing to acknowledge yourself a whore to acknowledge yourself a cheap whore is yet another level of selfabasement and yet the money is needed twenty pages should be adequate to make a persuasive argument bickford says thank you for your consideration gordon says he finishes his drink and gets up he doesnt have the case with him when he walks out judge john bickford orders another scotch sits for a long time and watches the boats bob against their slips in the harbor he remembers when he believed in the law youre a good claims investigator arent you mr smith tom caseys first question in his crossexamination of jack a question known in the crossexam business as an entry question which just like an entry wound can be small and even painless and its the smart move jack thinks which is just what youd expect from casey its smart not to attack me right away because the jury likes me right now and casey doesnt want to antagonize them by attacking me too soon so hell lay back and set the trap i hope im a good claims adjuster jack says crossexam witness rule number one try to answer in complete sentences not just yes or no rule number two use your own language not the lawyers casey taught him this stuff over the years that the lawyers real purpose in a crossexam is for the lawyer to testify and just get the witness to nod and shake his head like one of those bobblehead dogs in the rear window of a car crossexam casey has lectured is a dig me game the lawyer wants to strut his stuff in front of the jury he wants to show how smart he is how right he is dig me now casey asks and part of adjusting claims is investigating the claim right yes jack says we need to find out what happened what is damaged or lost and how much it will cost to repair and replace and the reason you need to find out what happened casey says is so that you can determine if you are even going to honor the claim in the first place isnt that right thats one of the reasons so do you consider yourself a good investigator knowing that jack is going to answer more or less yes if he answers no hes screwed if he answers yes hes another step closer to the ambush but theres no choice given the question yes i think i do a good job and part of doing a good job is performing a thorough investigation right they both know the game here caseys trying to get jack to set a standard for himself a bar that hell have to jump over down the line casey wants to set it as high as possible so jack answers we need to find the facts that will let us make a reasonable decision you need to carefully examine all the facts around a loss and make a decision based on your analysis right we need to examine all the relevant facts jack says so finding and examining all the relevant facts is what makes a good claims investigation yes so it stands to reason doesnt it i mean youd agree with me that if you didnt consider all the relevant facts youd have a bad claims investigation wouldnt you jack says id want to consider all the relevant facts and did you do a good job on this investigation mr smith theres no playing around with that question jack thinks its an ultimate question a barn burner you say anything but yes the case is over yes i did you considered all the relevant facts before you made the decision to deny my clients claim jack can feel the bullet going in but there isnt a damn thing he can do about it i believe so he says okay casey says did you know at the time you made the decision that the sheriffs fire inspector had taken debris samples from the house no so you didnt consider that fact did you the inspector told me on the first visit to the house that he had already established a cause and origin he said nothing about taking samples so i presumed that he hadnt done that casey pauses feigns considering the response then asks was that a no no i didnt consider that i wasnt aware at that time that he had taken samples so you couldnt have considered it could you no are debris samples relevant casey asks knowing that jack has no choice but to say yes because his side of the case put on an expert witness to testify about them and jack has already said that they were significant yes okay casey says he turns to face the jury as he asks then you couldnt have been aware at the time you made the decision to deny my clients claim that the debris samples taken by the sheriffs fire inspector tested negative for traces of accelerants isnt that right i was not shown those results did you ask for them no isnt that something that would have been important for you to know casey asks would that have been relevant son of a bitch is taking my own word and beating me over the head with it why the hell did i say relevant then again what the hell else could i have said i would have preferred that the inspector share them with me yes jack says but he didnt we werent made aware of them until after the suit was filed so you didnt consider that fact casey asks is that your answer i didnt consider those tests or the results or the results casey takes a marker from his pocket and crosses out the positive debris sample item on the chart looks at the jury looks back at jack now he says we heard you give a lot of testimony on mr whites financial woes yup here it is on your chart the mortgage the balloon payment the credit card bills at the time you made your decision were you aware that mr white had paid off the entire balloon payment at the time i made the decision he hadnt so you didnt consider that did you no would that have been relevant for you to know its something i would have considered casey crosses out the balloon payment item on the chart did you know that hes current with his credit card bills no cross off that hes current with the mortgage on his mothers home no cross off and the jurys getting unhappy jack can see them pushing the joysticks down in the observation room reinhardt looks over at goddamn billy and asks what the hell kind of claims investigations are you guys doing down here casey asks that he has over million in liquid assets in his various accounts come on jack thinks fight back again he says these were all things we learned only after the suit was filed so thats a no isnt it these were things yes or no that we learned mallon says please just answer yes or no mr smith no casey crosses the item off how about the tax liens casey asks did you know that he paid those off no the divorce casey says which hadnt happened yet did you consider the possibility of a reconciliation no would it have been relevant to your investigation if indeed the whites were trying to reconcile they werent trying to reconcile thats not what i asked you mr smith casey snaps he can get tougher with jack now because he senses the jury is turning i asked you whether that information would have been relevant i would have considered it but you didnt ask did you i had information indicating that you didnt ask did you just answer the question mr smith mallon says no i did not ask casey crosses off the alimony and divorce items the whole motive column is crossed out opportunity casey says youve testified that in your opinion mr white was the only person who had the exclusive opportunity to set this fire did you look for anyone else there was no information to point to anyone else thats a no yes thats a no did mrs white have a boyfriend i had no information to suggest that she had so you didnt consider that did you no wouldnt it have been important to you to know that casey asks wouldnt that have been a relevant fact the possibility that someone else was in the house in the bedroom with mrs white the night of the fire the night of her death because mr white never mentioned it i had casey sighs once again mr smith that is not the question i asked you the question i asked you was whether such information might have been relevant to your thorough fair investigation i asked mrs whites sister whether it was possible that the deceased was having an affair her sister casey says and what did she tell you she said that mrs white had no boyfriend mrs whites sister casey asks wasnt she the next beneficiary on the life insurance policy yes if mr white were found responsible for his wifes death her sister stood to gain isnt that right that would be correct did you ever ask her where she was the night of the fire yes i did and what did she tell you that she was at home about forty miles away and did she offer anyone who could corroborate her alibi no she was alone but you believed her right jack says i had no reason to disbelieve her right casey says by the way did you ask her these questions when she spent the night at your condo audible gasp from the jury audible moan in the observation room procon numbers plunge into the negatives vp claims looks at goddamn billy like he wants to kill him peters jumps to her feet objection lacks i withdraw that question casey says then he asks isnt it true that the sister spent the night with you on my couch yes on your couch casey repeats did you ask anyone else friends neighbors whether mrs white was having an affair no you never asked mr white and he didnt volunteer isnt that correct yes so you didnt even consider that possibility did you mr smith yes i did i considered it very improbable right casey says because mr white had all that motive casey pauses for a second to let it sink in with the jury then he says now youve told us that the security guard at the gate of the complex where mr white was living saw him come in at a quarter to five correct yes he told you that yes but you also saw a sworn affidavit from the guard mr derochik affirming that he did not see mr white come in at or any other time isnt that right the jurors get busy with the joysticks jack says mr white presented that statement only after we had denied the claim oh casey says but we only have your word as to what the guard told you isnt that right thats right and you disregarded mr derochiks sworn statement didnt you i didnt consider it truthful i see he crosses out the items under opportunity then he goes for the exit question and just like with a bullet its the exit wound that sprays the blood and flesh and bits of vital organs all over the wall so casey says you didnt find out about the clean samples you didnt find out about the mortgage being paid off you didnt find out about the credit cards being uptodate you didnt find out about the bank balance being in excess of million you didnt find out about a reconciliation you didnt find out about the lover and you never considered the sister as a potential suspect having failed to consider any of these highly relevant facts do you still think that you did a good job on this investigation and just like the entry question he doesnt care if jack answers yes or no it doesnt matter because either way jack looks bad yes i do jack says except he doesnt look so bad casey knows it he can tell without seeing the monitor with its spikes he can see it just by looking at the jury they dont know what to think they havent made up their minds casey knows hes fought to a stalemate which just wont do so he has to play a card he really doesnt want to play lettys at home when the phone rings she picks it up its a teenagers voice i want to talk with you he says slight asian accent its tony ky the wiseass from the chop shop what about letty asks shes knows what its about but she has to play the game theres a hesitation then the kid whispers tranh and do so letty thinks i guess uncle nguyen is feeling the heat come into the station she says just to set a bargaining position the kid almost laughs no someplace isolated letty asks with this edge in her voice thats like go to class yeah isolated you have a ride yeah i have a ride she tells him about a turnoff on the ortega a picnic spot and hiking trail into the cleveland national forest park your ride under the trees walk up the trail a ways be there at seven she says in the morning yeah learn how to get up she says she hangs up brushes her teeth brushes her hair does all the creamandlotion jazz and gets into bed with a book and an intent to turn the light out soon hard to get to sleep a lot on her mind pam pams murder natalie and michael and son of a bitch jack wade twelve years letty thinks youd think that you could take what happened twelve years ago and put it away but you cant have you ever lied under oath casey plays the card takes a drink of water and the next words out of his mouth are mr smith have you ever lied under oath its the old husband joke it doesnt matter whether jack answers yes or no either way hes screwed casey didnt want to do it hed hoped that jack would have just laid down on direct exam and let his case fade away should have gone down for the count but came out swinging instead so now casey has to go for the knockout punch and he hates doing it especially when he sees jack flush jack can feel himself turning red my goddamn shame he thinks blazing red under my skin the jurors see it they lean forward to get a better look jack can feel their eyes burning into him peters jumps to her feet objection your honor relevance goes to the witnesss credibility your honor prejudicial your honor peters says more heat than light mallon looks at the lawyers then down at jack overruled he said you may proceed casey asks again mr smith have you ever lied under oath get it over with jack thinks take the hit yes he says and leaves it at that he and casey look at each other for a minute casey giving him this look like if you had only stayed on the mat but that was in connection with an arson trial wasnt it casey asks thats right casey asks you lied about how you obtained a confession didnt you yes you swore under oath casey says that you hadnt coerced the confession when you had isnt that right yes in fact you beat a confession out of a suspect didnt you yes then told the court that you hadnt yes and that was a lie that was a lie you told other lies didnt you casey asks thinking sorry jack but believe it or not im trying to save your ass and your job you told other lies right yes you lied about evidence isnt that right yes you said that you found evidence at the fire scene correct yes but you hadnt found it at the scene had you no how did the evidence get to that fire scene casey asks jack says i planted it there jurors shake their heads hands pressing down on the joysticks casey starts to kick the ball downhill short questions rapid fire all while he looks at the jury his back to the witness you planted it there casey says thats correct you went out and got a gasoline can yes and you forced the suspect to place his fingerprints on the can yes and you took the can to the scene yes and photographed it there yes and then swore that you had found it there during your initial inspection isnt that right thats what happened casey says you planted phony evidence because you thought the suspect was guilty you were damn sure but you needed physical evidence to confirm that the fire was of incendiary origin isnt that right yes keeping up the pace he turns to face jack now you testified earlier that you took debris samples from my clients home casey says and that these samples tested positive for accelerants is that right yes the fire inspector deputy bentley found clean samples isnt that right casey asks thats what he says he was at the scene first yes before you jack says he was there when i arrived the alleged dirty samples only showed up after you got there isnt that right casey asks i took the samples from the house and the holes in the floor casey says the fire inspector didnt see those did he he didnt do a digout theres no mention of them in his report is there no they only appear after you show up isnt that true casey asks they show up after i did the digout jack says it would have been pretty easy to punch out those holes self wouldnt it i didnt do that pretty easy to pour a little accelerant into the joists and light a match thats ridiculous counselor pretty easy to bring your own contaminated samples to the scene and photograph them there that didnt happen you swear yes just like you swore before right casey says objection sustained same oath wasnt it mr smith knock it off mr casey mallon says casey nods and takes a drink of water makes a little show of getting his righteous indignation under control then he ups the ante to show the corporate mucks behind the mirror that they cant just dump jack and walk away from this thing he ties a tail onto management you were convicted of perjury isnt that right he asks i pled guilty to several counts of perjury and you were thrown out of the sheriffs department casey says for perjuring yourself beating up a suspect and planting phony evidence isnt that right mr smith thats correct and shortly after that casey says california fire and life hired you right casey looks right into the mirror to make sure the boys in the back get the point they do theyre looking at a monitor thats negative all the way yes jack says did they know about your record the man who hired me was aware of my record in fact casey says he sat through the trial in which you perjured yourself right i believe so he knew you were a liar casey says yes a brutal cop yes that you would plant phony evidence to nail an alleged arsonist he was at the trial and he hired you anyway yes and he hired you specifically to handle large fire losses for california fire and life isnt that right that was one of his reasons does this gentleman still work for california fire and life casey asks looking to the jury several of whom are shaking their heads he does in what capacity hes the head of claims jury goes nuts pushing the hammer down on those joysticks shaking their heads one guy says out loud unreal and hes your boss now right casey asks yes did he supervise your investigation of my clients claim yes have you in any way been punished for what you did in this investigation casey asks no suspended no criticized no casey looks back into the mirror as he asks so this is the way california fire and life wants you to handle its claim right strike that question no further questions thank you you may step down mr smith casey says im sorry one further question mr smith if you had to handle my clients claim all over again would you do anything differently its the standard crossexam wrapup question another trap where you dont care what the guy answers if he answers that he wouldnt do anything differently you get to tell the jury that this arrogant bozo would do the same bad things again if he had the chance if he says that he would do something different you get to tell the jury that by the witnesss own account he screwed up jack knows its over can see it in the jurors eyes theyre looking at him like hes a criminal theyre shocked and pissed off and theyre going to award poor tragedystricken mr white at least million and he knows whats going on in the back room the corporate boys are pissing all over themselves hopping up and down on one foot theyre so eager to lay the green poultice on this gaping wound and give nicky vale million so he says yes i would do something different what would you do jack turns to the jury to make eye contact id kill the son of a bitch then he gets up and walks out casey comes into the observation room grabs himself a plate of lasagna and says for my next trick like hes made wade disappear hes made their case disappear now hes going to make million of the companys money disappear and theyd fire the smartass wise guy right now except that he is the smartest lawyer in socal and they need him so that the board doesnt make them disappear the veeps look at him like fuck you casey but casey doesnt care let em be pissed what are they going to do fire him they have that collective were the bigdick guys from corporate cowboy so watch yourself if you want to stay on the ranch look in their collective eye so casey gives them his favorite john wayne line from the old stagecoach movie you may need me and this winchester curly he drawls i saw some ranches burning last night phil herlihy turns his wrath on goddamn billy whos sitting there sucking on a cig like there arent ten we thank you for not smoking signs in the room to which goddamn billys standard response is well now they dont have to thank me anyway herlihy turns to billy and just about screams how the hell could you hire that guy what the hell were you thinking about i was thinking billy says that hed be a damn good claims dog and he has been one of the best casey says the best herlihy pretends he doesnt hear casey any sane person who watched the crossexam wouldnt want to get in a debate with casey fire him herlihy says to billy tomorrow tonight if you can get hold of him i aint firing him billy says i just told you to i heard you the trial science inc geek walks in the geek is like white and his hands are shaking the verdict forms in his hand rattle like ghosts in the attic yes casey says hes still smiling tomato sauce looks like blood on his lips the ts seek says two hundred million what herlihy yells theyd award million in compensatory and punitives the geek says actually we had to push them to give a dollar figure what they really wanted to do was put the companys management in jail one of them wanted to hang you settle it herlihy says concur says reinhardt absolutely says bourne settle this file now herlihy says whats the demand fifty million casey says if the real jury goes the way this one does thats a savings of million not counting court costs and of course my exorbitant fees and these days juries are usually hip enough to figure the plaintiffs attorneys cut into their judgment we lose goddamn billy says we appeal on what grounds reinhardt snaps admissibility casey says you argue that wades background is irrelevant and prejudicial motions in limine sure casey says id try to keep jacks background out before the trial but i doubt id win we could also instruct him to not answer any questions about his background in deposition but that would start a discovery battle no discovery battles reinhardt says discovery battles have a way of getting out of hand subpoenas for documents tend to get broader and broader and if a judge got annoyed and let gordon go on a fishing expedition well that just cant happen this file is over herlihy says he says to casey start settlement negotiations tomorrow see if you can work this down but you have million settlement authority hold on billy says thats not your call to make you need executive authority for anything over a million vp claims says if i want it billy says i aint said i want a dime yet were going to settle this case that is my call to make goddamn it then make it reinhardt says i aint ready to make that call billy says ill make it reinhardt says i have the authority to settle a lawsuit against the company yeah you do billy says but there aint no lawsuit yet theres just a threat of a suit so its still in claims and im claims i can put an end to that herlihy says well goddamn it why dont you just do that dont think i wont go ahead i dont give a fuck you boys want to take this outside casey asks we have some serious issues to resolve in here let me propose a compromise we settle the case and jack wade keeps his job jack wade is history herlihy says hold on casey says if this doesnt go to trial theres no reason to fire jack until the next time reinhardt says so take him off fires casey says give him slipandfalls dog bites broken pipes or we could just shoot him billy says youre not helping me billy well goddamn it billy explodes he gets to his feet all jack wade did was his job tell you something else all he was doing when he set up that fucking teddy kuhl and that fucking kazzy azmekian was his goddamn job they were as guilty as sin and everybody goddamn knew it perjury my fucking ass truth was those cocksuckers did set that fire and so did nicky vale billy shut up tom im talking billy says i been in this business coming on thirty years and i can tell you this if it walks like a dog barks like a dog wags its tail like a dog and lifts its hind leg to pee like a dog its a goddamn dog and jack wade knows that and tom casey you know that even if these fools dont and you can bang on your goddamn machines and your goddamn laptop computers all goddamn night and this fire is still a goddamn arson and nicky vale set it and he murdered his wife and i aint paying that motherfucker one goddamn cent and i aint firing jack wade and if you boys dont like it you can just goddamn fire me i dont goddamn care theres your basic hushed silence as he heads for the door he turns around in the doorway and looks at them for a minute shakes his head this company used to stand for something he says now itll stand for anything shakes his head again and says any goddamn thing he turns and leaves well casey says we pay the fifty bourne says were going to the insurance commission for a rate hike in ninety days anyway this will add nicely to the debit side when we argue that we need it casey has stopped listening its a done deal jack busts the mustang south blows right past the exit to california fire and life passes the exit to his condo and shoots down to the ortega highway where he turns east you take the ortega east what youre letting yourself in for is a series of downhill switchbacks that is like guaranteed to make your labrador throw up in the backseat youre going over the top of the mountains in the cleveland national forest so youre cruising through some barren rockstrewn hills the forest and all of a sudden youre pitching downhill toward the town of lake elsinore and its like falling off the edge of the fucking earth which it is which youd know if youve ever actually been to lake snore this stretch of road is not where you want to fuck up you slip on the kozmic banana peel coming down these switchbacks you are suddenly lost in space man you are rocky the flying squirrel you are airborne you may have your fourwheeldrive sports utility vehicle but you can have eighteenwheeldrive and it wont matter if all those wheels are in the sky what you dont have is wings or a parachute which is what youre going to need if you screw up the distinction between centrifugal and centripetal force on one of these curves like bikers have done space launches off this mountain and the highway patrol cant even find them theyre in their own little bomb craters six hundred feet below you lose the edge on these curves its just amf jacks into it jacks working out his rage on the road he and the mustang are taking the ortega like its a nebraska farm road like what curves we dont see no stinking curves jacks doing the gas brake shift gas number cranking on that wheel like hes on the bridge of the starship enterprise as for jack well it isnt exactly the death ride of jack wade its not like hes necessarily trying to kill himself its just that hes not trying real hard not to because whats the difference jacks thinking the jobs gone and i dont have a life outside the job unless you count the daily surfing ritual at dana strand which will be gone soon into the great sunsets his adrenalines a little jacked when he has to slow down to figure out where lettys place is in the middle of nowhere he finally finds it about a hundred yards down a dirt road that runs between two pastures theres a stand of trees with several buildings hidden in it and when he pulls up the sign says del rio he sits in the car wondering why the hell hes there decides its for no good reason at all and hes just about to put the stang in reverse when he sees lights come on in the house he turns off the engine and gets out of the car she comes out shes wearing a tshirt over jeans and shes barefoot hair tussled stands in her gravel driveway looking at him like what are you doing here its over he finally says i blew it we lost she thinks about it for a few seconds then says you drove out here to tell me that its a minute at least before he hears himself speak i have nothing in my life feels like hes standing a long way away hearing himself say that she goes to him and takes him by the arm and leads him into her house later when she takes him into her bedroom she pulls her tshirt over her head and steps out of the jeans and gets under the sheet jack gets undressed and lies down beside her she reaches out for him and her skin is white and warm and they kiss and she presses against him and he pulls the sheet down when he reaches down to touch her shes moist and warm he strokes her feeling her get wetter feeling her flow to his hand and get hotter and then she says baby and when she reaches for him hes hard and with her open hand she strokes him up and down they stroke each other she starts to move against his hand she presses up and her eyes get wide as if shes surprised and her skin is hot and she arches her back and reaches her other hand for his and holds it tight as she cranes her neck back and comes he keeps stroking touching her where shes now so wet but she moves his hand away and says in me i want you in me and she guides him inside her and jack is surprised at how good she feels hot and ripply as she moves up and down against him and her breasts flatten against his chest and she doesnt close her eyes but she looks at him as he moves slowly in and out of her her black hair rippling on the pillow he reaches out to grab it and clench it in his hand bury his face and kiss her neck lick her salty skin there she clasps the back of his neck and pulls him close to kiss her her mouth is hot and her tongue is hot and her thighs feel fiery against his and he starts to move faster and harder because he wants to feel the heat of the core of her he can feel it when he lunges hard deep into her she can feel it too because she jams herself against him and pushes him up deeper into her he can feel the head of his cock touch this deep hot place inside her that touches some deep place in him and shes holding his neck and his ass and rocking with him and hes gripping her neck and her ass and can feel her wet against the tips of his fingers there and then it feels like inside there is this heat flowing flowing and she grips him harder saying yes baby its okay as he moans and starts to move faster and harder theres this heat in him he feels like hes falling he feels like hes on fire and falling as she rocks him in and around her theres that heat so deep inside her so lovely inside her so lovely her face so lovely this falling like riding a wave of flame yes baby its okay come in me you can come in me and then he is its like falling off the world like a wave of flame crashing rolling him over and over under this unbearable wave of pleasure not letting him up hes crying out shes cooing yes baby hes under this ocean of pleasure somewhere up above the water he hears his long scream he feels his soul race out ahead of him hes drowning shes saying baby and when finally he comes up its like he washes up on the white beach of her body white neck and white breasts her stomach slick their sweat like smooth wet sand and her face is flushed red and her eyes are wet black hair sweaty wet clings to her neck and he sees those eyes searching for his and then he finally breathes tears come drop from his eyes onto her neck her chest her breasts she holds him tightly to her as he sobs as he weeps twelve empty years jack wakes up in lettys bed at first hes like where the hell am i but then he smells the mexican coffee and remembers rolls out of the rack and comes into the kitchen and shes standing there by the toaster sipping on the strong coffee i dont do the baconandeggs thing she says but i can offer you toast and coffee sounds great he plops down on a stool by her curved kitchen counter and looks out the window the land slopes down through big old black oak trees to some open pasture across a fence horses are out grazing your horses jack asks the neighbors she says i ride them sometimes you ride just surfboards he says to each his own ride she says handing him a plate of buttered toast she sits on the stool next to his what are you going to do now im going to go in to the office he says and clean out my desk you think theyre really going to fire you jack says if they dont im going to quit anyway you dont have to do that she says yeah i do they sit and look out the window its pretty out there jack thinks the trees and the pasture mountains in the background after a few minutes she asks so what are you going to do dunno a few minutes later she says you could come here you dont have to the house needs a remodel she says you could be doing that you know fixing things sleeping in your bed well that would be a bonus for me how gallant more coffee more silence more window gazing then she says its a serious offer serious sincere she says looking into her coffee cup and sudden but look how often do you get a second chance i mean me as well yeah he says same thinking you romantic bastard same nice going yeah she asks looks up at him now oh yeah so she says its a serious sincere offer thanks he says can i think about it because he knows shes offering the whole package like this instant life the home the woman and he knows she hasnt given up on the kids yet which is bad because she should letty jack youre not going to get the kids he says its over for you maybe she says she gets up and starts to clean off the counter letty look you took your best shot and you lost letty says im not blaming you for anything okay im not calling up what you did twelve years ago and saying that cost me the kids all im saying is that i owe those kids my best shot even if you think its a loser im going to find a lawyer wholl take this in front of a judge and if i lose ill find another lawyer and another judge and if i lose okay okay she says i gotta go to work you want to come back here tonight yeah yeah you heard me or yeah you want to yeah i want to they stand there looking at each other so this is probably the moment when we kiss she says yeah so they do kiss and then hold on to each other for a minute and he says what i did twelve years ago it was the wrong thing to do i should have just dropped the case probably i mean that old man was more important than the case i know thats what you meant she walks him out to the stang and he takes off back to california fire and life jack goes out to billys office hotter than hell out there in the cactus garden you aint fired billy says they cant fire you until they fire me see you on the unemployment line shit id just retire billy says gives this private little smile fade into the sunset im quitting billy nah dont do that they gonna pay the demand billy says probably then i quit shit jack billy snuffs out the cig and struggles to light another one has to turn against the wind and cup his hands to do it sucks down the first drag and says just let it go cant phone rings inside billys office he says thats probably herlihy again i got claims agency underwriting and siu all banging on me about this claim you better go talk to them then dont go anywhere ill sit out here until the vultures take me away jack takes the files off the chair and sits down letty sits in the front seat of her car getting a last sip of her coffee shed rather be doing something else than hiking up some trail in cleveland forest to meet a vietnamese punk teenage chop shop artist to get the word about two of his missing homeboys although i guess i asked for it letty thinks as she sets her cup on the floor below the drivers seat i put the heat on him since busting him in the chop shop shes cranked up the da the orange county antigang task force and the little mokes probation officer plus shes popped three more chop shops a gambling room and a massage parlor to get uncle nguyen wound up so she wasnt all that surprised when she got the call she gets out of the car and walks uphill up the hiking trail where she can already see tony ky standing there doing the snitch hop the snitch hop is this very distinctive twostep a little double bounce on one foot then shift the weight and a double bounce on the other hands in pockets shoulders scrunched up head rhythmically turning from side to side letty sees this performance of the snitch hop she knows with some satisfaction that the kid is nervous as hell good letty thinks serves him right maybe hell get so freaked hell give it up and get a real job yeah right tony is nervous the kid is definitely not used to meeting with cops to give them information even if it is about two friends who have dropped off the screen and tony has had a brutal week first theres the bust in the chop shop which uncle nguyen was not happy about but tony figures hes still going to cruise through it then the da starts cracking on him about two other chop shops trying to connect him to some sort of conspiracy then the antigang guy is in his face mumbling something about rico then his probation officer says he dont have to wait for a conviction to violate just him being in the presence of other felons then like things werent shitty enough uncle nguyen reaches out personally with the word that if he knows anything about the disappearance of imbecile tranh and idiot do he had better get his mouth in gear immediately if not sooner and when uncle nguyen hears that tranh and do were last seen doing errands for the russians the old bastard like freaks and then tells him to do something totally whacked which is like call this police bitch and tell her and tony is like what and uncle nguyen is like do what i tell you havent you caused me enough headaches already i want this cop off my back so the kid makes the call which would be okay weird but okay except that the russian dude shows up again and asks like you been talking to the cops and tony is like no man i dont talk to cops and the russian dude is like well youre going to youre going to set up a meet and tony is like what and the russian dude is like your head use it or lose it all of which is to say that yes the kid is a little jumpy standing out there on some dirt path in the country waiting for a cop billy comes back out and says theyre going to pay tomorrow morning with me or without me so which is it jack asks gotta think about that billy says thats fair how bout you im gone jack billy says youre not going to find another claims job anywhere in the industry i dont want one what are you going to do i dont know jack says maybe remodeling billy frowns fights the wind to light another cig and says sleep on this goddamn it take some sick days fuck it billy these days theyre all sick days and walks out muy disgusted in the lobby the receptionist juts her chin at the waiting bench and says olivia hathaway for you not now shes here jack i dont work here anymore jack says shes somebody elses headache now jack shes standing right behind him now mrs hathaway a moment of your time not now mrs hathaway just one moment she says shes holding a plate of cookies i really dont have the time right now mrs hathaway two minutes later jacks sitting across a table from her in room jack starts mrs hathaway i dont have time for this today im in a very bad mood so for the last time im not paying for your spoons not now not ever i didnt come about my spoons

mrs vecch veccharrios yes olivia says and a mr azmekian a mr azmekian jack asks yes kazzy azmekian no she says i think it was kazimir jack sits there while she recites a litany of various claims jack has turned down for the past seven years its like the old lady is reading off his freaking inventory and the only way jack thinks that paul gordon could go trolling for these clients is that hes had access to all my files jack hears olivia saying so mr gordon wants me to join in this suit against you he even offered me shares in the westview olivia says in the what in the westview company my dear very confidentially of course what the hell what did you tell him jack asks olivia looks up from her knitting i told him to go fuck himself cookie yes maam id like a cookie jack says her blue eyes look at him very seriously i know a scam when i see one she says sugar your favorite a great cookie now about my spoons so letty asks so what tony says still doing the snitch hop kids dressed up in the official vietnamese gangsta uniform black levis black hightops black leather jacket and its what degrees out black leather jacket in august letty doesnt feel like it you called me tranh and do no kidding tony whispers they were doing a job for some russians okay letty says like this is telling her something no tony says they were doing a job for some russians which gets lettys attention in a hurry how did they get hooked up with the roc maybe we do some cars tony says is that right anyway he says like hes not here to engage in bigger issues tranh and do were running an errand for the russians these two guys came and said they needed some guys and a truck for what boost a truck pick some stuff up at a house take it somewhere lose the truck what stuff letty asks what house take it where tony says they talk with my boys they call later and leave an address what address thirtyseven bluffside drive which rocks letty the night pamela is murdered two missing vietnamese gangbangers are taking stuff out of the house tony says so they lift a truck from paladin unpainted furniture go over there that night they dont come back now you know everything i know so lighten up on me what two guys i dont know the kid whines two new guys not the usual guys you got usual guys we got guys who bring cars tony says we got guys come for the money these were not the guys would you recognize these guys if you saw pictures tony shakes his head no way lady no fucking way do i give up these guys you dont have enough weight make me do that describe them tall skinny guy big fat guy no style have you seen them since tony shakes his head too fast too hard letty thinks heard from them since no dont lie to me you little shit im not lying and dont whine either she says it annoys me what did they say to you keep your stupid fucking mouth shut something like that tony mumbles dont tell uncle nguyen do they know ive been bringing the heat on you they know the kid says resentful everyone knows youre in a tough spot you put me there yeah whatever letty says come on in bring me those guys tony thinks about it for a second see how it plays he says yeah see how it plays letty says the kid already knows how its going to play how its going to play is this gash is about to get whacked is how its going to play so he says give me a couple of minutes head start i dont want to be seen with no cop out here letty laughs theres nothing out here but hills dry grass and rocks out anywhere tony says he heads back down the trail lettys mind is racing she has the tranh and do disappearance hooked in with pamelas death and the fire she has nicky vale connected somehow with roc she has a truckload of stuff leaving the vale house the night of the fire shes deep into these thoughts as she walks back she has her head down shes dead because the hitter is just standing there waiting for her she has her head down shes thinking things through and the only reason she looks up is that she catches a glint of something metal even though there is nothing metal out there she looks up and sees the gun barrel and a glimpse of a face on a body she spins to the ground dropping hard on the dry red dirt lands awkwardly and she can feel her shoulder dislocate when she hits but she has her weapon out and she can see the guys arm try to follow her down so she aims to the right of the arm and punches out two rounds wham wham and then two more wham wham and the first two take him in the chest and the next two in the head so that guy is over but then another figure charges toward her letty yells forget him hes dead and she grips her weapon hard trying to steady it if she needs to fire her last rounds but then the horizon starts doing goofy flipflops and she sees the blue sky and thanks madre maria shes alive and then it all goes black last thing she hears is this guy bellowing fuck you bish but hes running away letty lies in the dirt her shoulder muscle down around her elbow and it motherfucking hurts but she figures that pain is a good thing given the alternative jacks watching tv hes sitting down in front of two monitors hooked to vcrs and running two tapes side by side the vale home movies of pamela showing off the furniture and the tape he made of the vales burned and blackened bedroom very weird watching them simultaneously almost like watching pamelas ghost beautiful sexy alive walk around the ashes of her bedroom watch her point out the chairs the card table the desk the bed or where they were where she was because he burned them and he burned her no he didnt jack thinks he sure as hell burned her but he wouldnt burn the furniture no more than olivia hathaway would dump her spoons nobody burns what they love jack thinks not while theres a chance that they can still have it except me i burn what i love and then scatter the ashes what was it i said to letty pintale get out what was that bird a mythical bird that rose from the ashes the phoenix like letty and me like pamela on the tape like nickys precious furniture show me pam show me how nickys precious antique furniture rose from these ashes show me what im missing pamelas ghost pams trying to tell you something the fire is trying to tell you something the fires running smack like listen up dummy im trying to give it to you but youre too stupid to see it i left it all there for you you speak fluent fire right youre the dalmatian you the man so read me he runs the tapes three times before he sees it the heat shadows pams showing off the cabinet a rare bombebased redlacquered and japanned bureaucabinet from about a very rare piece jack freezeframes both tapes there it is he compares where pam is pointing to the same place on the wall of the fire scene tape the heat shadow is the wrong shape he rewinds and looks at it again no question about it the paler shape the heat shadow on the wall is smaller and lower than what it should be if the bureaucabinet had shielded the wall from the heat its the wrong shadow the wrong ghost its the shape of the writing desk jack rewinds to pam describing the writing desk freezeframes both tapes again compares what pam is pointing out to the heat shadow on the wall the wrong shape its the shape of the cabinet you screwed up nicky and thank you pam and thank you fire and thank you olivia hathaway first thing he sees is the parrot it looks like its just moving along the top of the hedge and then jack realizes that its sitting on the shoulder of mr meissners white shirt eliot jack says eliot eliot pretty bird meissner stops and looks over the hedge its the space man he says wheres your space suit today jack wade california fire and life i remember mr wade jack jack meissner says what can eliot do for you chess pieces jack says you said something about chess pieces moving in and moving out i thought you meant the kids them too meissner says but you meant something else meissner nods the truck with the chess piece on it the knight stuff coming in and out half the night what stuff furniture meissner says did you see who two asian boys two big white guys nicky pretty bird yes youre a pretty bird eliot meissner says the wind ruffles the birds feathers and its digging into meissners shoulder to stay on is this important could be something to do with pamelas death meissner asks i think so meissner looks off toward the water when he looks back he says she was a lovely girl a sweet girl with problems but a sweet girl yeah if you need me to testify no jack says quickly i wont need you to testify has anyone else interviewed you about this no have you talked to anyone else about it the parrot meissner says but i dont think hes listening do you jack shrugs mr meissner he says dont tell anyone what youve told me not police not lawyers no one if anyone asks you what you saw that night all you say is that you heard the dog and you saw the flames its very important but i want to help youve helped because now i know just what happened nicky swapped the furniture brought in a truck moved some cheap shit in and took the good stuff out but one of his boys screwed up put the desk where the bureau was supposed to be and vice versa so nicky still has his precious furniture half a million bucks on the hoof two million when you count the claim add that to the rest of the claim youve got the sum total of the money that nicky paid back to revive his financial standing thank you mr meissner for nothing for everything jack walks back toward the car nicky has the furniture so what the heat shadow evidence on the tapes will just get dismissed as corrupted or nicky will claim that he forgot that he moved the furniture around before the fire yeah but you have an eyewitness who will testify that he saw the furniture coming in and out but you cant use him because the second you name him theyll kill him so what are you going to do he drives to laguna ten minutes later he hands a brass cabinet handle to marlowe marlowe looks at it for at least a second and a half before he says fake how do you know one im not helen keller marlowe says two im not forrest gump three ive been selling the real thing for approaching hmmmmnn years and i can tell you that this is not the brass from a georgian cabinet door next a claw handle foot may i saw marlowe asks knock yourself out marlowe takes a wood saw and makes two angled incisions into the wood cutting a wedge out he shines his lamp into the wedge and says this was made perhaps a month ago maybe two what else do you have for me a copper hasp eighteenth century perhaps in a former life so so i dont know what to tell you marlowe says look i know every piece in nicky vales collection i verified most of them for him others christ i bid against him but he had deeper pockets i dont know where you got these tchotchkes but the furniture in nickys house was the real thing these are the work of a master copier id say any names come to mind george scollins marlowe says the best he has a studio way out in the boonies up in laguna canyon does great restorations fantastic copies is that legal can be marlowe says theres a difference between a copy and a counterfeit it all depends on how its labeled a lot of people want antique furniture style without the age so they buy a scollins or they want a piece of furniture that doesnt exist anymore so they get scollins to copy it from a picture or they want a rare piece without the rare price tag so they buy a scollins if they pass it off as real to their friends its tacky but legal if they try to auction it as original thats fraud or if they burn it and try to sell it to their insurance company as the real thing you have scollinss address jack asks way out in the boonies is no shit jack thinks as he drives on a windy dirt road up one of the dozens of side canyons that stretch out like fingers from laguna canyon tucked away inside a little grove of trees the scollins place is more like the scollins places a number of little oneand twostory buildings tacked together on the sloped landscape or they were anyway because when jack gets closer he knows hes not going to get a chance to talk to george scollins because now what you have are a bunch of little burnedout shells gripping the slope hell of a view though jack gets out of the car he feels like hes on the top of the world he can see all across the dry brown hills and the ocean is like a rectangle of pure blue from this angle the water looks almost vertical nice place to live he goes into the scollins house to go dick around in there place still smells of turpentine and shellac and a host of other carbonbased chemicals that must have made a hell of a fuel load the fire would have gone up fast and hot ravenous alligator small cinder block house full of wood when the fire broke out it became an oven and a mess it looks like scollins lived his work the metal bed frame sits by the wall and there are remnants of furniture pieces scattered all over the floor heat shadows on the walls jack finds the probable point of origin an electrical baseboard heater an easy call by the scorching and char around it not to mention the remnants of what look to be cleaning rags accelerant splatter at the base of the heater why would the heat be on in the middle of summer classic teddy kuhl jack gets on his phone calls the sheriffs department fire investigation please one moment i need a little luck here he thinks he gets it guy gets on and its not bentley hi jack says john morici pacific mutual insurance hey you guys had a fire recently in laguna canyon the scollins residence hold on a sec guy gets back on and says im showing that to be farmers insurance we have the life jack says he plays a hunch im behind on my files and my boss is all over my ass can you just give me a c ampo so i can release a payment hold on jack holds on yeah the guy says it was ruled accidental let me see pile of rags by the heater so accidental death you got it hey who was the investigator uhhh that would be deputy bentley yeah that would be hes just clicked off when the phone chirps again yeah jack asks its goddamn billy jack yeah i know im fired its not that billy says its letty del rio theres been a shooting shes sitting up on the examining table she looks exhausted and weak but shes alive and jack is so damn grateful for that he could kiss god on the lips what happened he asks her i got stupid she says i went to meet a snitch alone and i wasnt paying attention and they set me up letty im all right she says your arm its fucked up but they fixed it she says ill be out of here this afternoon stay here jack says take it easy she looks at him and there are tears in her eyes one of thems dead she says you okay with that im not crazy about it letty says but im not eating myself up either they have an id no but jack sees theres this weird little look on her face what jack asks she tells him what the vietnamese kid told her about tranh and do and the vale house theyre dead jack says how do you know i dont but i do jack says nicky took the real furniture out substituted it with cheap fakes the guy who made the furniture is dead the kids who dropped it off and picked up the real furniture are dead too and pam and pam jack i can reopen now voice starting to fade shes a few moments from the enchanted forest okay jack says you stay out of this now okay promise she asks because these are dangerous people promise sgood she closes her eyes murmurs funny thing jack im about out and i hear the other guy the driver in the caddy he called me a bish is that weird or what i guess i am though huh a real ballbusting bish shes out jack squeezes her hand and leaves so angry that it feels like every square inch of his skin is on fire flashover jack pulls up across the street from a trashedout bungalow on a culdesac up in modjeska canyon the house was white once now its a sort of whitish with brown patches where the paint has worn off place needs a paint job bad jack thinks but he figures it isnt likely to get one because theres garbage strewn all across the rickety front porch including four biker types drinking beer with their feet up on the porch railing some freakin heavy metal noise some assholes might call rock n roll blasts from the stereo inside jack walks up the steps and asks teddy kuhl here its his house one of the bikers says i know that jack says what i asked is is he here hes inside tell him someone wants to see him no how come hes busy this gets a big laugh from the other three jack doesnt mind playing straight man doing what fucking a group guffaw very male bonding jack says tell him to take a break tell him someone wants to talk to him fuck you yeah okay fuck me jack backs off the porch and walks over to the driveway where a big black harley hog is parked jack checks back out on the street and counts three other harleys there so this one would be teddys teddy cools bad hog jack kicks it over then kicks in the headlight and stomps on the handbrake until it snaps off which raises what might be called a commotion among the boys on the porch it isnt five seconds before teddy bursts through the door the twelve years havent been kind to him his hairlines retreated like a french army hes got a couple less teeth and he has a paunch around the middle thats bouncing around as he tries to zip the fly on his jeans and pull his boots on at the same time hes getting his left boot on when he hollers whos the crazy motherfucker fucking with my bike jack smiles and says that would be me teddy grins and announces hey its deputy dawg former deputy dawg jack says well youre in a world of shit former deputy dawg teddy says he gets his boot on gestures for his boys to stay where they are and saunters down to the driveway i owe you you cocksucking motherfucker jack shakes like a wet dog ooooooh im scared can you be the same teddy kuhl that rolled over for me once like a little bitch this sets teddy off one of jacks favorite truisms is that you can always count on stupid to be stupid and this is what hes counting on teddy doesnt let him down either because the stupid thing teddy does is he reaches into the back waistband of his jeans for his piece while teddys left hand is behind his back jack comes over the top of it with a looping left hand that smashes down into the side of teddys nose you can hear the cartilage crunch over the blasting music so teddys hand is swinging the gun up but he cant see because his eyes are watering as jack steps to the side and swings teddys gun hand up and in so the gun butt smashes into teddys nose which lights teddy up like a pinball machine he cant even feel jack take the gun out of his hand hes in so much pain but he does feel it when jack brings the butt down on his nose and the bone breaks in two places so teddys on his knees in the driveway and his homeboys start down to help him but stop cold when jack points the pistol at them and says yes they all like teddy okay but not enough to take a bullet for him and this crazy motherfucker is just crazy enough to shoot them all so like teddys on his own and not doing very well at it because theres blood all over the driveway and a couple of teeth and a whole lot more blood and snot coming out of teddys nose you can always count on stupid jack thinks because nobody but a truly dumb moke like teddy gets that close to someone hes intending to shoot youre going to shoot a guy you shoot him from out of reach thats the whole point of having a gun in the first place but oh well he drags teddy along the driveway kicking him in the ribs as they go punctuating each kick with let me give you some life advice teddy you do not kick try to hurt kick people kick that i love kick do kick you kick get kick that kick he drags teddy until he has his head just inside the garage then he reaches up and punches the door button and the door comes down on teddys neck so jack is pretty much just talking to teddys head which is having some difficulty getting air jacks thinking that the last time he lit up teddy kuhl he regretted it for twelve years oh well jack thinks thisll give me something to regret for the next twelve kind of like old times huh teddy jack says fuck you jack says you went on a job this morning no i didnt jack leans on the garage door hard teddys head looks like it might just pop off all right i did teddy yells but that is not an official confession i was coerced jack lets up on the door who sent you teddy clamps his mouth shut jack leans into it repeats who sent you couple of russian dudes youre kazzys butt boy hes armenian jack says what does he have to do with the russians they own him they took him over nicky vale jack says what about him you know him never heard of no nicky vale jack leans on the door again nicky vale ive heard the name teddy says i heard that kicked around some sort of boss boss of bosses capo de tutti capi godfather shit kazzy said he went away and now hes back did you set the fire at his house no but teddy giggles much as you can giggle with a twohundredpound garage door on your neck whats funny teddy cool teddy actually laughs we been workin you dumbass motherfucker cal fire is our bish youve been waltzing through my files jack says who you got inside cal fire dunno is it sandra hansen siu siu mic key mouse i dunno tom casey dunno jack leans down on the garage door i dont know teddy croaks splatter my brains all over the garage deputy dawg sanitation comes and sprays em away tonight with a hose i dont fucking know somebody because we been working you humpin you the armenians the russians they all been humpin away at you jack you set the scollins fire jack asks that one i mightve done teddy says but you cant use any of this youll be in jail before i will same old teddy cool jack says toss in a bunch of soaked rags and a match you never grow teddy you never develop i mean here we both are in the same old place you being a stupid sloppy asshole and me whaling on your ass jack lets up on the door who gave the order to kill that old man teddy what old man porfirio guzman twelve years ago the old beaner teddy asks then looks up and smiles kazzy said his boss told him to so kazzy told me to and you cant do a thing about it deputy dawg problem is teddy cool is right you cant do shit because you dont have shit you have a witness to nicky moving furniture in and out the night of the fire the same witness puts nicky on the scene contrary to his recorded statement but if you use the witness they kill the witness deja vu you have the fake remnants yeah you have char samples too look what happened with them you have the guy who made the fakes and hes dead all burned up okay you have two missing vietnamese kids driving the stolen truck that picked up the furniture and you have an attempted hit on the deputy who was investigating the missing kids and nothing to hook any of it to nicky vale jack looks around the garage sees a gas can pours the contents around the floor as teddy screams jack pours the rest of the gas over teddys head some of it scatters and seeps down through the garage door jack squats down next to him what did nicky do with the furniture what furniture shit where did i put my matches i dont know nothing about no fucking furniture teddy isnt lying teddy is too scared to be lying give me something teddy jack says something i can use teddys thinking it over jack can see that teddys weighing relative fears his fear of nicky vale against his fear of burning alive jack knows hes going to win because the flame is immediate and the other is still abstract and teddy doesnt have a good grasp of the abstract westview teddy says what what i got to give you teddy says i just hear kazzy talking about something called westview something hes got going on with nicky vale jack pushes the button and the garage door opens teddys boys are standing there with guns pointed three shotguns two pistols and a glock good idea jack says lets have a blazing gun battle barbecue teddy cool put em down put em down put em down teddy screams jack walks through them to his car gets inside opens the window and says he sang like a little girl what can i say guys hes still my bish starts the car and drives away wondering what the hell is westview nicky looks across the desk at paul gordon whos sniffing the top of his cappuccino to make sure that its nutmeg and not cinnamon that important task done gordon looks up at nicky like im ready for you now for his part nicky will be glad to leave the mans ego behind ready nicky asks im all yours tomorrow morning nicky says tom casey will call to offer million to settle my claim gordon freaks in his wildest imagination he never dreamed that cal fire would go for the million he was counting on them turning it down what the fuck good is cal fire if it suddenly gets smart dont worry he says ill turn it down ill find a pretext nicky shakes his head youll accept that offer gordon turns white thats not the plan it is now the hell it is gordon says ive spent years setting up these suits ive got the cops ive got the judges you cant bail on me now nicky shrugs gordons voice gets shrill nicky what the fuck are you thinking about we can ride jack wade for hundreds of millions of dollars dont settle for the short money now jack wade has played his role nicky says wades on his way out then gordon gets it you son of a bitch he says you cut your own deal accept the offer nicky says youll get your fee fuck you gordon says were taking it to trial were taking all of them to trial in that case nicky says youre fired gordon laughs you cant fire me you jumpedup little hood you need me without me theyll eat you alive you think you can stand down cal fire and tom casey without me actually yes nicky thinks i think i can in fact i know it he stands up says youre fired gordon flips out follows nicky down the hallway yelling you think youre the only heavy hitter in town you need me i dont need you ill have viktor tratchev in this office in five minutes maybe he has the brains he has the vision or kazzy azmekian he has the balls to see this through hes not going to let you crash this you jumpedup little greasy eurotrash hood you cant fire me a very tawdry scene nicky thinks as he gets in the car and gordon should not have played the tratchev card or the azmekian one very selfindulgent very uncool two cards he should have held close to the chest and jumpedup little greasy eurotrash hood one might be tempted to take that personally oh well he leans back into the seat almost there he thinks a couple of steps to safety and the turnaround inside one generation fifty million dollars tomorrow fifty million dollars of squeakyclean money but theres work to be done first ritzcarlton he tells dani take the first step dani waits out in the car while the pakhan has his meeting uncle nguyens head is throbbing hes just had to tell tommy dos distraught mother that her idiot son is probably not coming home for dinner ever so theres a lot of wailing and sobbing and other irritating noise this woman has a piercing shriek that goes through uncle nguyens head she completely drowns out the angels game and wont settle down until uncle nguyen promises her vengeance he finally gets rid of her with that promise and goes down into the basement where he has tony ky hanging by his wrists and just to improve his mood he gives tony a couple of twohanders across the back with a bamboo rod which elicits a satisfying grunt of pain and then he says to tony tell me who these russians were and tony tells him tall skinny russian tall fat russian he doesnt know their names so uncle nguyen takes a jim edmonds swing at his back like good for a threebagger in any park in america and asks him who they were working for tratchev tony says uncle nguyen has a tough time with this hes been doing business with viktor tratchev for years and its always been a good and mutually profitable relationship so he gets tratchev on the phone and asks what is this shit all about what shit two of your people hired two of my boys for an errand and the boys havent come back which of my people uncle nguyen describes them tratchev is very happy to hear this description the last thing in the world he needs right now is a beef with the vietnamese first thing he needs right now is an ally against nicky vale so he says youre talking about dani and lev you had better send dani and lev over for a chat theyre not mine whose are they tratchev tells him uncle nguyen asks do you have a problem if i do what i need to do go figure tratchev doesnt have a problem jack walks back into the office theyre all looking at him like theyre seeing a ghost jack hears the whispers as he walks down the narrow aisle through the cubicles fired perjury kickbacks crooked cop im baaaack jack sings out some of the dogs turn around in their cubicles bury their faces in their monitors except one who picks up her phone cups her hand around the receiver and starts whispering so hansen has released a be on the lookout for and this babe cant wait to drop the dime but itll take them some time to work out how to handle it therell be calls up and down calls to billy calls to mahogany row so you have time but not a lot of time he sits down and starts banging the computer gets into the california secretary of states database and types in westview which is not the happiest name to be researching if you happen to be located on the west coast the screen brings up a couple of hundred of them westview travel westview realty westview retirement westview recreational vehicles westview condominium association westview ltd jack goes with westview ltd a limited partnership will only show the general partners not the shareholders theyre anonymous until you can get your hands on the actual limited partnership agreement which would have to be subpoenaed so its a good vehicle to play the ownership shell game jack doubleclicks on westview ltd and requests an lp statement which lists the general partners a james johnson a benjamin khafti and an orange coast ltd another limited partnership jack requests an lp statement for orange coast ltd a howard krasner a grant lederer another limited partnership crossco ltd jack requests an lp for crossco and on and on and on every hit gets him a couple of hypothetical people and another limited partnership the ownership shell game find the moving owners under the shell jack keeps playing hes twelve layers deep when he hits on jerisoco ltd bingo general partners a michael allen kazimir azmekian and something called gold coast ltd gold coast ltd back to the shell game he pops it for an lp and gets another meaningless name and two more limited partnerships those two get him three more and so on and so on and so on and then he hits it great sunsets ltd jacks head whirls great sunsets ltd the company thats trying to develop dana strands and its hooked into kazzy azmekian and nicky vale holy god jack sees two security guys and cooper the excop from siu coming down the aisle jack requests an lp for great sunsets ltd the computer hums come on come on jack thinks theyre fifty feet away come on jack thinks because he can feel the paranoia crawl up his back like a hot wave jack looks around and feels like the walls are closing in on him they are hes just managed to turn the computer off when cooper lays a hand on his shoulder youve been suspended jack cooper says pending an investigation fuck you i quit better cooper says goddamn billy comes up what the goddamn hell is going on here mr wade has been suspended who says mr wade has been suspended siu has uncovered some information involving kickbacks bullfuckingshit youll have to take that up with ms hansen cooper says you bet your goddamn ass ill take it up with mizzz goddamn hansen billy yells this aint over jack its over billy you dont know how over theyre walking him out jack can see sandra hansen watching him from the corner he waves at her hansens not happy shes thinking what a brainless dumb stud jack wade is shes thinking that jacks surfboard has landed on his head once make that twice too often but hes a good honest claims dog and its too bad hes so damn stubborn out this morning still chasing the vale file but she has three years and god only knows how much of her budget sunk into roc and shes not going to let one stubborn m of an adjuster flush it down the toilet not now not when the deal goes down tonight so jack wade has to go phil herlihys watching the whole thing up on mahogany row on the security camera phils gripping seriously hes been monitoring wades computer screen saw what he was working on jack wade has to go jack feels like his heads going to blow off his shoulders nicky owns the strands with siu taking his back very sweet face it you dont stand a chance they beat you any move you make theyll find a way to jam it they have the execs and the cops and the lawyers and the judges and face it you dont know who else nicky owns so fuck it sorry pam sorry letty nicky vale will get richer on his wifes body and his kids heartbreak and fuck that he looks for a place to turn around cant because theres a big black caddy coming up on his ass its a big humping old black caddy and its right on his ass the stang is a nice car but it doesnt have the weight to stand off the soupedup caddy this doofus is pushing at him the caddys on his tail through a tricky scurve which breaks open into a short straightaway that bends into a huge outside turn and jack taps the brakes because you do not want to go into this curve too fast unless you want to be orville wright so he slows down but this asshole stays right on him then he moves to pass jack cant freaking believe it but this asshole pulls right alongside him as the curve turns in comes around and stays beside him the caddys in the wrong lane on a curve and doesnt pull back in what the fuck are you doing jack yells because theres a cliff wall on the inside and a twohundredfoot drop on the outside and this is bad news which is true because now another car has come up behind him a muscle car a charger and now its right up on his ass which is bad because now jack has nowhere to go he cant even hit the brakes then he sees the truck coming in his lane straight at him he either crashes headon into the trailer truck or he goes off the road which is the plan jimmy dansky hes sitting in the cab of the truck and the cars headed straight for him the new guy is good the new guy is doing just what hes supposed to trap the mustang in place a game of chicken which jimmy figures hes going to win because he knows its psychologically impossible for a car to hang in the driver sees a truck coming hell hit the brakes and swerve human nature and when he swerves he loses it on that curve and hes over the edge byebye he goes and then the chase car can take the oncoming lane and everyone gets home safe except the mustang its in a crater at the bottom of the canyon a very tricky stunt a real ball tightener but its going like a bomb so he bears down on the mustang and waits for it to chicken out jack doesnt swerve or hit the brakes what he does is he steps on the gas he pushes the stang toward the trailer truck like shes going to take it out kamikaze mustang banfuckingzai jimmy dansky cant believe it they told him this guy was hardcore they didnt say he was crazy or suicidal turn cocksucker turn is what jimmy dansky is thinking what jack is thinking is like fuck you asshole you turn and all this is going on in like seconds and theres about to be a spectacular fourcar crash on the ortega and jack lets one hand off the wheel and grabs teddys pistol with the other shoots out the drivers window then wings a shot at the caddy and thats when the caddy driver chickens out he swerves the caddy inside toward the rock face jack moves left into the now vacant space in the oncoming lane the charger tries to get out of the way but its too late danskys truck sheers the top off the charger taking the drivers upper body with it as it smashes through the guardrail and launches into the sky above the canyon like uhh houston weve got a problem jimmys up there with half a charger and half a charger driver jammed in his grill the front of the truck is pointing toward the sun for a second he fantasizes that the track has enough momentum to sail across the canyon and land on the other side but then the laws of physics rule against jimmy and the front of the truck takes a downward tilt and jimmy without his parachute a few seconds later the truck smashes headfirst into the lower slope like some suicidal ski jumper then it does two somersaults and comes to a rest but by that time jimmy danskys neck has snapped in numerous locations jacks not doing so great either he scrapes the wall bounces off plunges toward the edge of the cliff jerks the wheel heads for the wall again pulls out and goes into a spin hes doing threesixties wall cliff wall cliff wall cliff hes spinning toward the edge of the cliff and then skids to a stop with the front of the stang hanging over the edge jacks looking down at eternity he gets out gently his legs are weak and the world is spinning and the caddy and charger are long gone he checks out the stang major damage frontleft quarter panel banged in passengerside door banged gashes and scrapes along the whole passenger side youre talking bondo from here to eternity its never going to be over he thinks you know too much letty knows too much they wont let you just give up and face it you wont let you just give up it wont be over until youve finished your job your job is to not pay claims you dont owe you dont pay people to burn their own houses down and you dont pay them to kill their wives and you dont let them rip off your company you do the job you started to do and do it right this time so quit your whining and find nickys fucking furniture and how the hell are you going to do that it could be anywhere in the freaking world nicky has apartment buildings nicky has condos nicky has yeah jack pats the back of the stang goodbye old paint he puts his shoulder to it and pushes it off the edge watches it somersault down the canyon and explode in a ball of flame at the bottom he starts walking west with his thumb out into a great sunset young waits for the sun to go down has his troops assembled in the parking lot of the ritz and they all have their assignments hes edgy as a mother duck because if he pulls this off tonight its the biggest organized crime roundup since the appalachia raid he has names records aliases safe houses he knows where the weapons are what they are who they belong to he makes half these busts he can start a ball rolling across the whole country start winding roc up in arizona texas kentucky west virginia new york hes just waiting for dark jimenez is likewise stoked got him his share of the list his share of the collars because for once the feds are playing team ball so he has his guys posted all over socal got a freakin battalion ready to hit in la another squad down here in orange county some more troops in san diego just waiting for the sun to go down sandra hansen shes sitting in the room at the ritz guzzling diet cokes like they could settle her nerves she wont get the satisfaction of going on the busts she cant ever even admit that cal fire funded half this investigation all she can do is sit by the phone and hope that it goes down right that something doesnt come along to fuck it up because its a tricky deal the busts tonight fifty million dollars payment in the morning then her guy starts filling them in in exchange for complete and total immunity for anything except a capital offense the whole deal signed off on by claims mahogany row and an alphabet soup of law enforcement agencies so tonights a big night she looks out the window at the beautiful stretch of beach and one of those incredible red california sunsets and all she wishes is that it would be morning nickys gazing at the sunset too lev and dani behind him on the lawn like lengthening shadows it is as if were in the cell again nicky says the three of us in a corner against the world we are fighting for our lives new lives years ago in that hell i promised you new lives i promised you paradise tomorrow if we do what we have to do tonight we will have those new lives we are just a few steps from safety tonight will tell the story just a few steps from safety but all the plans are made it will be a bloody night it already has been jimmy dansky and jack wade dead in a fiery pas de deux and the sister there can be no mistakes this time which is why hes ordered lev to do it lev will make no mistakes all other problems will disappear and i am a shifting cloud in a twilight sky lettys in no mood for sunsets she feels like hammered shit which is about right she thinks considering a deputy drives her home another drives her car for her want me to stay he asks im fine the boss said i know what the boss said letty laughs im fine she has an ice pack and a bottle of vicodin and some hopes that jack will show up tonight to pamper her a little fetch me a drink fluff my pillow make sure i get a good nights sleep because first thing in the morning im taking my broken wing to mother russias house and questioning nicky about what two missing kids were doing at his crib the night before they disappeared boss told me to lay off pams case and work the missing kids follow it where it leads well guess what it leads to nicky and where the hell is jack youd think hed befalling all over himself to do the concerned male number she calls him at the office gone calls him at home gets his tape leaves a message she knows where he is hes out working the arson case lifer claims dog on the scent job or no job jack will never give up its just one of the things she loves about him she loves him and shes worried about him and she says a little prayer that hes okay then she takes two vikes gets into bed and turns out the light natalie tarns on the bedside lamp go to sleep she says to michael i cant hes crying again why not natalie asks ghosts theyre not ghosts theyre shadows but they are scary natalie admits the branches of the big eucalyptus tree outside the window are blowing in the wind making ghostlike arms and heads on the bedroom wall im scared michael says of what fire michael says like burned up mommy this house wont catch on fire how do you know i dont know natalie thinks shes scared too she has bad dreams where theres fire everywhere and mommys asleep and wont wake up there wont be a fire she says because i am the princess and thats my command who can i be michael asks the princesss little brother michael whines cant i be something else too like a wizard whats that like a magician natalie says only better can i make things disappear yes like ghosts yes natalie says now go to sleep leave the light on she leaves the light on and lies awake and watches the shadows move jack sits in the darkness all but invisible against the bluff hes waiting for there to be just enough light for him to see without being seen so he sits down and just watches the ocean like he used to do as a kid just sits at dana strand and does nothing the waves are silver under the full moon they fall on the beach with a sound like shhhhhhhh a pacific lullaby jack waits for the sun to come up letty wakes up with a start a sound outside footsteps on the deck she picks up her weapon from the side table by the bed and holds it in her good hand as she eases along the wall to the door settle down girl she tells herself her hearts racing and her hands trembling she gets to the door and looks out through the glass panes cant see a thing she lifts the slinged hand up and turns the doorknob then kicks the door open and bursts out onto the deck in the shooting position swings right nothing swings left the raccoon scrambles down the steps shit letty says puffs a long sigh and gets her breath back then she laughs at herself and makes a note to get bungee cords for the garbage cans shuts the door and starts to go back to bed but her arms hurting so she goes into the bathroom turns on the light and takes a couple more vikes turns off the light and goes back to bed levs pressed against the corner of the house he watches the light come on and then go off again nicky watches paul gordon walk out of the starbucks with a cappuccino in his hand arrogantly oblivious to the possibility that the world might injure him the driver trails him across the almost empty parking lot toward the bank where gordon walks up to the automatic teller rests his cappuccino on the ledge puts in his card and taps his foot while the machine hums nicky watches from the backseat as dani lowers the front passenger window and rests the machine pistol on the edge gordon gets his cash grips his two hundred bucks in one hand and his coffee in the other and turns into the spray of bullets that smash into his chest the cappuccino splashes all over his bloodstained shirt as he falls to the hot asphalt youre fired nicky says teddy kuhls doing the smart thing hes running since motherfucking deputy dawgs parting shot that teddy sang like a bird teddy knows its only a matter of time before one of his tightest buddies rats him out to the russians teddy knows that he is just cash on the hoof so hurting as he is he nuts it up packs a few things gets on his bike and heads east until this shit cools off hes thinking maybe arizona he is doing a very smart thing then he does a very stupid thing he stops for a beer stupider than that he stops for a beer at a bikers bar called cooks corner out by modjeska canyon teddys thinking he needs a beer maybe and this is the last good beer spot for many dry and lonely miles the beer tastes so good to him he goes for another gets laughing with some buddies and ends up having five doesnt even notice one of his boys on the phone beer number seven he decides its time to hit the road and get out of dodge but he needs to take a piss first beer bladder pressing down on him like a fiftypound weight so he slides off the stool pushes the metal door into the mens room and steps up to the stainlesssteel trough all by his lonesome in there george thorogood song blaring from inside the bar teddys kind of rocking to it as he unzips his fly and lets loose aaaaaahhhhh hitter steps out from a stall puts the pistol to the back of teddys head and pulls the trigger teddy dies with whats left of his face in the urinal right next to that little white sponge thing judge john bickford gets an anonymous phone call at home informing him that his years of devoted service to the plaintiffs bar have been duly noted that an informant has in fact duly noted it to the california attorney generals office and that a story will appear in tomorrows orange county register linking him to a murdered paul gordon and paul gordon to the russian mafia bickford says goodbye to his wife and drives to a motel in oceanside where he tranquilizes himself with twelveyearold scotch and valium and in the small hours of the morning slashes his wrists the newspaper story never appears retired justice dennis mallon gets a similar phone call and catches a flight to mexico with a connection to grand cayman he has a home there dr benton howard steps off a curb into an oncoming car his injuries are so real that he dies of them word hits the street by morning that howard was an informant working with the antiroc task force which is working like a mother in what will become known in law enforcement circles as the st petersburg day massacre youngs troops roll up tratchevs brigade like its the freaking republican guard tratchevs guys are caught flatfooted theyre grabbed in bars theyre grabbed in their homes theyre grabbed in bed with their girlfriends viktor tratchev is having a quiet evening at home watching cops on the fox network when the door comes crashing in and special agent young comes through with a shotgun in his hands like hes robert stack tratchev is annoyed because he thought he had guards out there but the guards now have their hands behind their backs and plastic ties around their wrists so technically speaking theyre not really guards anymore bad boys bad boys what you gonna do tratchev reaches for his glasses which is a mistake because one of youngs troops puts two rounds into his chest before young can scream what the fuck are you doing but the fact is that the agent knows exactly what the fuck hes doing hes getting in position for a big payday from nicky vale is what hes doing what you gonna do when they come for you jimenezs boys are romping in la up and down fairfax theyre crashing in doors theyre jamming cars into curbs theyre blocking off alleys and side streets theyre scooping up car thieves drivedown artists extortionists drug dealers the whole first and second allstar team of rubinskys and schallers best moneymakers they get rubinsky and schaller too rubinskys in bed with his wife when jimenez gives him a wakeup call with a pistol barrel to the back of his neck schallers playing poker with some buddies when the game comes to a sudden halt the sweep misses kazzy azmekian hes not at home hes twenty nautical miles off rosarita on his fortyfoot sportscraft for an overnight fishing trip turns out he cant swim because when his trusted bodyguard launches him over the side kazzy just sort of goes glugglug and then disappears into the darkness anyway between tragic accidents like this and the task force sweep nicky vales selfreinvention as a legitimate businessman is pretty much complete but not quite the noise on the deck wakes letty up rattling of garbage cans damn raccoons she says as she gets out of bed stumbles for the door and this time doesnt bother to take her weapon its not like shes going to shoot the damn thing lev waits by the corner of the deck make it look like a rape is what the pakhan said then tear her up with the knife just another psychosex murder in the southland film at eleven he poises the knife in his left hand hears her footsteps hears her open the door sees her step out vamos letty yells as lev starts forward something stops him a tight cord around his neck pulls him back and down the steps letty hears the raccoon run off and closes the door locks it and goes back to bed whatever the sound was its gone now mother russia finally gets the children to sleep truth be known shell be happy when daziatnik rebuilds his own house and moves back in because while she loves having little michael with her the girl natalie favors her mother and is a real little bitch quite hopeless really genetics being what they are michael michael will be a little prince with some work but natalie mother russia goes into the bathroom brushes her teeth scrubs her face then takes a brush to her hair a hundred strokes every morning and every night and that is what will keep it beautiful and full the way daziatnik so admires it she finishes brushing it and stands back to admire her look in the mirror thats when she sees the man behind her it must be one of the new guards but the nerve to come into her bedroom what she starts to snap then the mans hand is over her mouth a cloth over her nose then blackness nicky lights up a joint savors the sweet musky scent takes a deep hit lets it swirl around in his lungs and then releases it feels all the tension go out with the smoke all problems dissolving into the night air tratchev dead his troops locked up rubinsky and schaller swept up with their troops the late dr benton howards reputation as a police informer firmly established paul gordon fired kazzy azmekian is flotsam or is it jetsam nicky can never remember doesnt matter he takes another toke slips out of his clothes and lets himself ease into the jacuzzis steaming water fifty million dollars coming his way tomorrow the turnaround in one generation a very good night and some very good boo he feels a small twinge of anxiety lev hasnt returned yet to report that the problem of the sister is no more nicky does another hit and lets the problem fly from his mind what lev sets out to kill lev kills hell be back soon so nickys having a very good night he has the whole thing working for him tratchev dead a big payday coming up on the morrow and life is way cool he shuts his eyes and stretches out and then feels something round against his toes hes like annoyed because he has told michael not to kick his soccer ball around the pool and the jacuzzi nicky goes to pick the ball up and screams falls backward against the side of the jacuzzi and cowers there and just stares at levs severed head bobbing up and down in the bubbling water nickys going fetal when dani gets there dani plucks levs head up by the hair and just howls in pain theres a ribbon around levs neck something written on it but even if they werent so freaked they couldnt read it its written in vietnamese nicky runs into the house to mothers room her door is ajar and he can see the flickering silver light of the television he opens the door without knocking mother a man sits on the bed watching television he casually swings his silenced pistol in nickys direction hello daz karpotsov says im sorry its nicky now isnt it colonel its general now karpotsov says nicky is like freaking but nicky stays cool congratulations he says

me put it this way karpotsov says we want our fucking money dude we want our piece of california fire and life the sun comes up enough to make out shapes that earlymorning hour when everything is in shades of gray jack starts up the ravine that cuts into the bluff he climbs until he comes to the old fence ducks under it just the way he did when he was a kid and hes in the old trailer park very weird very strange being here knowing it belongs to nicky vale that nickys planning on turning it into a tract of condos and town houses that he killed his wife by way of raising the capital jack picks his way through the eucalyptus and pine trees he walks past old trailer pads and then a dumpster he opens the lid of the dumpster shines the light in and jumps back two charred cracked skulls exploded from the inside out by intense heat tommy do and vince tranh jack closes the lid moves on toward the old decrepit rec hall he used to run around in when he was eight it was a fort when he was ten it was a rock n roll hall when he was fifteen it was makeout heaven the old hall is in bad shape some boards ripped out shingles stripped but the two wide old doors are still intact and theres a shiny new padlock on them a combination lock jack finds a rock and smashes the hasp the door swings open like its been an exhausting effort to stay shut first thing jack sees is the bed he pulls up a dustcover and there it is the robert adam fourposter canopied bed with the castle on top incredibly beautiful with its silk and fabrics and intricately carved coat of arms the video didnt do it justice the freaking room is filled with furniture all draped in cloth dust covers they look like monuments like ghosts jack goes around turning back the covers the george iii writing desk the hepplewhite chair the matthias lock rococo console table its all here jack says to himself the mahogany armless chairs the silent valet the kent mirror the side table the gilt chairs the card table jacks looking at it but what he sees in his mind is pamela vale walking him through like shes there in the old rec hall pointing to each piece as nicky holds the camera this is one of our real treasures a rare bombebased redlacquered and japanned bureaucabinet from about it has clawed and hairy paw feet also serpentineshaped corners with attenuated acanthus leaves a very rare piece its all here nickys precious furniture over half a million dollars worth times two once for the insurance settlement twice when he sells it again its more than that though its his identity his ego his freaking shifting cloud what he killed his wife to hold on to his wife the two vietnamese kids george scollins god only knows who else for a pile of old wood for a bunch of fucking things even though he stood to make million and it would have been safer to burn this stuff nicky couldnt stand to do it and now its going to cost him fifty mil and his claim and everything else if jack has his way dawn at mother russias very happy place nicky pours himself a cup of coffee and sits trembling on a stool at the kitchen counter two million in cash and a big piece of nickys deal is what karpotsov wants to release mother or well start burning her karpotsov said well send you some of the charred pieces first a finger then well start getting serious then its a hand then a foot when were fresh out of

didnt you like to burn people ill get the money for you youd better karpotsov got off the bed well id like to see the end of the movie but im sure you have things to arrange like later dude he got up and left nicky had a very restful night closing his eyes he saw levs dome bobbing up and down in the water opening his eyes he saw them taking a torch and he spent most of the night pacing the house now this morning nicky loses it they came into the house where my children sleep and took my mother slams his hand on the kitchen counter temper temper he tells himself temper will do you no good

i have a million bucks worth of stuff which is also enough evidence to connect you to the arson and your wifes murder jack says what do you think im going to do silence for a second then nicky says im prepared to be reasonable im not one hundred thousand dollars nicky says cash thats cheap nicky im surprised at you onefifty nickel and dime two hundred thousand nicky says no make your offer drop your lawsuit jack says would that do it for you no jack says drop your claim if i had the furniture back you can get it back good after you confess that you burned the house and killed your wife long sigh from nicky we can still make a deal he says i already told you jack says i dont do deals nicky says ill be coming for you jack says bring your lunch and hangs up nicky slams his hand on the counter he feels someone behind him little michael is standing there is grandma gone he asks yes nicky says but is she all burned up too michael asks like mommy nicky freaks the sun starts burning off the marine layer so the world is coming clear and sharp as jack steps out of the old rec hall he checks the load in teddys pistol six shots left should be enough when they come theyll come through the old gate hell hear it creak open and then hell hear their steps nicky wont come alone hell have his hitters enough to take me out but not before i kill him jack slips the pistol in his waistband and waits letty del rio checks the load in her weapon and slips it back into the holster this is a tricky operation with one hand trickier still to drive but shes going to do it show up at nickys door like a badnews avon lady dingdong she finesses her coffee cup to the floor below her feet and starts the engine wondering where the hell jack is why didnt he show up never mind time to go see nicky dingdong the gate creaks open jack hears it scrape against the ground one set of footsteps coming up the path let it be nicky jack thinks he holds the pistol at his side pulls the hammer back and raises the gun gets a whiff of something in the wind the smell of a burning cigarette goddamn he tucks the pistol back under his shirt goddamn billy they stand there not looking at each other for a minute or so jack had forgotten how beautiful the view was from up here the palm trees the bougainvillea and jacaranda the wide stretch of white beach that sweeps up to the big rock at dana head has to be one of the most beautiful places in the world worth saving worth killing for it aint too late billy says for what for you to walk away billy says forget about what you seen here jack nods its too late he says how long have you been on their payroll a long time since the atlas warehouse billy nods nobody was supposed to die just a price buildup and a sale to the insurance company why billy money billy says you bust your ass for this company for dog bones while the agents make the big money and the underwriters take payoffs and the judges take bribes and the lawyers rake it in and we old dogs are just supposed to roll over for the table scraps the hell with that you set me up jack says you gave them my files you tipped them off to every move you jerked me like i was on a leash you knew everything to do everything to say to keep me pushing you let me walk deeper and deeper into the trap billy and you didnt say a word i had no choice jack billy says i had no goddamn choice everyone has a choice so make a good one for yourself billy says im here to offer you a deal jack you can still get on the boat with you and nicky billy laughs you still dont get it jack it aint nicky its mahogany row all the vps and the president they all got shares jack feels like the world is spinning shares in what billy gestures all around them in this jack great sunsets we own it like the worlds falling out from under him california fire and life he asks owns great sunsets owns the strands mahogany row me and some others billy says we all have shares nicky vale partners genius sheer freaking genius jack thinks the companys been taking a goddamn pounding billy says between the fires and the earthquakes and the fraud and the goddamn lawsuits the company was about to go belly up so instead of giving it all to the damn lawyers and the other crooks we decided to get a piece of it ourselves we made some deals started paying on some of the drivedowns the phony thefts the medical buildups the arsons and taking our cut on the other end pay out the money get it back in the form of shares in dummy companies the perfect way to loot your own company jack thinks pay bogus claims to yourself route the money through policyholders who then invest back into your dummy companies very slick and it works both ways the russian mob can put dirty money into real estate suffer a loss then get clean money back through the insurance company everybody wins except the legit policyholders who pay the premiums and dumbass honest claims dogs and the occasional victim like pamela vale its just a beautiful scam so they took it to the next level why dick around with little claims payments when you can hit the california litigation lottery set your own claims people up for bad faith suits and then force yourself into settlements an easy thing to do from billys position a bad decision here a fuckedup file there hed know where all the weaknesses were or hed put them there brilliant it had to stop sometime billy says siu digging around and the goddamn task force so we figured one last big payout and i was the perfect setup for a huge bad faith settlement jack thinks a whole big dogandpony show to justify paying out million so you hauled me out we was saving you up jack for twelve years give or take billy drops his cigarette butt on the dirt snuffs it out with his foot lights another and says we dumped a lot of money into great sunsets over the years but you assholes fought us to a standstill save the strands just about broke us when we decided we had to shut down we knew we had to make this one pay off you lured gordon into whipping up a class action so you could justify a huge payment to head it off jack says then pay the money to yourselves there you go billy says gordons dead nickyll get the million this morning and fifty million bucks will go into great sunsets and thatll be more than enough to bribe the councilmen and the lawyers and the judges enough capital to do all that and put up their shitty condos and ruin what small part of the coast they havent already destroyed how about casey jack asks he in on this nah sandra hansen billy shakes his head sandra hansen is a true believer so i need to know billy says you in or out jack i can offer you shares you can get a condo here maybe a town house surf all goddamn day what do i have to do nothin billy says thats the beauty of it you dont have to do a goddamn thing just walk away thats the deal thats the deal jack looks around him at the strand at the ocean a womans dead he says that wasnt supposed to happen billy says nicky lost his temper i suppose billy says so whats it gonna be jack sighs cant do it billy billy shakes his head god damn jack goddamn billy they stand there looking at each other then jack says ill let you go billy i wont make the call for a couple of hours you can be in mexico well thats nice of you billy says but you got it backwards im all thats keeping you alive right now shit jack i begged them for the chance to come talk to you before before what billy shakes his head and then whistles a few seconds later accidentally bentley comes waddling up with his gun out right behind him nicky vale carrying a gasoline can bentley walks around jack and takes the pistol from him i told you not to go dicking around didnt i he says jack shrugs as bentley pushes him inside the building nickys very wired jabbering something about afghanistan he goes into this riff about afghanistan and mujahedin they didnt want to give it up either he says to jack but they did have you ever seen a whirling dervish wait until you set one on fire youll see them whirl he stands in front of jack right in his face stares at him and says im a businessman i tried to treat you like a businessman i tried to do business with you but you wouldnt do it you had to be rigid you had to be unreasonable youve never seen the inside of a russian prison youve never lived in cold and filth youre a native californian youve never seen anything but the sunshine and cant you see thats all i want too a little slice of sunshine jack i need my things and i need the insurance settlement because i have to have that money i owe it to some people who are going to kill me and my entire family if they dont get it im telling you this so youll understand how serious i am jack what ive learned what i think we both have learned is that you cant walk away from your history but ive made mine work for me and your history can work for you too jack it can make you rich its not too late to turn back from what youve done we can reinvent ourselves again jack reinvent this moment we cant change the past but we can design the future we can make each other rich choose the california life not the fire jack this doesnt have to end in ashes it already has jack says nicky shakes his head all you have to do is tell me who if anyone you have told have you for instance told tom casey letty del rio other police the newspapers answer my fucking questions jack dont be an asshole jack tell him wade nicky is cranked up back on the rant you wont be dead when the flames hit you jack well start with your feet you wouldnt believe the pain the nerves down there then youll want to tell me then you might still have your life but i wouldnt think about getting on too many surfboards jack this is so unnecessary but im desperate jack im desperate i am as you would say strung out lev is dead they cut his head off and threw it into my mothers home where my children live dani is back there guarding my children because they already took my mother theyre going to kill her theyre going to burn her if this falls through so i need to know jack i will do it jack ill pour the what do you like to call it accelerant all over you and fling a match you wont die from smoke inhalation you wont die from carbon monoxide asphyxiation youll die from the flames from the fire swirling around you like pamela jack asks no not like pamela nicky says he looks to bentley and says open the lid let him smell the fumes jack smells them hard not to in the closed room i loved her jack nicky says i loved being inside her i used to drink from her she was sweetness and sunshine my children came from inside her my children but she was going to take that bitch was going to take everything from me she was going to drain me leave me with nothing she was going to get up in court and say things about me nicky is a womanizer nicky is a druggie nicky is a crook nicky is a gangster nicky sleeps with his mother which is not true not the way she meant it she was going to say those things she told me that i told her she would never divorce me she would never take my possessions my house my money my things my kids and she said that if she had to she would say all those things before she let my mother get her hands on the kids and fuck them up thats what she said quote flick them up but no i didnt burn her alive i didnt make her dance in flames writhe on our bed like the bitch used to except this time in flames i didnt do that because i loved her i just made her go to sleep i made her drink and take pills and when she was asleep in our bed i climbed on top of her she had the most graceful whitest neck i can remember the first time i kissed her neck i can remember the first time she took me inside her and her black hair against her neck can you remember that incredible warmth the ineffable heat the first time inside a woman i used to want her so badly it was like i was on fire and the bitch knew that she knew what she was doing cockteasing bitch should burn she deserves it but i dont do that im on top of her with a pillow thats amusing now that i recall it because she used to have me put a pillow under her ass so i could go deeper inside im on top of her with the pillow over her mouth shes unconscious but her hips jerk and strain her back arches up and then she goes quiet in my arms but i cant finish

the can again goddamn it billy says takes out his old and shoots bentley square in the gut the flash ignites the fumes which in turn ignite bentley hes on fire so he drops the can and the gas gurgles onto the floor and he forgets everything he learns in fire school and goes running out the door hes a screaming swirling ball of flame when he crumples onto the dry grass which is how accidentally bentley sets the great south coast fire accidentally jack doesnt know that hes still in the building and its on fire the gas pours out of the can spreading accelerant all over the floor and fumes in the air and the fumes ignite like wham and a column of flame shoots upward flame and smoke and darkness and jack loses sight of nicky vale all jack can see is goddamn billy heading not for the door but farther into the rec hall in toward the old kitchen and jacks thinking get out of here but hes also thinking get billy out of here too so he goes after him which is like stupid jack tells himself which is like dumb because all the old wood is igniting then the covers on the furniture ignite and the fucking furniture ignites the fire is free burning there are flames everywhere the place is filling up with smoke and that son of a bitch billy was going to set you up anyway so why are you going after him because youre a dog and thats what a dog does a dog doesnt leave jack drops down and stays low down where the air is and makes his way after billy into the kitchen the old kitchen where they used to cook up hamburgers and hot dogs and big pots of chili and theres goddamn billy standing by the old stainlesssteel counter lighting a cigarette come on jack yells we can get out of here maybe the ceilings on fire the roofs involved we can get out of here jack repeats no billy says puts the stick to his lips and takes a long drag billy i can get us out of here jack shouts if we go now his eyes are starting to tear up tear up and burn and he can feel the smoke scorching his throat looks behind him and sees the flames looks up and sees little tongues of flame start to lick the kitchen ceiling cant do it jack jack starts to cry goddamn it billy it could be seconds to flashover seconds till the fairies start flying and flashover happens and everything ignites we cant wait any longer billy i can carry you screaming because the noise of the fire is unbelievable the starving alligator in a feeding frenzy crunching on the old house billy shakes his head i cant face it jack ill lie for you billy ill say you had nothing to do with it come on tiny balls of flame dance in the air the fairies flying its no good jack to hell with arguing jack thinks ill knock the stubborn old fucker out if i have to he starts toward billy billy shakes his head and pulls his old from out of his jacket points it at jack then says goddamn it puts the barrel to his head and pulls the trigger as the fairies fly flashover outside the fire spreads quickly the wind picks up the flame like its been waiting for a lover and sweeps it across the dry grass into the trees and onto the roofs the whole sky on fire the sun setting over the ocean a ball of fire the ocean ablaze in reflected flame on land the sky a redandorange glow from the fire thats spreading blowing north from dana headlands up toward the ritz and monarch bay the fire sweeps across the headlands over the grass and brush then ignites the juicy eucalyptus trees which crackle and pop and it sounds like a million firecrackers going off the fire races on and ignites the trees that flank the ritz encircles the gates of the resort like a besieging army while another arm of the fire races across the top of salt creek beach pushing on toward monarch bay where it doesnt stop at the gate doesnt wait for the guard to buzz it in the wind pushes the flames through into the trees into the expensive landscaping burning up the trees building up the heat to ignite the roofs natalie and michael stand in their room looking out the window and watching the fire come toward them they cant see the flames from where they stand what they see is an orange sky turning blood red as the sun sets they can smell the smoke the acrid burning sensation in their eyes and noses and theyre scared mommy is all burned up daddy is gone again even grandma is nowhere to be seen theres nobody there but the men that daddy has around and theyre busy spraying water on the roof and theyre paying no attention and the sirens are screaming and people are yelling and voices from unseen loudspeakers are commanding in stern voices to evacuate and theres a yell from a dozen voices as a woodshake roof ignites and natalie struggles to remember if she knows what evacuate means as leo hops and twirls and barks the fire crackles in the tree outside the window like a voice from a bad dream and what natalie is thinking is this is how mommy died out on the street letty tries to get in but a cop stops her at the gate and tells her no entry to civilian vehicles and she yells i have children in there but they wont let her through so she gets out and leaves the car there and heads in on foot toward the house she runs toward the house as the trees hiss and pop over her head people in cars and on foot stream the other way past her here and there a house has gone up now the smoke is thick it would be dark but for the flames and then shes at the house its on fire flames dance on the roof natalie michael a fireman stops her from rushing in she fights him screaming there are two children in there theres no one in there there are two children in there she wrests herself free and runs toward the front door inside its all smoke heat and darkness jacks crawling through hell on his stomach on the floor down where theres a little air below where the fires burning on the counters he crawls feels his way on the walls praying he remembers where the door is the smoke the noise the heat then he feels the doorway it has to be an exterior door it has to be because if it isnt when he opens it the fire will blast back and blow him away but there isnt a choice so he pushes it open and then hes outside the grass is on fire shit it seems like all of california is on fire through the smoke he can just make out a figure nicky running down the bluff jack runs after him coughing struggling for breath jack chases him down to the beach runs after him along the beach he can feel his heart pounding hear the surf pounding almost in rhythm nickys starting to slow down and then jack catches him nicky whirls and throws a finger strike at jacks eye jack turns his head and the strike catches him off the side of his left eye opening a gash and for a second jack cant see but he lunges for where nickys neck should be and throws nicky down into the surf lands on top of him holds on to nickys throat and pushes him under a wave comes in breaks close to shore and sends a rush of swirling white water into jack but he holds on he feels nickys hands around his wrists pulling and jerking nickys legs kick out and up trying to get away but jack has him by the throat and isnt letting up even as another wave breaks and smashes into him he holds on holds nicky under nickys bucking and thrashing as jack thinks about the atlas warehouse fire and porfirio guzman and the two dead teenagers and george scollins and his own fuckedup life and he pushes nicky down harder until he can feel nickys back hit the rocks rolling in the trench the white water recedes and jack can see nickys face can see his eyes bulge and jack hears himself yelling you want a deal nicky heres your fucking deal hears himself yell that hears himself and lets up drags nicky out of the water by the back of his neck and drops him on the beach nicky coughing and sputtering and gasping for air and jack swears he can hear a damn dog barking he looks up the beach where the monarch bay community juts out from the coastline the trees are on fire chimneys going up jack starts running natalie holds michael tight keeping him warm shielding him from the cold salt spray coming off the waves evacuate the voice had said evacuate she remembered meant to get out so she grabbed michael and got out of the house even before the fire had spread from the tree to the roof out onto the lawn and then the street and all the people were headed out toward the highway the pacific coast highway but natalie decided that all the people were wrong because they seemed to be heading into the fire so natalie stopped and thought about it for a few seconds and decided that the safest place to be in a fire would be by water by the ocean and that way even if the fire burned all the way down to the beach they could always jump into the ocean and swim until the fire went out so she took leo under her arm and michael by the hand and led them down toward the beach down the steps toward salt creek beach where aunt letty had taken them boogie boarding and they had gone for picnics and looking for crabs and snails in the tidal pools because aunt letty will be looking for us natalie thinks and she will know to come here jacks running along the beach the bluffs above him on fire the peninsula of monarch bay smoking and the smoke is thickening its hard to see and he doesnt know how hes going to find michael and natalie and hes just hoping that they got out of there and then he hears this dog yipping the kids recognize him go to him because hes an adult they know here wheres my daddy michael asks black eyes big and full of tears natalie asks wheres aunt letty i dont know jack says has she been here natalie does a little pirouette of anxiety of course shes here jack thinks shes here for the same reason im here oh god i hope she didnt go to the house its going to be all right jack says holding them its going to be all right because people will lie their mom is dead their dad killed her and the last person who loved them is maybe looking for them where they arent namely in another burning house and waiting in the wings is mother russia but jack repeats its going to be all right he heads up for the house its on fire he goes in hard to see hard to breathe the house is filling with smoke letty letty he makes his way up the stairs to the kids room shes facedown on the bed oh no oh no he turns her over dont be dead please dont be dead shes unconscious but still breathing he picks her up and carries her down the stairs which are on fire too many flames too much smoke and she might not have the time so he plunges through it comes out the other side comes out the door into the smoky air and lays her down please dont die please dont die she starts to cough cough and then breathe and then her eyes open when she can speak she asks about the kids he picks her up again and carries her down the point to the beach when they get there nicky is standing with his kids his arms wrapped protectively around them jack leans in to him whispers something into his ear lets do a deal the next afternoon the sun is high and hot over a landscape burned black ashes still float in the mild breeze jack sits waiting in the front seat of a used pickup in the parking lot of dana strand beach letty sits beside him she chews on a broken fingernail hell be here jack says she nods and goes back to chewing her nail five long minutes go by and then jack sees the black mercedes snake around the curve of selva into the parking lot here they come he says the mercedes pulls alongside dani gets out nods and then nicky gets out of the car jack gets out of the truck they meet between the two cars we have a deal nicky asks you have your money dont you yes then we have part of a deal nicky nods then he hands jack the signed papers terminating his parental rights over natalie and michael tom casey drew up the papers so jack is confident theyre airtight he checks nickys signature and says looks okay to me nicky walks back to the mercedes the door opens and the kids come out blinking in the harsh sunlight natalie has leo under her arm nicky puts his arms around their shoulders and says daddys going to be very busy for the next little while so youre going to stay with aunt letty for a few months all right they nod and hug him and there are a few tears letty comes over and nicky ushers the children over to her take good care of them nicky says

peck on the cheek and a quick hug and gets into the truck starts it up and kicks it into gear before he has a chance to look back fires up a dick dale amp his deltones tape drives past the new sign set at the entrance to the strands pamela vale memorial park he points the truck south dani pulls the car over on the dirt turnout above dana strand nicky asks what dani shoots him through the groin the bullet pierces nickys spinal cord but hes conscious as dani gets out takes a can of gas from the trunk and pours it all around the car dani opens the back door hes crying as he rolls up nickys pant leg takes a knife and makes an incision above the two crosses tattoo behind nickys knee he slices the knife down and rips off the skin nicky cant feel it tears stream down danis face as he says if ever i transgress against vorovskoy zakon may i burn in hell he closes the door steps away and tosses the match then sticks his gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger mans sitting in a car and the cars on fire he doesnt get out flames lick at his legs and he doesnt get out just down the hill the pacific pounds on the rocks california fire and life jack wade sits on an old hobie longboard riding swells that refuse to become waves he watches a plume of smoke rise up from the beach the smoke means to him that hernando has fired up the grill and that the coals will be hot enough in a little while and that hell have to come and help hernando cook dinner for the tourists if there are any at the fishing camp usually there arent and then jack helps hernando work on the little lodge that hes putting up nothing fancy a little cinderblockandrebar job with a beamed roof but jack knows how to build it and hernando is happy for the help the rest of the time jack surfs or fishes or drives into town to buy supplies for the camp when the tourists are in hell cook them breakfasts of huevos rancheros or pancakes or any other damn thing they want and he makes lunches of fruit and chicken and cold cold beer in the evening he grills the fish theyve caught or the fish hes caught and after hes done cleaning up he grabs a beer and sits and listens to hernando sing the old canciones or if hernando doesnt feel like singing jack just lies in the bed of hernandos old pickup and listens to the dodgers game on the radio the weather reports talk about big rainstorms coming up in the north sometimes jack sits back and looks at some crayon drawings that come for uncle jack in hernandos mail at first they were of trees and houses on fire now they mostly show horses or kids on horses and the kids are usually smiling and the lady with them always has black hair jack thinks a lot about letty he thinks a lot about himself and letty with the kids he rarely thinks about california fire and life
