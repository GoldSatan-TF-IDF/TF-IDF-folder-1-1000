a fistful of charms kim harrison to the man who invariably says really okay instead of you want to do what one the solid thud of davids car door shutting echoed off the stone face of the eightstory building we had parked beside leaning against the gray sports car i shaded my eyes and squinted up at its aged and architecturally beautiful columns and fluted sills the uppermost floor was golden in the setting sun but here at street level we were in a chill shadow cincinnati had a handful of such landmark buildings most abandoned as this one appeared to be are you sure this is the place i asked then dragged the flat of my arms off the roof of his car the river was close i could smell the oil and gas mix of boats the top floor probably had a view though the streets were clean the area was clearly depressed but with a little attentionand a lot of moneyi could see it as one of the citys newest residential hot spots david set his worn leather briefcase down and reached into the inner pocket of his suit coat pulling out a sheaf of papers he flipped to the back then glanced at the distant corner and the street sign yes he said his soft voice tense but not worried tugging my little red leather jacket down i hiked my bag higher on my shoulder and headed to his side of the car heels clunking id like to say i was wearing my buttkicking boots in deference to this being a run but in reality i just liked them they went well with the blue jeans and black tshirt i had on and with the matching cap i looked and felt sassy david frowned at the chunkingor my choice of attire maybesteeling his features to bland acceptance when he saw me quietly laughing at him he was in his respectable work clothes somehow pulling off the mix of the threepiece suit and his shoulderlength wavy black hair held back in a subdued clip id seen him a couple of times in running tights that showed off his excellently maintained midthirties physiqueyumand a fulllength duster and cowboy hatvan helsing eat your heart outbut his somewhat small stature lost none of its presence when he dressed like the insurance claims adjuster he was david was kind of complex for a were i hesitated when i came even with him and together we eyed the building three streets over i could hear the shush of traffic but here nothing moved its really quiet i said holding my elbows against the chill of the midmay evening brown eyes pinched david ran a hand over his cleanshaven cheeks its the right address rachel he said peering at the top floor i can call to check if you want no this is cool i smiled with my lips closed hefting my shoulder bag and feeling the extra weight of my splat gun this was davids run not mine and about as benign as you could getadjusting the claim of an earth witch whose wall had cracked i wouldnt need the sleepytime charms i loaded my modified paint ball gun with but i just grabbed my bag when david asked me to come with him it was still packed from my last runstorming the back room of an illegal spammer god plugging him had been satisfying david pushed into motion gallantly gesturing me to go first he was older than i by about ten years but it was hard to tell unless you looked at his eyes shes probably living in one of those new flats theyre making above old warehouses he said heading for the ornate stoop i snickered and david looked at me what he said dark eyebrows rising i entered the building before him shoving the door so he could follow tight on my heels i was thinking if you lived in one it would still be a warehouse were house get it he sighed and i frowned jenks my old backup would have laughed guilt hit me and my pace faltered jenks was currently awol hiding out in some weres basement after id majorly screwed up by not trusting him but with spring here i could step up my efforts to apologize and get him to return the front lobby was spacious full of gray marble and little else my heels sounded loud in the tallceilinged space creeped out i stopped chunking and started walking to minimize the noise a pair of blackedged elevators were across the lobby and we headed for them david pushed the up button and rocked back i eyed him the corners of my lips quirking though he was trying to hide it i could see he was getting excited about his run being a field insurance adjustor wasnt the desk job one might think it was most of his companys clients were inderlanderswitches weres and the occasional vampireand as such getting the truth as to why a clients car was totaled was harder than it sounded was it from the teenage son backing it into the garage wall or did the witch down the street finally get tired of hearing him beep every time he left the drive one was covered the other wasnt and sometimes it took ah creative interviewing techniques to get the truth david noticed i was smiling at him and the rims of his ears went red under his dark complexion i appreciate you coming with me he said shifting forward as the elevator dinged and the doors opened i owe you dinner okay no problem i joined him in the murky mirrored lift and watched my reflection in the amber light as the doors closed id had to move an interview for a possible client but david had helped me in the past and that was far more important the trim were winced the last time i adjusted the claim of an earth witch i later found she had scammed the company my ignorance cost them hundreds of thousands i appreciate you giving me your opinion as to whether she caused the damage with a misuse of magic i tucked a loosely curling lock of red hair that had escaped my french braid behind an ear then adjusted my leather cap the lift was old and slow like i said no problem david watched the numbers counting up i think my boss is trying to get me fired he said softly this is the third claim this week to hit my desk that im not familiar with his grip on his briefcase shifted hes waiting for me to make a mistake pushing for it i leaned against the back mirror and smiled weakly at him sorry i know how that feels i had quit my old job at inderland security the is almost a year ago to go independent though it had been roughand still was occasionallyit was the best decision id ever made still he persisted the not unpleasant scent of musk growing as he turned to me in the confined space this isnt your job i owe you david let it go i said exasperated im happy to come out here and make sure some witch isnt scamming you its no big deal i do this stuff every day in the dark usually alone and if im lucky it involves running and screaming and my foot in somebodys gut the were smiled to show his flat blocky teeth you like your job dont you i smiled right back you bet i do the floor lurched and the doors opened david waited for me to exit first and i looked out onto the huge buildingsized room on the top floor the setting sun streamed in the ceilingtofloor windows shining on the scattered construction materials past the windows the ohio river made a gray sheen when finished this would be an excellent apartment my nose tickled at the scent of twobyfours and sanded plaster and i sneezed davids eyes went everywhere hello mrs bryant he said his deep voice echoing im david david hue from were insurance i brought an assistant with me he gave my tight jeans tshirt and red leather jacket a disparaging look mrs bryant i followed him farther in my nose wrinkling i think the crack in her wall might be from removing some of those supporting members i said softly like i said no problem mrs bryant david called again my thoughts went to the empty street and how far we were from the casual observer behind me the elevator doors slid shut and the lift descended a small scuff from the far end of the room sent a stab of adrenaline through me and i spun david was on edge too and together we laughed at ourselves when a slight figure rose from the couch set adjacent to a modern kitchen at the end of the long room the cupboards still wrapped in plastic mrs bryant im david hue as prompt as your last yearly review claims a masculine voice said the soft resonances sifting through the darkening air and very thoughtful to bring a witch with you to check your customers claim with tell me do you take that off your endoftheyear taxes or do you claim it as a business expense davids eyes were wide its a business expense sir i looked from david to the man ah david i take it thats not mrs bryant his grip on his briefcase shifting david shook his head i think its the president of the company oh i thought about that then thought about that some more i was getting a bad feeling about this david he put a hand on my shoulder and leaned in i think you should leave he said the worry in his brown eyes running right to my core recalling what hed said in the elevator about his boss gunning for him my pulse quickened david if youre in trouble im not leaving i said boots thumping as he hustled me to the lift his face was grim i can handle this i tried to twist from his grip then ill stay and help you to the car when its over he glanced at me i dont think so rachel but thanks the elevator opened still protesting i was ill prepared when david jerked me back my head came up and my face went cold crap the lift was full of weres in various levels of elegance ranging from armani suits and sophisticated skirt and top combos to jeans and blouses even worse they all had the collected confident pride of alpha wolves and they were smiling shit david had a big problem please tell me its your birthday i said and this is a surprise party a young were in a bright red dress was the last to step from the elevator tossing her thick length of black hair she gave me a onceover though sure of herself i could tell by her stance that at least she wasnt an alpha bitch this was getting weird alphas never got together they just didnt especially without their respective packs behind them its not his birthday the woman said cattily but i imagine hes surprised davids grip on my arm twitched hello karen he said caustically my skin crawled and my muscles tightened as the weres ringed us i thought of the splat gun in my bag then felt for a ley line but didnt tap it david couldnt pay me to leave now this looked like a lynching hi david the woman in red said satisfaction clear in both her voice and in her stance behind the alpha males you cant imagine how overjoyed i was to find you had started a pack davids boss was now there too and with quick and confident steps he moved between us and the elevator the tension in the room ratcheted up a notch and karen slinked behind him i hadnt known david long but id never seen this mix of anger pride and annoyance on him before there was no fear david was a loner and as such the personal power of an alpha held little sway over him but there were eight of them and one was his boss this doesnt involve her sir david said with a respectful anger let her leave davids boss lifted an eyebrow actually this has nothing to do with you my breath caught okay maybe i was the one with the problem thank you for coming david your presence is no longer needed the polished were said turning to the others he added get him out of here i took a heaving lungful of air with my second sight i reached for a ley line latching onto the one that ran under the university my concentration shattered when two men grabbed my arms hey i shouted as one ripped my shoulder bag off and sent it spinning to land against a stack of lumber let go of me i demanded unable to twist easily from their twin grips david grunted in pain and when i stomped on someones foot they shoved me down plaster dust puffed up choking me my breath whooshed out as someone sat on me my hands were pulled behind my back and i went still ow i complained blowing a red curl from my face i gave another squirm crap david was being dragged into the elevator he was still fighting them redfaced and wrathful his fists lashed out making ugly sounding thumps when he scored he could have wered to fight more viciously but there was a fiveminute downtime when he would be helpless get him out of here davids boss shouted impatiently and the doors shut there was a clunk as something hit the inside of the elevator and then the machinery started to lower the lift i heard a shout and the sounds of a fight that slowly grew muffled fear slid through me and i gave another wiggle davids boss turned his gaze to me strap her he said lightly my breath hissed in frantic i reached for the ley line again tapping it with a splinter of thought everafter energy flowed through me filling my chi and then the secondary spindle i could keep in my head pain struck through me when someone wrenched my right arm too far back the cool plastic of a zipstrip was jammed over one wrist snugged tight with a quick pull and a familiar ratcheting sound to leave the end dangling my face went cold as every last erg of everafter washed out of me the bitter taste of dandelions was on my lips stupid stupid witch son of a bitch i shouted and the weres sitting on me fell away i staggered to my feet and tried to wedge the flexible plasticwrapped band off me failing its core was charmed silver like in my longgone is issue cuffs i couldnt tap a line i couldnt do anything i seldom used my new ley line skills in defense and i hadnt been thinking of how easy they could be nullified utterly bereft of my magic i stood in the last of the amber light coming in the tall windows i was alone with a pack of alphas my thoughts zinged to mr rays pack and the wishing fish i had accidentally stolen from him and then me making the owners of the howlers baseball team pay for my time doing it ohcrap i had to get out of there davids boss shifted his weight to his other foot the sun spilled over him to glint on the dust on his dress shoes ms morgan isnt it he asked companionably i nodded wiping my palms off on my jeans plaster dust clung to me and i only made things worse i never took my eyes from him knowing it was a blatant show of dominance i had dealt a little with weres and none of them but david seemed to like me i didnt know why its a pleasure to meet you he said coming closer and pulling a pair of metalrimmed glasses from an inner pocket of his suit coat im davids boss you can call me mr finley perching the glasses on his narrow nose he took the stapled papers that karen smugly handed him forgive me if im a little slow he said peering at them my secretary usually does this he looked over the papers at me pen clicking open your pack number is what huh i said intelligently then stiffened as the ring of weres seemed to close in karen snickered and my face warmed mr finleys slight wrinkles bunched as he frowned youre davids alpha karen is challenging you for your place there is paperwork what is your pack number my mouth dropped open this wasnt about the rays or the howlers i was the sole member of davids pack yeah but it was just a paper relationship one designed so i could get my overly inflated insurance cheap cheap cheap and david could keep his job and buck the system to continue working alone and without a partner he didnt want a real pack being a confirmed loner and good at it but it was nearly impossible to fire an alpha which was why he had asked me to start a pack with him my gaze darted to karen smiling like the queen of the nile as dark and exotic as an egyptian whore she wanted to challenge me for my position oh hell no i said and karen snorted thinking i was afraid im not fighting her david doesnt want a real pack obviously karen scorned i claim ascension before eight packs i claim it there werent eight alphas there anymore but i thought the five that were left were more than enough to force the issue mr finley let the hand holding the sheet of papers fall does anyone have a catalog she doesnt know her pack number i do sang out a woman swinging her purse around and digging to bring out what looked like a small address book new edition she added and thumbed it open this is nothing personal mr finley said your alpha has become the topic of interest at the water cooler and this is the simplest way to get david back on track and end the disturbing rumors that have been reaching me i have invited the principal shareholders in the company as witnesses he smiled without warmth this will be legally binding this is crap i said nastily and the surrounding weres either chuckled or gasped at my temerity to swear at him lips pressed tight i glanced at my bag and the splat gun halfway across the room my hand touched the small of my back looking for my nonexistent cuffs long gone with my is paycheck god i missed my cuffs here it is the woman said her head lowered rachel morgan och af you registered in cincinnati davids boss asked idly writing it down folding the pages over he fixed on my eyes david isnt the first to start a pack with someone not of ah were descent he finally said but he is the first in this company to do so with the sole intent to save his job this is not a good trend challengers choice karen said reaching for the tie to her dress i choose to were first davids boss clicked the pen shut then lets get started someone grabbed my arms and i froze for three heartbeats challengers choice my grandmothers ass i had five minutes to subdue her while she wered or i was going to lose this i silently twisted going down and rolling there were several shouts when i knocked the feet out from whoever held me then my breath was crushed out of my lungs as someone else fell on me adrenaline surged painfully someone pinned my legs another pushed my head into the plasterdustcovered plywood they wont kill me i told myself as i spit the hair out of my mouth and tried to get a decent breath this is some asinine were dominance thing and they wont kill me thats what i was telling myself but it was hard to convince my trembling muscles a low snarl far deeper than it ought to have been rumbled thorough the empty top floor and the three men holding me let me up what in hell i thought as i scrambled to my feet then stared karen had wered she had wered in thirty seconds flat how i stammered not believing it karen made one hell of a wolf as a person she was petite maybe pounds but turn that same pounds into snarling animal and you get a wolf the size of a pony damn a steady growl of discontent came from her lips curling from her muzzle in a warning older than dirt silky fur reminiscent of her black hair covered her except for her ears which were rimmed in white beyond the circle were her clothes discarded into a pile on the plywood floor the faces ringing me were solemn it wasnt a street brawl but a serious affair that would be as binding as a legal document around me the weres were backing up enlarging the circle double damn mr finley smiled knowingly at me and my gaze darted from him to the surrounding alphas in their nice clothes and fivehundreddollar shoes my heart hammered and i figured it out i was in deep shit they had bound themselves into a round frightened i eased into a fighting stance when weres bound themselves together outside their usual packs weird stuff happened id seen this once before at a howlers game when several alphas had united to support an injured player taking on the players pain so he could go on to win the game illegal but wickedly hard to prove since picking out the alphas responsible in a huge stadium was next to impossible the effect was temporary since weres especially alphas couldnt seem to work under anyones direction for long but they would be able to hold it together long enough for karen to hurt me really really bad i settled my feet more firmly in their boots feeling my fists begin to sweat this wasnt fair damn it they took my magic away so the only thing i could do would be to try to beat her off but she wasnt going to feel a thing i was toast i was dog chow i was going to be really sore in the morning but i wasnt going to go down without a fight karens ears went back it was the only warning i got instinct overpowered training and i backpedaled as she lunged teeth snapping where my face would have been we went down her paws on my chest the floor slammed into me and i grunted hot dog breath hit my face and i kneed her trying to knock her breath away there was a startled yip and dull claws raked my side as she scrambled up and back i stayed down rolling to my knees so she couldnt push me over again not waiting she jumped i cried out stiffarming her panic struck me when my fist went right square into her mouth her paws the size of my hands pushed at me as she frantically backed off and i fell backward i was lucky she hadnt twisted her head and taken a chunk out of my arm as it was i was bleeding from a nasty gash karens echoing racking coughs turned into an aggressive growl whats the matter grandma i panted flipping my braid out of the way cant get little red riding hood down your throat ears pinned hackles raised and lips curled to show her teeth she came at me okay maybe that wasnt the best thing to say karen slammed into me like a flung door rocking me back and sending me down her teeth went around my neck choking i grabbed the foot that was pinching me digging my nails into it she bit down and i gasped i made a fist and punched her in the ribs twice my knee came up and i got her somewhere there was silky hair in my mouth and i reached up and pulled an ear her teeth gripped harder cutting off my air my sight started to go black panicking i went for her eyes with no thought but survival i dug my nails into her eyelids that she felt and yelping she jerked off me i took a ragged breath levering myself up on an elbow my other hand went to my neck it came away wet with blood this isnt fair i shouted mad as hell as i scrambled up my knuckles were bleeding my side hurt and i was shaking from adrenaline and fear i could see mr finleys excitementsmell the rising musk they were all getting off on the chance to see one of their own legally maul a person nobody said it was supposed to be fair the man said softly then gestured to karen but her impetus to attack hesitated at the ding of the elevator despair crept over me with three more alphas she wasnt going to feel anything not even if i cut something off the doors slid open to show david leaning against the back of the lift his face had a bruise that was likely going to turn his eye black and his sport coat was torn and filthy slowly he lifted his head a murderous look in his brown eyes leave his boss said sharply i forgot my briefcase he said limping forward he took in the situation in a glance still breathing heavily from escaping the three weres who had dragged him off you challenge my alpha im damn well going to be here to make sure its a fair fight shambling to his briefcase he picked it up dusted it off and turned to me rachel you doing okay i felt a flush of gratitude he wasnt coming to my rescue he wanted to make sure they were playing fair im doing okay i said voice cracking but that bitch isnt feeling any pain and they took away my magic i was going to lose this i was going to lose this so bad sorry david the surrounding weres glanced uneasily at each other now that they had a witness and mr finleys complexion darkened finish it he said roughly and karen came at me her nails scraped on the plywood floor as they scrambled for purchase gasping i fell to my back before she could push me down pulling my knees to my chest i planted my feet against her as she landed on me and flung her over my head i heard a startled yip and thump and david shouting something there were two fights going on i spun on my butt to face her my eyes widened and i flung up an arm karen smashed into me pinning me to the floor she covered me and fear stabbed deep i had to keep her from getting a grip on my throat again and i cried out when she bit my arm id had enough making a fist i smashed it into her head she jerked her muzzle up raking my arm and sending a pulse of pain through me immediately she was back snarling and more savage but a ribbon of hope rose in me and i gritted my teeth she had felt that i could hear thumps and cries in the background david was interfering breaking their concentration the round was falling apart i couldnt best karen but sure as hell she was going to walk away remembering me the anger and excessive adrenaline wouldnt be denied you stupid dog i shouted slamming my fist into her ear again to make her yelp youre a foulbreathed dung flop of a citybred poodle how do you like this huh i hit her again unable to see from the tears blurring my vision want some more how about this she latched onto my shoulder and picked me up intending to shake me a silky ear landed in my mouth and after failing to spit it out i bit down hard karen barked and was gone taking a clean breath i rolled over onto all fours to see her rachel david cried and my splat ball gun slid to within my grasp i picked the cherryred gun up and on my knees aimed it at karen she sat back her forelegs scrambling to halt her forward motion arms shaking i spit out a tuft of white fur game over bitch i said then plugged her the puff of air from my gun was almost lost in someones cry of frustration it hit her square in the nose covering her face with a sleepytime potion the most aggressive thing a white witch would use karen went down as if strings were cut sliding to land three feet from me i rose shaking and so full of adrenaline i could hardly stand arms stiff i aimed my gun at mr finley the sun had gone behind the surrounding hills across the river and his face was shadowed his posture was easy enough to read i win i said then smacked david when he put a hand on my shoulder easy rachel david soothed im fine i shouted pulling my aim back to his boss before the man could move if you want to challenge my title okay but i do it as a witch not with my strength washed out of me this wasnt fair and you know it come on rachel lets go i was still aiming at his boss i really really wanted to plug him but in what i thought was a huge show of class i lowered the gun snatching my bag from david as he handed it to me around me i felt an easing of tension from the watching alphas briefcase in hand david escorted me to the elevator i was still shaking but i turned my back on them knowing it would say more clearly than words that i wasnt afraid i was scared though if karen had been trying to kill me not just cow me into submission it would have been over in the first thirty seconds david hit the down button and together we turned this was not a fair contest he said then wiped his mouth to make his hand come away red with blood i had a right to be here mr finley shook his head either the females alpha shall be present or in the case of his absence six alphas may serve as witness to prevent anyhe smiled foul play there werent six alphas here at the time of the contest david said i expect to see this recorded as a win for rachel that woman is not my alpha i followed his gaze to karen lying forgotten on the floor and i wondered if someone was going to douse her in saltwater to break the charm or just dump her on her packs doorstep unconscious i didnt care and i wasnt going to ask wrong or not its the law mr finley said the alphas moving to back him and its there to allow a gentle correction when an alpha goes astray he took a deep breath clearly thinking this will be recorded as a win for your alpha he said as if he didnt care provided you dont file a complaint but david she isnt a were if she cant best another with her physical skills she doesnt deserve an alpha title and will be taken down i felt a stab of fear at the memory of karen on top of me a person cant stand against a wolf mr finley said she would have to were to have even a chance and witches cant were the mans eyes went to mine and though i didnt look away the fear slid to my belly the elevator dinged and i backed up into it not caring if they knew i was afraid david joined me and i gripped my bag and my gun as if id fall apart without them davids boss stepped forward his presence threatening and his face utterly shadowed in the new night you are an alpha he said as if correcting a child stop playing with witches and start paying your dues the doors slid shut and i slumped against the mirror paying his dues what was that supposed to mean slowly the lift descended my tension easing with every floor between us it smelled like angry were in there and i glanced at david one of the mirrors was cracked and my reflection looked awful braid falling apart and caked with plaster dust a bite mark on my neck where karens teeth had bruised and broken my skin my knuckles scraped from being in her mouth my back hurt my foot was sore and damn it i was missing an earring my favorite hoops too i remembered the soft feel of karens ear in my mouth and the sudden give as i bit down it had been awful hurting someone that intimately but i was okay i wasnt dead nothing had changed id never tried to use my ley line skills in a pitched fight like that and now i knew to watch out for wristbands caught like a teenager shoplifting god help me i licked my thumb and wiped a smear of plaster dust off my forehead the wristband was ugly but id need ivys bolt cutters to get it off removing my remaining earring i dropped it in my bag david was leaning into the corner and holding his ribs but he didnt look like he was worried about running into the three weres he had downed so i put my gun away lone wolves were like alphas that didnt need the support of a pack to feel confident rather dangerous when one stopped to think about it david chuckled looking at him i made a face and he started to laugh cutting it short as he winced in pain his lightly wrinkled face still showing his amusement he glanced at the numbers counting down then pulled himself upright trying to arrange his torn coat how about that dinner he asked and i snorted im getting the lobster i said then added weres never work together outside their packs i must have really pissed them off god what is their problem its not you its me he said discomfited they dont like that i started a pack with you no thats not true they dont like that im not contributing to the were population the adrenaline was fading making me hurt all over i had a pain amulet in my bag but i wasnt going to use it when david had nothing and when in hell had karen scored on my face tilting my head i examined the red claw mark running close to my ear in the dim light then turned to david when his last words penetrated excuse me i asked confused what do you mean not contributing to the were population david dropped his gaze i started a pack with you i tried to straighten but it hurt yeah i got the nokids part there why do they care because i dont have any ah informal relations with any other were woman either because if he did they would expect to be in his pack eventually and i prompted he shifted from foot to foot the only way to get more weres is by birth not like vampires who can turn humans if they work at it with numbers come strength and powerhis voice trailed off and i got it oh for crying out loud i complained holding my shoulder this was political the elevator chimed and the doors opened fraid so he said they let subordinate weres do what they will but as a loner what i do matters i trooped out before him looking for trouble but it was quiet in the abandoned lobby apart from the three weres slumped in the corner david had sounded bitter and when he opened the main door for me i touched his arm in a show of support clearly surprised he glanced at me uh about dinner he said looking at his clothes you want to reschedule my feet hit the pavement the cadence of my boots telling me i was limping it was quiet but the stillness seemed to hold a new threat mr finley was right about one thing this was going to happen again unless i asserted my claim in a way they would respect breathing deeply of the chill air i headed for davids car no way man you owe me dinner how about some skyline chili i said and he hesitated in confusion go through the drivethrough i have to do some research tonight rachel he protested as his car gave a cheerful chirp and unlocked i think you deserve at least one night off his eyes narrowed and he looked at me over the roof of his car i am really sorry about this maybewe should get the pack contract annulled i looked up from opening my door dont you dare i said loudly in case someone was listening from a top floor then my expression went sheepish i cant afford the rider everyone else makes me take out on my health insurance david chuckled but i could tell he wasnt satisfied we slipped into his car both of us moving slowly when we found new pains and tried to find a comfortable way to sit oh god i hurt all over i mean it rachel he said his low voice filling the small car after our doors shut its not fair to ask you to put up with this crap smiling i looked across the car at him dont worry about it david i like being your alpha all i have to do is find the right charm to were with he sighed his small frame moving in his exhalation then he snorted what i asked buckling myself in as he started the car the right charm to were he said putting the car into gear and pulling from the curb get it you want to be my alpha but have nothing to were putting a hand to my head i leaned my elbow into the door for support thats not funny i said but he just laughed even though it hurt him two dappled patterns of afternoon light sifted over my gloved hands as i knelt on a green foam pad and strained to reach the back of the flower bed where grass had taken root despite the shade of the mature oak above it from the street came the soft sound of cars a blue jay called and was answered saturday in the hollows was the pinnacle of casual straightening i stretched to crack my back then slumped wincing when my amulet lost contact with my skin and i felt a jolt of pain i knew i shouldnt be working out there under the influence of a pain amulet lest i hurt myself without realizing it but after yesterday i needed some dirt time to reassure my subconscious that i was alive and the garden needed attention it was a mess without jenks and his family keeping it up the smell of brewing coffee slipped out the kitchen window and into the peace of the cool spring afternoon and i knew that ivy was up standing i gazed from the yellow clapboard addon behind the rented church to the walled graveyard past the witchs garden the entire grounds took up four city lots and stretched from one street to the other behind it though no one had been buried here for almost thirty years the grass was mown by yours truly i felt a tidy graveyard made a happy graveyard wondering if ivy would bring me coffee if i shouted i nudged my knee pad into the sun near a patch of softstemmed black violets jenks had seeded the plot last fall and i wanted to thin them before they got spindly from competition i knelt before the small plants moving my way around the bed circling the rosebush and pulling a third of them i had been out there long enough to get warm from exertion worry waking me before noon sleep hadnt come easily either id sat up past sunrise in the kitchen with my spell books in search of a charm to were into a wolf it was a task whose success was slim at best there were no spells to change into sentient beingsat least no legal ones and it would have to be an earth charm since ley line magic was mostly illusion or physical bursts of energy i had a small but unique library yet for all my spells and charms i had nothing that told me how to were inching my pad down the flower bed i felt a band of worry tighten in me as david had said the only way you could be a were was to be born that way the bandagecovered tooth gashes on my knuckles and neck from karen would soon be gone with no lingering effects but for what remained in my memory there might be a charm in the black arts section of the library but black earth magic used nasty ingredientslike indispensable people partsand i wasnt going to go there the one time i had considered using black earth magic i came away with a demon mark then got another then managed to find myself said demons familiar lucky for me i had kept my soul and the bargain was declared unenforceable i was free and clear but for big als original demon mark which id wear along with newts mark until i found a way to pay both of them back but at least with the familiar bond broken al wasnt showing up every time i tapped a ley line eyes pinched from the sun i smeared dirt over my wrist and als demon mark the earth was cool and it hid the upraised circleandline scar more reliably than any charm it covered the red welt from the band the weres had put on me too god i had been stupid the breeze shifted a red curl to tickle my face and i tucked it away glancing past the rosebush to the back of the flower bed my lips parted in dismay it had been trampled an entire section of plants had been snapped at their bases and were now sprawled and wilting tiny footprints gave evidence of who had done it outraged i gathered a handful of broken stems feeling in the soft pliancy their unstoppable death damn garden fairies hey i shouted lurching up to stare into the canopy of the nearby ash tree face warm i stomped over and stood under it the plants in my hand like an accusation id been fighting them since theyd migrated up from mexico last week but it was a losing battle fairies ate insects not nectar like pixies did and they didnt care if they killed a garden in their search for food they were like humans that way destroying what kept them alive in the long term in their search for shortterm resources there were only six of them but they had no respect for anything i said hey i called louder craning my neck to the wad of leaves that looked like a squirrels nest midway up the tree i told you to stay out of my garden if you couldnt keep from wrecking it what are you going to do about this as i fumed on the ground there was a rustling and a dead leaf fluttered down a pale fairy poked his head out the leader of the small bachelor clan orienting on me immediately its not your garden he said loudly its my garden and you can take a long walk in a short ley line for all i care my mouth dropped open from behind me came the thump of a window closing ivy didnt want anything to do with what was to follow i didnt blame her but it was jenkss garden and if i didnt drive them out it would be trashed by the time i convinced him to come back i was a runner damn it if i couldnt keep jenkss garden intact i didnt deserve the title but it was getting harder each time and they only returned the moment i went inside dont ignore me i shouted as the fairy disappeared inside the communal nest you nasty little twit a cry of outrage slipped from me when a tiny bare ass took the place of the pale face and shook at me from the wad of leaves they thought they were safe up there out of my reach disgusted i dropped the broken stems and stalked to the shed they wouldnt come to me so i would go to them i had a ladder the blue jays in the graveyard called enjoying something new to gossip about while i struggled with the twelvefoot length of metal it smacked into the lower branches as i maneuvered it against the trunk and with a shrill protest the nest emptied in an explosion of blue and orange butterfly wings i put a foot on the first rail puffing a red curl out of my eyes i hated to do this but if they ruined the garden jenkss kids would starve now came a loud demand and i cried out when sharp pings pinched my back cowering i ducked my head and spun the ladder slipped crashing down into the very flower bed they had destroyed ticked i looked up they were lobbing last years acorns at me the sharp ends hard enough to hurt you little boogers i cried glad i had on a pain amulet again the leader shouted my eyes widened at the handful of acorns coming at me rhombus i said the trigger word instigating a hardlearned series of mental exercises into an almost instinctive action quicker than thought my awareness touched the small ley line in the graveyard energy filled me the balance equalizing in the time between memory and action i spun around toe pointing sketching a rough circle and ley line force filled it closing it i could have done this last night and avoided a trouncing but for the charmed silver they had put on me a shimmering band of everafter flashed into existence the moleculethin sheet of alternate reality arching to a close over my head and six feet under my feet making an oblong bubble that prevented anything more obnoxious than air to pass through it was sloppy and wouldnt hold a demon but the acorns pinged off it it worked against bullets too knock it off i exclaimed flustered the usual red sheen of energy shifted to gold as it took on the main color of my aura seeing me safe but trapped in my bubble the largest fairy fluttered down on his mothlike wings his hands on his narrow hips and his gossamer spiderwebdraped hair making him look like a sixinch negative of the grim reaper his lips were a stark red against his pale face and his thin features were tight in determination his harsh beauty made him look incredibly fragile but he was tougher than sinew he was a garden fairy not one of the assassins that had almost killed me last spring but he was still accustomed to fighting for his right to live go inside and we wont hurt you he said leering i snickered what were they going to do butterfly kiss me to death an excited whisper pulled my attention to the row of neighborhood kids watching from over the tall wall surrounding the graveyard their eyes were wide while i tried to best tiny little flying things something every inderlander knew was impossible crap i was acting like an ignorant human but it was jenkss garden and id hold them off as long as i could resolute i pushed out of my circle i jerked as the energy of the circle raced back into me overflowed my chi and returned to the ley line a shrill cry came to ready the darts darts oh swell pulse quickening i ran to the far side of the kitchen for the hose i tried to be nice i tried to be reasonable i muttered while i opened the valve and water started dripping from the spray nozzle the blue jays in the graveyard called and i struggled with the hose jerking to a halt when it caught on the corner of the kitchen taking off my gloves i snapped the hose into a sine wave it came free and i stumbled backward from the ash tree came the highpitched sounds of organization id never hosed them off before maybe this would do it fairy wings didnt do well when wet get her came a shout and i jerked my head up the thorns they held looked as large as swords as they headed right for me gasping i aimed the hose and squeezed they darted up and i followed them my lips parting when the water turned into a pathetic trickle to arch to the ground and die what in hell i spun at the sound of gushing water they had cut the hose i spent twenty bucks on that hose i cried then felt myself pale as the entire clan fronted me tiny spears probably tipped with poison ivy er can we talk about this i stammered i dropped the hose and the orangewinged fairy grinned like a vampire stripper at a bachelorette party my heart pounded and i wondered if i should flee inside the church and subject myself to ivys laughter or tough it out and get a bad case of poison ivy the sound of pixy wings brought my heart into my throat jenks i exclaimed turning to follow the head fairys worried gaze fixed beyond my shoulder but it wasnt jenks it was his wife matalina and eldest daughter jih back off matalina threatened hovering beside me at head height the harsh clatter of her more maneuverable dragonflylike wings set the stray strands of my damp hair to tickle my face she looked thinner than last winter her childlike features severe determination showed in her eyes and she held a drawn bow with an arrow at the string her daughter looked even more ominous with a woodhandled sword of silver in her grip she had possession of a small garden across the street and needed silver to protect it and herself since she had yet to take a husband its mine the fairy screamed in frustration two women cant hold a garden i need only hold the ground i fly over matalina said resolutely get out now he hesitated and matalina pulled the bow back farther making a tiny creak well only take it when you leave he cried motioning for his clan to retreat then take it she said but while i am here you wont be i watched awed while a fourinch pixy stood down an entire clan of fairies such was jenkss reputation and such was the capabilities of pixies they could rule the world by assassinations and blackmail if they wanted but all they desired was a small plot of ground and the peace to tend it thanks matalina i whispered she didnt take her steely gaze off them as they retreated to the kneehigh wall that divided the garden from the graveyard thank me when ive watered seedlings with their blood she muttered shocking me the pretty silkclad pixy looked all of eighteen her usual tan pale from living with jenks and her children in that weres basement all winter her billowy green lightweight dress swirled in the draft from her wings they were a harsh red with anger as were her daughters the faire of garden fairies fled to a corner of the graveyard hovering and dancing in a belligerent display over the dandelions almost a street away matalina pulled her bow loosing an arrow on an exhale a bright spot of orange jerked up and then down did you get him her daughter asked her ethereal voice frightening in its vehemence matalina lowered her bow i pinned his wing to a stone he tore it when he jerked away something to remember me by i swallowed and nervously wiped my hands on my jeans the shot was clear across the property steadying myself i went to the faucet and turned off the spraying water matalina i said as i straightened bobbing my head at her daughter in greeting thanks they almost filled me with poison ivy how are you hows jenks will he talk to me i blurted but my brow furrowed and my hope fell when she dropped her eyes im sorry rachel she settled upon my offered hand her wings shifting into motion then stilling as they turned a dismal blue heithats why im here oh god is he all right i said suddenly afraid when the pretty woman looked ready to burst into tears her ferocity had been washed away in misery and i glanced at the distant fairies while matalina struggled for her composure he was dead jenks was dead rachel she warbled looking all the more like an angel when she wiped a hand under her eye he needs me and he forbade the children to return especially now my first wash of relief that he was alive spilled right back to worry and i glanced at the butterfly wings they were getting closer lets go inside i said ill make you up some sugar water matalina shook her head bow hanging from her grip beside her her daughter watched the graveyard thank you she said ill make sure jihs garden is safe then ill be back i looked to the front of the church as if i could see her garden on the opposite side of the street jih looked eight but in pixy years she was old enough to be on her own and was actively searching for a husband finding herself in the unique situation of being able to take her time as she developed her own garden holding it with silver given to her by her father and seeing that they had just evicted a clan of fairies making sure there was no one waiting to jump jih when she returned home sounded like a good idea okay i said and matalina and jih rose a few inches sending the scent of green things to me ill wait inside just come on in ill be in the kitchen in a soft clatter they flitted up and over the tall steeple and i watched concerned things were probably tough for them while jenkss pride kept them out of their garden and they struggled to make ends meet what was it with small men and oversized pride checking to see that my bandages hadnt come off my knuckles i stomped up the wooden steps and wedged my gardening sneakers off leaving them there i went in the back door and into the living room the smell of coffee was almost a slap a set of masculine boots clattered on the linoleum in the kitchen across the hall and i hesitated that wasnt ivy kisten curious i padded to the kitchen hesitating in the open archway i scanned the apparently empty room i liked my kitchen no let me rephrase i loved my kitchen with the loyalty of a bulldog to his favorite bone it took up more space than the living room and had two stovesso i never had to stir spells and cook on the same flame there were bright fluorescent lights expansive counter and cupboard space and sundry ceramic spelling utensils hanging over the center island counter an oversized brandy snifter with my beta mr fish rested on the sill of the single bluecurtained window over the sink a shallow circle was etched in the linoleum for when i needed the extra protection for a sensitive spell and herbs hung from a sweater rack in the corner a heavy antique farm table took up the interior wall my end holding a stack of books that hadnt been there earlier the rest held ivys precisely arranged computer printer maps colored markers and whatever else she needed to plan her runs into boredom my eyebrows rose at the pile of books but i smiled because of the jeansclad backside poking out from the open stainlesssteel fridge door kist i said the pleased sound of my voice bringing the living vamps head up i thought you were ivy hi love he said the british accent he usually faked almost nonexistent as he casually shut the door with a foot hope you dont mind i let myself in i didnt want to ring the bell and wake the dead i smiled and he set the cream cheese on the counter and moved to me ivy wasnt dead yet but she was as nasty as a homeless bridge troll if you woke her before she thought she should be up mmmm you can let yourself in anytime so long as you make me coffee i said curving my arms around his tapering waist as he gave me a hug hello his closecut fingernails traced an inch above the new bruises and tooth marks on my neck are you okay he breathed my eyes slid shut at the concern in his voice he had wanted to come over last night and i appreciated that he hadnt when i asked him not to im fine i said toying with the idea of telling him that they hadnt played fair five alphas binding into a round to give their bitch the advantage in an already unfair fight but it was so unusual an occurrence that i was afraid he would say i was making it upand it sounded too much like whining to me instead i leaned my head against him and took in his scent a mix of dark leather and silk he was wearing a black cotton tee that pulled tight across his shoulders but the aroma of silk and leather remained with it was the dusky hint of incense that lingered around vampires i hadnt identified that particular scent with vamps until i started living with ivy but now i could probably tell with my eyes closed whether it was ivy or kisten in the room either scent was delicious and i breathed deeply willingly taking in the vampire pheromones he was unconsciously giving off to soothe and relax me it was an adaptation to make finding a willing source of blood easier not that kisten and i were sharing blood not me not this little witch no how or ever the risk of becoming a playthingmy will given to a vampirewas too real but that didnt mean i couldnt enjoy the mild buzz i could hear his heartbeat and i lingered while his fingers traced a yummy path to the small of my back my forehead came to his shoulder lower than usual since he was in boots and i was in socks his exhaled breath stirred my hair the sensation brought my head up and i met his blue eyes squarely from under his long bangs reading in the normalsized pupils that he had slaked his blood lust before coming over he usually did i like it when you smell like dirt he said his eyes halflidded and sly smiling i ran a fingernail down his rough cheek he had a small nose and chin and he usually kept a days worth of stubble to give himself a more rugged cast his hair was dyed blond to match his almostbeard though i had yet to catch him with darker roots or a charm to color it whats the real color of your hair i asked impulsively as i played with the wispy strands at the nape of his neck he pulled away blinking in surprise two slices of toast popped up and he shifted to the counter bringing out a plate and setting the bread on it ah its blond my eyes roved over his very nice backside and i slumped against the counter enjoying the view the rims of his ears were a faint red and i pushed into motion leaning to run a finger along his torn ear where someone had ripped out one of the twin diamond studs his right ear still held both studs and i wondered who had the missing earring i would have asked but was afraid hed tell me ivy had it you dye your hair i insisted what color is it really he wouldnt look at me while he opened the cream cheese and spread a thick layer on the toast its sort of brown why is that a problem dropping my hands to his waist i turned him around pinning him to the counter i leaned until our hips touched god no i just wondered oh his hands went about my waist and clearly relieved he inhaled slowly seeming to take my very soul in with him a spark of desire jumped from him to me going right to my core to catch my breath i knew he was scenting me reading in the slight tension of my body pressing into him my willingness to turn our embrace into something more i knew our natural scents mixing was a potent blood aphrodisiac i also knew ivy would kill him if he broke my skin even by accident but this was all old news and id be a fool if i didnt admit that part of kistens allure was the mix of deep intimacy he offered along with the potential danger of him losing control and biting me yeah i was a stupid trusting girl but it made for great sex and kisten is very careful i thought pulling coyly away at the low growl rumbling up through him he wouldnt have come over if he wasnt sure of his control and i knew he teased himself with my offlimits blood as much as i tested my will against the supposedly betterthansex carnal ecstasy that a vampire bite could bring i see youre making friends with your neighbors he said and i eased from him to reopen the window and wash my hands if i didnt stop ivy would sense it and be out here glowering like a shunned lover we were roommates and business partnersthat was allbut she made no attempt to hide that she wanted more she had asked me once to be her scion which was sort of a numberone helper and wielder of vampire power when the vamp in question was limited by sunlight she wasnt dead yet and didnt need a scion but ivy was a planner the position was an honor but i didnt want it even though as a witch i couldnt be turned vampire it involved an exchange of blood to cement ties which was why i had flatly refused her the first time shed asked but after meeting her old high school roommate i thought she was after more than that kisten could separate the drive for blood from the desire for sex but ivy couldnt and the sensations a bloodlusting vamp pulled from me were too much like sexual hunger for me to think otherwise ivys offer that i become her scion was also an offer to be her lover and as much as i cared for her i wasnt wired that way i turned off the tap and dried my hands on the dish towel frowning at the butterfly wings drifting closer to the garden you could have helped me out there i said sourly me blue eyes glinting in amusement he set the orange juice on the counter and shut the fridge rachel honey i love you and all but what do you think i could have done tossing the dish towel to the counter i turned my back on him crossing my arms while i gazed out at the cautiously approaching wings he was right but that didnt mean i had to like it i was lucky matalina had shown up and i wondered again what she wanted a warm breath touched my shoulder and i jerked realizing kisten had snuck up on me unheard with his vampsoft steps i would have come out if you needed it he said his rumbly voice going right into me but they were only garden fairies yeah i said with a sigh i suppose turning my eyes went over his shoulder to the three books on the table are those for me i asked wanting to change the subject kisten reached past me to pluck an early daisy from the vase beside mr fish piscary had them behind glass they look like spell books to me i thought you might find something to were in them theyre yours if you want them im not going to tell him where they went his eyes were eager for the chance to help me but i didnt move standing beside the sink with my arms crossed eyeing them if the master vampire had them under glass then they were probably older than the sun even worse they had the look of demon magic making them useless since only demons could work it generally uncrossing my arms i considered them again maybe there was something i could use thanks i said moving to touch the top book and stifling a shudder when i felt a slight sponginess as if my aura had gone from liquid to syrup my torn skin tingled and i wiped my hand on my jeans you wont get in trouble the faint tightening of his jaw was the only sign of his nervousness you mean in more trouble than trying to kill him he said flicking his long bangs from his eyes i gave him a sick smile i see your point i went to get myself a cup of coffee while kisten poured a small glass of orange juice and set it on a tray he pulled from behind the microwave the plate of toast went on it shortly followed by the daisy hed taken from the windowsill i watched my curiosity growing when he gave me a sideways smile to show his sharp canines and hustled into the hallway with it all okay so it wasnt for me leaning against the counter i sipped my coffee and listened to a door creak open kistens voice called out cheerfully good afternoon ivy wakey wakey eggs and bakey shove it kist came ivys slurred mumble hey she cried louder dont open those what the hell are you doing a smile curved over my face and i snickered taking my coffee and sitting at the table theres my girl kisten coaxed sit up take the damn tray before i spill the coffee its saturday she snarled what are you doing here so early as i listened to kistens soothing voice rise and fall in an unrecognizable patter i wondered what was going on from families of wealth kisten and ivy had grown up together tried the cohabitation thing and parted as friends rumor had it piscary planned for them to get together and have a passel of children to carry on his livingvamp line before one of them died i was no expert in relationships but even i could tell that wasnt going to happen kisten cared deeply for ivy and she for him but seeing them together always gave me the feeling of a close brothersister relationship even so this breakfast in bed thing was unusual watch the coffee kisten exclaimed shortly followed by ivys yelp you arent helping get out of my room she snarled her graysilk voice harsh shall i lay out your clothes love kisten said his fake british accent on full and laughter in his voice i adore that pink skirt you wore all last fall why dont you wear that anymore get out she exclaimed and i heard something hit the wall pancakes tomorrow get the hell out of my room the door clicked shut and i met kistens grin with my own when he came in and went to the coffeemaker lose a bet i guessed and he nodded his thin eyebrows high i pushed out a chair kittycorner from me with my foot and he settled in with his mug his long legs going out to encircle mine under the corner of the table i said you could go on a run with david and come home without turning it into a slugfest she said you couldnt he reached for the sugar bowl and dumped two spoonfuls in thanks i said glad he had bet against her i lost on purpose he said crushing my vindication before it had taken its first breath thanks a lot i amended pulling my feet from between his setting his mug down he leaned forward and took my hands in his stop it rachel how else could i find an excuse to come over here every morning for a week i couldnt be mad at him now so i smiled dropping my gaze to our twined hands mine thin and pale beside his tan masculine fingers it was nice seeing them there together like that the past four months he had not lavished attention on me but rather was there and available whenever the mood struck either of us he was incredibly busy running piscarys affairs now that the undead master vampire was in jailthanks to meand i was occupied with my end of ivys and my runner firm vampiric charms as a result kisten and i spent spontaneous snips of intense time together that i found both extremely satisfying and curiously freeing our brief nearly daily conversations over coffee or dinner were more enjoyable and reassuring than a threeday weekend backpacking in the adirondacks dodging weekendwarrior weres and slapping mosquitoes he felt no jealousy about the time i spent pursuing my career and i felt only relief that he slaked his blood lust elsewhereit was a part of him i was ignoring until i found a way to deal with it there were problems brewing in our future as bloodchaste witches and living vampires were not known for making longterm commitments but i was tired of being alone and kisten met every emotional need i had raised and i met all of his but one allowing someone else to do that with no distrust on my part our relationship was too good to be true and i wondered again how i could find comfort with a vampire when id never been able to hold onto it with a witch or with nick i thought feeling the expression leave my face what kisten said more aware of my mood shift than if i had painted my face blue i took a breath hating myself for where my thoughts had gone nothing i smiled thinly just thinking how much i like being with you oh his bristly face creased into a worried smile what are you doing today i sat back pulling my hand from his and putting my sock feet to either side of his lap so he wouldnt think i was drawing away my eyes drifted to my shoulder bag and my checkbook i wasnt desperate for moneywonder of wonders since the calls for my services had dropped dramatically after the six oclock news last winter had featured me being dragged down the street on my ass by a demon and because i was heeding davids advice to take a few days off to mend i knew i ought to spend the time in research or balancing my bank account or cleaning my bathroom or doing something constructive but then i met kistens eyes and the only idea that came to me wasah not the least bit constructive at all his eyes were not calm there was the faintest rising of black in them the faintest thinning of blue gaze riveted to mine he reached for one of my feet bringing it onto his lap and starting to rub it the intent behind his action strengthened when he sensed my pulse quickening and his massage took on a rhythm that spoke ofpossibilities my breath came and went there was no blood lust in his eyes only a desire that made my gut tighten and a tingle start at my demon scar i need todomy laundry i said arching my eyebrows laundry he never looked from me as his hands left my foot and started creeping upward moving pressing hinting that sounds like it involves water and soap mmmm could be slippery and messy i think i have a bar of soap somewhere want some help uhhuh i thought my mind pinging over the possible ways he could help me and how i could get ivy out of the church for a few hours seeing mywellwillingness might be too weak a wordenthusiasm in my inviting smile kisten reached out and pulled my chair bumping and scraping around the corner of the table snuggling it up to his with a living vampires strength my legs opened to put my knees to either side of him and he leaned forward the blue of his eyes vanishing to a thin ribbon tension rising i put my lips beside his torn ear the scent of leather and silk crashed over me and i closed my eyes in anticipation you have your caps i whispered i felt him nod but i was more interested in where his lips were going he cupped a hand along my jaw and tilted my face to his always he said always and forever with you oh god i thought just about melting kisten wore caps on his sharp canines to keep from breaking my skin in a moment of passion they were generally worn by adolescent living vampires still lacking control and kisten risked a severe ribbing should anyone find out he wore them when we slept together his decision was born from his respect for my desire to withhold my blood from him and ivys threat to stake him twice if he took my blood kisten claimed it was possible to be bound and not become a vampires shadow but everything i had seen said otherwise my fear remained and so did his caps i inhaled bringing the vamp pheromones deep into me willing them to relax me wanting the tingling promise that was humming in my demon scar to race through my body but then kisten stiffened and drew away ivy i whispered feeling my eyes go worried as his gaze went distant pixy wings he said pushing my chair out matalina i answered sending my gaze to the open archway to the hall there was a distant thump jenks came ivys muffled call from her room my lips parted in surprise she had heard matalinas wings through a closed door great just freaking great then shed heard our conversation too its matalina i shouted not wanting her to burst out thinking it was jenks but it was too late and i stood awkwardly when her door thumped open matalina zipped into the kitchen a heartbeat before ivy staggered in halting in an undignified slump with one hand supporting herself against the open archway she was still in her skimpy nightgown her black silk robe doing next to nothing to hide her tall lanky build trim and smoothlimbed from her martial arts practice her straight black hair mussed from sleeping framed her oval face in an untidy fashion shed had it cut not too long ago and it still surprised me to see it bumping about just under her ears it made her long neck look longer the single scar on it a smooth line now faint from cosmetic surgery wideeyed from being jerked from her bed her brown somewhat almondshaped eyes looked larger than usual and her thin lips were open to show small teeth head cocked kisten spun in his chair taking in her lack of clothes his grin widened grimacing at her less than suave entrance ivy pulled herself straight trying to find her usual iron hold on her emotions her pale cheeks were flushed and she wouldnt meet my eyes as she closed her robe with an abrupt motion matalina she said her voice still rough from sleep is jenks okay will he talk to us god i hope so kisten said dryly turning his chair so he didnt have his back to ivy the agitated pixy flitted to perch on the center island counter a glittering trail of silver sparkles sifted from her slowly falling to make a temporary sunbeam clear evidence of her flustered state i already knew her answer but i couldnt help but slump when she shook her head her wings stilling her pretty eyes went wide and she twisted the fabric of her silk dress please she said her voice carrying a frightening amount of worry jenks wont come to you im so scared rachel he cant go alone he wont come back if he goes alone suddenly i was a whole lot more concerned go where i said crowding closer ivy moved in too and we clustered before her almost helpless as the tiny woman who could stand down six fairies started to cry forever the gentleman kisten carefully tore a tissue and handed her a piece the size of his thumbnail she could have used it for a washcloth its jax matalina said holding her breath between sobs jax was her oldest son my fear quickened hes at nicks apartment i said ill drive you over matalina shook her head hes not there he left with nick on the winter solstice i jerked upright feeling as if id been kicked in the stomach nick was here i stammered at the solstice he never even called i looked at ivy shocked the freaking human bastard he had come cleared out his apartment and left just like jenks said he would and i thought he cared for me i had been hurt and half dead from hypothermia and he just left as i fumed the betrayal and confusion i thought long gone swelled to make my head hurt we got a call this morning matalina was saying oblivious to my state though kisten and ivy exchanged knowing glances we think hes in michigan michigan i blurted what the turn is he doing in michigan ivy nudged closer almost coming between matalina and me you said you think you dont know for certain the pixy turned her tearstreaked face to ivy looking as tragic and strong as a mourning angel nick told jax they were in michigan but they moved him jax doesnt know for sure they moved him who moved him i said bending close are they in trouble the tiny womans eyes were frightened ive never seen jenks so angry nick took jax to help him with his work but something went wrong now nick is hurt and jax cant get home its cold up there and im so worried i glanced at ivy her eyes dark with widening pupils her lips pressed into a thin angry line work nick cleaned museum artifacts and restored old books what kind of work would he need a pixy for in michigan in the springtime when most pixies were still shaking off hibernation at that latitude my thoughts went to nicks confidant casualness his aversion to anything with a badge his wickedly quick mind and his uncanny tendency to be able to get ahold of just about anything given time id met him in cincys rat fights where he had been turned into a rat after borrowing a tome from a vampire he had come back to cincinnati and left with jax without telling me he was here why would he take jax with him my face went hot and i felt my knees go quivery pixies had other skills than gardening shit nick was a thief leaning hard against the counter i looked from kisten to ivy her expression telling me that she had known but realized id only get mad at her until i figured it out for myself god i was so stupid it had been there all the time and i hadnt let myself see it i opened my mouth jumping when kisten jabbed me in the ribs his eyes went to matalina the poor woman didnt know i shut my mouth feeling cold matalina i said softly is there any way to find out where they are maybe jax could find a newspaper or something jax cant read she whispered dropping her head into her hands her wings drooping none of us can she said crying except jenks he learned so he could work for the is i felt so helpless unable to do anything how do you give someone four inches high a hug how do you tell her that her eldest son had been misled by a thief a thief i had trusted im so scared the tiny pixy said her voice muffled jenks is going after him hes going all the way up north he wont come back its too far he wont be able to find enough to eat and its too cold unless he has somewhere safe to stay at night her hands fell away the misery and heartache on her tiny features striking fear in me where is he i asked my growing anger pushing out the fear i dont know matalina sniffed as she looked at the torn tissue in her grip jax said it was cold and everyone was making candy theres a big green bridge and lots of water i shook my head impatiently not jax jenks matalinas hopeful expression made her look more beautiful than all of gods angels youll talk to him she quavered taking a slow breath i glanced at ivy hes sulked enough i said im going to talk to the little twit and hes going to listen and then well both go ivy straightened her arms held tight at her sides as she took two steps back her eyes were wide and her face carefully blank rachel kisten said the warning in his voice jerking my attention to him matalina rose three inches into the air her face alight even as the tears continued hell be angry if he finds out i came to you for help ddont tell him i asked you ignoring kisten i took a resolute breath tell me where hes going to be and ill find him he isnt going to do this alone i dont care if he talks to me or not but im going with him three the coffee in my cup was cold which i didnt remember until i had it to my lips sharp and bitter the taste of it puckered my face an instant before i let it slip down my throat shuddering i held another dollop on my tongue a soft thrill lifted through me as i tapped the line in the graveyard and set my pencil down on the kitchen table from candles burn and planets spin i whispered awkwardly around the coffee my fingers sketching out a complex figure friction is how it ends and begins rolling my eyes i brought my hands together to make a loud pop simultaneously saying consimilis god help me it was so hokey but the rhyme did help me remember the finger motions and the two words that actually did the charm cold to hot harness within i finished making the ley line gesture that would use the coffee in my mouth as a focal object so i wouldnt warm upsaymr fishs bowl calefacio i said smiling at the familiar drop of line energy through me i tightened my awareness to let what i thought was the right amount of power run through me to excite the water molecules and warm the coffee excellent i breathed when the mug began to steam my fingers curled about the warm porcelain and i dropped the line entirely much better i thought when i went to take a sip jerking back and touching my lip when i found it too hot ceri had said control would come with practice but i was still waiting i set the mug down pushing ivys maps farther out of my space and into hers the robins were singing loudly and i squinted trying to read in the early dusk of the developing rain clouds as i leafed through kistens borrowed books id have to leave in half an hour to accidentally run into jenks on his run and i was getting antsy ivy was in one of her moods and kisten had hustled her out shortly after matalina left so she wouldnt drive me crazy all afternoon id find out soon enough what was bothering her and maybe kisten could take care of it for me instead my spine cracked when i straightened arching my back and taking a deep breath i pulled my fingers off the duskdarkened print feeling the tingle of disconnection strike through me like a reverse static shock kists books were indeed demon texts id quickly gotten used to the numb feeling of the pages lured into exploring them when i realized every curse mixed earth and ley line magic utilizing both to make more than the sum of the parts it made for fascinating reading even if my latin sucked dishwater and i was only now starting to remember i was supposed to be afraid of this stuff it wasnt what i had expected sure there were the nasty spells that would turn your neighbors barking dog inside out strike your fourthgrade teacher with agony or call down a flaming ball of hell to smack the guy tailgating you but there were softer spells too ones i couldnt see harm in spells that did the same things many of my eminently legal earth charms did and thats what scared me the most mood going introspective i flipped the page and found a curse that would encase someone in a thick layer of air to slow their movements as if they were in molasses i suppose one could use it to gain the advantage in a fight and kill them with a blow to the head or knife thrust but would it tarnish ones soul if all you did was slow them down so you could slap a pair of cuffs on them the more i looked the harder it was to tell i had assumed demon curses were black as a matter of course but i truly couldnt see the harm here even more worrisome was the potential power they all had the curse detailed before me wasnt the illusion of molasses that black ley line witches used to give people bad dreams in which they were unable to escape something or to help a loved one and it wasnt the earth charm that had to be laboriously cooked and targeted to a specific person which resulted in slower reactions not this almost complete immobility the demon curse took the quick implementation and wide range of application of a ley line charm and harnessed it in a pair of polarized amulets thereby giving it the reality and permanence of earth magic it was a mix of both it was the real thing it was demon magic and i was one of two people who could both walk under the sun and kindle it thanks trent i muttered as i turned the page my fingertips prickling your dad was a peach but i wasnt complaining i shouldnt have lived to puberty the genetic aberration that i was afflicted with killed every witch born with it before they were two i truly believed that trent kalamacks father hadnt known that the same thing that was killing me had made it possible for me to kindle demon magic accidentally circumventing a genetic checksandbalances all he knew was his friends daughter was dying of an ancient malady and he had the wisdom and technologyeven if it was illegalto save my life so he had and it kinda worried me that the only other witch trents father had fixed was now suffering a living hell as the demon algaliarepts familiar in the everafter guilt assailed me quickly quashed i had told lee not to give me to al id warned him to get us the hell out of the everafter when we had the chance but nooooo the wicked witch from the west thought he knew everything and now he was paying for his mistake with his life it had been either him or me and i liked where i lived a freshening gust of wind blew in carrying the hint of rain and shifting the curtains i glanced at the book before me and turned the page to find a curse to pull out someones intelligence until they had the brain of a worm blinking i closed the book okay so it was easy to figure out that some of them were black but was there such a thing as a white curse the thing was i knew earth magic was powerful but giving it the speed and versatility of ley line magic was frightening and the mixing of the two branches of magic was in every curse in the few hours i had been sitting here i found curses that shifted mass to line energy or vice versa so you could actually make big things little and little things big not just project the illusion of a size change as with ley line magic and since it also involved an earth magic potion the change was realas in having viable offspring real nervous i pushed myself away from the table my fingers tapped the old wood in a quick rhythm and i glanced at the clock almost six i couldnt sit here any longer the weather was shifting and i wanted to be in it surging to my feet i snatched the book up and knelt at the low shelf under the center island counter i didnt want to shelve it with my usual library but i certainly didnt want the three of them under my pillow either brow creasing i moved a mundane cookbook to serve as a buffer between my spell books and the demon tomes so i was superstitious so sue me the last two books slid into place and i straightened wiping my hands on my jeans while i looked at them sitting oh so nicely between the country farms cookie cookbook id swiped from my mom and the copy of real witches eat quiche i had gotten from the iss secret santa three years ago you can guess which one i used the most grabbing my bag i headed out boot heels clunking as i went down the hallway past ivys and my bedrooms and bathrooms and into the sanctuary the pews were long gone leaving only the faded reminder of a huge cross above where the altar once stood stainedglass windows stretched from knee height to the top of the twelvefoot walls the open raftered ceiling was dusky with the early twilight from the clouds and i would use my panties as a sun hat if i could hear the whispered giggles of pixies plotting mischief up there again the large room took up half the heated space in the church and it was empty but for my plantstrewn desk on the anklehigh stage where the altar had stood and ivys baby grand piano just past the foyer id only heard her play it once her long fingers pulling a depth of emotion from the keys that i only rarely saw in her face i snatched my keys from my desk in passing and they jingled happily as i continued into the dark foyer squinting i plucked my red leather jacket and cap from the peg beside the fourinchthick twin oak doors at the last moment i grabbed ivys umbrella with the ebony handle before wedging the door open there was no lockonly a bar to lower from the insidebut no one on this side of the ley lines would dare steal from a tamwood vampire the door thumped shut behind me and i flounced down the steps to the cracked sidewalk the spring evening was balmy the humidity of an approaching storm shifting the air pressure to make the robins sing and my blood quicken i could smell rain and imagine the distant rumble of thunder i loved spring storms and i smiled at the fresh green leaves shifting in the rising breeze my steps quickened when i saw my car tucked in the tiny carport a bright red convertible with two seats up front and two unusable seats in back across the street and a few houses down our neighbor keasley was standing at the edge of his front porch his spine bent from arthritis and his head up as he tasted the changing wind he raised a gnarly hand when i waved telling me everything was fine with him unseen preschoolage kids were shouting responding to the air pressure shift with less restraint than i was managing up and down the street people were coming out of their americana middleclass homes heads up and eyes on the sky it was the seasons first warm rain and only three days out of a new moon the is would have a busy night trying to rein everyone in not my problem anymore i cheerfully thought as i settled in behind the wheel of my car and took the time to put the top down so i could feel the wind in my hair yeah it was going to rain but not for a few hours yet saucy little red cap on my head and wearing a snappy leather jacket to block the wind i drove through the hollows at a modest pace waiting until i crossed the bridge and got on the interstate before i opened her up the damp wind beating on my face brought every smell to me sharper and more vivid than it had been for months and the rumble of tires engine and wind muffling everything else was like freedom itself i found myself inching past eighty when i saw the cruiser parked on an entrance ramp it had the federal inderland bureau emblem on it and waving merrily i tunked it down and got a headlight blink in return everyone in the humanrun fib knew my carheck they had given it to me the fib wouldnt stop me but the inderland run is would just out of spite for having quit their lameass nationwide police force i tucked a strand of blowing hair behind my ear and warily checked behind me id only had my car a couple of months and already the entire fleet of is flunkies doing street duty knew me by sight taking every opportunity to help me rack up points on my license and it wasnt fair the red light i ran a month ago was for a darn good reasonand at five in the morning no one had even been at the intersection but the cop i still dont know where he had come frommy trunk maybe and id been late for an appointment the time i got pulled over for speeding on i hadnt been going that much faster than everyone else stupid car i muttered fondly though i wouldnt trade my little red ticket magnet for anything it wasnt its fault the is took every chance they could to make my life miserable but walkie talkie man was cranked steriogram singing so fast only a vamp could keep up and it wasnt long before the little white hand crept up to eighty again pulling my mood along with it i even found a cutelooking guy on a cycle to flirt with while i made my way to edgemont where jenks had his run the cessation of wind as i came off the interstate was almost an assault and when a rumble of real thunder rolled over me i pulled to the side of the road to put the top up my head jerked up when the guy on the cycle whizzed past his hand raised in salute my faint smile lingered for a moment then vanished if i couldnt get jenks to talk to me i was going to kill the little twit taking a deep breath i turned my phone to vibrate snapped off the music and pulled into traffic i jostled over a railroad track peering into the coming dusk and noting that the pace of the pedestrian and bike traffic had changed from casual to intense as the threat of rain increased it was a business district one of the old industrial areas that the city had thrown a lot of money at to turn it into a themed mall and parks to attract the usual outlying shops and apartments it reminded me of mrs bryants flat and i frowned i drove past the address to evaluate the multistoried sprawling building by the art deco and the mailbox drivethrough it looked like a manufacturing complex turned into a mix of light commercial and upscale apartments i hadnt seen jenks but that wouldnt be unusual if he was tailing someone matalina said he was on a smut run to build up money to buy an airline ticket my brow was furrowed in worry when i turned the corner and got a lucky spot at the curb in front of a coffeehouse jerking the parking break up and shifting the stick to neutral pixies couldnt fly commerciallythe shifting air pressures wreaked havoc with them jenks wasnt thinking straight anymore no wonder matalina had come to me snatching up my bag i timed my move with traffic and got out a quick look at the lowering clouds and i reached for ivys umbrella the smell of coffee almost pulled me inside but i dutifully went the other way a quick glance and i slipped into the alley of the building in question walking so my feet were silent in my vampmade boots the scent of garbage and dog urine was strong and i wrinkled my nose and pulled my jacket closer looking for a spot where i could stay out of sight and watch the front door of the complex i was early if i could catch him before he went in it would be all the better but then i froze at the sound of a familiar wing clatter face going still i looked up the narrow passage to find a pixy dressed in a black body stocking rubbing a clean spot to see through on a dirtgrimed birdspotted upperstory window shame stilled my voice god i had been so stupid i didnt blame him for leaving for thinking i hadnt trusted him the ugly truth was i hadnt last solstice i had figured out that trent kalamack was an elf and getting the wealthy son of a bitch to not kill me for knowing that the elves werent extinct but had gone into hiding had taken a pretty piece of blackmail finding out what kind of inderlander trent was had become the holy grail of the pixy world and i knew the temptation for jenks to blab it would be too much even so he deserved better than my lies of omission and i was afraid he might not listen to me even now jenks hovered intent on whatever was inside his dragonfly wings were invisible in his calm state and not a hint of pixy dust sifted from him he looked confident and a red bandanna was tied about his forehead it was protection against accidentally invading a rival pixys or fairys territory a promise of a quick departure with no attempt at poaching i nervously gathered my resolve glancing at the wall of the alley before i leaned against it and tried to look casual so is she cheating on her husband i asked nah jenks said his eyes focused through the glass shes taking an exercise class to surprise him on their twentyfifth anniversary he doesnt deserve her the mistrusting bastard then he jerked slamming back six feet to nearly hit the adjacent building you he cried pixy dust sifting like sunbeams what the hell are you doing here i pushed myself off the wall and stepped forward jenks he dropped like a stone to hover before me finger pointing as the pixy dust he had let slip slowly fell over us anger creased his tiny features to make him grim and threatening she told you he shrilled his jaw clenched and his face red under his short blond hair i took a step back alarmed jenks shes only worried the hell with you both he snarled im outta here he turned wings a blur of red ticked i tapped a line energy flowed equalizing in the time it takes for a burst bubble to vanish rhombus i snapped imagining a circle a sheet of gold hummed into existence so thick it blurred the walls of the surrounding alley i staggered my balance questionable since i hadnt taken even the time to pretend to draw a circle in the air jenks jerked to a stop a mere inch in front of the circle you sorry stupid witch he shrilled seeming at a loss for something worse let me out i ought to kill your car i ought to leave slug eggs in your slippers i ought to i ought to hands on my hips i got in his face yeah you ought to but first youre going to listen to me his eyes widened and i leaned forward until he shifted back what is wrong with you jenks this cant just be about me not telling you what trent is jenkss face lost its surprise his eyes touched upon the bandages and bruises on my neck then dropped to my pain amulet seemingly by force of will his eyes narrowed with an old anger thats right he said hovering an inch before my nose its about you lying to me its about you not trusting me with information its about you pissing all over our partnership finally i thought finally i gritted my jaw almost crosseyed with him so close good god if i tell you what he is will that make you happy shut your mouth he shouted i dont care anymore and i dont need your help break your circle so i can get the hell away from you or ill jam something where it shouldnt go witch you stupid ass i exclaimed warming fine furious i shoved a foot into the circle my breath hissed in when the circles energy flowed into me at the end of the alley the passing people gave us a few curious looks run away i said gesturing wildly not caring what they thought leave you cowardly ball of spider snot ive been trying to apologize for the last five months but youre so preoccupied with your stinking little hurt feelings that you wont listen i think you like being slighted i think you feel secure in your downtrodden pixy mentality i think you get off on the poor little pixy that no one takes seriously crap that you wrap yourself in and when i believed in you you got scared and ran away at the first sign that you might have to live up to your ideas jenkss mouth was hanging open and he was slowly loosing altitude seeing him floundering i surged ahead thinking i might have finally shaken him loose go on and leave i continued my legs starting to shake stay in your stinking little basement and hide but matalina and your kids are coming back to the garden you can shove a cherry up your ass and make jam for all i care but i need them i cant keep those damn fairies out to save my dandelions and i need my garden as much as i need backup on a night with a full moon and your bitching and moaning dont mean crap anymore because ive been trying to apologize and all youve done is shit on me well im not apologizing anymore still he hung in the air his wings shifting to a lighter shade of red he didnt seem to know what to do with his hands and they tugged his bandanna and fell to his sword im going to find jax and nick i said my anger lessening i had said what i wanted and all that was left was hearing what he thought are you coming with me or not jenks rose my going north has nothing to do with you he said tightly like hell it doesnt i said hearing the first heavy drop of rain hit the nearby dumpster he may be your son but it was my old boyfriend who got him in trouble he lied to you he lied to me and im going up there so i can kick nicks ass from here to the everafter even i could hear my sullen tone and jenks gave me a nasty smile be careful he goaded someone might think you still like him i do not i said feeling a headache start but hes in trouble and i cant just let whoever it is kill him a bitter saucy look returned to jenkss face and he flitted to the end of a twobyfour sticking out of a can yuhhuh he said snidely hands on his hips why are you really going i just told you why i snapped hiding my bitten hand when he looked at it his head bobbed up and down yada yada yada he said making a getonwithit gesture with one hand i know why youre going but i want to hear you say it i fumbled not believing this because im as mad as all hell i said the rain falling steadily now if we had to continue this conversation much longer we were going to get soaked he said he was going to come back and he did just long enough to clear out his apartment and take off no goodbye not even an it was great babe but i gotta go now i need to tell him to his face that he crapped all over me and i dont love him anymore jenkss tiny eyebrows rose and i wished he was bigger so i could wipe the smirk off his face this is some female closure thing isnt it he said and i sneered look i said im going to get jax and pull nicks sorry ass out from whatever mess hes in are you coming with me or are you going to waste your time taking smut runs for a paycheck you will only waste on a plane ticket that will leave you hospitalized for three days i slowed thinking i could chance appealing to his love for matalina without him flying away matalina is scared jenks shes afraid you wont come back if you go alone his face emptied of emotion and for a moment i thought id gone too far i can do this on my own he said angrily i dont need your help my thoughts went to his iffy food supply and the cold northern nights it could snow in may in michigan jenks knew it sure you dont i said i crossed my arms and eyed him just like i could have survived those fairy assassins last year without your help his lips pursed he took a breath to tell me something his hand went up finger pointing i made my eyes wide and mocking slowly his hand fell still standing on the twobyfour jenkss wings drooped youre going i fought to keep my surge of hope from showing yes i said but to even have a chance i need a security bypass expert reconnaissance and someone i trust to watch my back ivy cant do it she cant leave cincinnati jenkss wings hummed into motion then stilled you hurt me bad rachel my chest clenched in guilt i know i whispered and im sorry i dont deserve your help but im asking for it i pulled my head up pleading with him with my eyes for the first time his face showed the hurt id given him and my heart broke again ill think about it he muttered taking to the air i took a faltering step after him im leaving tomorrow early noon wings clattering jenks flew a swooping path back to me i nearly raised my hand for him to land on but it would hurt too much if he shunned it i suppose thats early for a witch he said the pitch of his wings rose until my eyeballs hurt okay ill come with you but im not coming back to the firm this is a oneshot deal my throat closed and i swallowed down a lump hed come back he knew it as much as i did i wanted to shout an exuberant yes i wanted to whoop to make the passing people stare but what i did instead was smile shakily at him okay i said so relieved i was almost crying blinking profusely i followed him to the head of the alley though jenks would have snugged under my hat before to get out of the rain it was too much to ask just yet can you meet me tonight at the church after midnight i asked i have a few charms to prep before we head out we left the alley together the lighter gloom making me feel as if we had come out of a black hole we were both walking on eggshells the patterns were familiar but the sensitivities were so very fragile i can do that jenks said apprehensively glancing up at the rain good good i listened to my feet hit the sidewalk the thumps jarring up my spine do you still have your half of the phone set you gave me i could hear the hesitancy in my voice and i wondered if jenks could too i had kept the phone hed given me for the solstice hell i had almost made it into a shrine i popped open ivys black umbrella and jenks flew under it five months ago he would have sat on my shoulder but even this small show of trust caught at me david brought it over he said stiffly keeping to the distant corner good i said again feeling stupid can you bring it with you its a little big for me to slip into my pocket but ill manage it was sarcastic and biting but he was sounding more like the jenks i knew i glanced at him seeing he was trailing the faintest wisp of silver sparkles my car was just ahead and i wondered whether hed take offense if i offered him a ride home cowardly ball of spider snot jenks said when i opened the door and he darted inside swallowing hard i stared across to the sidewalk and the people running for cover as the clouds opened and it began to pour he was back i had gotten him back it wasnt perfect but it was a start breath shaking i folded the umbrella and ducked inside give me a break i said as i started the car and turned the heat on full to warm him up i was pressed for time four i held up the black lace top in consideration sighing i decided against it folding it up and jamming it back into the third drawer down sure i looked good in it but this was a rescue run not spring break taking the shortsleeve peachcolored cotton shirt instead i set it atop the jeans already packed in the suitcase my mom had given me for graduation she insisted it hadnt been a hint but i reserved my doubts to this day moving to my top drawer i grabbed enough socks and undies for a week the church was empty since ivy was out getting jenks and his brood the rain pattered pleasantly on my small stainedglass window propped open with a pencil getting the sill wet but little else from the dark garden came the trill of a toad it mixed well with the soft jazz from the living room in the back of my closet i found the red turtleneck sweater id stored last week i shook the hanger from it carefully folded it and set it with the rest i added a pair of running shorts and my favorite black tee with staff on it that id gotten while working takatas concert last winter the temp could hit eighty as easily as thirtyfive i sighed content midnight rain toad song jazz and jenks coming home it didnt get much better my head rose at the creak of the front door hey its me came kistens voice and now it was better still back here i called taking two steps to the hall one hand on the doorframe as i leaned out the lights were dim in the sanctuary his tall silhouette mysterious and attractive as he shook the rain from his fulllength slicker i ducked back inside and shut my underwear drawer just before kisten came in the soft and certain steps of his dress shoes distinct on the hardwood floor the scent of pizza and someone elses perfume hung about him and by his carefully styled hair cleanshaven cheeks expensive dress slacks and silk shirt i knew he had come from work i liked the respectable financially successful club manager aspect of kisten as much as his rougher bad boy image he could do both equally well hi love he said hitting his fake british accent hard to make me smile a rainspotted paper grocery bag was in his hands the top rolled down i padded forward in my sneakers having to reach to give him a hug my fingers played with the damp tips of his hair as i drew away and he smiled enjoying the tease hi i said reaching for the bag is that them nodding he gave it to me and i set it on the bed opening it and peering inside as i had asked there was a pair of sweatpants and a soft flannel sweatshirt kisten looked at the bag clearly wanting to know why but all he said was ivys out she went to get jenks because of the rain pensive i opened a lower drawer and packed another tshirt she missed him as much as me i finished softly looking tired kisten sat at the head of my bed his long fingers rolling the top of the bag down i closed my suitcase but didnt zip it it was unusual for him to leave piscarys club midhours clearly something was bothering him i straightened arms crossed and waited for it i dont think you should go he said his voice serious my mouth fell open surprise shifting to anger when i pieced it together is this about nick i said turning to my dresser to pack the ungodly expensive bottle of perfume that kept my natural scent from mixing with a vampires kisten im over him give me some credit thats not why ivy ivy i stiffened glancing into the empty hall what about her is piscary his slowly moving head said no and i relaxed a notch hes leaving her alone but she relies on you more than you know if you go things might shift flustered i jammed the perfume into a zippy bag and dropped it into a pocket in my vanity case im only going to be gone for a week maybe two its not as if im her scion no youre her friend and thats more important than anything else to her right now arms crossed i leaned back against my dresser this isnt my responsibilityi have my own life i protested gods we share rent we arent married kistens eyes were dark in the dim light from my table lamp his brow pinched with worry you have coffee with her every day when she wakes up youre across the hall when she shuts the curtains before going to sleep that might not mean much to you but its everything to her youre her first real friend indamn i think its been over ten years youre her friend i said and what about skimmer youre her only friend not after her blood he amended his eyes sad its different well just crap on that i said picking up my last favorite earring but not knowing what to do with it disgusted i threw it away ivy hasnt said anything to me about not leaving rachel he stood coming to take my elbows in his grip his fingers were warm and i felt them tighten and relax from the living room jazz rose and fell she wont i dropped my head frustrated never once did i tell her id be anything but what we are now i said we arent sharing a bed or blood or anything i dont belong to her and keeping her together isnt my job why is this all on me anyway youve known her longer than i i know her past you dont she leans on you more because of your ignorance of what she was he took a hesitant breath before he continued it was ugly rachel piscary warped her into a viciously savage lover who couldnt separate blood from lust or love she survived by becoming something she hated accepting the pattern of selfabuse of trying to please everyone she thought she loved i didnt want to hear this but when i tried to move his grip tightened shes better now he said his blue eyes pleading for me to listen it took her a long time to break the pattern and even longer to start to feel good about herself ive never seen her happier and like it or not its because of you she loves skimmer but that woman is a big part of what ivy was and how she got there and if you leave my jaw tightened and i stiffened not liking this at all i am not ivys keeper i said gut twisting i did not sign up for this kisten but he only smiled soft and full of understanding and regret i liked ivyi liked her respected her and wished i had half her willpowerbut i didnt want anyone relying on me that heavily hell i could hardly take care of myself much less a powerful mentally abused vampire she wont ask more than you can give he said especially if she needs it but you did move in with her and more telling you stayed when your relationship began to evolve excuse me i said trying to pull away he wouldnt let go and i jerked from him falling two steps back kistens expression had a hint of accusation she asked you to be her scion he said and i said no but you forgave her for trying to force you and you did it without a second thought this was crap he had heard all of this why was he making such a big deal about it only because i jumped on her back and breathed in her ear when we were sparring i said i pushed her too far and it wasnt her fault besides she was scared that if she didnt make me her scion piscary was going to kill me kisten nodded his calm state helping to dissipate my anger it was a nowin situation he said softly and you both handled it the best you could but the point is you did jump on her knowing what it might trigger i took a breath to protest then turned away flustered it was a mistake and i didnt think it was right to walk out because i made a mistake why not he insisted people leave all the time when someone makes a mistake frightened i went to push past him i had to get out of there rachel he said loudly jerking me into him why didnt you leave right then no one would have thought any less of you i took a breath then let it out because she is my friend i said eyes down and keeping my voice low so it wouldnt shake thats why and it wouldnt be fair for me to leave because of my mistake because sherelies on me my shoulders slumped and kistens grip on me eased pulling me closer damn it kist i said putting my cheek to his shirt and breathing in his scent i can hardly take care of myself i cant save her too no one said you had to he said his voice rumbling into me and no one says its going to stay this way helping to keep you alive and unbound with that scar of yours makes ivy feel worthwhilethat shes making the world a better place do you know how hard that is for a vampire to find she leans on you harder than me because she feels responsible for you and you owe her there is that i thought remembering how vulnerable my unclaimed vampire scar made me but my debt to ivy wasnt why i hadnt left nick had said i was making excuses to stay in an unsafe situation that i had wanted her to bite me i couldnt believe that it was just friendship wasnt it kistens hand across my hair was soothing and i put my arms around his waist finding comfort in his touch if you leave he said you take her strength i never wanted this i said how had i become her lodestone her savior all i wanted was to be her friend i know his breath moved my hair will you stay i swallowed not wanting to move i cant i said and he gently pushed me back until he could see my face jenks needs me its just a quick run five hundred miles how much trouble could nick and jax be in they probably just need bail money ill be back kistens face was creased his elegant grace marred by sorrow the caring he felt for me and for ivy were mixed together and somehow beautiful i know you will i just hope ivy is here when you do uncomfortable i went to my closet and pretended to shuffle for something shes a big girl shell be fine its only a days drive he took a breath to say something then stopped shifting from foot to foot as he changed his mind going back to the bed he opened the crinkling bag of sweats and looked inside what do you want these for anyway a disguise or is it to remember me by glad at the shift in topics i turned with my buttkicking boots in hand and set them by the bed remember you by a faint flush rimmed his ears yeah i thought you wanted them to put under your pillow or something so it was like i was there with you taking the bag from him i peered into it in speculation you wore them already he rubbed a hand across his smooth chin discomforted ah just once i didnt sweat in them or anything i dated a girl who liked wearing one of my shirts to bed she said it was like i was holding her all night i thought it was a uh girl thing my smile blossomed you mean like this feeling wicked i pulled out the sweatshirt and slipped it on over my top holding my arms about myself i shifted back and forth my eyes closed and breathing deeply i didnt care that the reason he smelled good was from a thousand years of evolution to make it easier for him to find prey you wicked wicked witch kisten whispered the sudden heat in his voice pulled my eyes open he took a slow breath his entire body moving oh god you smell good yeah what about now grinning i did jumping jacks knowing the mixing of our scents would drive him slightly nuts as expected his eyes dilated with a sudden blood lust flashing to black rachel he said his voice strained dont giggling i evaded his reaching hand wait wait i gasped i can make it worse stop kisten said his voice low and controlled there was a hint of threat in it and when he reached for me again i shrieked darting around the end of the bed with vampire quickness he followed my back hitting the wall with a breathstealing thump as he pinned me eyes crinkled and smiling i wiggled and twisted enjoying pushing his buttons after only a token show of resistance i stopped letting him find my mouth my breath left me in a slow sound as i eased against him my arms crunched between us his grip on my shoulders was firm and dominating possessive but i knew hed let go if i made one real motion to break free soft jazz completed my mood his fingers clenched and released his lips moving lower until his mouth brushed my chin following the line of my jaw to the hollow under my ear my heart pounded and i tilted my head in a surprised sound my breath escaped when the tingling at my scar surged with the quickness and sudden shock of a flag snapping in the wind heat scoured me following my veins and settling into an insistent poundingdemanding i follow it through to its natural end kisten felt it and as his breath quickened i pulled my hands from between us sending my fingers to the nape of his neck my eyes closed as i felt his need his desire beat on mine to make it stronger a sound escaped me as his lips gently worked my old scar my body rebelled at the surge of passion and my knees gave way he was ready for it holding me firm to him i wanted this god how i wanted it i should have tried wearing something of his ages ago rachel he whispered his breathing harsh and heavy with desire what i panted my blood still humming though his lips werent on my scar anymore dont everwear anything of mineagain i cant i froze not understanding i made a motion to break free but he held me firm fear scoured painfully where passion once ran my eyes flicked to his seeing them lost and black then to his mouth he wasnt wearing his caps shit i had pushed him too far i cant let go of you he said his lips not moving adrenaline surged and a drop of sweat formed at his hairline shit shit shit i was in trouble my gaze flicked to the glint of fang at the corner of his mouth from one breath to the next the coin of desire had flipped from sex to blood damn the next ten seconds were going to be really dicey i think i can let go if you arent afraid he said fear and blood lust mixed in his voice i couldnt look away from his black eyes i could not look from his eyes while kisten unconsciously dumped pheromones into the air to make my vampire scar send wave after wave of passion through me in time with my hammering pulse my gut twisted mind racing i forced my breathing to be slow and even fear would trip him over the edge id pulled ivy down once and i knew if he was still talking then the odds were highly in my favor listen i said the ecstasy from my vampire scar mixing with my fear in an unreal slurry it felt good it was a rush the thrill of skydiving and sex all at the same time and i knew that letting him bite me would triple the sensation and i was going to let go of him and push him away im going to close my eyes because i trust you i said rachel it was soft and pleading he truly wanted to let go damn it this was my fault tension made my head hurt and i closed my eyes on the black orbs his gaze had become it made the fear ten times harder to surmount but still i trusted him i could tap a line and send him flying into the walland if push came to shove i wouldbut it would change our relationship utterly and i loved him it was a quiet tentative love with the frightening promise that it would grow if i didnt screw it up and i wanted a love based on trust not who was stronger kisten i said forcing my jaw to unclench im going to let go of you and you are going to let go of my shoulders and step back ready i could hear him breathe harsh and insistent it struck a chord inside me and we both shuddered it would feel so damn good to let him bite me his teeth sinking deep pulling me to him the pain twisted to pleasure scouring through me like fire and stealing my breath taking me to imagined heights of ecstasy it would be incredible the best thing id ever felt it would change my life forever and it was not going to happen for all the promised pleasure i knew it hid an equally ugly reality and i was afraid now kisten i said eyes still closed forcing my fingers to move my hands fell from him and he stepped away my eyes flashed open he had his back to me a hand on the waisthigh post at the foot of my bed his free hand shook i reached out then hesitated kisten im sorry i said voice trembling and he bobbed his head me too his husky voice ran through me like water through sand leaving me warm and tingly do me a favor and dont do that again you bet crossing my arms in front of me i took off his sweatshirt and let it fall to the bed the tingle at my neck faded leaving me shaking and sick at heart i had known mixing our scents was a blood aphrodisiac but not how potent it was or that it could come on that fast i was still making mistakes almost a year at this and i was still making mistakes kistens head came up and i wasnt surprised to hear the front door open in three seconds flat six streaks of silver and gold whizzed by my door at head height two more seconds and they raced back hi ms morgan came a highpitched voice and a pixy girl came to a short stop at the door peering in with her dress fluttering about her ankles her face was flushed and her fair hair was swirling in the draft from her wings there was a crash from the living room and she darted off shouting so high that my head hurt the music blared then cut out i took a step to the door jerking to a stop when matalina halted before me im sorry rachel the pretty pixy woman said looking frazzled ill take care of it ill get them out to the stump as soon as it stops raining smoothing the rough edges of my bandaged knuckles i tried to wash away the last of my runaway passions and the fear from kisten he hadnt moved clearly still trying to regain control dont worry about it i said i didnt have time to pixyproof the church there was another crash this time from the kitchen a handful of pixies flowed by all talking at once and matalina followed admonishing them to stay out of my cupboards my worry deepened when ivy strode past jenks was on her shoulder and he gave me an unsure look and a nod of recognition ivy caught sight of kisten and she backpedaled her shorter hair swinging her gaze went to his shirt on the bed then took in my soft guilt and the tremor in my hands nostrils flaring she scented the vamp pheromones and my fear realizing in seconds what had transpired i shrugged helplessly were back she said dryly then continued to the kitchen the new loudness of her steps and the slight tension in her body the only sign that she knew i had pushed kisten too far kisten didnt meet my gaze but my shoulders eased at the returning ring of blue in his eyes you okay i asked and he gave me a closedlipped smile i shouldnt have given you a pair i already wore he said taking the shirt and stuffing it in the bag maybe you should wash them i took the bag when he extended it embarrassed he followed me into the hallway turning to the kitchen while i went the other way to get the washer going the sharp scent of the soap ticked my nose and i dumped in a full measure then added a little more i closed the lid and stood with my hands on the washer as it filled my head bowed my gaze fell on my bitten hand sometimes i thought i was the stupidest witch ever born straightening i forced a pleasant expression onto my face and headed to the kitchen anticipating ivys mocking look unable to met anyones eyes i went straight to the coffeemaker to get a mug to hide behind all the pixy kids were in the living room and the sound of their play mixed with the soft hush of the rain past the open kitchen window ivy gave me one wry look before returning to her emails having parked herself at her computer out of the way in the corner jenks was on the sill his back to me as he looked into the wet garden and kisten was sitting in my chair his legs stretched to poke out past the corner of the table no one was saying anything hey uh kist i stammered and he pulled his head up i found a spell to were with in one of the books you gave me he seemed to have found his calm and though i was wiretight his eyes were weary no kidding he said encouraged i brought out the book and thumped it open before him jenks flitted over nearly landing on my shoulder but choosing kistens at the last moment he glanced down his wings stilling before his head jerked up to mine isnt that yeah i interrupted its demon magic but see i dont have to kill anything kisten blew out his breath meeting ivys blank expression before easing away from the book you can do demon magic he asked i nodded and tucked a curl behind my ear i didnt want to tell him why and though kisten was too much of a gentleman to ask when others could hear jenks was another story wings clattering he put his hands on his hips and frowned at me in his best peter pan pose how come you can do demon magic and no one else can he asked im not the only one i said tightly and then the metallic bong of the pull bell ivy and i used for a doorbell vibrated through the damp air ivy and kisten both straightened and i said its probably ceri i asked her to come over to help me with my spells tonight your demon spells jenks said bitingly and i frowned not wanting to argue ill let her in kisten said as he stood ive got to go ihave an appointment his voice was strained and i backed up feeling like dirt when i saw his rising hunger crap he was having a hard time staying balanced tonight i was never going to do that again kisten smoothly reached out and i didnt move when he put his hands lightly on my shoulder and gave me a quick kiss ill call you after we close you going to be up i nodded kisten im sorry i whispered and he gave me a smile before walking out with slow measured steps riling him up without being able to satisfy his hunger wasnt fair jenks landed on the table beside me his wings clattering for my attention rachel thats demon magic he said his belligerent attitude not hiding his worry thats why i asked ceri to look at it i said ive got this under control but its demon magic ivy tell her shes being stupid she knows shes being stupid ivy closed her computer down with a few clicks see what she did to kist i crossed my arms all right its demon magic but that doesnt necessarily make it black can we hear what ceri says before we decide anything we yeah we it was we again and it was going to stay that way damn it in a surge of motion ivy rose stretching for the ceiling in her black jeans and a tight knit shirt she grabbed her purse and shouted wait up kist jenks and i stared at her youre going with him i asked for both of us ivys look rife with disapproval was aimed at me i want to make sure no one takes advantage of him and he ends up hating himself when the sun comes up she shrugged into her jacket and put on her shades though it was dark out if you pulled that on me id pin you to the wall and have at it kist is a gentleman you dont deserve him my breath caught at the memory of my back to the wall and kistens lips on my neck a spike of remembered need raced from my neck to my groin ivy sucked in her breath as if id slapped her her heightened senses taking in my state as easily as i could see the sparkles sifting from jenks im sorry i said though my skin was tingling i wasnt thinking thats why i gave you the damn book she said tightly so you wouldnt have to what did she do jenks asked but ivy had walked out boot heels clunking what book the one about dating vampires tinks panties you still have that he added ill bring back a pizza ivy called unseen from the hallway what did you do rache jenks said the wind from his wings cooling my cheeks i put on kistens shirt and did jumping jacks i said embarrassed the small pixy snorted going to the windowsill to check on the rain you keep pulling stunts like that and people will think you want to be bitten yeah i muttered taking a sip of my cooling coffee and leaning against the center island counter i was still making mistakes then i remembered what quen had once told me if you do it once its a mistake if you do it twice its not a mistake anymore five i looked up when the soft conversation in the sanctuary gave way to clipped steps and ceri peered hesitantly around the corner of the archway pulling the rain hood from her she smiled clearly pleased to see jenks and me back on speaking terms jenks about trent i said seeing his wings turn an excited red he knew that whatever trent was ceri was the same i can figure this out myself he said focusing on ceri shut your mouth i shut my mouth i stood and extended my hands to give ceri a hug i wasnt a touchyfeely person but ceri was she had been als familiar until i stole her in the breath of time between her retirement and my attempted installment glancing briefly at my neck and bandaged knuckles she pressed her lips disapprovingly but thankfully said nothing her small almost ethereal stature met mine and the handtooled silver crucifix ivy had given her made a cold spot through my shirt the hug was brief but sincere and she was smiling when she put me at arms length she had thin fair hair that she wore free and flowing a small chin delicate nose large pride short temper and a mild demeanor unless challenged she took off her rain cape and draped it over ivys chair the selfproclaimed throne of the room al had dressed her commensurate to her earthly status while in his servicetreating her as a favored slaveservantbed warmer as well as an adornmentand though she now wore jeans and a sweater in her usual purple gold and black instead of a skintight gown of shimmering silk and gold the bearing was still there thanks for coming over i said genuinely glad to see her do you want some tea no thank you she elegantly extended a narrow hand for jenks to land on its good to see you back where you can help the people who need you the most master pixy she said to him and i would swear he turned three shades of red hi ceri he said you look wellrested did you sleep well tonight her heartshaped face went crafty knowing he was trying to decipher what kind of inderlander she was by her sleep patterns i have yet to take my evening rest she said shifting her fingers until he took to the air her gaze went to the open book on the table is that it a thrill of adrenaline went through me one of them is it demon tucking her long fair hair behind an ear she leaned to take a closer look oh yes suddenly i was a whole lot more nervous and i set my mug on the counter while my stomach churned there are a couple of charms i might want to try would you look at them for me and tell me what you think ceris delicate features glowed with pleasure id love to i exhaled in a puff of relief thanks wiping my hands on my jeans i pointed to the curse to were this one here what about it do you think i can do it all right the tips of her severely straight hair touched the stainspotted yellow text as she bent over the book frowning she gathered the strands up and out of the way jenks flitted to the table as she squinted alighting on the saltshaker there was a crash from the living room followed by a chorus of pixy shrieks and he sighed ill be right back he said buzzing out ive stirred this one before she said fingers hovering over the print what does it do i asked nervous all over again i mean would it make me into a real wolf or would i just look like one ceri straightened her gaze darting to the hallway as jenkss highpitched harangue filtered in making my eyeballs hurt its a standard morphing curse the same class that al uses you keep your intelligence and personality same as when you shift with an earth charm the difference is the blending of you and wolf goes to the cellular level if there were two of you you could have pups with a witchs iq if you stayed a wolf through gestation my mouth dropped open i reached out to touch the page then drew back oh with casual interest she ran her finger down the list of ingredients all in latin this wont turn you into a were but this is how werewolves got started she said conversationally there was a fad about six millennia ago where demons would torment a human woman in payment for a vanity wish by forcing a demonwolfhuman pairing it always resulted in a human child that could were my eyes darted to her but she didnt notice my fear god howdisgusting and tragic for both the woman and child the shame of dealing with a demon would never fade always tied as it was to the love of a child id often wondered how the weres had gotten started since they werent from the everafter like witches and elves would you like me to make it for you ceri asked her green eyes placid i jerked my focus sharpening its okay to use nodding she reached under the counter for my smallest copper spell pot i dont mind i could do this one in my sleep making curses is what demon familiars do it will take all of thirty minutes seemingly unaware of my bewilderment she casually moved the curse book to the island counter demons arent any more powerful than witches she said but theyre prepared for anything so it looks like theyre stronger but al morphs so fast and into so many things i protested leaning against the counter tiny boots clicking ceri turned from one of my cupboards a wad of wolf s bane in her hand the stuff was toxic in large doses and i felt a twinge of worry al is a higher demon she said you could probably best a lesser surface demon with the earth magic you have in your charm cupboard though with enough prep work a surface demon is as powerful as al was she saying i could best al with my magic i didnt believe that for a second with a preoccupied grace ceri lit the sterno flame canister from a taper she started from the gas burner the stove served as my hearth fire since the pilot light was always burning and it made for a stable beginning to any spell ceri i protested i can do this sit she said or watch i want to be useful she smiled without showing her teeth sadness clouding her clear eyes where do you keep your blessed candles um in with the big silver serving spoons i said pointing doesnt everyone jenks swooped in gold sparkles sifting from him in agitation sorry about the lamp he muttered they will be washing the windows inside and out tomorrow thats okay it was ivys i said thinking they could break every light in the place if they wanted it was more than nice having them backit was right al is a walking pharmaceutical ceri said flipping to an index to check something and jenks made a hiccup of surprised sound thats why demons want familiars experienced in the craft familiars make the curses they use the demons kindling them to life taking them internally and holding them until invoking them with ley line magic with the first inklings of understanding i pulled another demon book out and rifled through it seeing the patterns in als magic so every time he morphs or does a charm or travels the lines he uses a curse or spell probably one that i made him ceri finished for me squinting as she snatched one of ivys pens and changed something in the text muttering a word of latin to make it stick traveling the lines puts a lot of blackness on your soul which is why theyre so angry when you call them al agreed to pay the price for pulling you through the first time and he wants information to compensate for the smut i glanced at the circular scar on my wrist there was a second one on the underside of my foot from newt the demon from whom id bought a trip home the last time i found myself stranded in the everafter nervous i hid that foot behind the other i hadnt told ceri because she was afraid of newt that she was terrified of the clearly insane demon and not al made me feel all warm and cozy i was never going to travel the lines again may i have a lock of your hair ceri asked surprising me taking the percent silver snippers id spent a small fortune on that she was extending to me now i cut a spaghettisized wad of hair from the nape of my neck im simplifying things she said when i handed it to her and you probably noticed he has a few shapes and spells that he enjoys more than others the british nobleman in a green coat i said and a delicate rose color came over ceri i wondered what the story behind that was but i wouldnt ask i spent three years doing nothing but twisting that curse she said fingers going slow from the ladle came jenkss attentiongetting wing clatter three years shes a thousand years old i said and his eyes widened ceri laughed at his disconcertion that isnt my normal span she said im aging now as are you jenkss wings blurred into motion then stilled i can live twenty years he said and i heard the frustration in his voice how about you ceri turned her solemn green eyes to me for guidance that elves were not entirely extinct was a secret i had told her to keep and while knowing her expected life span wouldnt give it away it could be used to piece the truth together i nodded and she closed her eyes in a slow blink of understanding about a hundred sixty years she said softly same as a witch i glanced uneasily between them while jenks fought to hide an unknown emotion i hadnt known how long elves lived and while i watched ceri weave my hair into an elaborate chain that looped back into itself i wondered how old trents parents had been when they had him a witch was fertile for about a hundred years with a twentyyear lag on one end and forty at the tail end i hadnt had a period in two years since things pretty much shut down unless there was a suitable candidate to stir things up and as much as i liked kisten he wasnt a witch to click the right hormones on seeing that elves had their origins in the everafter like witches i was willing to bet their physiologies were closer to witch than human as if feeling jenkss distress matalina flitted in trailing three of their daughters and an unsteady toddler jenks dear she said giving me an apologetic look the rain has slacked im going to move everyone out so rachel and ivy can have some peace jenkss hand dropped to his sword hilt i want to do a roombyroom check first no she flitted close and gave him a hovering kiss on the cheek she looked happy and content and i loved seeing her like that you stay here the seals werent tampered with my lower lip curled in to catch between my teeth jenks wasnt going to like my next move actually matalina id like you to stay if you could jenks jerked upward a sudden wariness in him as he joined her their wings somehow not tangling though they hovered side by side why he said flatly ah i glanced at ceri who was muttering latin and making gestures over my ring of hair at the center of a platesized pentacle she had sifted onto the counter with salt i stifled a feeling of worry knotting your hair made an unbreakable link to the donor the ring of twisted hair vanished with a pop replaced with a pile of ash apparently this was okay since she smiled and carefully brushed it and the salt into the shotglasssized spell pot rachel jenks prompted and i tore my gaze from ceri she had tapped a line and her hair was drifting in an unfelt breeze she might want a say in this next spell i said nervous i pulled the demon book closer and opened it to a page marked with the silk bookmark ivy had gotten on sale last week jenks hovered a good inch above the text and matalina gave a set of intent instructions to her daughters with a whining toddler in tow they darted out of the kitchen ceri i prompted cautiously not wanting to interrupt her is this one okay to do the elf blinked as if coming out of a trance nodding she pushed her sleeves to her elbows and crossed the room to the tengallon vat of saltwater i used to dissolution used amulets as i watched in surprise she dunked her hands into it arms coming up dripping wet i tossed her a dish towel wondering if i should start a similar practice fingers moving gracefully she dried her hands while she came to peer at the spell book on the table her eyes widened at the charm id found to make little things big for she started her gaze darting to jenks i nodded is it safe she bit her lips a pretty frown crossing her angular delicate face youd have to modify it with something to supplement bone mass maybe tweak the metabolism so its not burning so fast and then youd have to take the wings into account whoa jenks exclaimed darting to the ceiling no freaking way you arent doing anything to this little pixy no way no how ignoring him i watched matalina take a slow steady breath her hands clasped before her i turned to ceri can it be done oh yes she said much of it is ley line magic and you have the earth charm ingredients in your stock the hard part will be developing the supplemental curses to finetune it to limit his discomfort but i can do it no jenks cried augmen i know that one that means big im not going to get big you can forget it i like who i am and i cant do my job if im big he had retreated to where matalina was standing on the counter her wings unusually still and i gestured helplessly jenks i coaxed just listen no his voice was shrill as he pointed at me you are a freaky misguided crazyass witch im not doing this i straightened at the sound of the back door opening the curtains fluttered and i recognized ivys footsteps the smell of pizza mixed with the rich scent of wet garden and ivy came in looking like a frat boys fantasy in her raindamp sexinleather coat and a square box of pizza balanced on one hand short hair swinging she noisily dropped the box on the table taking in the room with a solemn quiet face she moved ceris rain cape to a different chair and the tension ratcheted up a notch if youre big i said while ivy got herself a plate you wont have to worry about the temperature fluctuations it could snow up there jenks no ivy flipped the top open and took a slice carefully putting it on a plate and retreating to her corner of the kitchen you want to make jenks big she said witches can do that uh i stammered not wanting to get into why my blood could kindle demon magic she can ceri said skirting the issue and food wont be a problem i blurted to keep the subject to jenks and off of me jenks bristled despite the gentle hand matalina put on his arm ive never had a problem keeping my family fed he said i never said you did the smell of the pizza was making me feel ill as my stomach knotted and i sat down but were talking almost five hundred miles if they are where i think they are and i dont want to have to stop every hour for you to fight off roadside park fairies so you can eat sugar water and peanut butter wont do it and you know that jenks took a breath to protest ivy ate her pizza scooting down in the chair and putting her heels on the table next to her keyboard her gaze shifting between jenks and me i tucked a red curl behind an ear hoping i wasnt pushing our delicate working relationship too far and you can see how the other side lives i said you wont have to wait for someone to open the door for you or use the phone hell you could drive his wings blurred into motion and matalina looked frightened look i said feeling uncomfortable why dont you and matalina talk it over i dont need to talk it over jenks said tightly im not going to do it my shoulders slumped but i was too afraid to push him further fine i said sourly excuse me i have to move my laundry covering my worry with a false anger i stomped out of the kitchen sneakers squeaking on the linoleum and then the hardwood floors as i went to my bathroom slamming the white enameled doors harder than i needed to i shifted kistens sweats to the dryer jenks didnt need them anymore but i wasnt going to give them back wet i wrenched the dial to dry punched the on button and heard the drier start to turn arms shoulder width apart i leaned over the dryer low temperatures would severely limit jenks after sunset another month and it wouldnt matter but may could be cold in michigan i pushed myself up resigned to dealing with it it was his choice resolute i padded toward the kitchen forcing the frown from me please jenks i heard ivy plead just before i turned the corner the unusual emotion in her voice jerking me to a stop she never let her emotions show like that rachel needs someone as a buffer between her and any vamp she runs into outside of cincinnati she whispered unaware that i could hear every vamp here knows ill kill them twice if they touch her but once shes out of my influence her unclaimed scar is going to make her fair game i cant go with her piscary she took a shaky breath hed be really pissed if i left his influence god jenks this is just about killing me i cant go with her you have to and you have to be big otherwise no one will take you seriously my face went cold and i put a hand to my scar crap i forgot about that i dont need to be big to protect her he said and i nodded i know that ivy said and she knows that but a bloodhungry vamp wont care and there might be more than one insides shaking i slowly backed up my fingers felt for the knob of my bathroom door and i yanked it closed slamming it as if id just gotten out then i briskly entered the kitchen not looking at anyone ceri was standing by my smallest spell pot with a finger stick in her hand what she wanted was obvious ivy was pretending to read her email and jenks was standing with a horrified look on his face matalina beside him so i guess were stopping every hour i said jenks swallowed hard ill do it really jenks i said trying to hide my guilt its okay you dont have to do this he flitted up hands on hips while he got in my face im doing this so shut the hell up and say thankyou feeling miserable and vulnerable i whispered thank you his wings clattered as he flitted shakily to matalina with a little huff she clutched at him her beautiful angel face looking scared when she turned him so his back was to me and they started to talk their words so highpitched and fast i couldnt follow with the practiced silence of a slave ceri eased close to set the spell pot with the were potion beside me she placed the finger stick next to it with a small click and backed away still upset i fumbled the sterile blade open and glanced at the brew it looked like cherry koolaid in the miniature copper pot thanks i muttered white or not using demon magic wasnt what i wanted to be known for the prick of the blade was a jolt and i massaged my finger three drops of my blood went plopping into the vat and the throatcatching scent of burnt amber rose as my blood kindled demon magic how nice is that my stomach quivered and i looked at it it wont invoke early i asked and ceri shook her head lifting the heavy tome she moved it in front of me here she said pointing this is the word of invocation it wont work unless youre connected to a line or you have enough everafter spindled to effect a change ive seen what you can hold and its enough this one hereshe pointed farther down the pageis the word to shift back i suggest not using it unless youre connected to a line youre adding to your mass on this second one not removing it and its hard to know how much energy to withhold from your spindle to make up for the imbalance its easier to connect to a line and let it balance itself saltwater wont break demon magic so dont forget the countercurse nervous i shifted my grip on the little copper pot it would be enough potion for seven earth charms but ley line magic was usually one spell per go i looked again at the word of invocation lupus pretty straightforward it wont work unless its inside of you ceri said sounding annoyed jenks flitted close hovering over the pages his gaze moved from the print to me how is she going to say the word to shift back if shes a wolf he asked and a flash of angst burned through me until i guessed it must be like any ley line charm that only required you to think it hard enough though shouting a word of invocation definitely added a measure of strength ceris green eyes narrowed saying it in her mind will be enough she said do you want me to put it in a pentagram to keep it fresh or are you going to take it now i raised the spell pot trying to smooth out my brow so i at least didnt look nervous it was just an elaborate disguise potion one that would make me furry and with big teeth if i was lucky id never have to invoke it i felt ivys attention on me and while everyone watched i downed it i tried not to taste it but the biting grit of ash and the bitter taste of tinfoil chlorophyll and salt puckered my lips oh god i said while ivy grabbed a second slice of pizza that tastes like crap i went to the dissolution vat and gave the empty spell pot a quick dunk before i set it in the sink the potion burned through me and i tried to stifle a shudder failing you okay ivy asked as i shivered and the pot rattled against the sink before i let it go fine i said my voice rough id just taken a demon spell voluntarily tonight i was peachy keen and tomorrow i would be taking the bus tour of the nicest parts of hell ceri hid a smile and i frowned at her what i snapped but she only smiled wider thats what al said whenever he took his potions swell i snarled going to sit at the table and pull the pizza closer i knew it was anxiety that was making me irritable and i tried to smooth my face out pretending it didnt bother me see matalina jenks coaxed and he flew to land beside her on the sill next to my beta its fine rachel took a demon spell and shes okay it will be easier this way and i wont die of the cold ill be just as big as she is it will be okay mattie i promise matalina rose in a column of silver sparkles she wrung her hands and stared at everyone for a moment her distress obvious and heartbreaking in an instant she was gone out into the rain through the pixy hole in the screen standing on the sill jenks let his wings droop i felt a flash of guilt then stifled it jenks was going whether i was with him or not and if he was big he would have a better chance of coming back in one piece but she was so upset it was hard not to feel like it was my fault okay i said the bite of pizza tasteless what do we do first for jenks ceris slight shoulders eased and she gripped her crucifix with what was clearly an unknowing gesture of contentment his curse will have to be specially tailored we should probably set a circle too this is going to be difficult six the harsh smell of lowgrade yarn dye didnt mix well with the luscious scent of leather and silk through it ran a dusky incense that soaked into me with each slow breath keeping my muscles loose and slack kisten my nose tickled and i pushed the afghan from my face snuggling deeper into the sound of his heartbeat i felt him shift and a sleepy part of me remembered we were in the living room on the couch lying like spoons my head was tucked under his chin and his arm was over my middle warm and secure rachel he whispered so softly that it barely stirred my hair mmmm i mumbled not wanting to move in the past eleven months id found that a vampires blood lust varied like tempers dependent upon stress temperament upbringing and when they had slaked it last i had gone into living with ivy as a roommate as a complete idiot turns out she had been on the extreme end of the hairyscary scale at the time being stressed about piscary wanting her to make me a toy or kill me acerbated by her guilt at her desire for blood and trying to abstain from it three years of abstinence made for a very anxious vamp i didnt want to know what ivy had been before going cold turkey to try to remake herself all i knew was she was much easier to live with now that she was taking care of business though it left her hating herself and feeling she was a failure every time she succumbed id found kisten to be on the other end with a laidback temperament to begin with and no issues about satisfying his blood lust and though i wouldnt feel comfortable napping in the same room with ivy i could snuggle up to kisten provided he took care of things beforehand and i didnt do jumping jacks in his sweatshirt i thought sourly rachel love he said again louder with a hint of pleading i could feel his muscles tense and his breathing quicken i think ceri is ready for you to kindle jenkss spell and as much as id love to pull blood from you it might be better if you did it yourself my eyes flew open and i stared at the bank of ivys electronic equipment she finished it i said and kisten grunted when my elbow pushed off his gut when i sat up my sock feet hit the rug and my eyes shot to the clock on the tv it was past noon i fell asleep i said seeing our pizzacruststrewn plates on the coffee table kist i complained you werent supposed to let me fall asleep he remained reclining on ivys gray suede couch his hair tousled and a content sleepy look to his eyes sorry he said around a yawn not looking sorry at all darn it i was supposed to be helping ceri it was bad enough she was doing my spelling for me to be sleeping when she did it was just rude he lifted one shoulder and let it fall she said to let you sleep giving him an exasperated sigh i tugged my jeans straight i hated it when i fell asleep in my clothes at least i had showered before dinner thinking it only fair i get rid of the lingering scent of wearing his sweatshirt ceri i said shuffling into the kitchen for crying out loud id wanted to have kistens borrowed van packed and be on the road by now ceri was sitting with her elbows on ivys antique table beside her was a pizza box empty but for a single slice and an untouched container of garlic dipping sauce her long wispy hair was the only movement floating in the chill breeze from the window the kitchen was cleaner than i ever managed when i did my spelling copper bowls stacked neatly in the sink the grit of salt under my feet from where she had made a circle and a scattering of ley line magic paraphernalia and earth magic herbs a demon book was open on the center counter and the purple candle i burned last halloween guttered even as i watched the early afternoon sun was a bright swath of light coming in the window past the drifting curtains pixies shrieked and played shredding the fairy nest in the ash tree with a savage enthusiasm jenks was sitting on the table slumped against ceris halfempty cup of tea ceri i said reaching to touch her shoulder her head jerked up o di immortals gally she said clearly not awake my apologies your curse is ready ill have your tea directly jenks took to the air in a clattering of wings and my attention shot from him to her ceri i repeated frightened she called algaliarept gally the young woman stiffened then dropped her head into her hands again god help me rachel she said her words muffled for a moment my hand slipped from her shoulder she had thought she was back with al im sorry i said feeling even more guilty i fell asleep and kisten didnt wake me are you okay she turned a thin smile on her heartshaped face her green eyes were tired and weary i was sure she hadnt slept since yesterday afternoon and she looked ready to drop im fine she lisped faintly clearly not embarrassed i sat before her jeez ceri i could have done something im fine she repeated her eyes on the ribbon of smoke spiraling up from the candle jenks helped me with the plants hes very knowledgeable eyebrows rising i watched jenks tug his green silk gardening jacket down you think im going to take a spell without knowing whats in it he said jenks helped you make it i asked she shrugged it doesnt matter who makes it as long as you kindle it pale face smiling tiredly she nodded to the potion and finger stick moving slowly i rose and went to jenkss spell the crack of the safety seal on the finger stick breaking was loud use your jupiter finger ceri advised it will add the strength of your will to it it made a difference i wondered feeling ill from more than lack of sleep as i pricked my finger for three drops of blood kisten stirred in the living room when they went plopping into the spell pot and the scent of burnt amber rose jenkss wings blurred to motion and i held my breath waiting for something to happen nothing but i had to say the magic words first done ceri said slumping where she sat my eyes went to kistens lanky form when he strode into the kitchen barefoot and rumpled afternoon ladies he said pulling the pizza box closer and dropping the last stiff slice on a plate he wasnt the first guy to have a toothbrush at my sink but he was the only one to have kept it there this long and i felt good seeing him here in his disheveled untuckedshirt state content and comfortable coffee i asked and he nodded clearly not functioning on all levels yet as he dragged the plate from the table and headed into the hall scratching the bristles on his jawline i jumped when kisten pounded on ivys door and shouted ivy get up heres your breakfast rachel is leaving and youd better hurry if you want to see jenks change so much for coffee toast juice and a flower i thought hearing ivys voice rise in disgust before kisten shut her door and cut off her complaints ceri looked mystified and i shook my head to tell her it wasnt worth explaining i went to clean the coffeemaker turning the water to a trickle when kisten thunked my bathroom door shut and my shower started so we going to do this jenks i prompted while i swirled the water around his wings shading to blue jenks landed by the shotglasssized cup of brew i drink it ceri nodded once its in you rachel will invoke it nothing will happen until then all of it i asked eyes widening its like what a gallon in pixy terms jenks shrugged i drink that much sugar water for breakfast he said and my brow furrowed if he drank like that we might be stopping every hour anyway my fingers fumbled to unroll the coffee bag and the dark scent of grounds hit me thick and comforting i measured out what i needed into the new filter then added a smidgen more while i surreptitiously watched jenks procrastinate finally he scuffed his boots on the counter and spooned out a pixysized portion with a tiny glass he downed the dripping cup in one go making a face when he lowered the cup i flipped the coffeemaker on and leaned against the counter arms crossed what does it taste like i asked remembering the demon spell already in me i was hoping he didnt say it tasted like my blood uh jenks scooped out another cupful it tastes like the garden in the fall when people have been burning their leaves dead ashes i thought greeeeeat chin high he swallowed it then turned to me for the love of tink you arent going to stand there and watch me are you grimacing i pushed myself from the counter can i make you some tea i asked ceri not wanting to look like i was watching but not wanting to leave either what if he had a reaction or something with a barely perceivable motion ceri regained her upright posture my offer seeming to turn on an entirely new set of behaviors yes thank you she said carefully i returned to the sink and filled the kettle wincing at jenkss tiny belch and groan the sound of running water seemed to revive ceri and she rose moving about the kitchen to put things away i can do that i protested and she watched my eyes go to the clock above the sink crap it was getting late so can i she said you have a long way to drive and all i have to do is she looked sourly about the kitchen i dont have anything to do but sleep i should be thanking you it was exhilarating to craft such a complex curse its one of my best efforts her pride was obvious and after the burner ignited under the kettle i stood against the counter and watched jenks belch and recite his abcs at the same time would the mans talents never end curiosity finally prompted me to ask what was it like being his familiar ceri seemed to grow drowsy as she stood in the sun at the sink and washed her teacup he is domineering and cruel she said softly head down as she watched her thin hands but my origins made me unique he enjoyed showing me off and so kept me well once i became pliant he often gave me favors and courtesies that most remained ignorant of my thoughts returned to her embarrassment when speaking of als favorite appearance of a british nobleman they had been together for a thousand years and there were countless cases of captives becoming enamored of their captors and that nickname i tried to meet her eyes but she avoided it ill be back jenks said patting his stomach this stuff makes you pee like a toad i cringed as he took to the air and flew heavily past ceri and out the pixy hole in the screen a glance at the spell pot brought my eyebrows up it was half gone damn the man could slam it faster than a frat boy i made anywhere from thirty to fifty curses a day ceri said taking a rag from the sink and wiping the island counter free of salt apart from warming his bed and putting food on his table every seventh day he would work in the lab with me expanding my knowledge this charm eyes distant she touched the counter beside the remaining brew this one we would have spent all day with going slow so he could explain the complexities of mixing curses those daysi almost felt good about myself clasping my hands about my middle i felt cold at the hint of wistfulness to her voice she nearly seemed to regret she wasnt working in a demon sweatshop anymore eyes distant she took the boiling water from the stove and poured it into a small teapot jenks returned without comment settling before the brew with his little cup the hair on the back of my neck pricked and ivy came in with a soft scuffing hands busy tucking her shirt behind her jeans not meeting anyones eyes she shuffled to the coffeemaker and poured two mugs even as the last drips spilled onto the hot plate to sizzle i looked up in surprise when she hesitantly set one beside me kistens words echoed through my thoughts as i watched her sit at her computer reading the tension in her shoulders when she jabbed the on button and hit the shortcut to her mail what hed said about her leaning on me more than him because i didnt know her past tightened my gut i looked at her as she sat at the far end of the kitchen distant but a part of the group her perfect face was quiet and still not a glimmer of her savage past showing a chill went through me at what might lie beneath it what might come out if i left her just how bad had it been ivy looked from her monitor her eyes fastening on me from under her short bangs my gaze dropped good lord it was only for a few days thanks for the coffee i said uncurling my fingers and lacing them about the warm ceramic while i steeled my emotions i had to go nick and jax needed help id be back she said nothing her face showing no emotion a screen of new emails came in one after the other and she began winnowing through them nervous i turned to ceri i really appreciate this i said thinking of the long drive ahead if it wasnt for your help i wouldnt even try it im just glad its not a black charm i added white or not using demon magic was not what i wanted to be known for in her spot in the sun ceri stiffened um rachel she said and my heart seemed to skip a beat my head slowly lifted and my mouth went dry jenks stopped with his cup halfway to his mouth he met my eyes his wings going absolutely still its a black charm i said my voice squeaky at the end well its demon magic she said sounding apologetic theyre all black she looked between jenks and me mystified i thought you knew that seven i took a shaky breath and reached for the counter it was black i had taken a black charm this just keeps getting better and better why in hell hadnt she told me hell no jenks rose in a flurry of coppercolored sparkles just forget it ivy forget it im not doing this while ivy snarled at jenks that he would or shed jam him through a keyhole backward i wobbled to the table and slumped into my chair ceri was so odd seemingly as innocent as joan of arc but as accepting of black magic as if she sat at lucifers feet and did his nails every other wednesday they were all black and she didnt see anything wrong with them come to think of it joan of arc had heard voices in her head telling her to kill people rachel ceris hand on my shoulder pulled my head up and i stared i uh i muttered i kinda expected they were black but you didnt seem to be having any problem making them so i looked at the remainder of jenkss potion wondering if he quit now whether hed be okay he needs this curse ceri gracefully sat so i couldnt see jenks and ivy arguing at the far end of the table and the smut from one or two is trifling matalina zipped in through the pixy hole in the screen at one of jenkss sharp squeaks bringing the smell of the spring noon with her her yellow dress swirled prettily about her ankles when she came to a short stop her expression inquisitive as she tried to figure out what was going on i couldnt seem to get enough air trifling didnt she get it what if i only use them for good i tried will they still stain my soul if i only do good with them matalinas wings stopped and she dropped three inches to the table losing her balance and falling to bend a wing backward ceri exhaled in obvious exasperation youre severely breaking the laws of nature with these curses she lectured her green eyes narrow far more than with earth or line magic on their own it doesnt matter if theyre used for good or bad the smut on your soul is the same if you mess with natures books you pay a price my eyes flicked past her to matalina and jenks the small pixy woman had found her feet and she had a hand on jenkss shoulder as he hunched over his knees he was hyperventilating by the look of it pixy dust shading to red sifting from him to pool and spill onto the floor it swirled in the draft from the window and it would have been pretty if i hadnt known that it meant he was severely stressed ivys lips were a thin line i didnt understand why she was arguing with him i didnt expect him to go through with it if it was a black curse damn it ceri had been calling them curses all along and i hadnt been listening but i dont want my soul to go black i almost whined i just got rid of als aura ceris delicate features went annoyed and she stood then get rid of it jenkss head came up his eyes looking frightened rachel is not a black witch he shouted and i wondered at his hot loyalty shes not going to foster it off on an innocent i never said she should ceri said bristling ceri i said hesitantly listening to matalina try to soothe her husband isnt there another way to get rid of the reality imbalance than to pass it to someone else clearly aware of jenks ready to fly at her ceri calmly went to her brewed tea no once you make it the only way to get rid of it is to pass it to someone else but im not suggesting you give it to an innocent people will accept it voluntarily if you sweeten the deal i didnt like the sound of that why would someone voluntarily take my blackness onto their soul i said and the elf sighed visibly biting back her annoyance tact wasnt in her repertoire despite her kindness and overflowing goodwill you attach it to something they want rachel she said a spell or task information my eyes widened as i figured it out like a demon i said and she nodded oh god my stomach hurt the only way to get rid of it would be to trick people into taking it like a demon ceri stood at my sink the morning sun streaming about her making her look like a princess in jeans and a black and gold sweater its a good option she said blowing at her tea to hasten its cooling i have too much imbalance to rid myself of it that way but perhaps if i forayed into the everafter and rescued people stolen and still in possession of their souls they might take a hundred years of my imbalance in return for the chance to be free of the everafter ceri i protested frightened and she raised a soothing hand im not going into the everafter she said but if the opportunity ever arose that i could help free someone will you tell me ivy stirred and jenks interrupted her with a hot rache is not going into the everafter hes right i said and i rose my knees feeling weak i cant ask anyone to take the black i put on my soul just forget it my fingers encircled the remainder of jenkss potion and i headed for my dissolution vat im not a black witch matalina heaved a sigh of relief and even jenks relaxed his feet settling into a puddle of silver sparkles on the table only to jerk upward when ceri slammed her hand onto the counter you listen to me and listen good she shouted shocking me and making ivy jerk i am not evil because i have a thousand years of demon smut on my soul she exclaimed the tips of her hair trembling and her face flushed every time you disturb reality nature has to balance it out the black on your soul isnt evil its a promise to make up for what you have done its a mark not a death sentence and you can get rid of it given time ceri im sorry i fumbled but she wasnt listening youre an ignorant foolish stupid witch she berated and i cringed my grip tightening on the copper spell pot and feeling the anger from her like a whip are you saying that because i carry the stink of demon magic that im a bad person no i wedged in that god will show no pity she said green eyes flashing that because i made one mistake in fear that led to a thousand more that i will burn in hell no ceri i took a step forward my soul is black she said her fear showing in her suddenly pale cheeks ill never be rid of it all before i die ill suffer for it but it wont be because im a bad person but because i was a frightened one thats why i dont want to do this i pleaded she took a breath as if only now realizing she had been shouting closing her eyes she seemed to steady herself the anger had been reduced to a slow shimmer in the back of her green eyes when she opened them her usual mild countenance made it difficult to remember that she had once been royalty and accustomed to command ivy took a wary sip of her coffee her eyes never moving from ceri kistens shower went off and the ensuing silence seemed loud im sorry ceri said head down the sheet of her fair hair hiding her face i shouldnt have raised my voice i set the copper pot on the counter dont worry about it i said like you said im an ignorant witch her smile was sour and showed a mild embarrassment no you arent you cant know what you havent been told she ran her hands down her jeans soothing herself perhaps im more concerned than i want to admit about the payment i carry she admitted seeing you worry about one or two curses when i have several million on my soul made me she flushed delicately and i wondered if her ears were a tiny bit pointed i was most unfair to you her voice had acquired a noble cadence behind me i heard ivy cross her legs at her knees forget it i said feeling cold rachel ceri hid her hands trembling by clasping them the blackness these two curses carry is so small compared to the benefits that will come from it jenks safely journeying to help his son you using a demon curse to were so as to retain the title of davids alpha that you deserve it would be more of a crime to let these things remain undone or slip away than to willingly accept the price to have them she touched the pot of remaining brew and i eyed it with a sick feeling i was not going to ask jenks to finish it everything of value or strength has a price she continued to let jax and nick continue to suffer because you were afraid makes you lookunconscionably timid cowardly might be a better word i thought looking at jenks and feeling ill knowing that i had a curse inside me just waiting to be put into playand i had done it to myself ill take the black for my curse jenks said abruptly his face hard with determination from the table came matalinas tiny hiccup and i saw fear in her childlike features she loved jenks more than life itself no i said youve only got a few years left to get rid of it and its my idea my spell my curse ill take it jenks flew up in my face his wings red and his face severe shut up he shouted and i jerked back so i could focus on him hes my son i take the curse i pay the price there was the sound of my bathroom door opening and kisten ambled into the kitchen his shirt rumpled and with a sly smile his hair was slicked back and his damp stubbled face caught the sun he looked great and he knew it but his confidence faltered when he saw ivy unhappy at her computer jenks and matalina clearly distressed me undoubtedly looking scared with my hands wrapped around my middle and of course ceris exasperated expression as she once again found herself trying to convince the plebeians that she knew what was best for them what did i miss he asked going to the coffeemaker and pouring what was left into one of my oversized mugs ivy pushed her chair out and looked sullen theyre demon curses its going to leave a mark on rachels soul jenks is having second thoughts i am not the small pixy shouted but ill kiss a fairys ass before i let rachel pay the price for my curse kisten slowly tucked his shirttails in and sipped his coffee his eyes went everywhere and he breathed deeply absorbing the scents of the room and using them to read the situation jenks i protested then made a sound of defeat when he flew to the last of the potion and drank it his throat moving as he gulped it down matalina dropped to the table her wings unmoving she was a small spot of brightness looking more alone than id ever seen her while she watched her husband put his life in jeopardy for my safety and that of their son the kitchen was silent but for the sound of his kids in the garden when he belligerently dropped his pixysized cup into the spell pot with a dull clang i guess thats it then i said gathering myself and leaning so i could glimpse the clock above the sink i didnt like this not at all looking as if she was desperately trying not to cry matalina rubbed her wings together to make a piercing whistle which gave us all of three seconds before what looked like jenkss entire family flowed into the kitchen from the hallway the sharp scent of ashes came in with them and i realized they had come in down the chimney out jenks shouted i said you could watch from the door in a swirl of disney nightmare his brood settled on the top of the door frame shrieks scraped the inside of my skull as they shoved each other vying for the best vantage point ivy and kisten cringed visibly and jenks made another whistle of admonishment they obediently settled whispering at my threshold of hearing ivy swore under her breath her face taking on a dark cast his tall stature graceful kisten crossed the kitchen to stand beside her pouring half his coffee into her mug to try to pacify her she wasnt at her best until at least sundown okay jenks i said thinking that willfully twisting a demon curse was spectacularly stupid and that id never hear the end of it if it killed me what would my mother say ready the pixies lining the door frame squealed and matalina flitted to him her pretty face pale be careful love she whispered and i looked away when they exchanged a last embrace the two of them rising slowly in a cloud of gold sparkles before they parted she went to the sill wings moving fitfully to make glittering flashes of light this was all but killing her and i felt guilty even though it was probably the best way to ensure his safety standing beside matalina in the sun ceri nodded confidently kisten put a supportive hand atop ivys shoulder taking a breath i went to the table nervously settling myself at my usual spot and pulling the demon book of spells onto my lap it was heavy and my blood hummed in my legs almost as if it was trying to reach the pages oh theres a nice thought whats going to happen jenks asked fidgeting as he landed on the center counter and i turned sideways in the chair so i could see him i licked my lips and looked at the print it was in latin but ceri and i had gone over it while eating pizza before i fell asleep the demon magic for idiots version please he added and a thin smile crossed me i tap a line and say the words of invocation i said to shift you back i say it again same as with the wereing charm thats it his eyes were wide and ceri sniffed you did want the short version she said moving everything off the island counter and to the sink i did a horrendous amount of prep work to make it that easy master pixy his wings drooped sorry ivy held her arms close to her and frowned her aggression clearly misplaced worry can we get on with this she asked and i dropped my head to the print again exhaling i stretched my awareness past the clapboard walls of the kitchen past the flower beds already feeling the light presence of pixies to the small underused ley line running through the graveyard touching it with a finger of thought i stifled a tremor at the jolt of connection it used to be that the flow of force into me had been slow and sedate not anymore the surge of energy coursed through me backwashing through me in an uncomfortable sensation it settled into my chi with the warmth and satisfaction of hot chocolate i could pull out more and spindle it in my head to use later but i didnt need it so i let the heavy resonating wash of energy find its way out of me and back into the line i was a net through which the ley line ran flowing free but for what i pulled out it all happened in the time between one heartbeat and the next and i lifted my head my eyes closed my hair was moving in the wind that always seemed to be blowing in the everafter and i ran a hand over my loose curls to tame them i thanked god that it was daylight and i couldnt see even a shadow of the everafter unless i stood right in a line which i wasnt i hate it when she taps a line ivy whispered to kisten in the corner you ever see anything freakier than that you should see the face she makes when she shut up kist i exclaimed my eyes flashing open to find him grinning at me standing with her teacup perched in her fingers and the sun streaming in around her ceri was trying to keep a scholarly air about her but the snicker on her face ruined it is it going to hurt jenks asked gold pixy dust sifting from him in a steady stream i thought back to the gutwrenching pain when i had turned into a mink and cringed close your eyes and count down from ten i said ill hit you with it when you get to zero he took a breath dark lashes fluttering against his cheeks his wings slowly stilled until he came to a rest on top of the cleared island counter tennine he said his voice steady setting the book on the table i stood light and unreal from the line running through me i reached out and put a hand over him my knees were shaking and i hoped that no one saw it demon magic god save me i took another breath non sum qualis eram i said eight ivy gasped and i staggered when jenks was encased in the swirl of gold everafter that had dropped from my hand to encompass him jenks matalina cried flying up into the utensils my breath was crushed out of me stumbling i put a hand behind me searching for support i gasped when a torrent of line energy slammed into me and i shoved the helping hands away my head seemed to expand and i cried out when the line exploded out of me and hit jenks with a crack that had to be audible i fell finding myself on the kitchen floor with ivys arms under my shoulders as she eased me down i couldnt breathe as i struggled to remember how to make my lungs work i heard a crash in the hanging utensils followed by a groan and a thump sweet mother of tink a new lightly masculine voice said im dying im dying matalina my heart isnt beating i took a clean breath then another propped up in ivys grip i was hot then cold and i couldnt see clearly looking up past the edge of the counter i found kisten beside ceri frozen as if unable to decide what to do i pushed ivys hand off me and sat up when i realized what had laid me out it wasnt the force of the line i had channeled but the shitload of intenttopayback that i had just laid on my soul i had it not jenks and it was going to stay that way heart pounding i got to my feet my mouth dropping open when i saw jenks on the counter ohmygod i whispered jenks turned to me his eyes wide and frightened angular face pinched he looked at the ceiling chest heaving as he hyperventilated ceri was at the sink beaming beside me ivy stared shocked kisten wasnt much better matalina was in tears and pixy children were flying around someone got tangled in my hair pulling me back to reality anyone younger than fifteenout of the kitchen i shouted someone get me a paper bag ivy go get a towel for jenks you think youd never seen a naked man before ivy jerked into motion not one sitting on my counter she muttered walking out jenkss eyes were wide in panic as i snatched the bag kisten handed me shaking it open i puffed into it here i said breath into this rache he gasped his face pale and his shoulder cold when i touched him he flinched then let me hold the bag to his face my heart he said his words muffled around the bag somethings wrong rache turn me back im dying smiling i held the bag to him as he sat on my counter stark naked and hyperventilating thats how slow it beats i said and you dont have to breathe so fast slow down i soothed close your eyes take a breath count to three let it out count to four shove it up your ass he said hunching into himself and starting to shake the last time you told me to close my eyes and count from ten look what happened to me ivy returned draping the first towel over his lap and the second over his shoulders he was calming down his eyes roving over the kitchen darting from the ceiling to the open archway his breath caught when he saw the garden through the window holy crap he whispered and i pulled the bag away he might not look like jenks but he sounded like him better i said taking a step back his head bobbed and as he sat on the counter and concentrated on breathing we stood with our mouths hanging open taking in a sixfoot pixy in a word he wasdamn jenks had said he was eighteen and he looked it a very athletic eighteen with wide innocent eyes a smooth young face and a blond shock of curly hair all tousled and needing to be arranged his wings were gone leaving only wide shoulders and the lean muscles that had once supported them he had a trim waist and his feet dangling to the floor were long and narrow they were perfectly shaped and my eyebrows rose id seen his feet before and one had been terribly misshapen i silently cataloged the rest of him realizing all his scars were gone even the one hed gotten from fairy steel his incredibly defined abs were smooth and perfect making him utterly lanky with the clean smoothness of late adolescence every part of him was lean with a long strength there wasnt a fleck of hair on him anywhere but for his eyebrows and atop his head i knew i had looked his gaze met mine from under his mussed bangs and i blinked taken by them ceri had green eyes but jenkss were shockingly green like new leaves they were narrowed with anxiety but even the fading fear couldnt hide his youth sure he had a wife and fiftyfour kids but he looked like a college freshman a yummy college freshman majoring in ohmygodigottagetmesomeofthat jenks rubbed his head where he had hit the overhanging rack matalina he said the cadence of his voice familiar but the sound of it odd oh matalina he breathed when she dropped to land on his shaking hand youre beautiful jenks she said hiccuping im so proud of you i shhhh he said his face twisting in heartache when he found himself unable to touch her please dont cry mattie its going to be okay i promise my eyes warmed with unshed tears as she played with the folds of her dress im sorry i promised myself i wasnt going to cry i dont want you to see me cry she darted up zipping out into the hall jenks made a move to follow probably forgetting he didnt have wings anymore he leaned forward and fell to the floor face first jenks i shouted when he hit with a dull smack and started swearing le go let go of me he exclaimed slapping at me as he wedged his legs under him only to fall back down his towel fell away and he struggled to hold it in place and stand up all at the same time damn it all to hell why cant i balance right his face went ashen and he quit struggling crap i gotta pee again i looked pleadingly at kisten the living vamp swung into motion easily dodging jenkss flailing arms and hoisting him up off the floor by his shoulders jenks was taller by four inches but kisten had done bouncer work at his club come on jenks he said moving him into the hallway ive got some clothes you can put on falling down is a lot more comfortable when you have something between your ass and the carpet matalina jenks called in panic from the hall protesting as kisten manhandled him to my bathroom hey i can walk i just forgot i didnt have wings leme go i can do this i jumped at the sound of kisten shutting the bathroom door nice ass jenks ivy said into the new silence shaking her head she picked up the second towel jenks had left behind folding it as if needing to give herself something to do my breath came from me in a long exhalation that i said to ceri has got to be the most fantastic charm ive ever seen ceri beamed and i realized shed been worried waiting for my approval curse she said her eyes on her teacup as she blushed thank you she added modestly i wrote it down in the back with all the supplemental curses worked in on the chance youd want to use it again the countercurse is included just as its supposed to be all you have to do is tap a line and say the words countercurse i thought morosely wondering if that meant more black on my soul or if i had taken it all already um thanks ceri youre incredible ill never be able to do a charm that complex thank you she stood in front of the window and sipped her tea looking pleased you returned me my soul rachel mariana morgan making your life easier is a small thing ivy made a rude sound and dropped the folded towel on the table she didnt seem to know what to do next my soul my poor tarnished blackening soul my mouth went dry as the enormity of what i had done fell on me shit i was playing with the black arts no not the black artswhich you could go to jail forbut demonic arts they didnt even have laws for people practicing demonic arts i felt cold then hot not only had i just put a bunch of black on my soul but i had called it a good thing not bad oh god i was going to be sick rachel i sank down into my chair feeling shaky ceri had her hand on my shoulder but i hardly felt it ivy was shouting something and ceri was telling her to sit down and be still that it was just the delayed shock of taking on so much reality imbalance and that i was going to be okay okay i thought putting my head on the table before i fell over maybe rhombus i whispered feeling the eyeblinkfast connection to the line and the protective circle rise around me ceri leapt forward joining me before it finished forming i had practiced this ley line charm for three months and it was white magic damn it not black rachel ivy cried as the shimmering band of everafter wavered into existence between us i pulled my head up determined not to spew i wanted to see what i had done to my soul and though i couldnt see my aura i could see a reflection of the damage in the shimmering band of everafter god help me i whispered feeling my face go cold rachel its all right ceri was crouched before me her hand gripping mine trying to get me to look at her youre seeing an artificially inflated shade it hasnt had a chance to soak in yet it really isnt that bad soak in i said my voice cracking i dont want it to soak in my aura had turned the usually red sheen of everafter to black hidden in it was a shimmer of gold from my aura looking like an aged patina i swallowed hard i would not spew i would not spew it will get better i promise i met her eyes the panic subsiding it would get better ceri said so i had to believe her rachel ivy cried standing helplessly outside the circle take this down my head hurt and i couldnt get enough air sorry i breathed breaking my link with the line the sheet of everafter flickered and vanished and i felt a surge through me when i emptied my chi i didnt want anything extra in me right now i was too full of blackness looking embarrassed ivy forced the tension from her shoulders she blinked several times trying to recapture her usual placid calmness when i knew what she wanted to do was give me a slap and tell me i was being stupid or give me a hug and tell me it was going to be okay but she couldnt do either so she just stood there looking miserable i gotta go i said abruptly surging to my feet ceri gracefully stood and got out of my way but ivy reached for me rachel wait she protested and i hesitated vision swimming as she gripped my elbow i couldnt stay there i felt like a leper in a house of innocents a pariah among nobles i was covered in blackness and this time it was all mine jenks i shouted yanking out of ivys grip and heading for my room lets go rachel what are you doing i went to my room scuffed my shoes on grabbed my bag and pushed past her and into the hall exactly what i had planned i said ignoring her pacing far too close behind me you havent had anything to eat she said youre still reeling from invoking thatspell it wont kill you to sit down and have a cup of coffee there was a thump from my bathroom followed by kistens muffled exclamation the door crashed open and i stopped kisten was leaning against the washer face contorted in pain as he tried to catch his breath jenks was holding the door frame looking casual in kistens gray and black sweats but his green eyes were stressed sorry he said sounding as if he meant it i uh slipped he ran his eyes up and down my haggard appearance ready to go i could feel ivy behind me here i said extending my suitcase make yourself useful and get this in the van he blinked then grinned to show even very white teeth yeah i can carry that i handed it over and jenks stumbled at the weight his head thunked into the wall of the narrow hallway bloody hell he exclaimed crashing into the opposite wall when he overcompensated im all right he said quickly waving off any help im all right sweet mother of tink the damn walls are so close its like walking in a freaking anthill i watched to make sure he was going to be okay reaching out when he started weaving once he lost the guidance of the walls and was in the open space of the sanctuary his kids were with him adding to the noise as they shouted encouragement and advice hoping he took the time to walk down the steps instead of trying to jump them i headed for the kitchen ivy was hot on my heels kisten close behind quiet and pensive rachel ivy said and i stood in my kitchen and stared at ceri trying to remember why i had come in there im going with you no you arent oh yeah my stuff i grabbed my shoulder bag with its usual charms then opened the pantry for one of the canvas carry bags ivy used when she went shopping if you leave piscary will slip into your head kisten then she said desperation creeping into her graysilk voice you cant go alone im not going alone jenks is with me i jammed the three demon books into the bag then bent to get my splat gun from under the counter where i kept it at crawling height i didnt know what i would need but if i was going to use demon magic i was going to use demon magic my chest clenched and i held my breath to keep the tears from starting what in hell was wrong with me jenks can hardly stand up ivy said as i ran a hand through my charm cupboard and scooped them all into my shoulder bag pain amulets generic disguise charmsyeah those would be good i pulled myself to a stop heart pounding as i looked at her distress youre not feeling right ivy said im not letting you walk out of here alone im fine i said trembling and im not alone jenks is with me my voice rose and kistens eyes went round jenks is all the backup i need he is all the backup i ever needed the only time i screw up royally is when hes not with me and you have no right to question his competency ivys mouth snapped shut that not what i meant she said and i pushed past her and into the hall i almost ran jenks down and realized that hed heard the whole thing i can carry that he said softly and i handed the bag of demon texts to him his balance bobbled but his head didnt hit the wall like last time he headed down the dark hall limping breath fast i walked into ivys room kneeling on the floor by her bed and pulling her sword out from where id seen her tuck it once rachel she protested from the hallway as i straightened up gripping the wickedly sharp katana safe in its sheath can i take this i asked shortly and she nodded thanks jenks needed a sword so he couldnt walk without running into things hed get better and then hed need a sword kisten and ivy trailed behind me as i slung the sword over my shoulder to hang with my bag and stomped down the hall i had to be angry if i wasnt angry i was going to fall apart my soul was black i was doing demon magic i was turning into everything i feared and hated and i was doing it to save someone who had lied and left me to make my partners son a thief leaning into my bathroom in passing i snapped my vanity case shut jenks was going to need a toothbrush hell he was going to need a wardrobe but i had to get out of there if i didnt keep moving i was going to realize just how deep into the shit i had fallen rachel wait ivy said after i reached the foyer snatched my leather jacket from its hook and opened the door rachel stop i halted on the stoop the spring breeze lifting my hair and the birds chirping my bag and ivys sword hanging from my shoulder my vanity case in one hand and my coat over an arm at the curb jenks was fiddling with the vans sliding door opening and closing it like a new toy the sun glistened in his hair and his kids flitted about his head heart pounding i turned framed in the open door ivy looked haunted her usually placid face severe with panic in her dilated eyes i bought a laptop for you she said her eyes dropping as she extended it oh god she had given me a piece of her security thank you i whispered unable to breathe as i accepted it it was in a leather case and probably weighed all of three pounds its registered to you she said looking at it as i slung it over my free shoulder and i already added you onto my system so all you have to do is plug in and click i wrote down a list of local numbers for the cities youre going to be passing through to dial up with thank you i whispered she had given me a piece of what made her life sane ivy ill be back it was what nick had said to me but id come back it wasnt a lie for me impulsively i set my case on the stoop and leaned forward to give her a hug she froze and then hugged me back the dusky scent of her filled my senses and i stepped away kisten waited quietly behind her only now seeing ivy standing there with one arm hanging down and the other clasped around her middle did i understand what hed been trying to tell me she wasnt afraid for me she was afraid for herself that she might slip into old patterns without me there to remind her who she wanted to be just how bad had it been ire flashed through me damn it this wasnt fair yeah i was her friend but she could take care of herself ivy i said i dont want to go but i have to then go she exploded her perfect face creasing in anger and her eyes flashing to black i never asked you to stay motions stiff she spun with a vamp quickness and yanked open the door to the church it boomed shut behind her and left me blinking i looked at it thinking that this wasnt good no she hadnt asked me but kisten had kisten picked up my case and together we went down the stairs my laces flapping nearing the van i awkwardly dug in my shoulder bag for the keys then hesitated by the drivers side door when i remembered kisten hadnt yet given them to me they jingled as he held them out from inside the van came the excited shrieks of pixies youll keep an eye on her i asked him scouts honor his blue eyes were pinched from more than the sun im taking some time off jenks came from around the front of the van silently taking my coat vanity bag and the swordthe last bringing a growl of anticipation from him i waited until i heard the sliding door shut then slumped at the sound of jenkss passengerside door closing kisten i said feeling a twinge of guilt shes a grown woman why are we treating her like an invalid he reached out and took my shoulders because she is because piscary can drop into her mind and force her to do just about anything and it kills a piece of her every time he does because he has filled her with his own blood lust making her do things she doesnt want to do because she is trying to run his illegal businesses out of a sense of duty and maintain her share of your runner firm out of a sense of love yeah thats what i thought my lips pressed together and i straightened i never said i would stay in the church much less cincinnati keeping her together is not my job youre right he said calmly but it happened but it shouldnt have damn it kisten all i wanted to do was help her you have he said kissing my forehead shell be fine but ivy making you her lodestone wouldnt have evolved if you hadnt let it and you know it my shoulders slumped swell just what i needed guilt the breeze shifted his bangs and i hesitated looking at the oak door between ivy and me how bad was it i whispered kistens face lost all emotion piscary he exhaled piscary worked her over so well those first few years that her parents sent her away for her last two years of high school hoping he would lose interest she came back even more confused thanks to skimmer his eyes narrowed in an old anger still potent that woman could have saved ivy with her love but she was so driven by the urge for better blood hotter sex that she sent ivy deeper i felt cold the breeze shifting my curls id known this but there was obviously more seeing my unease kisten frowned when she returned piscary played on her new vulnerabilities lapping up her misery when he rewarded her for behavior that went contrary to what she wanted to believe eventually she abandoned everything to keep from going insane turning herself off and letting piscary make her into whatever he wanted she started hurting people she loved when they were at their most vulnerable and when they abandoned her she started enticing innocents dropping his eyes kisten looked to his bare feet i knew he was one of the people she had hurt and i could tell he felt guilty for leaving her you couldnt do anything i said and his head jerked up anger in his eyes it was bad rachel he said i should have done something instead i turned my back on her and walked away she wont tell me but i think she killed people to satisfy her blood lust god i hope it was by accident i swallowed hard but he wasnt done yet for years she ran rampant he said staring at the van but his eyes unfocused as if looking into the past she was a living vampire functioning as an undead walking under the sun as beautiful and seductive as death piscary made her that way and her crimes were given amnesty the favored child he said the last with bitterness and his gaze dropped to me i dont know what happened but one day i found her on my kitchen floor covered in blood and crying i hadnt seen her in years but i took her in piscary gave her some peace and after a while she got better i think it was so she wouldnt kill herself too soon for his liking all i know is she found a way to deal with the blood lust chaining it somehow by mixing it with love and then she met you and found the strength to say no to it all kisten looked at me his hand touching my hair she likes herself now youre right that she isnt going to throw it all away just because you arent here its just he squinted his gaze going distant again it was bad rachel it got better and when she met you she found a core of strength that piscary hadnt been able to warp i just dont want to see it break i was shaking inside and somehow my hands found his ill be back he nodded looking at my fingers within his i know i felt the need to move i didnt care that it now came from the need to run from what i had just learned my eyes dropped to the keys thanks for letting me use your van no biggie he said forcing a smile but his eyes were worried so terribly worried just return it with a full tank of gas he reached forward and i leaned against him breathing in his scent one last time my head tilted and our lips met but it was an empty kiss my worry having pushed any passion out this was for jenks not nick i didnt owe nick anything i slipped something in your suitcase for you kisten said and i pulled away what is it i asked but he didnt answer giving me a smile before he reluctantly stepped back his hand trailed down my arm and slipped away goodbye kist i whispered its only for a few days he nodded bye love take care of yourself you too bare feet soundless he turned and went back into the church the door creaked shut and he was gone feeling numb i turned and yanked open my door jenkss kids flowed out of his open window and i got in slamming the door behind me the laptop slipped under the seat with my bag and i jammed the keys into the ignition the big engine turned over and settled into a slow even rumble only now did i look across to jenks surprised again at seeing him there sitting beside me in kistens sweats and his shockingly yellow hair this was really weird his seat belt was on and his hands dropped from where hed been fiddling with the visor you look small he finally said looking both innocent and wise a smile quirked the corner of my lips shifting into gear i accelerated down the street eight for the love of tink jenks muttered angling another one of the cheetos into his mouth he meticulously chewed and swallowed adding her hair looks like a dandelion you think someone would have told her theres enough there to make a quilt out of my gaze was fixed on the car ahead of us going an aggravating fiftysix miles an hour on the twolane doubleyellowlined road the woman in question had white hair frizzed out worse than mine he was right jenks i said youre getting crumbs all over kistens van the crackle of cellophane was faint over the musichappy happy music that didnt fit my mood at all sorry he said rolling the bag down and shoving it in the back licking the orange from his fingers he started messing with kists cds again then hed fiddle with the glove box or spend five minutes getting his window at juuuuust the right height or fuss with his seat belt or any of the half a dozen things hed been doing since getting in the van all the while making a soft commentary that i think he didnt know i could hear it had been a long day i sighed adjusting my grip on the wheel we had been off the interstate for the last miles or so taking a twolane road instead of the interstate up to mackinaw the pine forest pressed close on either side making the sun an occasional flash it was nearing the horizon and the wind coming in my window was chill carrying the scent of earth and growing things it soothed me where the music couldnt the national forestry sign caught my eye and i smoothly braked i had to get out from behind this woman and if i heard that song one more time i was going to jam daddys tbird down jenkss throat not to mention mr bladder the size of a walnut might need to use the can again which was why we were on the back roads instead of the faster interstate jenks got frantic if he couldnt pee when he wanted to he looked up from rifling through the glove box as i slowed to bump over the wooden bridge spanning a drainage ditch hed been through it three times but who knows maybe something had changed since the last time he had arranged the old napkins registration insurance and the broken pencil i had to remind myself that he was a pixy not a human despite what he looked like and therefore had a pixys curiosity a rest stop he questioned his green eyes innocently wide what for i didnt look at him pulling in between two faded white lines and shifting into park lake huron lay before us but i was too tired to enjoy it to rest the music cut off with the engine reaching under the seat my healing knuckles grazed my new laptop when i shifted the seat rearward closing my eyes i took a slow breath and leaned back my hands still on the wheel please get out and take a walk jenks jenks was silent there was the crackle of cellophane as he gathered up the trash the man never stopped eating i was going to introduce him to a mighty burger tonight maybe threequarters of a pound of meat would slow him down you want me to drive he asked and i cracked an eyelid looking askance at him oh theres a good idea if we were stopped itd be me getting the points not him nah i said my hands falling from the wheel and into my lap were almost there i just need to move around a little with a wisdom far beyond his apparent age jenks ran his eyes over me his shoulders slumped and i wondered if he knew he was getting on my nerves maybe there was a reason pixies were only four inches tall me too he said meekly opening his door to let in a gust of sunsetcooled wind smelling of pine and water do you have any change for the machine relieved i tugged my bag onto my lap and handed him a fiver id have given him more but he had nowhere to put it he needed a wallet and a pair of pants to put it in i had hustled him out of the church so fast that all he had was his phone clipped proudly to his elastic waistband which had since been depressingly silent wed been hoping jax would call again but no such luck thanks he said getting out and tripping on the flipflops id bought him at the first gas station we stopped at the van shifted when he shut the door and he made his way to a rusted trash can set about fifty feet from the parking lot chained to a tree his balance was markedly better with only the usual trouble most people had walking with slabs of orange plastic attached to their feet he dumped the trash and headed for a tree an alarming intentness to his pace i took a breath to call out and he jerked to a stop slumped he scanned the park making his way to a clapboard restroom instead such were the trials in a day of the life of a sixfootfour pixy i sighed watching him slow at the bed of straggly daylilies to talk to the pixies they buzzed about him in a swirl of gold and silver sparkles coming from all over the park like fireflies on a mission within moments a cloud of glowing dust hovered over him in the darkening air i turned at the hush of a car pulling in a few slots down three boys like stair steps exploded out arguing about who switched whose dead batteries in their handheld games mom said nothing wearily popping the trunk and settling it all with a twelvepack of double as money was offered by dad and the three ran to the vending machines under a rustic shelter shoving each other to get there first jenks caught the smallest before he fell into the flowers i had a feeling jenks was more worried about the plants than the boy i smiled when the couple leaned against the car and watched them exhaling loudly i knew the feeling my smile slowly faded into melancholy i had always planned on children but with a hundred years of fertility facing me i was in no hurry my thoughts drifted to kisten and i pulled my eyes from the boys at the vending machines witches married outside their species all the time especially before the turn there were perfectly acceptable options adoption artificial insemination borrowing your best friends boyfriend for a night issues of what was morally right and wrong tended not to matter when you found yourself in love with a man you couldnt tell you werent human it sort of went with the whole hidingamonghumansforthelastfivethousandyears thing we werent hiding now but why limit oneself simply because there wasnt a safety issue anymore it was way too soon for me to think about kids but with kisten any children would have to be engendered by someone else frustrated i got out of the van my body aching from my first day without a pain amulet since my beating the couple drifted away talking between themselves there wouldnt be any children with nick either i reminded myself so it isnt like this is anything new painfully stretching to touch my toes i froze realizing i had put him in present tense damn this was not a choice between them oh god i thought tell me im only doing this to help jenks that nothing is left in me to rekindle but the wedge of doubt wiggled itself between me and my logic settling in to make me feel stupid angry with myself i did a few more stretches and then wondering if the black on my aura had soaked in i tapped a line and set a circle my lips curled in revulsion the shimmering sheet of energy rose black and ugly the reddish light of sunset coming in from around the trees adding an ominous cast to the black sheen the gold tint of my aura was entirely lost disgusted i dropped the line and the circle vanished leaving me depressed even better mom and dad cleaver called to their kids and with an unusual hushed haste at their loud questions jammed everyone into the car to drive away with a little squeak of tire on pavement yeah i muttered watching their brake lights flash red as they settled into traffic run from the black witch i felt like a leper and leaned against the warm van and crossed my arms over my chest remembering why my folks always took us to big cities or places like disney world on vacation small towns generally didnt have much of an inderland population and those who did live in them usually played their differences down way down the snickslapsnick of jenkss flipflops grew louder as he returned down the cracked sidewalk the swirl of pixies dropping back one by one until he was alone behind him were the outlines of two islands both so big they looked like the opposite shore far off to the left was the bridge that had clued me in that this was where jax was it was starting to glitter in the dimming light as night fell the bridge was huge even from this distance they havent seen jax jenks said handing me a candy bar but they promise to take him in if they do my eyes widened really pixies were very territorial even among themselves so the offer was somewhat of a shock he nodded the half smile glimmering under his mop of hair turning him guileless i think i impressed them jenks king of the pixies i said and he laughed the wonderful sound struck through me lifting my spirits it slowly died to leave an unhappy silence well find him jenks i said touching his shoulder he jumped then flashed me a nervous smile my hand fell away and i remembered his anger at me for having lied to him no wonder he didnt want me to touch him im sure theyre in mackinaw i added miserable his back to the water and his face empty of emotion jenks watched the sporadic traffic where else could they be i tore open my candy bar and took a bite of caramel and chocolate more for something to do than hunger the van was radiating heat and it felt good to lean against the side of the engine jax said they were in michigan i said chewing big green bridge held up by cables lots of fresh water fudge puttputt golf well find him pain hard and deep crossed jenkss face jax was the first child mattie and i were able to keep alive through the winter he whispered and the sweetness left the wad of sugar and nuts in my mouth he was so small i held him in my hands to keep him warm for four months while i slept ive got to find him rache oh god i thought as i swallowed wondering if i had ever loved anyone that deeply well find him i said feeling totally inadequate i reached to touch him pulling away at the last moment he realized it and the silence grew uncomfortable ready to go i said folding the wrapper over the rest of the candy and reaching for the door handle were almost there well get a room grab something to eat and then im taking you shopping shopping his thin eyebrows rose and he walked to the front of the van our doors shut simultaneously and i buckled myself in refreshed and my resolve strengthened you dont think im going to be seen with a sixfoot piece of dessert dressed in a nasty pair of sweats do you jenks brushed the hair from his eyes his angular face showing a surprising amount of sly amusement some underwear would be nice snorting i started the van and put it into reverse snapping off the cd player before it started up again sorry about that i had to get out of there me too he said surprising me and i wasnt about to wear any of kistens the guy is nice and all but he stinks he hesitated plucking at his collar hey uh thanks for what you said back there my brow furrowed checking both ways i pulled onto the road at the rest stop sheepish he shifted his shoulders in embarrassment no in the kitchen about me being the only backup you ever needed oh i warmed keeping my eyes on the car ahead of us a black saltrusted corvette that reminded me of kistens other vehicle i meant it jenks i missed you the past five months and if you dont come back to the firm i swear im going to leave you like this his panicked expression eased when he saw i was joking for the love of tink dont you dare he muttered i cant even pix anyone i sweat now instead of dusting did you know that ive got water coming off me instead of dust what the hell can i do with sweat rub up against someone and make them puke in disgust ive seen you sweat and its not pretty i dont even want to think about sex two sweaty bodies pressed against each other like that disgusting talk about birth controlits no wonder you only have a handful of kids he shuddered and i smiled same old jenks i couldnt keep myself from stiffening when he began rummaging in the music and apparently sensing it he stopped putting his hands in his lap to stare out the front window at the darkening sky we had come out of the woods and were starting to see homes and businesses strung out along the road in a thin strip behind them was the flat blue of the lake gray in the fading light rachel he said his voice soft with regret i dont know if i can come back alarmed i looked at him then the road then at him again what do you mean you dont know if its about trent he held up a hand his brow pinched its not trent i figured out hes an elf after helping ceri last night i jerked and the van crossed the yellow line a horn blew and i yanked the wheel back you figured it out i stammered feeling my heart pound jenks i wanted to tell you really but i was afraid you would blab and im not going to tell anyone he said and i could see it was killing him it would have brought him a huge amount of prestige in the pixy world if i do then it means you were right in not telling me and you werent his voice was hard and i felt a stab of guilt then why i asked wishing he had brought this up when we were parked not when i was trying to navigate the outskirts of an unfamiliar town bright with neon lights for a moment he was silent his young face pensive as he put his thoughts in order im eighteen he finally said do you know how old that is for a pixy im slowing down you nicked me last fall ivy can snag me whenever she wants ivys got piscarys undead reactions i said scared and i was lucky jenks you look great you arent old rachel he said around a sigh my kids are moving out to make their own lives the garden is starting to go empty im not complaining he rushed on the wish for sterility i got from you is a blessing since the last three years of children in a pixys life have a very low life expectancy and it would kill matalina knowing she was having children that wouldnt live a week past her little josephinashes flying now shes going to make it his voice cut off cracking and my throat tightened between that wish and the garden he continued staring out the front window im not worried about any of my children surviving past matalina and me and i thank you for that jenks i started wanting him to stop shut up he said hotly his smooth cheeks reddening i dont want your pity clearly angry he put a hand on the open windowsill its my own fault it never bothered me until i got to know you and ivy im old i dont care what i look like and im mad as all hell that you two are going to have your damn runner business from now until forever and im not going to be a part of it thats why i didnt come back not because you didnt tell me what trent was i didnt say anything gritting my jaw and miserable i hadnt known he was that old signaling i made a right turn to follow the strip along the waters edge ahead of us was the huge bridge connecting the upper peninsula of michigan with the lower all lit up and sparkling you cant let that stop you from coming back i said hesitantly i do demon magic and ivy is piscarys scion turning the wheel i pulled into a twostory motel an outside pool snuggled up in the el the rooms made i stopped under the faded red and white striped canopy watching the kids in swimsuits and plastic armcuffs run in front of the van confident i wouldnt hit them the mother trailing behind them gave me a grateful wave i thought they must be either insane or weres since it was only sixty out any of us could die tomorrow i finished he looked at me the lines of anger smoothing out you wont die tomorrow he said putting the van into park i turned to him how do you figure that jenks undid his belt and gave me a sideways smile that rivaled kistens for mischief because im with you a groan slipped from me i had walked right into that one smiling he got out glancing up at the first stars almost unseen behind the towns lights stiff from the long ride i followed him into the tiny office it was empty but for an astounding display of knickknacks and pamphlets hands out jenks headed for the shelves of miniatures like a starving man his pixy curiosity and need to touch making the display irresistible the door shut behind us and seeing him lost in the throes of pixy bliss i punched him in the arm ow he exclaimed holding it and giving me an injured look what was that for you know why i said dryly finding a smile as i turned to the casually dressed woman who came in from a back room through an open archway i could hear a tv in the background and smell someones lunch or dinner rather seeing as she was human she blinked as she took us in can i help you she asked becoming hesitant when she realized we were inderlanders mackinaw was a tourist town and probably not big enough to draw a huge resident inderland crowd yes a room for two please i said reaching for the registration card and pen a frown came over me at the form well we could go under my name i thought writing ms rachel morgan in my big loopy script the clicks of the ceramic and pewter figurines being picked up and set down were audible and the woman behind the counter winced watching him over my shoulder jenks could you get the plate number for me i asked and he slipped out the seashell door chime clunking roughly that will be two twenty she said stiffly great i thought cheap cheap cheap you gotta love small towns in the offseason were only staying the night not the week i said putting down the churchs address that is the nightly rate she said her voice tartly smug my head came up two hundred twenty dollars its the offseason i said and she shrugged shocked i thought for a moment can i get a discount for were insurance her eyes were mocking we only offer discounts for aaa my lips pressed together and i went warm slowly i curled my hand up and brought it below the level of the high partition hiding my bandaged knuckles crap crap crap you gotta love those smalltown mentalities she had upped the rates for us hoping wed go somewhere else cash she added smugly we dont take plastic or personal checks the chipped sign behind her said they did but i wasnt going to walk out of there i had my pride and money was nothing compared to that do you have one with a kitchen i asked shaking inside two hundred and twenty dollars would really take a chunk out of my cash that will be thirty extra she said of course it will i muttered angry i jerked my bag open and pulled out two hundreds and a fifty as jenks came in his eyes went from the money in my hand to the womans satisfaction and finally to my anger figuring it out immediately hell he had probably heard the entire conversation with his pixy hearing his gaze rose to the fake camera in the corner then out the glass door to the parking lot rache i think we hit primetime gold he said taking the pen chained to the desk and writing the plate number on the form someone just peed into the pool and i can smell shower mold from here if we hurry we can get a shot of the bridge at sunset for the opening credits the woman set a key on the counter her motions suddenly hesitant jenks flipped open his phone do you still have the number for the countys health department from our last stop i steeled my face into a bored countenance its on my clipboard but lets wait on the opening shot we can do a sunrise frame tom had a cow the last time we burned film before he had a chance to canvas the local hot spots for the worst offenders the woman went ashen i dropped the bills on the counter and took the worn key on its little plastic tag my eyebrows rose number thirteen how apropos thanks i said jenks jerked to get in front of me as i turned to leave allow me ms morgan he said opening it gracefully and i strode out the door pride intact somehow i managed to keep a straight face until the door clanked shut jenks snickered and i lost it thanks i said between snorts god i was ready to smack her a good one no problem jenks said scanning the rooms his gaze settling on the last one tucked at the short end of the el can i drive the van over there i thought he more than deserved it and i left him to work it out as i walked across the dark lot throwing up heat to the sounds of the kids splashing in the pool the underwater lights had come on and they reflected up against the open umbrellas to look inviting if it hadnt been so cold id have asked jenks if pixies could swim finding out if my mental image of jenks in a speedo matched reality would be worth a few goose bumps the key stuck for a moment but with a little wiggling it engaged and the door swung open out flowed the scent of citrus and clean linen jenks pulled the van around to the empty spot before the door the headlights fell into the room to show an ugly brown carpet and a yellow bedspread flicking on the light i went in heading for the pretend kitchen and the second door at the back i set my bag on the bed concerned when i realized the door led to the bathroom not a second room muttering about caves jenks came in with my suitcase his eyes roving the low ceiling he dropped my bag by the door tossed me the keys to the van and headed out flicking the light switch several times because he could ah jenks i called fingers smarting from the keys we need a different room jenks came in with my laptop and ivys sword setting them on the round table under the front window how come i was kidding about the shower mold he took a deep breath nose wrinkling that smells likewell its not shower mold i didnt want to know what he was smelling but when i silently pointed to the single bed all he did was shrug his lusciously green eyes innocent gesturing helplessly i said one bed so then he flushed his eyes darting to the box of tissues on the bedside table oh yeah i wont fit in the kleenex box anymore will i not looking forward to talking to that lady i headed for the door snagging my shoulder bag in passing ill get a new room do me a favor and dont use the bathroom shell probably charge us a cleaning fee im coming with you he said falling into step with me the kids from the pool were making a quick wetfooted dash to their room shivering under skimpy white towels when we crossed the parking lot jenks opened the office door for me and the sound of seashells clunking mixed with the sound of a tearful argument when we entered you charged them the fourth of july weekend rate i heard a man say and her blubbering answer i looked at jenks in a mute question and he cleared his throat loudly silence after a hushed conversation a short folliclechallenged man in a plaid shirt emerged brushing his balding plate yes he said with an artificially interested look what can i get for you extra towels for the pool from somewhere out of sight the woman made a hiccup of a sob and he reddened actually i said putting the room key on the chesthigh partition between us id like to see about getting a different room we need two beds not one my fault for not making that clear i smiled as if i hadnt heard anything the mans gaze went to jenks and he flushed deeper ah yes number thirteen right he said snatching it and giving me a new one jenks headed for the knickknacks but at my heavy sigh he went to the pamphlets instead setting my bag on the counter i smugly asked whats the price difference for that none was his quick reply same rate anything else i can do for you make reservations for you and the rest of your party maybe he blinked looking ill will they be staying with us as well jenks turned to look out the glassed door his hand to his smooth chin while he tried not to laugh no i said lightly they called to tell us they found a place on the other side of town that filled up their pool with lake water that wins out over moldy bathrooms any day the mans mouth worked but nothing came out jenks jerked into motion and i glanced behind me to see him hunched and gripping one of the pamphlets close to his face thank you i said holding up the key and smiling we may be staying a second night do you have any twoday specials yes maam he said eyes going relieved second night is half price during the offseason ill put you down for it if you like he glanced at his unseen wife through the archway that sounds great i said and a late checkout for tuesday late checkout on tuesday he said scribbling something in his registration book no problem we appreciate your business i nodded and smiled touching jenkss arm and pulling him out the door since he wasnt moving fixed to the pamphlet in his grip thanks i called cheerfully have a good night the door chimes thunked dully and i exhaled into the cooler night air the parking lot was silent but for the nearby traffic satisfied i glanced at the key in the dim light under the canopy room eleven this time rache jenks shoved the pamphlet at me here hes here i know it get in the van they close in ten minutes jenks i exclaimed when he grabbed my arm and pulled me stumbling across the lot jenks wait up jax hes where there he said shaking the pamphlet in front of my face thats where i would go bewildered i peered at the colorful trifolded paper in the dim light of the streetlamp my lips parted and i reached to dig my keys out while jenks threw our stuff back into the van and slammed the motel door shut shaking in impatience the butterfly shack of course nine humming nervously jenks put the jar of honey in the basket with my bandages and the rest of his groceries he fidgeted and my eyebrows rose honey jenks i questioned its medicinal he said reddening and turning to stand before the array of baking supplies feet spread wide in his peter pan pose reaching to a top shelf he dropped a jar of yeast in with the rest bee pollen he grumbled under his breath where in tinks bordello do they keep the vitamin supplements cant find a bloody thing in this store who laid it out gilligan his head rose and he scanned the signs hanging over the aisles the vitamins would be with the medicines i said and he jerked clearly shocked he stammered you heard that and i shrugged damn he muttered walking away i didnt know you could hear that well you never heard me before i trailed behind him arms empty jenks insisted on carrying everything insisted on opening every door for me hell hed flush my toilet if i let him it wasnt a macho thing it was because he could automatic doors were his favorites and though he hadnt played with one yet by getting on and off the sensor pad i knew he wanted to his pace was quick his steps silent in the new boots i had bought him all of an hour ago he wasnt happy about me insisting we go shopping before seeing if jax was at the butterfly shack a butterfly exhibit and wildlife store but he agreed that if jax was there he was hiding or he would have had the owner call us to come get him we didnt know the situation and if we knocked on the door and told the proprietor he had been harboring a pixy one possibly wanted in connection with a theft we might start a few tongues wagging so jenks and i used the interim while the proprietor closed up shop and counted his money to do a little prebreakin outfittingshopping i had been pleasantly surprised to find some upscale stores right beside the touristcrap traps in an obviously new slab of light commercial buildings that had gone up in the last five years or so the trees only had been in the ground that long i was a witch i could tell since it was just before the tourist season the selections were high and the prices were almost reasonable that would change next week when school let out and the town tripled its population when the fudgiestourists named after the candy mackinaw was known fordescended on them turns out jenks was a power shopper which probably stemmed from his garden gathering background in a very short time we had hit three clothes stores a dance outlet and a shoe mart so now instead of a hunky young man in sweats and flipflops i was with a sixfootfour athletic angsty young man dressed in casual linen pants and matching fawncolored shirt under it was a skintight twopiece suit of silk and spandex that had set us back a couple hundred dollars but after seeing him in it my head bobbed and my card came out my treat i couldnt help but let my eyes ramble over him as he crouched before a display of vitamins and took off the shades i had bought him not wanting a repeat of him grumbling over the sun all the way up there clearly bothered he ran a hand under his cap in worry the red leather should have clashed with what he had on but on him yum jenks looked really good and i was wishing i had brought nicer clothes and a camera he was a hard man to keep up with once you got him out of sweats and flipflops bee pollen he said as he jiggled the sleeve of his new aviator jacket down and reached forward blowing the dust from the lid of the glass jar this stuff tastes like its already been through the bee he said rising to place it with the rest but seeing as the only flowers they have here are stale daisies and dehydrated roses it will do his voice carried a hard derision and i silently looked at the price no wonder pixies spent more time in the garden than working a ninetofive to buy their food like most people the two bottles of maple syrup he wanted cost a whopping nine dollars each and when i tried to substitute the fake stuff he had added a third let me carry something i offered feeling useless he shook his head pace intent as he headed to the front if we dont go now it will be too cold to find any pixies who might help besides the owner has to be home and watching tv its almost nine i glanced at his phone clipped to his belt its twenty past i said lets go past jenks snickered shifting the basket the suns been down only an hour he skittered sideways when i snatched the phone from his belt and held it for him to see ninetwenty i said not knowing if i should be smug or worried that his unerring time sense was off i hoped ceri hadnt ruined it for an instant jenks looked horrified then his mouth quirked we shifted latitude he said im going to be he took the phone from me and peered at the clock twenty minutes slow at sunset and twenty minutes fast at sunrise jenks chuckled never thought id need a watch but it would be easier than trying to switch over and then have to switch back i shrugged id never felt the need for a watch unless i was working with ivy and had to synchronize to keep her from having a fit and then i just used jenks feeling short next to his height i steered him from the selfservice line or we would have been there all night jenks took charge of the basket unloading it and leaving me to smile neutrally at the woman her plucked eyebrows rose upon taking in the bee pollen yeast honey maple syrup beer bandaids and the ailing plant jenks had rescued from the halfprice rack in the tiny floral department doing a little cooking she asked slyly her grin thick with an amused conclusion as to what two people might be doing with a shopping list like ours her name tag said terri and she was a comfortable twenty pounds overweight with swollen fingers and too many rings jenkss green eyes were innocently wide jane honey he said to me be a dear and run back for the instant pudding his voice dropped taking on a sultry depth lets try butterscotch this time im bored with chocolate feeling wicked i leaned against him reaching to play with the curls about his ears you know alexia is allergic to butterscotch i said besides tom will do aaaaanything for pistachio and i have some of that in the fridge right beside the caramel drizzle and the whipped cream i giggled tossing my red hair god i love caramel it takes forever to lick off jenks broke into a devilish grin eyeing the woman from under his hat as he took a handful of toothbrushes from the grab rack and set them on the conveyer belt thats what i love so much about my janie he said giving me a sideways hug that pulled me off balance and into him always thinking of others isnt she the kindest soul youve ever met the womans face was red flustered she kept trying to ring up the markeddown plant finally giving up and putting it into a plastic bag sixtythree twentyseven she stammered not meeting jenkss eyes smug jenks pulled out the wallet he had bought all of fifteen minutes ago shuffling to find the vampiric charms credit card he carefully ran it through the machine clearly enjoying himself as he punched the right buttons ivy had arranged for it ages ago and jenkss signature was on file as a matter of course this was the first time hed been able to use it but he looked like he knew what he was doing the woman stared at the name of our firm when it popped up on her screen her jaw falling to make a double chin jenks signed the pad with a careful seriousness smiling at the cashier as she extended the receipt and a strip of coupons cheerio he said the plastic a soft rustle when he took all the bags and looped his arm through them i glanced back when the glass doors swung apart and the night air cold off the straits set a few strands of hair to tickle my face she was already gossiping with the manager putting a hand to her mouth when she saw me look at her jeez jenks i said taking one of the bags so i could look at the receipt over sixty dollars for two bags of groceries maybe we could have done something really disgusting like lick her microphone and why had he bought so many toothbrushes you enjoyed it and you know it witch he said then snatched the ticker tape from me when i tried to throw it and the coupons away i want that he said tucking them in a pocket i might use them later no one uses those i said head bowed while i dug in my bag for the keys the lights flashed and the locks disengaged jiggling the bag on his arm jenks opened my door for me before going to the other side of the van and dropping his groceries beside his bags of slacks shirts silk boxers socks and a silk robe i would have protested over except that he was eventually going to get small again and i was going to claim it the man couldnt have anything cheap and i wouldve questioned his claim that oilbased fabrics would make him break out if i hadnt seen it for myself his door opened and he settled himself carefully buckling in as if it was a religion ready i said feeling the ease of shopping start to shift into the anticipation of a run an illegal run yes we were rescuing jenkss son not robbing the place but they would still throw our butts in jail if we were caught jenkss head went up and down and he zipped and unzipped the small waist pack he had put his few tools in taking a steadying breath i started the van and headed to the shops and the theater bridge traffic was congested and had been for the better part of the month according to the disgruntled clerk in the shoe outlet apparently it was down to one lane either way while they scrambled to make maintenance repairs roundtheclock to finish before memorial day fortunately we didnt have to cross the huge suspension bridge just weave past the confusion the van was blowing cold air even though i had the heater on and i thanked the stars that jenks was big tonight would have been iffy for him if he were four inches tall i only hoped jax had found somewhere warm a butterfly exhibit would have enough food but why heat it to a comfortable seventyfive degrees when fifty will do the theater was in a mazelike cluster of new shops catering to tourists on footsort of a miniopenaired mall plopped beside the original downtownbut they had a special lot for the cinema and i parked between a white truck and a rusting toyota with a bumper sticker that said follow me to the up eh the engine cut out and i looked across the van at jenks in the new silence the sound of slow crickets came in from the nearby empty field he seemed nervous his fingers quick as they fussed with the zipper on his pack you going to be okay i said realizing this was the first time he had been on a run where he couldnt just fly out of danger he nodded the deep concern on his face appearing out of place on someone so young rustling in a bag he pulled a bottle of maple syrup out from behind the seat his green eyes met mine in the uncertain light looking black hey um when we get out will you pretend to fix your shoe or something i want to take care of the cameras on the back of the building and a distraction might help my gaze went to the bottle in his hand then rose to his wary expression not sure how a bottle of syrup was going to fix the cameras but willing to go along with it sure relieved he got out i followed suit leaning against the van to take off my shoe and shake a nonexistent pebble out i watched jenks with half my attention understanding when he let out a trill of a whistle anxiously touching his red hat as a curious aggressive pixy zipped up to him in the cooling dusk i missed what was said but jenks returned looking satisfied the bottle of maple syrup gone what i said as he waited for me to fall into step with him theyll put the cameras on loop for us when we leave the building he said not taking my arm as kisten or nick might but walking beside me with an odd closeness the shops lining the thoroughfare were closed but the theater had a small crowd of what were clearly locals to judge by the amount of noisy banter the movie showing had been out for three weeks in cincy but there must not be a lot to do up here we neared the ticket booth and my pulse quickened theyll loop the cameras for a bottle of maple syrup i asked voice hushed jenks shrugged glancing at the marquee sure that stuff is liquid gold i dug in my bag for a twenty as i took that in maybe i could make more pimping maple syrup to pixies than running we bought two tickets to the sf film and after getting jenks a bag of popcorn we headed into the theater immediately going out the emergency exit my eyes went to the cameras atop the building catching the faintest glint of streetlight on pixy wings maybe it was a little overkill but being placed at the theater if the butterfly shacks alarms went off might be the difference between keeping my feet on the street and cooling them on a jail cot together we made our way from the service entrances in back to the front jenks shedding clothes and handing them to me to stuff in my bag every few yards it was terribly distracting but i managed to avoid running into the dumpsters and recycling bins upon reaching the shuttered tourist area he was in his softsoled boots and his skintight outfit we had come out a few blocks from the theater and it was creepy being on the street at night with everything closed reminding me how far from home and out of my element i was the butterfly shack was tucked into the end of a culdesac and we headed for it feet silent on the cement watch my back jenks whispered leaving me in a shadow while he twirled the long tool in his fingers into a blur crouching to put his eyes even with the lock i gave him long glance then turned to watch the empty foot street no prob jenks i thought sure he was married but i could look people i breathed but he had heard and was already behind the scrawny bushes beside the door they were butterfly bushes if i guessed right and scraggly any other business would have torn them out shrinking into my shadow i held my breath until the couple passed the womans heels fast and the man griping they were going to miss the previews five seconds later jenks was back at the door a moment of tinkering and he stood to carefully try the latch it clicked open a nice cheery green light blinking a welcome from the lock pad he grinned jerking his head for me to join him i slipped inside and moved to get out of his way if there was more security jenks could tell better than i the door shut leaving the wash of streetlight coming in the large windows as smoothly as if on wings jenks glided past me camera behind the mirror in the corner he said cant do anything about that one if im six feet tall lets get him get out and hope for the best my gut tightened this was more looseygoosey than even i liked the back i whispered cataloging the silent shelves and displays of amazon rain forest stuffed animals and expensive books on how to design a garden for wildlife it smelled wonderful rich with subtle perfumes of exotic flowers and vines filtering out from behind an obvious pair of glass doors but it was cold the tourist season wouldnt officially begin till next week and i was sure they kept the temp low at night to extend the life of the insects jenks slipped to the back making me feel clumsy behind him i wondered if he would even show up on the camera he moved so stealthily the soft sucking sound of the outer glass door of the casual airlock was loud and jenks held it for me his eyes wide to take in what little light there was nervous i ducked under his arm breathing deeply of the scent of moist dirt jenks opened the second door and the sound of running water joined it my shoulders eased despite my tension and i hastened to keep up as he entered the walkthrough exhibit it was a twostorytall room glasswalled from ten feet up the night was a black ceiling festooned with vines and hanging planters of musky smelling petunias and jewellike begonias maybe forty feet long and fifteen feet wide the room made a narrow slice of another continent and it was cold i clasped my shoulders and looked at jenks worried jax jenks called the hope in his voice heartrending are you here its me dad dad i thought in envy what i would have given to have heard that directed at me when i needed it i shoved the ugly feeling aside happy that jax had a dad who was able to rescue his ass growing up was hard enough without having to pull yourself out of whatever mess you got yourself into when your decisions were faster than your brain or your feet there was a chirp from the incubators tucked out of the way my brows rose and jenks stiffened there i said breathlessly pointing under that cupboard where the heat lamp is jax jenks whispered padding down the slate slabs edged with moss are you okay a grin heavy with relief came over me when with a sprinkling of glowing dust a pixy darted out from under the cupboard it was jax and he zipped around us wings clattering he was okay hell he was more than okay he looked great ms morgan the young pixy cried lighting the small space with his excitement and zipping around my head like an insane firefly youre alive we thought you were dead wheres my dad he rose to the ceiling then dropped dad jenks stared transfixed at his son darting over the exhibit he opened his mouth then closed it clearly struggling to find a way to touch his son without hurting him jax he whispered his eyes both young and oldpained and filled with joy jax let out a startled chirp slamming back a good two feet before he caught himself dad he shouted pixy dust slipping from him what happened youre big jenkss hand shook as his son landed on it i got big to find you its too cold to be out without somewhere to go and its not safe for ms morgan to be out of cincinnati unescorted i made a face chafing at the truth though we hadnt even seen a vampire much less a hungry one they didnt like small towns jax i said impatiently wheres nick the small pixys eyes widened and the dust slipping from him turned thin they took him i can show you were he is holy crap hell be glad to see you we didnt know you were alive ms morgan we thought you were dead that was the second time he had said it and i blinked in understanding oh god nick had called the night al snapped the familiar bond between us al answered my phone and told nick i belonged to him then the media thought id died on the boat kisten blew up nick thought i was dead thats why he had never called thats why he didnt tell me he was back on the solstice thats why he cleared out his apartment and left he thought i was dead god help me i whispered reaching out for the filthy incubator full of butterfly pupa the budded rose left on my doorstep in the jelly jar with the pentagram of protection on it had been from him nick hadnt left me he thought i had died rache i straightened when jenks tentatively touched my arm im okay i whispered though i was far from it id deal with it later we have to go i said turning away wait jax exclaimed dropping down to the floor and peering under the cupboard here kitty kitty kitty jax jenks shouted in horror scooping his son up dad jax protested easily slipping the loose prison of his fathers fingers let go my eyes widened at the ball of orange fluff squeezing out from under the counter blinking and stretching i looked again not believing its a cat i said winning the pulitzer prize for incredible intellect well actually it was a kitten so points off for that jenkss mouth was moving but nothing came out he backed up with what looked like terror in his wide eyes its a cat i said again then added a frantic jax no when the pixy dropped down i reached for him drawing away when the fluffy orange kitten arched its back and spit at me her name is rex jax said proudly his wings still as he stood on the dirty floor beside the incubator and scratched vigorously under her chin the kitten relaxed forgetting me and stretching its neck so jax could get just the right spot i took a slow breath as in tyrannosaurus rex great just freaking great i want to keep her jax said and the kitten sank down and began to purr tiny sharp claws kneading in and out and eyes closed its a cat boy you couldnt slip anything past me tonight jax i said persuasively and the small pixy bristled im not leaving her he said i would have frozen my first night if it wasnt for her shes been keeping me warm and if i leave that mean old witch who owns the place will find her again and call the pound i heard her say so i glanced from the kitten to jenks he looked like he was hyperventilating and i took his arm in case he was going to pass out jax you cant keep her shes mine jax protested ive been feeding her butterfly pupa and shes been keeping me warm she wont hurt me look jenks almost had a coronary when his son flitted back and forth before the kitten enticing her to take a shot at him the kittens white tip of a tail twitched and her hindquarters quivered jax jenks shouted scooping him up out of danger as rexs paw came out my heart jumped into my throat and it was all i could do to not reach for him too dad let me go jax exclaimed and he was free flitting over our heads the kitten watching with a nerveracking intensity jenks visably swallowed the cat saved my sons life he said shaking we arent leaving it here to starve or die at the pound jenks i protested watching rex pace under jaxs flitting path her head up and her steps light someone will take her in look how sweet she is i clasped my hands so i wouldnt pick her up sure i said my resolve weakening when rex fell over to look cute and harmless her little white belly in the air shes all soft and sweet now but shes going to get bigger and then there will be yelling and screaming and soft kitty fur in my garden jenks frowned im not going to keep her ill find a home for her but she saved my sons life and i wont let her starve here i shook my head and while jax cheered his father gingerly scooped the kitten up rex gave a token wiggle before settling into the crook of his arm jenks had her both safe and secureas if she was a child let me take her i said holding out my hands ive got her okay jenkss angular face was pale making him look as if he was going to pass out jax its cold out get in ms morgans purse until we get to the motel hell no jax said shocking me as he lit on my shoulder im not going to ride in no purse ill be fine with rex tinks diaphragm dad where do you think ive been sleeping for the last four days tinks diaph jenks sputtered watch your mouth young man this was not happening jax dropped down to snuggle in the hollow of rexs tummy almost disappearing in the soft kitten fur jenks took several breaths his shoulders so tense you could crack eggs on them we have to go i whispered we can talk about this later jenks nodded and with the wobbling pace of a drunk made his way to the front of the exhibit jenks holding the kitten and me opening doors the scent of books and carpet made the air smell dead as we crept into the gift shop i fearfully looked for flashing red and blue lights outside relieved at finding only a comforting darkness and a quiet cobble street i said nothing when jenks awkwardly got his wallet out from his back pocket with one hand and left every last dollar of cash i had given him on the counter he nodded respectfully to the camera behind the mirror and we left as we had come in we didnt see anyone on the way back to the parking lot but i didnt take one good breath until the van door slammed shut behind me fingers shaking i started the engine carefully backing up and finding my way to the strip rache jenks said eyes on the kitten in his arms as he broke his conspicuous silence can we stop at that grocery store and pick up some cat food ive got a coupon and so it begins i thought mentally adding a litter pan and litter and a can opener and a little saucer for water and maybe a fuzzy mouse or ten i glanced at jenks out of the corner of my eye his smooth long fingers gentling the fur between rexs ears as the kitten purred loud enough to be heard over the van jax was cuddled between her paws sleeping the sleep of the exhausted a misty smile came over me and i felt myself relax wed get rid of her as soon as we found a good home riiiiight ten hes fine i said into my cell phone stomach tight as rex stalked jax across the bed the pixy was sitting dejectedly on the lamp shade his feet swinging while his dad lectured him how did you find him so quick kisten asked his voice thin and tiny from too many towers between us i took a breath to tell jenks about the cat but he bent without slowing his harangue to scoop up the orange ball of warriorintraining and hold her close soothing her into forgetting what she was doing my held breath escaped and i paused to remember what i had been saying he was at a butterfly exhibit i twisted in my seat by the curtained window aiming the battered remote at the tv to click off the local ten oclock news thered been no latebreaking story about intruders at the store so it looked as if wed be okay id have been willing to bet that no one would even look at the camera records despite the cash jenks had left he made friends with a kitten i added leaning for the last slice of pizza the bracelet of black gold i had found in my suitcase glittered in the light and i smiled at his gift not caring right now that he probably gave the bit of finery to all his lovers as a notsosubtle show of his conquests to those in the know ivy had one so did candice the vamp who had tried to kill me last solstice i especially liked the little skull charm he had on it but maybe this wasnt such a good club after all a kitten kisten said no shit jingling the metallic skull and heart together i chuckled yeah i took a bite of my pizza fed her butterfly pupa in return for her keeping him warm i added around my full mouth her he asked the disbelief clear in his voice her name is rex i said brightly shaking my new charm bracelet down what else would a nineyearold pixy name a predator a hundred times his size eyeing jenks holding the somnolent kitten my eyebrows rose you want a cat he laughed the miles between us vanishing im living on my boat rachel cats can live on boats i said glad he had moved out of piscarys quarters when skimmer moved in that he docked his twostory yacht at the restaurants quay was close enough hey uh how is ivy i asked softly shifting to drape the back of my knees over the arm of the green chair kistens sigh was worrisome skimmers been at the church since you left tension stiffened my shoulders he was fishing to find out if i was jealous i could hear it really i said lightly but my face went cold when i studied my feelings wondering if the faint annoyance was from jealousy or the idea that someone was in my church eating at my table using my ceramic spelling spoons for making brownies i threw the halfeaten slice of pizza back into the box shes falling into old patterns he said making me feel even better i can see it she knows its happening but she cant stop it rachel ivy needs you here so she doesnt forget what she wants my jaw stiffened when my thoughts swung to our conversation beside his van after living with ivy for almost a year i had seen the marks piscarys manipulations had left on her thoughts and reactions though not knowing how they had gotten there hearing how bad it had been twisted my stomach i couldnt believe shed ever return to it voluntarily even if skimmer opened the door and tried to shove her through it kisten was overreacting ivy is not going to fall apart because im not there god kisten give the woman some credit shes vulnerable frowning i swung my feet to kick repeatedly at the curtains jenks had put his ailing plant on the table and it was looking better already shes the most powerful living vampire in cincinnati i said which is why shes vulnerable i said nothing knowing he was right its only a few days i said wishing i didnt have to do this over the stinking phone were heading back as soon as we get nick jenks made a harsh grunt of sound and i pulled my eyes from his plant since when were we going to get nick he said his youthful face holding anger we came for jax we got him tomorrow we leave surprised my eyes widened ah kist can i call you back he sighed clearly having heard jenks sure he said sounding resigned that i wasnt coming home until nick was safe talk to you later love you my heart gave a pound and i heard the words again in my thoughts love you he did i knew it to the core of my being i love you too i said softly i could have breathed it and he would have heard the connection broke and i turned the phone off it needed recharging and as i gathered my thoughts for the coming argument with jenks i dug my adapter out of my bag and plugged it in i turned finding jenks standing in his peter pan pose hands on his hips and his feet spread wide it had lost its effectiveness now that he was sixfeetfour but seeing as he was still in those black tights he could stand anyway he wanted rex was on the floor blinking sleepily up at him with innocent kitten eyes jax took the opportunity to dart to the kitchen alighting on one of the plastic cups in their little cellophane sleeves eyes wide he watched us between bites of the nasty concoction of bee pollen and maple syrup his dad had made for him a moment after we walked in the door im not leaving without nick i said forcing my jaw to unclench he hadnt left me he thought i had died and he needed help jenkss face hardened he lured my son away he taught him how to be a thief and not even a good thief he taught him to be a twobit crappy thief who got caught i hesitated unsure if he was upset about the thief part or the bad thief part deciding it didnt matter i took my own peter pan pose pointing aggressively to the parking lot that van isnt turning south until we are all in it from the kitchen jax made an attentiongetting clatter of wings theyre going to kill him dad hes all beat up they want it and theyre going to keep beating on him until he tells them where it is or he dies turning jenks scooped rex up when the small predator realized where jax was and began stalking him again want what he said warily jax froze in his reach for another cake of bee pollen and syrup uh he stammered wings moving in blurred spurts at that i collapsed back into my chair and stared at the ceiling look i said legs stretched out and tired whatever happened happened jenks im sorry youre mad at nick and if you want to sit here and watch tv while i save nicks ass i wont think any less of you his fingers caressing rex froze and i knew id hit a nerve but nick saved my life i said crossing my knees as a feeling of guilt passed through me he saved my life and i shack up with the first guy who shows an interest i cant walk away jenks shifted forward and back his need to move obvious and odd now that he was fullsized and dressed in that fartoodistracting skintight outfit wishing hed put something on over it i pulled the map of the area i had bought in the motel office out from under the pizza box and opened it up the crackle of map paper swung my thoughts to ivy and my worry tightened skimmer was sleeping over skimmer was piscarys lawyer out from the west coast and top of her class eminently comfortable in using manipulation to get what she wanted ivy didnt want a vampiric lifestyle but skimmer didnt care she just wanted ivy and if what kisten had said was true she didnt mind screwing ivys mental state up to get her that alone was enough to make me hate the intelligent woman it hadnt surprised me to find that skimmer was responsible for part of ivys problems the two had undoubtedly run wild gaining a reputation for savage bloodletting mixed liberally with aggressive sex it was no wonder ivy had twined the emotions of love and the ecstasy of bloodletting together so tightly that they were one in her mind back then she was vulnerable and alone for the first time in her life with skimmer undoubtedly more than willing to help her explore the sophisticated vampiric bloodletting techniques ivy had gained in the time piscary had been at her piscary had probably planned it all the bastard it wasnt a problem for a vampire that bloodletting was a way to show that they loved someone but by the sounds of it piscary twisted that until the stronger ivys feelings of love were the more savage she became piscary could take ithell hed made her what she wasbut kisten had left her and i wouldnt have been surprised if ivy had killed someone she loved in a moment of passion it would explain why shed abstained from blood for three years trying to separate her feelings of love from her blood lust i wondered if she had then wondered what kind of a hell ivy lived in where the more she loved someone the more likely she would hurt them skimmer had no qualms about her deep affections toward ivy and though ivy clearly loved her back skimmer represented everything that she was trying to escape the more often ivy shared blood with her past lover the greater the chance that she would be lured into old patterns savage bloodletting patterns that would rebound on her with a vengeance if she tried to love someone who wasnt as strong as she and i had just walked out knowing skimmer would probably step back in god i shouldnt have just left like that just a few days i reassured myself moving the pizza box to the floor and clicking on the table lamp jax i said arranging the map and pushing jenkss recovering plant to the outskirts you said they had him on an island which one he might still love me do i still love him did i ever love him really or had it just been that i loved his acceptance of me my bracelet hissed against the map and jax flitted close landing to bring the bitter scent of maple syrup to me this one ms morgan he said his voice high pollen crumbs fell and i blew them away when jax rose to sit on the table lamps shade from the corner of my sight i saw jenks fidget i couldnt do this with a halftrained pixy i needed jenks fingertips brushing the large island in the straits i felt like ivy with her maps and markers planning a run my motions went still and my focus blurred it wasnt her need to be organized i suddenly realized it was a front to disguise her feelings of inadequacy damn i whispered this wasnt good ivy was a lot more fragile than she let on she was a vampire molded from birth to look to someone for guidance even if she could garner the attention in a room from simply walking in and could snap my neck with half a thought telling myself that nick needed me more right now than ivy needed me to keep her sane i pushed my worry aside and looked at the island jax had said nick was on according to the fishing pamphlet i took from the front office bois blanc island had been publicly owned before the turn a rather large were pack had bought everyone else out shortly afterward making the big island into a huntingspa kind of thing trespassing wasnt a good idea tension quickened my pulse when jenks put rex on the bed and edged closer an odd mix of angsty teen and worried dad taking a breath i said to the map i need your help jenks ill do it without backup if i have to but every time i do my ass hits the grass youre the best operative outside of ivy that i know please i cant leave him there jenks pulled a straightbacked chair from the kitchen bumping it over the carpet and sat down next to me so he could see the map right side up he glanced at jax on the lamp pixy dust sifting upward from the heat of the bulb i couldnt tell if he was going to help me or not what did you two get caught doing jax he said the pixys wings blurred and dust drifted from him youll get mad his tiny features were frightened it didnt matter that he was an adult in pixy terms he still looked eight to me im already mad jenks said sounding like my dad when i took a weeks grounding instead of telling him why id been banned from the local roller rink running off with a snappedwinged thief like that jax if you wanted a more exciting life than a gardener why didnt you tell me i could have helped given you the tools you need eyebrows high i leaned away from the table i knew the is hadnt taught jenks the skills that landed him his job with them but this was unexpected i was never a thief he said shooting me a quick look but i know things i found them out the hard way and jax doesnt need to jax fidgeted turning defensive i tried he said his voice small but you wanted me to be a gardener i didnt want to disappoint you and it was easier to just go jenks slumped im sorry he said making me wish i was somewhere else i only wanted you to be safe its not an easy way to live look at me im scarred and old and if i didnt have a garden now id be worthless i dont want that for you wings blurring jax dropped to land before his dad half your scars are from the garden he protested the ones you almost died from the seasons make me think of death not life a slow circle that means nothing and when nick asked me to help him i said yes i didnt want to tend his stupid plants i wanted to help him i glanced at jenks in sympathy he looked like he was dying inside seeing his son want what he had and knowing how hard it was going to be dad jax said rising up until jenks put up a hand for him to land on i know you and mom want me to be safe but a garden isnt safe its only a more convenient place to die i want the thrill of the run i want every day to be different i dont expect you to understand i understand more than you know he said his words shifting his sons wings rex skulked to the pizza box on the floor and stole a crust running to the kitchen she hunkered down gnawing on it as if it was a bone and watching us with big black evil eyes seeing her jenks took a deep breath and tension brought me straight he had decided to help me tell me what you two got caught doing ill help get nick out under two conditions my pulse quickened and i found myself tapping my pencil on the table what are they jax asked a healthy tone of caution mixing with hope one that you dont take another run until i give you the skills to keep your wings untattered nick is dangerous and i dont want you taken advantage of i may have raised a runner but i did not raise a thief pixy dust sifted from jax as he looked from his dad to me and back again in wideeyed amazement whats the other jenks winced his ears reddening that you dont tell your mother i stopped my snicker just in time jaxs wings blurred into motion okay he said and a zing of adrenaline brought me back to the map nick and i were contracted by a were pack these guys he dropped from jenkss hand to land on the island and my thrill turned to unease they wanted a statue jax said didnt even know where it was nick called up a demon dad dust sifted to make him look as if he was in a sunbeam he called up a demon and the demon told him where it was okay now im officially worried did the demon show up as a dog and turn into a guy wearing green velveteen and smoked glasses i asked setting my pen down and holding my arms to myself why nick why are you playing with your soul jax shook his head green eyes wide and frightened it showed up as you ms morgan nick was mad and yelled at it we thought you were dead it wasnt big al nick said so my first flush of relief turned to a deep worry a second demon better and better then what i whispered rex jumped into jenkss lap nearly giving me a heart attack since i thought she had been going for jax how jenks knew she hadnt been eluded me the dust rose and fell from jax the demon uh took what they agreed on and told nick where the statue was a vampire in detroit had it its older than anything why would a vampire have a were artifact i wondered i glanced at jenks his hands keeping rex from falling over while she inexpertly cleaned her ears jenks puckered his brows his smooth features trying to wrinkle but not managing it what does it do jax he said shocking me again with how at odds his youthful face was to the tone of his voice he looked eighteen he sounded like he was forty with a bad mortgage jax flushed i dont know but we got it okay the vampire had been staked in the s and it was just sitting there forgotten in the slop so you found it i prompted whats the problem why are they hurting him at that jax took to the air rexs eyes went black for the hunt and jenks soothed her fingertips lost in her orange fur uh the pixy said his voice high nick said it wasnt what they said it was another pack found out he had it and made a better offer enough to pay back what the first pack paid him to finance the snatch plus a whole lot more jenks looked disgusted greedy bastard he muttered his jaw clenched i took an unhappy breath leaning into my chair and crossing my arms over my chest so he sold it to the second group and the original pack wasnt happy about it jax shook his head solemnly slowly drifting downward until his feet hit the map no he said neither of them should have it we were going to go to the west coast he had this guy who could give him a new identity he was going to get us safe then give the first pack their money back and walk away from the entire thing my face scrunched into a frown right he was going to get himself safe then sell it to the highest bidder online where is it jax i asked starting to get angry he didnt tell me one day it was there the next it was gone in a sudden motion rex jumped up onto the table adrenaline surged but jax rubbed his wings together in a coaxing sound and the kitten padded over its not at our cabin though the small pixy said standing under the kittens jaw and stretching to rake his fingers under her chin they tore it apart stepping out from between rexs paws he met my eyes looking scared i dont know where it is and nick wont tell he doesnt want them to have it ms morgan greedy sob i thought wondering why i cared if he loved me or not so wheres their money i asked maybe all they want is that and theyll let him go they took it jax didnt look happy they took it the same time they took him they want the statue they dont care about the money i put my hand on the table to entice rex to me but all she did was sniff my nails jenks curled a long hand under her belly to put her on the floor where she stared up at him and theyre here jenks asked my attention following his to the map jaxs head bobbed yup i can show you exactly where my eyes met jenkss and we exchanged a silent look this was going to take longer than a simple snatch and dash okay i said wondering if there was a phone book in the room were here at least another night probably through the week jax i want to know everything jax shot almost to the ceiling all right he shouted and jenks glared at him you are staying here he said his tone thick with parental control though he looked like a kid himself his arms were crossed and the determination in his eyes would have rocked a bulldog back from a bone like hell i jax made a startled yelp when jenks snatched him out of the air my eyes widened i didnt know what jenks was worried about he hadnt slowed at all you will stay here he barked i dont care how old you are youre still my son its too cold for you to be effective and if you want me to teach you anything it starts now he let go of jax and the pixy hovered right where jenks had left him looking scared you have to learn how to read before i can even take you out with me jenks muttered read jax exclaimed i get along okay uncomfortable i rose and stretched opening drawers until i found the yellow pages i wanted to know my resources seeing as we were out of cincinnati an island for gods sake i dont have to know how to read jax sputtered like hell you dont jenks said you want this life thats your choice ill teach you what i know but youre going to earn it i sat at the head of the bed where i could see them while flipping through the thin pages it was last years book but nothing changed fast in small towns i slowed when i found a large number of charm shops i knew there must be a resident population of witches taking advantage of the heavyduty ley lines in the area jenkss anger vanished as quickly as it had come and more softly he said jax if you could read you could have told us were you were you could have hitched onto the first bus to cincy and been home by sunset you want to know how to pick the locks loop the cameras bypass security show me how bad you want it by learning what will help you the most first jax scowled slowly descending until his feet settled in a glowing puddle of pixy dust here jenks took the pencil i had left behind and leaned over the map this is how you write your name a few more silent moments and that is the alphabet i frowned at the sharp snap of the pencil being broken and jenks held the broken nub of graphite out to jax remember the song he prompted sing it while you practice the letters and lmnop is not one letter but five it took me forever to figure that out dad jax whined jenks stood tilting the lamp shade to better light the map there are fifteen makers of locks in the us you want to know which one youre picking before you blow yourself and your runner into the everafter making a sharp noise with his wings jax started writing make the letters as big as your feet jenks said as he came to see how i was progressing with the phone book no one can read your writing unless you do and thats the entire point guilt in his eyes jenks sat beside me and i shifted so i wouldnt slip into him from the table by the door came the alphabet song sounding like a death dirge dont worry about it jenks i said watching rex follow him up onto the bed to make tiny jumps over the bedspread to him hell be okay i know he will he said the worry settling into his eyes rex plopped herself into his lap and he dropped his gaze its not him im worried about he said softly its you me i looked up from the turning pages jenks wouldnt bring his gaze from the kitten a puddle of orange in his lap i have only a year to get him up to snuff so youll have backup when im gone oh god jenks you arent a carton of milk with an expiration date you look great dont he said softly eyes on his smooth fingers among rexs fur ive got maybe one more tolerable year when it goes it goes fast its all right i want to make sure youre okay and if hes working for you he wont be tempted to do anything stupid with nick again i swallowed forcing the lump out of my throat i had not gotten him back just to lose him damn it jenks i said as jax started the alphabet song again theres got to be a spell or a charm there isnt finally he met my eyes they held a deep bitterness touched with anger its the way it is rache i dont want to leave you helpless let me do this he wont let you down and ill feel better knowing he wont be working for nick or the likes of him miserable i sat beside him wanting to give him a hug or cry on his shoulder but apart from that time in front of terri at the grocery store he had always jumped when i touched him thanks jenks i said turning to the pages before he could see my eyes swimming there was nothing i could say that wouldnt make him and me feel worse his grip shifted in rexs fur clearly wanting to change the subject what do the boat rentals look like taking a breath i focused on the timesmeared print okay but theres still the problem of noise he looked blankly at me and i added it would be stupid to think they dont watch the water and its not like we can just boat up to the beach and not expect to be seen even at night theres noise it carries too well over water we could paddle across he suggested and i gave him a telling look ah jenks its not a lake its a friggin freshwater ocean did you see the size of the tanker going under the bridge when we came into town the wake from it could tip us im not canoeing it unless your name is pocahontas besides the ambient light will give us away firstquarter moon or not to expect fog is ridiculous he made a face glancing at jax and clearing his throat to get him to start singing again you want to fly it i lost my wings were going to swim it i flipped forward a few pages underwater jenks blinked rache you gotta stop using that sugar substitute under the water do you know how cold it is just listen i found the page and after taking rex off his lap i dropped the book onto it it was my turn to hold the cat she wiggled and squirmed settling as the warmth of my hands covered her look i said charmed when rex patted at my swinging bracelet they have scuba diving off the wrecks charm enhanced so you dont freeze to death the waters pretty clear here despite the current and since theyre privately owned you can take whatever you want off the wrecks its a poor mans treasurehunting excursion he snorted ive never been swimming and unless you took a class i wasnt aware of you dont know how to dive doesnt matter i pointed to the halfpage ad see theyre licensed to take you out regardless of experience ive heard of these things they teach you enough so that you dont kill yourself then you go out with a guide once you sign that release form theyre off the hook except for gross negligence eyebrows high he looked at me gross negligence as in losing two divers wont someone notice when we dont get back on the boat my fingers in rexs fur moved faster and she peered up at me with her sweet kitten face well i wasnt going to try and slip away from them i uh was going to talk to the owner maybe arrange something jenks glanced at his son literally hovering over his work then back to me youd trust a human to keep his mouth shut god jenks you want me to knock them out and steal their stuff no he said the quickness of his reply telling me he thought i should do just that sighing he frowned lets just say you talk to the owner and they go along with your little stunt how do you plan on getting back to the mainland with nick yeah there was that maybe theyll give us an extra tank and stuff so we can all swim back if we cant get to the mainland we can get to mackinac island look you could almost walk underwater to it from there we can take the ferry to either side of the straits to help confuse our trail pleased i tucked a curl out of my way jenks rose setting the book next to me on the bed it has a lot of ifs its one big if i admitted but we dont have time for a weeks worth of recon and if we start asking around theyre going to know were here its our best way to get on the island undetected and id rather be out of sight underwater making my escape than on top of the water where they can follow us we can come up anywhere on shore and disappear jenks snorted how very james bond of you what if nicks beat up so bad he cant swim i felt a flush of worry then we steal a boat its an island they must have boats thats not a bad idea in itself we could boat all the way to toledo if we have to if you have a better idea im listening head down he shook his head its your run just tell me where to stand my first wash of relief that he would go along with it was shortlived as i started to make a mental list of what wed have to do for the prep work new sleepytime potions i murmured my fingers soothing rex into sleep while jenks went to check on jaxs progress a real map and we need to do the tourist thing talk to the local fishermen over coffee and find out what the boat patterns are coming off and going to bois blanc you want to do that you like to talk tinks panties youre starting to sound like ivy jenks complained lightly leaning over the table and pointing out a mistake to jax i blinked then turned from the sight of his eighteenyearold butt in those black tights of his married pixymy new mantra and thats not necessarily a bad thing he added as he straightened i looked at the hotel phone wanting to find out if they were open yet for the season or we would have to hang around a week but i remained where i was with rex it was probably a humanrun establishment and would be closed for the night no mistakes jenks i said feeling cold but for where rex lay nicks life might depend on it eleven the wind was bitter despite the bright morning sun and i squinted at the horizon holding onto the side of the boat as we jostled out to the wreck site jenks sat beside me in the lee of the cabin both amazed and appalled that he could see his breath and wasnt freezing to death it hadnt seemed this cold when we were on the dock but it was frigid out here with the water still holding the cold of ice even through the rubber of the wet suit when in hell were they going to give us our warmth amulets you okay jenks asked his voice raised against the chortling engine i nodded taking in his coldreddened hands wrapped about his lidded coffee trying to eek out some warmth from it as we bounced on the choppy waves the wind had whipped up he looked nervous though i didnt know why hed done well at the practice pool yesterday i patted his knee and he jumped cringing i turned to watch the other passengershigh school students on a field trip we had lucked out yesterday my call to marshals mackinaw wrecks got us an afternoon of practice at the high school pool and a place on todays boat i still hadnt managed to talk to captain marshal and it was down to the wire now the man whose day job was as the high schools swim coach had been very nice as he treaded water and painstakingly coaxed jenks in past his knees but everytime i tried to talk to him about why i wanted to go out on his boat someone usually his assistant interrupted before i knew it class was over and marshal was gone without my having gotten more than a good look at him in his speedo and a bad case of the flushing stammers as i tried to gain his attention and his help the guy probably thought i was a flaky redhead i knew his assistant debbie did today was the seasons first run traditionally taking out the high school dive team to find what the last winters storm had unearthed before the currents could cover it again come friday and the first of the fudgies all the real stuff would be carefully cataloged and the nails and buttons planted for the tourists would be in place ethical i didnt know it would be disappointing to spend this much money and have nothing to show for it even if it was fake with his youthful physique jenks fit in looking good in the rented wet suit and his red localyokel knit hat down tight about his ears cheeks ruddy with cold he sipped at his coffee so thick with sugar it was syrupy god he looked good enough to eat i thought then flushed and crossed my legs at my knees despite making it harder to keep my balance want some coffee with your sugar jenks i asked and he froze as a wave dropped us you going to ask captain speedo before or after you get in the water jenks shot back i gave him a soft thwack on his leg to burn off a burst of angst he didnt jump this time and i felt better not minding that he was quietly laughing at me while jenks snickered i turned to marshal the captain had been watching me from the corner of his eye since i boarded unlike the rest of us in wet suits he was wearing only a black speedo and a red windbreaker his bare comfortably muscled legs showing goose bumps clearly the man was cold but too much of a stud to admit it bracing myself against the bouncing waves i opened my mouth to attract his attention but debbie called to him drawing him away again damn it i slumped back down in my seat what in hell was wrong with me forcing my breathing to slow i waited for his assistant to finish asking him whatever deathly important question she had the sun glinted prettily on the water and i found myself thinking this was an ungodly time to be out here much less awake jenks was fine seeing as he was usually up long before sunrise and i could hear him muttering nine fortyeight nine fortyeight as he tried to shift his internal clock the thrum of the engine was lulling me into a drowsy state despite the caffeine and the nap jenks had made me take yesterday trying not to yawn i straightened my hand straying to my waist pack with my charms and splat gun safe in their zippy bags a good deal of yesterday had been spent in the almost unusable kitchen id purchased a disposable copper insert for spelling at a discount store and jenks traded maple syrup for everything else i needed to craft the sleepytime charms and the scent disguise spells the paint ball gun shop had been the hardest to find being left where the old post office used to be past the baptist church that burned down in seventyfive and right at the higgans farm turnaround cant miss it between yesterdays predive class grilling jax for details my six hours spelling and the three hours we spent at the mackinaw fort doing the tourist thing i was mentally and physically tired but the oddest thing by far had been watching jenks teach jax how to read the little pixy was picking it up faster than i would have thought possible while i stirred my spells jenks and jax had watched sesame street of all things the music and puppets seemingly making a direct line to the pixy mentality one song in particular seemed to have wedged itself into my head the tuneworm settling firmly around my cerebral cortex like an alien from an sf movie seeing my foot tapping to its catchy beat i stilled it wondering if id be stuck with the tune the rest of the day and what elmo would find wrong with this situation the splat gun in my fanny pack the sixfoot pixy beside me take your pick elmo and try not to giggle bois blanc island was taking on definition the top of a lighthouse peeking over the trees making me glad i was going in underwater we had already passed the noautomobile mackinac island and the huge bridge was to the left and behind us spanning the narrows between the two peninsulas yeah narrows it stretched over four freakin miles an oceangoing tanker was passing under the bridge looking like a mouse under a chair the bridge was enormous and according to the place mat under my burger last night it came in only feet shorter in height than carew tower the support towers being five hundred feet up and two hundred feet down to bedrock it was the third longest suspension bridge in the world the longest in the western hemisphere it was a big sucker claiming five mens lives in its construction one never found hitting water at that height was like hitting a cement parking lot id expect to see something like it in a big city not out in the boonies where moose and wolves crossed the ice in the winter i lurched when the thrum of the engine dropped in pitch and the boat slowed rocking as our own wake rolled under us the six guys clustered at the back of the boat jostled and pushed showing off for debbie all done up in her rubber wet suit her chest looked like a barbie dolls whereas mine was more like her little sister ellies i couldnt help but wonder if she was the reason most of the slobbering sacks of hormones had joined the diving club in the first place god i feel old jenks i whispered tucking a stray red curl behind an ear yeah me too damn it i wondered if i could jam my foot any farther down my throat the wind seemed to shift as the boat turned and debbie expertly hooked the buoy and tied us off the diving flag went up the pole the engine cut out and the level of excitement grew divers listen up marshal said standing to garner everyones attention look to your guides theyll give you your warmth amulets and make sure theyre working though im sure youll sing out once you hit the water if they arent you got it coach one of the kids sang out in a high falsetto gaining laughs thats captain when were on the water smartass marshal said flicking a glance at jenks and me debbie you take the boys he said unzipping his windbreaker ill take mr morgan and his sister not feeling at all bad for the lie on the release form i stood and the butterflies started any time rache jenks muttered and i thwacked him with my foot two of the boys gave each other highfives clustering around the woman in rubber as she comfortably fended off their exuberance she knew them by name and it looked like this was an old game my pulse quickened when the line of tanks got shorter as they unlatched them from the side and spun them to the back of the boat everyone seemed to know what to do even the guy who drove us out there now settling himself in the bow in the sun with a handheld game miss i jerked bringing my attention back to find myself eyetochest with captain marshal my god he was tall and really reallyhairless completely not a hint of hair on him marred the even honey tone of his skin no beard no mustache no eyebrows which had bothered me yesterday until i realized that like a lot of professional swimmers he probably used a potion to remove it earth charms arent very specific taking off everything which might sound like a good idea but isnt unless you dont mind being bald everywhere he was smiling his brown eyes expectant the man was in his late twenties by the look of his lean muscled legs bare to the wind and the defined abs stacked above his tiny speedo bald looked good on marshal i decided welldefined legs wide shoulders and in between was mmmmmmmm good and he was a witch with his own business my mother would love this one i mused then grimaced remembering the last time id thought that ill be your guide today he said glancing from me to jenks now standing behind me were going to let the dive team get out of the way and then well follow sounds good i said hearing a forced cheerfulness in my voice but inside i was scrambling there were too many people i wanted to ask him privately but i was running out of time heres your charms marshal continued handing me a plastic bag with two redwood disks in them his gaze landed on my neck still bruised from karen and fell away theyre already invoked you can put them on now though youll be toasty until you get in the water uh thanks i stammered fingering them through the insulating plastic they were stickered with his name and license number on one side all i needed to do was put one on so it touched my skin and even the slight chill from the morning would be gone i handed the bag to jenks who immediately shook one into his palm sighing in relief at the warmth satisfied they worked i gave serious consideration to shooting everyone with a sleepytime charm and just stealing everything um mr marshal he ducked his head smiling at me to show even white teeth i could smell the heady scent of redwood coming from him like spice he made his own charms i could tell captain marshal he said as if it was a joke marshal is my first name captain marshal i amended look ive got to ask you something debbie called and he put up a long finger just a sec he said and walked away damn it i exclaimed under my breath what in hell is wrong with that woman cant she do anything without asking him jenks shrugged squinting at the morning sun as he took off his knit hat and messed with his gear she thinks you like him he said and i blinked miss i jumped and spun when marshals hand landed on my shoulder he tightened his grip and i looked into the depth of his brown eyes surprised ready to go uh i stammered my gaze flicking behind him to debbie she was glaring adjusting her fins with sharp motions before she fell over the back of the boat it was just me marshal jenks and the guy at the front of the boat hunched over his game in the sun yesterdays fiasco at the pool was making a whole lot more sense ah marshal about the dive the witchs lips turned up into a smile its okay ms morgan he said solicitously well take it step by step i know the straits look daunting but you did well at the pool pooal i thought liking his mild accent uh its not that i said as he selected a tank and beckoned me closer but when i met his eyes i was shocked to find him grinning at me more than a hint of attraction in his dark gaze captain marshal im very sorry i said flatly i should have brought this up earlier i didnt come out here to dive on the wreck sit he said right there so i can get your tank hooked up captain he took my shoulders and sat me down reaching to adjust my gear i meant to ask you before we got all the way out here i looked at jenks for help but he was laughing at me damn it i swore im sorry marshal im out here on false pretenses im flattered ms morgan marshal said glancing up under his hairless eyebrows but you paid for a dive on my wreck and i feel obligated to do my best to fulfill it if youre going to be in town a few more days maybe we can have dinner my jaw dropped and i realized why he had been watching me oh god debbie wasnt the only one who thought i was interested in him suddenly i saw my stammering attempts at trying to talk to him in an entirely new way jenks snickered and i felt myself blush captain marshal i said firmly im not looking for a date the mans face slowly lost its expression his faint smile wrinkles easing to a smooth nothing as he straightened i uhyoure not i thought you two were brother and sister hes my partner i said adding a quick business partner you like women marshal stammered backing up a step and looking like he was going to die of embarrassment shit i hate it when i misread people god im sorry no its not that either i said wincing as i pulled the hair out of my mouth which the wind had tugged from my braid youre an attractive man and any other time i would be salivating at the idea of a private lesson at your poolpooalbut i need your help marshal zipped his coat up looking uneasy i glanced at jenks and took a breath my old boyfriend is on that island and i need to rescue him without anyone knowing about it smooth features blank he stared at me the sun glinting off the top of his head im an independent runner i said shuffling in my waist pack and handing him one of my black business cards a pack of weres kidnapped my old boyfriend and theyre holding him i need to get over there undetected and you were in the book uh if i could borrow a second set of gear and tanks for him to swim out with that would begreat im prepared to pay for it you uh have my credit card on file right brown eyes blinking marshal brought his gaze up from the business card squinting he peered at jenks moving his head this way and that like an owl an intent look came into his eyes almost predatorial jenks backed up a step and nervous i watched what are you doing i finally asked looking for the camera my jaw clenched you dont believe me should i disgusted i felt my anger rise look i said as the wake from a passing ship hit us and the bobbing boat added insult to my clenched stomach i could have come out here and shot you all with sleepytime potions and took what i needed but im asking for your help and because you decided to not break the law means i should he said feet spread wide against the boats movement even if i wanted to i couldnt let you swim off like that even if i believed you i wouldnt let you swim off like that not only would i lose my license but youd probably kill yourself im not asking you to break your license i said belligerently im asking you to let me borrow a set of gear and tanks marshal ran a hand over his bald head nearly laughing in anger it took me three years to get my license he said with a mixture of disbelief and frustration three years that was for the dive business add on another four to get my earth magic degree so i could make my own amulets and the boat could be cost effective youre a selfish little whitebread brat if you think im going to jeopardize that because your boyfriend ran off and you want to catch him cheating on you everything was given to you was it you know nothing about hard work and sacrifice he did not run off with another girl i shouted and the guy at the front of the boat sat up to look at us furious i lowered my voice and stood so i could poke my finger at his chestif i had the guts and dont you dare tell me i dont know anything about hard work and sacrifice i worked for seven years as a peon in the is busted my butt to break my contract with them and put my life on the line every day trying to make rent so you can shove your holierthanthou crap right back up where it came from my old boyfriend bit off more than he could handle and he needs my help the weres took him i said pointing to the island and you are my best shot at getting over there undetected seeming taken aback he hesitated why didnt you just go to the is my lips pressed together thinking this could go south really fast if he called the is out here with his radio because theyre incompetent boobs and rescuing people is what i do for a living i said and he eyed me suspiciously his gaze going to my bruised neck again look im usually better at it then this i added refusing to explain the teeth marks im sort of out of my element up here i tried to ask you earlier but debbie kept interfering at that marshal smirked and relaxed okay im listening i glanced at the bow of the boat and the man with his game like he would even notice if a great white shark bit off the back of the boat thanks i breathed sitting down again marshal did the same and jenks dropped to sit crosslegged where he could see both of us the sun glinted on his yellow hair and it was obvious the warmth spell was working his lips were red again and he was very relaxed almost basking see i said embarrassed now that i seemed to have my hat in my hand my boyfriend my old boyfriend i reiterated flushing turns out hes i couldnt tell him he was a thief he recovers things hes a thief marshal said and i blinked seeing my muddle the man snorted let me guess he stole something from the weres and got caught no i said tucking a windblown strand away actually he was contracted by them to recover something and when he found it he decided to give them their money back and keep it i need to get him off that island marshal looked at jenks who shrugged fine i said feeling stupid i dont blame you if you want to take me back to the dock and tell me to get lost in a ley line but one way or the other im going over the side of this boat id rather it be in a wet suit with one of your charms eyes squinting i peered at him could i at least buy a spell from you so he doesnt freeze on the way back marshals smooth face scrunched up im not licensed to sell my charms only use them in my work my head bobbed and i felt a finger of relief wedge itself between my heart and the band wrapped about it yeah me too how about a trade he leaned toward me and after meeting my eyes to ask for permission took a deep sniff of me i could smell a hint of chlorine on him over his redwood scent apparently i smelled witchy enough since he settled back satisfied what do you have a exhalation of relief slipped from me pulling my waist pack around i dug in it ah on me not much but i can send you something once i get home ive got some sleepytime potions in splat balls and three scent amulets jenks closed his eyes seeming to soak in the sun he was smiling scent amulets marshal said a hand tracing the line of muscle of his upper arm hidden under his windbreaker when would i ever use one of those affronted i froze i use them all the time well i dont i bathe every day jenks snickered and i warmed they arent deodorant charms i said offended they disguise your scent so weres cant follow you marshal glanced from me to the island youre serious damn who are you girl sitting straighter i stuck my pasty white hand out thinking it must be really clammy from the cold damp on the water rachel morgan third partner of vampiric charms out of cincinnati thats jenks second partner of the same marshals hand was warm and as we shook he gave jenks a sideways glance a smile quirking the corner of his lips i didnt think he believed me yet youre the silent partner eh marshal said and jenks cracked an eyelid and let it shut you know he went on releasing my hand i was willing to go along with the joke because youre cute and we dont get many cute witch tourists but this he gestured to the distant island cant we just go to dinner my eyes narrowed i leaned forward until i was too close for my comfort look mr captain of the good ship lollypop i dont care if you believe me or not i need to get to the island im going over the side of your boat i want to trade for an extra charm from you so my boyfriend i gritted my teeth my exboyfriend doesnt freeze on the way back actually i want to trade for three because i dont have any warmth amulets and i think theyre pretty cool the equipment id like to arrange for an extended rental if i lose them on the way which is a distinct probability you can take the price of them off my card you got it on file he looked at me and i felt queasy from the adrenaline is it real yes its real it ran through didnt it hairless brow furrowed he eyed me how do i know your magic is good you smell good but that doesnt mean fish guts i looked at jenks and he nodded hes a pixy i said tossing my head to him i made him big so he could handle the cold temps up here while we rescued his son okay technically ceri made the curse but i could stir rings around this guy marshal seemed impressed but what he said was his son is your boyfriend exasperated i felt my hands start to shake with my desire to scream no but jenkss son was with him and hes not my boyfriend hes my former boyfriend exhaling long and slow marshal eyed first jenks then me i waited breath held bob the man shouted to the front of the boat and i stiffened come on back here and help me get my gear on im going to take mr and ms morgan on an extended tour he looked at me taking in my obvious relief though i dont know why he finished softly twelve i didnt like the cold i didnt like the feeling of so much water pressing on me i didnt like that in some way i was connected to the ocean with nothing between me and it but water and i really didnt like that i had watched jaws last month on the classic channel twice we had been swimming for some time caught between the gray of the water surface and the gray of the unseen bottom deep enough that a passing boat wouldnt clip us but shallow enough that the light still penetrated well marshal was clearly on edge about leaving the security of the divingboat flag but he was young enough to like breaking the rules when it suited him i think that was why he was helping me life up here couldnt be that exciting the claustrophobic feeling of breathing underwater had eased but i still didnt like it marshal had taken a heading from the boat and all we had to do was follow it using the compass in the air gauge jenks had taken point i was second and marshal brought up the rear it was cold despite the amulets and the farther we went the more grateful i was becoming marshal wasnt getting anything out of this but a good story he couldnt tell anyone he had only asked one thing of me and i quickly agreed adding my own request he would get us to the island undetected but he was going to take his equipment back with him it wasnt that he was worried about losing the investment in his gear but that jenks and i might try to swim back through the shipping channel and get ourselves chopped to bait by a tanker good enough reason but i agreed to it not because of my safety but marshals i wanted him out of there and safe he lived here if i got caught and the weres suspected he had helped us they might go after him i made him promise hed go back to his boat finish his dive and return to the dock as if nothing had happened i had asked him to forget me but i selfishly hoped he wouldnt it had been fun talking about spells with someone who stirred them for a living i didnt find that very often slowly the water around me brightened from light reflecting off the rising bottom and my adrenaline spiked when i realized wed reached the island the current had kept the dropoff sharp and about thirty feet from the shore we stopped my fins resting on the smooth fistsized rocks the bottom was made of step onecheck i thought when i broke the surface my pulse pounding from the stress of the dive marshal had warned us but it still came as a surprise swimming with the sedate pace of a fish sounded easier than it was my legs felt like rubber and the rest of me like lead the return to wind and sound was a shock and i squinted through my foggedup mask at the empty shore relieved i edged in until i could sit neck deep in slightly warmer water pulling off my mask and mouthpiece i took in crisp air that didnt taste like plastic jenks was up already and red pressure lines marked his face he looked as tired as i felt different muscles i decided too cold perhaps marshal came up beside me in an upwelling of bubbles and i turned to the boat glad to find its white smear some distance away the farther it was the less likely the weres would think it was a threat you okay i asked jenks and he nodded clearly miserable with cold despite the amulet marshal had given him satisfied to simply sit and catch my breath i scanned the empty shore it looked peaceful enough with a few gulls stomping about on the narrow beach screaming as they weighed the possibility of a snack coming their way i couldve flown that in three minutes jenks said wiggling out of his harness yeah i said following suit and collapsed from cold halfway to become fish food jax made it he said sourly and i might collapse from the cold anyway how do you stand it rache tinks titties i think parts of me fell off i snorted removing my gloves to fumble numbly at my belt with jenkss help i got out of my own gear and felt a hundred times lighter somewhere along the way id scratched the healing gashes of my knuckles back open but my hands were too cold to bleed i looked at the whiterimmed wounds thinking id never get them healed over at this rate marshal stood sleek in his customdesigned wet suit of gold and black his mask resting atop his forehead rachel he said his brown eyes worried i changed my mind leaving you here isnt a good idea jenks glanced at me and i stifled a sigh having half expected this i appreciate that i said lurching to stand and almost falling down again but the best way you can help me is to get yourself back out to your boat and finish your day as if youd never heard of me if any weres come sniffing around tell them you took me out on your boat and i hit you on the head and stole your gear you didnt go to the is because you were embarrassed from beside me jenks looked at marshals muscular physique clearly defined under the thick rubber and chuckled marshals smile widened the water glinting on his face youre really something rachel maybe fins and gear in hand i headed for the beach to get out of my wet suit no maybes i said not looking back as my bare feet splashed in the sparkling surf i dropped everything but my waist pack reaching for a ley line and not finding one i wasnt surprised i had a spindle of ley line energy in my head but i couldnt make a circle unless i tapped a line it was limiting but not debilitating ive got your business card at the boat marshal insisted following me jenks was right behind him his pixy strength letting him carry his gear and our tanks both burn it i suggested stumbling on the smooth fistsized rocks i sat down before i fell over i didnt feel a bit like james bond as i pulled a rock from under me and tossed it aside jenks dropped everything where i had then came to sit beside me with a weary sigh with his help i peeled out of the wet suit to feel cold and exposed marshal stood awkwardly between me and the water an obvious target should anyone come out of the nearby woods i should have known something was wrong when you wore running tights under your wet suit he said as the suit came off the rocks were cold through the wet spandex and setting my waist pack on my lap i unzipped it everything was dry inside the zippy bags and as jenks got out of his suit i put my lightweight running shoes on fingers fumbling from the cold marshals eyes widened at the splat gun peeking from around the rim letting him get an eyeful i handed jenks his scent disguise amulet then dropped mine around my neck tucking it behind the collar of my black twopiece running outfit reminded i took marshals warmth charm and extended it to him marshal took a breath to protest and i said its got your name on it i nudged jenks and he reluctantly handed his over too while he and i prepared to move marshals expression slowly turned from puzzlement to alarm it was a lot colder without the amulets and i felt the wind keenly through the wet spandex tension had me stiff when i rolled up the wet suit as best i could and handed it to him this isnt good marshal said as he took it and i sat on the rocks and looked up at him no it isnt i said cold wet and tired but here i am feet shifting on the rocks his glaze drifted to the splat gun and while he fidgeted i handed jenks his share of the splat balls which he dropped into a mesh bag hanging from his waist i had offered to get him his own gun at the shop where i picked up the paint balls to fill with the sleepytime potions but hed wanted the impressivelooking slingshot instead it fastened to his arm and looked as effective as a crossbow i was willing to bet he was as accurate with it too ready to go jenks stood in a clatter of sliding stones taking a stick of driftwood and swinging it as if it was a sword he was gracefully controlled and marshal watched for a moment before he extended a hand to help me up youre a good witch right i took it feeling the warmth and strength behind it despite how it looks yes i said then tugged the cuff back down over my demon scar my fingers slipped from his and he dropped a step away i was a white witch damn it behind me jenks thrust and parried silent but for his feet in the stones we had to get going but marshal stood in front of me looking sleek in his wet suit warmth amulets dangling from his fingers he looked behind him at his boat and our gear piled on the shore lips tight in decision he bowed his head and peeled the sticker off an amulet here he said handing me the charm i blinked the cold vanishing as my fingers touched it again marshal but he was moving lean muscles bunching as he gathered a handful of equipment and strode to the edge of the vegetation keep them he said as he dropped the gear in the scrub then went back for another second load i changed my mind i thought you were joking about this rescue thing i cant leave you here without a way off your boyfriend can use my gear im going to tell my boys you panicked and made me radio the water taxi to get you back to land if you have to swim for it hug round island to get to mackinac island and take the ferry you can leave everything in a locker at one of the docks and mail me the key if you dont swim off leave everything here and ill pick it up the next time we get a good fog my heart seemed to swell and my eyes warmed from gratitude what about your driver marshal shrugged his rubberclad shoulders looking good as the sun glinted on him hell go along with it we go way back his eyes went narrow with worry promise me you wont trying to cross the straits its too far i nodded and he handed jenks his amulet back watch the ferries coming in to mackinac island especially the ones that hydroplane they come in fast theres a second warmth amulet in my gear for your boyfriend i have it for emergencies he winced his hairless eyebrows rising this sounds like one i didnt know what to say from beside me jenks peeled the sticker from his amulet and fed it to one of the gulls ringing us it flew squawking away three more in hot pursuit marshal i stammered you might lose your license bestcase scenario no i wont i trust you you arent a professional diver but youre a professional something and you need a little help if you have any problem just dump the gear and swim at the surface id uh rather you didnt though his brown eyes seemed to flit among the trees something weird has been going on over here and i dont like it he smiled though he still looked worried i hope you get your boyfriend back okay relief slipped into me god what a nice guy thank you marshal i said leaning forward and pulling myself up to give him a kiss on the cheek can you reach your boat okay he nodded discomfited i do a lot of free swimming piece of cake i remembered my stint of swimming in the frozen ohio river hoping he would be okay soon as i can ill call you to let you know we made it okay and where your stuff is thanks he said head swinging back up to me id appreciate that someday im going to track you down and youre going to tell me what this was all about i felt a sloppy smile come over me its a date but then ill have to kill you laughing he turned to go then hesitated the sun glinting on his suit burn your card brushing my wet hair back i nodded okay this time he didnt stop as i watched he waded into the surf diving into a wave and starting for his boat with clean smooth strokes now i feel like james bond i said and jenks laughed into the woods jenks said and with a last backward look at marshal i headed for the scrub the smooth rocks were hard to walk on and i felt like an idiot wobbling after him it was warmer without the wind and after only a few steps the beach turned into a thick brush the first of the springgreen leaves closed over us and as i picked my way through the vegetation jenks asked do you like him no i said immediately feeling the tension of a lie how could i not he was risking his livelihood and maybe his life hes a witch jenks offered as if that was all it took toying with the idea of letting the stick i was holding fling back to slap him i said jenks stop being my mother the brush thinned as we forced our way into the interior and the trees grew larger i think you like him jenks persisted hes got a nice body my breath came quick okay i like him i admitted but it takes more than a nice body jenks jeez i do have a little depth youve got a great body and you dont see me trying to get into your fruit of the looms he reddened at that and finally breaking through into a clearing i stopped trying to find my sense of direction which way do you think the compound is anyway jenks was better than a compass and he pointed want to run until we get close i nodded jenks was wearing marshals warmth amulet and looked toasty but it was too much for me without it i felt sluggish and i hoped i didnt hurt myself until i warmed up between jax and the old plot map in the local museum we had a good layout of the island jenks ran a finger between his heel and his shoe before taking a deep breath and breaking into a slow lope that wouldnt stress us too much and would give us time to dodge obstacles instead of running into them jax had said most of the buildings in use were by the islands lakes thats where we were headed i thought of marshal swimming for his boat and hoped he was okay as usual jenks took point leaping over decaying logs and dodging boulders the size of a small car which had been dumped by the last glacier he looked good running ahead of me and i wondered if he would run a few laps with me at the zoo before i switched him back i could use the morale boost of being seen with him it was quiet with only birds and animals disturbing the morning a jay saw us screaming as it followed until losing interest a plane droned overhead and the wind kept the tops of the trees moving i could smell spring everywhere and i felt as if we had slipped back in time with the clear air the bright sun and the spooked deer the island had been privately owned since forever never developed from its original temperatezone mix of softwood forest and meadow officially it was now a private hunters retreat patterned after isle royale farther north but instead of real wolves tracking down moose it was weres sporting with whitetailed deer during a careful questioning jenks and i had found that the locals didnt think highly of either the yearround residents or the visitors who passed through their town on the way to the island never taking the time for a meal or to fill up their gas tank one man told jenks they had to restock the deer every year since the animals could and did swim for the mainlandwhich made me all warm and fuzzy inside according to the records and what little jax told us a primitive road circled the island i was breathing hard but moving well when we found it and jenks cut a hard right as soon as we crossed it he slowed too but we still ran right into the deer carcass jenks jerked to a stop and i plowed into him pinwheeling to keep from falling into the hollowedout body its head flung over its back and its eyes cloudy holy crap he swore panting as he backed up whitefaced its a deer isnt it i nodded transfixed and breathing heavily there was surprisingly little smell since the temperatures had been keeping the decomposition slow but what worried me was that it had been gutted the entrails eaten first and the rest remaining as a slow smorgasbord lets get out of here i said thinking that even though the weres were on a private island they were doing their entire species a great disservice remembering and honoring your heritage was one thing going wild was another we backed away the low growl rumbling up from behind us pulling me to a heartpounding halt damn from the other side came a high yip double damn adrenaline pulsed through me making my head hurt and my hand drop to the reassuring feel of my splat gun jenks turned putting his back to mine shit why couldnt anything be easy where are they i whispered bewildered the clearing looked empty rache jenks said my size recognition might be off but i think its a real wolf i followed his gaze but i didnt see anything until it moved my first flush of fear redoubled a were i could reason with shouting things like is investigations paperwork and news crews but what could you say to a wolf whose kill you ran into and what in hell were they doing with real wolves god i didnt want to know get your ass up a tree i said fixed on the yellow orbs watching me my gun was in my hand arms extended and stiff theyre too thin he whispered and ive got your back my gut clenched three more wolves came skulking out from the brush snarling at each other as they closed the distance it was a clear indication that we should leave but there was nowhere to go how good are you with that slingshot i said loudly hoping the sound of our voices would chase them off riiiight i heard a low thrum of vibrating rubber and the closest wolf yipped shying before it snapped at its pack mate it didnt break against the fur jenks said maybe if theyre closer i licked my lips my grip on my gun tightening crap i didnt want to waste my spells on wolves but i didnt want to end up like that deer either they werent afraid of people and what that likely meant gave me an unsettled feeling theyd been running with weres my pulse jackhammered when the nearest wolf started an unnerving pace to me the memory of karen pinning me to the floor and choking me into unconsciousness raced through me oh god these wolves wouldnt pull their punches i couldnt make a protective circle use em rache jenks exclaimed his back to mine weve got three more coming from my side adrenaline burned tripping me into an unreal high of the calmofbattle i exhaled and squeezed the trigger aiming for the nose the nearest wolf yelped then dropped in its tracks the rest charged i gasped praying the compressed air would hold out as i continued to shoot stop shouted a distant masculine voice the sound of tearing bushes spun me rachel jenks cried falling away a black shadow crashed into me i screamed clenched into a ball as i hit the ground leaf mold hit my cheek the musky scent of were filled my senses the memory of karens teeth on my neck paralyzed me theyre alive i shouted covering my face damn it dont hurt me theyre alive this wasnt an alpha contest but an attack in the woods and i could be as scared as i wanted randy stand down the masculine voice shouted i still had my gun i still had my gun the thought of it slid through my panic i could plug the son of a bitch if i needed to but putting him down might not be the best way to go about this now that we were found id rather talk my way out of it the were standing over me grabbed my shoulder in his mouth and i almost lost it i submit i shouted knowing it would likely trigger a different set of reactions my hand still gripped my gun and if things didnt change really fast i was going to drop him get off her jenks said his voice low and controlled now all i could see was werewolf hair long brown and silky the heat from him was a moist wave of musk i shook from the adrenaline as the were snarled my shoulder still in its mouth i heard three pairs of people feet come to a thumping halt around us what is he i heard one whisper hes going to be a chew toy if he doesnt put that slingshot down another answered i took a breath willing myself to stop trembling if this moldy wolf hide doesnt get off me im going to spell him i shouted hoping my voice wasnt shaking the were growled and i couldnt help but shriek ill do it when his grip tightened randy get your wormy ass off her the first voice exclaimed shes right they arent dead theyre knocked out stand down the pressure on my shoulder increased then vanished hand on my shoulder i sat up trying not to shake as i took in the clearing it was full of downed wolves and weres all but one in their people shift jenks was surrounded by three weres in brown fatigues holding conventional weapons i didnt know what they were but they looked big enough to leave holes he still hadnt lowered his arm with the slingshot on it and it was pointed at a fourth were standing a little apart from everyone else he didnt have a drawn weapon but it was clear he was in charge since he had a shiny little emblem on his cap instead of a patch like everyone else he looked older too there was a pistol in a holster on his belt and brown face paint marked his skin swell id fallen into a freaking survivalist group just peachy damn keen the were that had pinned me was nosing the three downed wolves in the nearby distance a wolf howled and i shivered pulling my legs straight can i stand up the were with the emblem on his hat snorted i dont know maam can you funny funny man taking that as permission i sullenly got to my feet brushing the sticks and leaf mold off he had a twang to his voice as if having grown up in the south your weapon he said eyes tracking my movements and the bag and any charms i debated for all of three seconds then emptied the chamber and broke all the balls underfoot before tossing it he caught it with an easy grace an amused smile on him his gaze lingered on my neck and the clearly were bite marks and i made a face of exasperation god maybe i should have worn a turtleneck to storm the rebel fortress witch he said and i nodded throwing him my pack and two amulets i could have given them to marshal for all the good they had done me i came for nick i said shivering in the new cold what do you want for him the surrounding weres seemed to relax jenks jerked when one reached for his slingshot and i did nothing when they wrestled him to the ground and took it and his belt pack away looking like bullies falling on a kid after school jaw gritted at the grunts and thumps of fists into flesh i watched the leader instead wanting to know whom we faced he wasnt the alpha i decided while his men smacked jenks into a temporary submission but by his cleanshaven face and his bearing he was high up in the pack standing my height in heavylooking military boots he made a goodsized were wellproportioned and tidy in his fatigues with narrow shoulders and a body that looked like it was used to running trim not blocky in the least maybe late thirties early fortieshis hair was cut too close to his skull to know if it was gray or simply blond jenks shoved the three weres off him in disgust and got to his feet a sullen beaten pixy he was bleeding from a scratch on his forehead and his face went ashen when he saw the blood on his hands with that he lost all his will to fight obediently wobbling into place behind me when we were encouraged to head back to the road time to go meet the boss thirteen as we jostled down the shaded road the wind from our passage dried my sweat and made my curls into lank tangles jenks and i were in the back of the openaired hummerwhoohoo a convertiblethe were with the pin on his black cap sitting opposite us along with three other guys weapons pointed it was kind of sad really as it wouldnt take much to wrestle one away and fall out of the vehicle if i wanted to risk being shot but jenks was bleeding from a scalp wound shaking as he sat beside me his hand pressing the clean bandage they gave him against it it hadnt looked bad when i first saw it but by his reaction hed be dead in five minutes i wanted to see how bad it was before we did anything spectacular the were in wolf s clothing was up front with the driver squinting against the wind his tongue hanging out it would have been funny if it hadnt been for the guns do they have to drive so fast i muttered to jenks therere deer out here the guy in charge met my eyes they were brown pretty in the flickering light coming through the skimpy tree cover and reminding me of davids boss being both everywhere and nowhere at the same time they dont move much cept for dusk maam he said and i bobbed my head especially if theyre dead and gutted i thought sourly not really caring i turned away what id wanted to know had been answered he wasnt adverse to jenks and me talking i didnt know if we were prisoners or guests but there were those weapons mr imincharge adjusted his cap then jiggled the drivers elbow pointing to the radio hey he drawled into the mike after the driver passed it to him somebody pick up after a moment a slurred crackling what came back the mans thin lips went thinner three of arethas pack are down at saturdays kill i want a tank truck out therenow get a full data spread before you douse them i dont have any saltwater made up whoever it was complained no one told me we were collecting data this month thats because we arent he answered anger growing in his face though it wasnt in his slow speech but theyre down and since aretha has pups in her i want an ultrasound and be careful theyre riled up and likely to be unpredictable an ultrasound came an indignant voice who the hell is this this here is brett he drawled shifting his cap farther back and squinting at the sun we hit a bump and i clutched at a support post who the hell is this there was no answer except static and i snickered glad i wasnt the only one in trouble so i said when brett gave the mike to the driver and settled back are you a survivalist group or a wolf research station both he shifted his brown eyes between jenks and me the large pixy had his head bowed over his knees ignoring everyone in his effort to keep his hand to his wound i pulled a strand of hair out of my mouth wishing i had on more than my black tights i looked like a thief and the men surrounding me were getting their moneys worth they were in baggy camouflage and from what i could see each had a celtic knot tattooed in the arch of their ears that matched the emblems on their hats huh most packs had a tattoo that all members subscribed to but they usually put them in a more traditional place weres loved body decoration standing in stark contrast to vamps who shunned getting ink even if a parlor would give them any it seemed that pain was part of the mystique and since vamps could turn pain into pleasure it was a rare artist who would work on vamps living or dead but weres indulged themselves freely and the best artists could run on four feet as well as two i was glad david hadnt brought up the idea of a pack tattoo jenks was starting to hyperventilate and i put a hand on his shoulder take it easy jenks i soothed growing anxious when the light brightened and we slowed easing into a pleasantlooking compound there was a lake nearby with a mishmash of small cabins and larger homes surrounding it welltended dirt paths everywhere ill get you something as soon as we stop you will he said tilting his head to meet my eyes youll fix it i nearly laughed at his panicked expression until i remembered it was a pixy wifes ancestral duty to keep her mate alive and no one elsesand matalina wasnt here matalina wont mind i said then wondered will she his eighteenyearold features scrunched into relief no i didnt want to assume good lord jenks i said weight shifting when we stopped its no big deal bretts eyes were bright in speculation at the exchange and he made us remain seated until everyone else got out the were in wolf s clothing was last and as soon as jenks and my feet hit the parking lot brett directed us to head to the lake the people who saw us were curious but the only ones stopping to watch wore either bright flamboyant clothes or casual business attire both of which looked out of place among the predominant fatigues clearly they were not military and i wondered what they were doing there everyone was on two feet which wasnt surprising since it seemed there were two or possibly three packs on the islandthree big packsand when packs mixed fur flew if they didnt stay people it was highly unusual to have were packs mixing like this indeed i could see it in the thinly veiled disdain that the weres in fatigues showed the street weres and the belligerent whyshouldicarewhatyouthink attitude of the colorfully dressed pack in response chickadees called in the chill spring air and the sun was dappled through the pale green leaves of the saplings it was a nice spot but something smelled rank literally and it wasnt the breath of the were padding on four feet to my right my worried gaze followed jenkss to the lake logs were arranged in a circle around a large defunct bonfire and i could faintly smell the acidic odor of hurt and pain over the scent of old ash all of a sudden i did not want to go over there jenks stiffened nostrils flaring he dug in his heels with a defiant clench to his jaw tension slammed into me and every man with a weapon tightened his grip as we came to a collective halt the were on four feet growled ears flat and his lip curled to show white teeth now yall just ease down brett said softly cautiously evaluating jenkss resolve and rocking back we arent going to the pit mr vincent will want to see you he cocked his head at the driver put them in the living room get them a med kit and back off my eyebrows rose and the men surrounding us with their matching fatigues and cute caps looked among themselves their grips on their weapons shifting sir the driver stammered clearly not wanting to and bretts eyes narrowed you got a problem he said his slow drawl making twice as many syllables as was warranted or is security for a witch and awhatever he isbeyond you i cant leave them alone in mr vincents living room the driver said clearly worried a jeep with a milkywhite tank and coiled hose was leaving and brett smiled squinting in the sun deal with it he said and next time dont start to were less i tell you besides he looks smart he added indicating jenks and right quiet a gentleman so im willing to wager he wont be doing anything rash his amiable demeanor fell away to leave a hardened will capiche he said to jenks every drop of casual country boy gone jenks nodded his face both serious and scared i didnt care if this was their standard good copbad cop ploy as long as i didnt have to go to the lake relieved i smiled at brett not having to fake my gratitude in the brighter light at the outskirts of the parking lot i could tell that his hair was silver with age not sunlight putting him closer to forty than thirty bretts answering smile made his face wrinkle his eyes amused as he clearly realized i was playing the grateful captive and not as helpless as i let on randy he said and the were on four feet pricked his ears youre with me turning on a heel he strode to the second largest building off the lot the ponysized were trotting beside him the driver watched them go his lips moving in an unheard curse with obvious anger he jerked his weapon indicating we should take an alternate path jenks and i fell into step before they could touch us time for a little bad cop we were headed away from the pit but i didnt feel much better the walkway was made of flat slate and jenkss running shoes were silent beside mine the weres scuffed in their boots behind us the building we were headed for looked like it had been built in the seventies lowslung and made out of a salmoncolored stone with high small windows that overlooked the lake the middle section was taller and i imagined it had vaulted ceilings since it wasnt quite high enough for a full second story i slowed as i approached the entryway thinking the massive wood and steel door looked like it belonged to a vault you want me to just walk in i asked hesitating he sneered clearly not happy about his boss reprimanding him by giving him an awkward task that if we ran he would be punished for not to mention brett had taken with him the only member of his team that might have a chance of catching us taking that as a yes jenks reached in front of me to pull the door open leaving his blood behind on it it would be a good marker of where we were for someone looking if they forgot to clean it off i dont think anyone even noticed and we slipped inside down the hall and to the left the driver said gesturing with the butt of his weapon i was tired of his attitude it wasnt my fault brett was mad at him i took jenkss elbowapparently the sight of his blood was making him woozy againand led the way past sterile walls to a bright spot at the end of the hall it was clearly a living room and i evaluated it for possibilities while the driver had a hushed conversation with the armed sentry in the archway more weapons but no face paint or insignia on them this time apart from the tattoo the low ceilings of the hallway gave rise to that story and a half i had noticed from outside to my right a bank of windows opened onto an enclosed courtyard landscaped with shrubs and a formal fountain to my left was the exterior wall facing the lake a catwalk tucked under the high windows defense was written all over the sunken room and my mind pinged on my first ideathat this was a survivalists group i was willing to bet that when they left us alone someone would still be watching so it was no surprise when jenks muttered there are six cameras in here i cant place them all but i can hear their different frequencies no kidding i said eyes roving but seeing nothing in the plush sunken living room with two opposing couches a coffee table two chairs by the windows and what i thought was a modest entertainment center until i realized it held two huge flat screen tvs three satellite boxes and a computer that would have made ivy salivate i followed jenks down the shallow step to sit at the couch farthest in barking out a derisive hurry up with that firstaid kit when the driver hustled everyone out he hefted his rifle in a show of aggression and i gave him a simpering smile right i said flopping on the couch and stretching my arms out along the top of it youre going to plug me in your bosss living room and get blood all over his carpet because i was snippy do you know how hard it is to get blood out of carpet be a good little pup and do what youre told jenks fidgeted and the man flashed red his jaw muscles clenching you keep backing into your corner he said as he lowered his weapon when it comes to it ill be there whatever i looked at the ceiling baring my already bruised throat to him though my gut twisted with weres your rank determined how you were treated and i wanted to be treated well so i was going to be a bitch in more than one definition of the word i never heard him leave but i let out my held breath when jenks relaxed hes gone i whispered and he made an exasperated face tinks panties rache he said sitting on the edge of the couch beside me and putting his elbow on his knee that was rash even for you i brought my head back down to look at him surrounded by carpet and walls i could smell the lake on me and i ran a hand through my tangled damp curls getting my fingers stuck i thought about pushing his elbow off his knee but didnt since he was still bleeding instead i sat up and reached for the bandage pressed against his head dont he said sounding frantic as he drew back lips pursed i glared about the room at the unseen cameras wheres my damn firstaid kit i shouted someone better bring me my kit or im going to get pissed rache jenks protested i dont want to see the pit it smelled awful seeing his worry i tried to smile believe me im trying to stay out of it but if we act like prey theyll treat us like a wounded antelope youve watched animal planet right we both looked up when a small girl dressed in jeans and a sweater came in from the rooms only door she had a tackle box in her hand and she silently set it on the table before jenks and me not meeting our eyes she backed three steps away before turning around thank you i said never stopping she looked over her shoulder clearly surprised youre welcome she said stumbling on the step up out of the sunken area her ears went red and i guessed she was no more than thirteen life was good in a traditional were pack if you were on top crap if you were on the bottom and i wondered where she fit in jenks made a rude sound and i opened it up to find the usual stuffminus anything sharp and pointy so why were you nice to her he asked i dug until i found a goodsized bandage and a packet of antiseptic wipes because she was nice to me pushing the tackle box aside to make room on the table i sat sideways now are you going to be nice to me or am i going to have to get bitchy he took a deep breath astonishing me when he went solemn and worried okay he said slowly peeling the bandage away eyes fixed to the blood on it he started to breathe fast i almost smiled seeing that it was little more than a scratch maybe if he was four inches tall and had a thimbleful of blood it might be a problem but this was nothing it was still bleeding though and i tore open the antiseptic wipes hold still i said pulling away when he fidgeted darn it jenks hold still its not going to hurt that bad its just a scrape the way youre acting youd think it was a knife wound that was going to need stitches his jerked his gaze from the bloodstained bandage to mine the light coming in from the courtyard made his eyes very green its not that he said reminding me that we were being watched no one but matalina has ever tended me before except my mother i set my hands on my lap remembering hearing somewhere that pixies bonded for life a trickle of blood headed for his eyes and i reached for it you miss matalina i said softly jenks nodded his gaze going to the rag as i dabbed at his forehead gently brushing aside his yellow curls his hair was dry like straw ive never been away from her this long before he said ten years and weve never been apart for more than a day i couldnt help my twinge of envy here i was tending an eighteenyearold ready to die and missing his wife youre lucky jenks i said softly id be ecstatic if i could manage a year with the same guy its hormonal he said and i drew away affronted i think i saw some alcohol in here i muttered flipping the tackle box back open i meant between matalina and me he said the rims of his ears reddening i feel bad for you stumbling about searching for love with matalina i just knew making a sour face i teased out another antiseptic wipe and carefully dabbed his scrape to pick out a leaf chip yeah well witches arent that lucky i threw the bloodied pad on the table and jenks slumped going soft and mistyeyed i remember the first time i saw her he said and i made a mmmm of encouragement seeing that hed finally quit fidgeting i had just left home i was a country boy did you know that really the bandage i had pulled out was too big and i rummaged for something smaller spotting a handi wipe i gave it to him to clean his fingers with too much rain and not enough sun he said as he set his rag aside and opened the package as if it held gossamer carefully he unfolded the cloth the garden was bad i could either fend for myself or take the food out of my siblings mouth so i left hitched a ride on a produce truck and ended in cincinnatis farmers market i got beat up the first time i trespassed in the streets i didnt know crap sorry i said deciding that jenks might take offense at the barbie bandaid and shuffled through until i found a heman one just who were they giving first aid to kindergarteners it was just plain luck matalina found me sleeping under that bluebell plant and not one of her brothers luckily she found me woke me and tried to kill me in that order i was even luckier when she let me stay the night breaking her familys first rule i looked up my tension easing at the love in his eyes it was shocking to see it there honest and raw in so young a face he gave me a weak smile i left before sunup but when i heard a new housing development was going in near eden park i went to look over the plans they were putting in lots of landscaping i asked matalina to help me and when the trucks came we were there one person cant hold anything but two can have the world rache i had a feeling he was trying to tell me more than his words were saying but i didnt want to listen hold still i said pushing his hair out of the way and putting the bandage on i leaned back and his bloodied hair fell to hide it turning to the table i gathered my mess into a pile not knowing what to do with it thank you jenks said softly and i flicked a glance at him no prob matalina stitched me up right nice so im glad to return the favor there was a scuffing at the open archway and we turned a small man in slacks and a red polo shirt had come in his pace quick and confidentbusy was the impression i got two men in fatigues were right behind him they had pistols in leg holsters and i stood jenks was quick to follow tossing his stained curls out of his way the mans hair was cut close to his head military style with a whiteness that stood out in sharp contrast to his deep tan and windroughened features there was no beard or mustache which didnt surprise me presence flowed from him like cologne as he stepped down into the living room but it wasnt trent kalamacks confidence based on manipulation no it was a confidence born from knowing he could pin you to the floor and hurt you he was in his early fifties i guessed and id dare call him squat and compact none of it was flab boss man i presume i whispered and he came to a jerky halt four feet away the table between us his intelligence was obvious as he looked jenks and me over fingers fumbling at his shirt pocket for a pair of glasses while we stood there in our thiefblack outfits the man took a breath and let it out hell he said to jenks his voice rough as if he smoked a lot ive been watching you the last five minutes and i dont know what you are jenks looked at me and i shrugged surprised to find him that open and honest im a pixy jenks said tucking his hand behind his back so the man wouldnt try to shake it by god a pixy he blurted brown eyes wide glancing at me he put his glasses on took a breath and added your work yup i said reaching out to shake his hand my breath hissed and i jerked back when the two men that had come in with him cocked their weapons i hadnt even seen them pull them stand down the man bellowed and jenks jumped it was shockingly loud and deep carrying the crack of a whip i watched heart pounding until the two men lowered their sights they didnt put the guns away though i was starting to hate those little hats of theirs walter vincent the man said hitting the ts sharp and crisp i glanced at the men behind him then extended my hand again rachel morgan i said more confidently than i felt and this is jenks my partner this was weird civilized yes ive come to rob you sir how delightful wont you have some tea before you do the were before me pursed his lips his white eyebrows going high i could see his thoughts jumping and i found myself thinking he had a rugged attractiveness despite his age and that he was likely going to have someone hurt me i was a sucker for a smart man especially when the brains came packaged in a body that was carefully maintained rachel morgan he said his voice rising and falling in amazement ive heard of you if you can believe it though mr sparagmos is of the belief that youre dead my heart gave one hard beat nick was here he was alive i licked my lips suddenly nervous it was only a bad hair day but try telling that to the media i exhaled never looking away knowing i was challenging him but feeling i had to im not leaving without him head bobbing walter backed up two quick steps the men behind him had a better shot at me and my heart found a faster pace jenks didnt move but i heard his breathing quicken truer words may never have been spoken walter said it was a threat and i didnt like the complete unconcern in his voice jenks moved to stand beside me and the tension rose a small man in fatigues silently came in with a sheet of paper distracting him walters eyes slowly slid from me and my pentup shudder broke free my lips pressed together in annoyance that he had gotten to me walter stood by the wide window light spilling in over him and his paper as he squinted at it while reading he pointed to the firstaid kit and silently the man collected it all and left rachel morgan independent runner and equal third holder in vampiric charms walter said broke from the is last june and survived his attention came back to me curiosity high in his rugged tanned face he sat in an overstuffed chair and let the paper fall to the floor no one picked it up i glanced at it seeing a blurry shot of me with my hair all over the place and my lips parted like i was on brimstone i frowned not remembering it being taken walter put an ankle on one knee and i pulled my gaze up waiting only someone very smart or very wealthy survives an is death threat he said thick powerful fingers steepled you arent smart seeing as we caught you and you clearly work for your bread and butter being from cincinnati youre logically one of kalamacks more attractive sacrificial sheep i took an angry breath and jenks caught my elbow jerking me back i dont work for trent i said feeling myself warm i broke my is contract on my own he had nothing to do with it except that i paid for my freedom by almost nailing his ass for trafficking in biodrugs walter smiled to show me small white teeth says here you had breakfast with him last december after a night on the town my flush of anger turned to one of embarrassment i was suffering from hypothermia and he didnt want to drop me at the hospital or my office one would have gotten the law involved the other my roommate both to be avoided if ones name was kalamack exactly walter leaned forward his eyes fixed on mine you saved his life rubbing my fingers into my forehead i said it was a one shot deal maybe if i had been thinking i wouldve let him drown but then i wouldve had to give the ten thousand back walter was smug as he leaned into his chair by the window the sun glinting on his white hair the question you will answer is how did kalamack find out about the artifacts existence much less that someone knew where it was and where that person is slowly i sat on the edge of the couch feeling sick jenks moved to the other side of the coffee table sitting to watch my back walter and the door all at the same time male weres were known to cut females of any species a lot of slack since their hormones guided their thoughts but eventually logic would kick in and things were going to get nasty i glanced at the two men by the door then the plateglass window neither one was a good option i had nowhere to go ive nothing against you walter said bringing my attention from the possibility of throwing one of them into the glass to break it thus solving two problems at once and im willing to let you and your partner go astonished i stupidly did nothing when the small man pushed up from his chair in a smooth very fast motion the two men by the door were already moving my breath caught and i stifled a gasp when the compact were was suddenly on me rache jenks shouted and i heard the click of safeties there was a scuffle that ended with his grunt of pain but i couldnt see him walters face was in the way calm and calculating his fingers lightly around my neck just under my chin adrenaline pulsed to make my head hurt almost too fast to realize the older were had pinned me to the couch heart pounding i jerked back my first instinct to struggle though it was hard really hard i met his placid brown eyes and fear struck me he was so calm so sure of his dominance i could smell his aftershave and the rising scent of musk under it as he hung over me his small but powerful hand under my chin the only place we touched his pulse was fast and his breathing quick but his eyes were calm i didnt move knowing it would trigger an entirely new set of ugliness jenks would suffer and then me as long as i didnt do anything neither would walter it was a were mind game and though it went against all my instincts i could play it my fingers though were stiff and my arm was tense ready to jab his solar plexus even if it did get me shot im willing to let you go he repeated softly his breath smelling of cinnamon toothpaste and his thick lips hardly moving you will return to kalamack and tell him that its mine he wont have it it belongs to me damn elf thinks he can rule the world he whispered so only i could hear its our turn they had their chance my heart pounded and i felt my pulse lift against his fingers looks to me like it belongs to nick i said boldly and how had he known trent was an elf i took a quick breath of air jerking when he pushed himself away and was suddenly eight feet back my gaze shot to jenks he had been dragged to the middle of the room and he now held himself to favor his right leg he gave me an apologetic look he didnt owe me and the two men holding him let go at a small gesture from walter the dry blood in jenkss his hair was turning a tackylooking brown and i forced my eyes from him and back to walter ruffled i refused to touch my neck instead draping my arms over the top of the couch inside i was shaking i didnt like weres either hit me or back off but this posturing and threats was useless to me exuding confidence and satisfaction walter sat taking the couch opposite me and mirroring me almost exactly clearly the were wasnt going to break the silence so i would it would cost me points in this inane game but i wanted to see the end of it before the sun went nova i dont give a damn about your artifact i said voice soft so it wouldnt shake like my hands were threatening to and as far as i know trent doesnt either i dont work for him intentionally im here for nick now i took a slow breath are you going to give him to me or am i going to have to hurt a few people and take him instead of laughing walters brow furrowed and he sucked on his teeth kalamack doesnt know he said flatly making it a statement not a question why are you here why do you care what happens to sparagmos i pulled my arms from the couch putting one hand on my hip and the other gesturing in exasperation you know i asked myself that same question just this morning a smile came over the were and he glanced to a decorative mirror presumably twoway a rescue of the heart he said and i warmed at the mockery in his voice you love him and he thinks youre dead oh thats classic but its stupid enough to be the truth i said nothing gritting my teeth jenks shifted closer and the sentries adjusted the grip on their weapons pam walter called and i wasnt surprised when a diminutive woman entered arms swinging confidently an amulet dangling from her fingers she was dressed in lightweight cotton capri pants and a matching blouse her long black hair coming to her midback defined eyebrows thick pouty lips and a delicate facial bone structure gave me the impression of a china doll a very athletic china doll i amended when she pointedly dropped the amulet on the coffee table in accusation truth charm i guessed by the notches on the rim and i pulled my gaze away from the clatter of it hitting the table weres used witch magic more than vamps and i wondered if it was because they needed the boost of power more than the vamps or if it was that vamps were so sure of their superiority they felt they didnt need witch magic to compete with the rest of inderland shes not lying the woman said giving me a quick smile that was neither warm nor welcoming about anything walter sighed as if it was bad news im sorry to hear that he said softly damn i looked at jenks his eyes were wide and he looked anxious he had heard it too something had shifted double damn six more men came in and walter stood curving his arm familiarly about pams waist and tugging her closer pit them he said sounding regretful and jenks stiffened i want to know if anyone is coming after her he smiled at pam try not to do anything that cant be undone we may have to give them back to whoever backed her in this she many not belong to kalamack but she belongs to someone whoa wait up i said standing youd let me walk out of here if i worked for trent and was after your stinking statue but youre going to put me away if all i came for was nick jenks groaned and i froze when walter and pam looked to the truth amulet on the table it shone a nice friendly green and you knew it was a statue how walter said softly crap on toast stupid stupid witch now they wouldnt stop until they found out about jax i knew jenkss thoughts were on a similar path when he jiggled on his feet anxious find out what they know walter said and a wild look came over jenks i fought to not move as someone put his hands on me exerting a steadily growing pressure to fall into motion bretts stocky figure eased into the archway his expression clearly saying he thought they were making a mistake im not going to talk i said shaking inside there isnt a spell stirred that can make me saying anything much less the truth walter favored me with a smile that showed his small teeth i wasnt planning on using spells to make you talk we have drugs for that he said and i went cold sparagmos has quite a resistance to them and weve since turned to older methods hes resisting those too but maybe we can move him by hurting you all he does is weep when we ask him where the statue is pam will you supervise her interrogation my ulcer acts up when i hurt a woman he started for brett and the archway leaving jenks and me with a room full of weapons frantic i looked from jenks to walter standing by the door giving a quiet set of instructions to brett i scanned the room as if for options finding none if she knows someone else does too find out who walter finished rache jenks whispered clearly tensed to move but waiting for me to give the word i claim ascension i said frightened oh god not again not on purpose walter jerked but it was pam who spun her dark hair furling with the motion and her lips parted a surprised doll with red cheeks i claim the right for pack ascension i said louder i wasnt about to fight her but i could stall for time kisten would know something was wrong if i didnt call him in three days at that point i didnt care if i had to be rescued or not i want three days to prepare you cant touch me i added for good measure anger pulled walters white eyebrows tight and furrows lined his brow you cant he said you arent a were and even if you were youd be nothing but a twobite whore jenks didnt relax but he was listening as was everyone in the room poised waiting i can i said shrugging out of the grip of whoever held me i do my pack number is och af and as an alpha i can claim ascension over whomever in hell i want to look me up im in the catalog shaking i gave pam a shrug i hope she understood meant it was nothing personal she looked at the bruises on my neck her eyebrows rising but her thoughts unknown i dont want to front your lousy tickinfested pack i said making sure everyone knew where i was coming from but i want nick if i best your alpha then i claim him and leave i took a slow breath we all leave intact and unharassed no walter barked and everyone but pam and i jumped jenks looked worried his green eyes pinched rache he said apparently not caring everyone could hear him remember what happened the last time i shot him a poisonous look i won last time i said hotly by a point of law he said jerking to a standstill when he tried to take a step and the men surrounding him threatened violence jenks i said patiently ignoring the pointed weapons we can try to fight our way out of some crazy survivalists group swim for shore and hopefully elude them or i can fight one stinking were one way we end up hurt and with nothing the other way im the only one who gets hurt and maybe we walk away from this with nick thats all i want jenkss face fell into an unusual expression of hatred that looked wrong on him why he whispered i dont know why you even care i dropped my eyes to the carpet wondering that myself this isnt a game walter said his round face going red get the medic up here with the drugs i want to know who sent them and what they know the man grabbed me and i tensed ah walter dear pam said and everyone in the room froze at the ice in her voice what by cerberuss balls are you doing in the silence walter turned she isnt a were i thought his words cut off at pams low noise her eyes were squinting and her hands were on her hips ive been challenged her voice got louder how am i supposed to walk out of this room and not have every last whining dog think im a coward i dont care if shes a leprechaun and has green tits she just pissed in my food dish jenks snickered making walters ears redden sweetie he coaxed but he was hunched and submissive i cocked an eyebrow at jenks maybe id been going about weres all wrong it was the women who held the balls of the alpha males that really had the power sugar pup he tried again when she pushed his hand off her shes stalling for time i want to know whos coming to bail her out before they get here shes not a were and i dont want to jeopardize gaining the artifact by adhering to old traditions that dont belong anymore its those traditions that put you where you are now she said scathingly we dont have to give her three days pam turned to me simpering we do it now think of it as me softening her up it will be fun and if she cheats with her magic the pack can rip her to shreds my hope did the proverbial swirl down the crapper walter apparently didnt know what to do either as he stood in blank surprise while pam kissed his cheek smiling give me twenty minutes to change she said then sashayed out i looked at jenks shit this was not what i had planned fourteen little sun made it past the fragile spring leaves and i shivered it is the cold i thought not the rank smell of ash and emptied bowels or the people joining the noisy throng in twos and threes and it wasnt that jenks had his hands cuffed before him and it couldnt be from the air of a festival growing as everyone gathered to see me get mauled no it had to be from the chill may afternoon yeah right i whispered forcing my hands from my elbows and rocking to my toes to loosen my muscles the scent of old smoke was strong from the nearby fire pit almost hiding the rising odor of musk i had a feeling they wouldve lit the bonfire to add to the travesty if it had been later as it was the people in fatigues and little caps were arranging themselves in small knots in one corner across the clearing the street weres in their baggy colorful clothes were more cool as they portrayed an indifference that was fake but effective nonetheless between them was the third group wearing slacks and dresses they were quietly laughing at the guys in fatigues but were clearly wary of the rougher wild cannons the street weres made with their show of jewelry and loud voices the excited chatter was getting on my nerves under it was the sensation of gathering power it tickled through me and my expression blanked as i slowly recognized the unfamiliar feeling with thoughts of the fiasco at mrs bryants running through me i opened my minds eye to see the surrounding weres auras my gut twisted as they swam into view crap on toast i thought glancing worriedly at jenks all three packs had the same sheen of brown rimming their auras most weres had an outermost haze reflecting the predominant color of their male alphas and the chance that all three alpha males on the island had brown auras was slim they were bound into a round under one were damn it this wasnt fair and the bond was strong too i realized as i scanned the compound for a way out of this strong enough to sense as it hadnt been at davids intervention which didnt bode well for the upcoming alpha contest listening to the jeers and chatter around me i couldnt help but feel as if the extra strength came from the subordinate members joining it walter wasnt an especially powerful alpha and i wasnt vain enough to think that they had done this just to see me get torn apart i was getting the sensation that they had been bound to a common goal for weeks maybe days at the least disconcerted i dropped my second sight and stretched where i stood legs spread wide and bending at the waist to place the flat of my arms against the hardpacked dirt i had to find a way to break the round or today would be a repeat of karen without the happy ending my butt was in the air with only my black tights between me and their imaginations and at a rude laugh i came up in a slow exhale i turned to jenks they had let him wash the blood off his hair and his blond mop was in loose ringlets throwing his green eyes in stark relief youthful features pinched he stood absolutely still for once and i didnt think it was because of the armed guard actually i was surprised they had him here but he was providing a lot of entertainment and was a curiosity in himself i could understand their confidence even if we got away how could we escape survivalists streetracer gangs and weres with credit cards about the only thing going for me was that my rudimentary ley line skills hadnt made it to walters report i was a strict earth witch according to it and seeing as i hadnt made a circle or hit the wolves with anything other than an earth charm they had no idea i could work the lines too just as well they would have put one of those nasty black ratchetwristbands on me for fear id tap a line through my familiar and make them all toads that i didnt have a familiar was a mute point the band would have still made me helpless robbing me of the energy i had in my chi and spindled in my head and i wanted to use it i looked at my feet and stifled a shiver of nervousness id wanted to turn jenks his proper size before this got started jax waited at the hotel and as long as it was warm jenks could fly back and they could get out of here this wasnt a rescue anymore we were down to salvage excitement rose through the surrounding weressending the feeling of sandpaper over the skin of my aura now that i was aware of itand i followed everyones attention as pam made her sedate way to us her red robe fluttered about her bare feet and with her hair flowing about her she looked exotic walking under the trees as if belonging to the earth my muscles tensed and avoiding her eyes i went to jenks for a last word stop one of his guards barked before i had gone three feet and i froze hip cocked give me a break i said loudly as if i wasnt shaking inside what by the turn do you think im going to do pams voice rose high carrying a derision i wasnt sure was aimed at me or the guys with guns let her talk to him she said it may be the last time she has her wits about her thats nice i mused the threat of their doctor with his needles keeping me quiet pam swayed to a halt before two women they didnt look enough alike to be friends the tallest was wearing a wellworn leather halter and classically torn jeans and the other had on an inappropriate dress suit and heels visiting alphas i guessed the four men around jenks had lowered their weapons a smidge and i sidled past i was finding it easier to ignore the barrels pointed at me though stress had me wound tighter than ivys last blind date jenks i said i want to turn you small his worry melted into disbelief what the hell for i grimaced wishing the guards werent hearing this you can fly back to the mainland while its warm get on a bus go home and forget i ever asked you to help me with this i dont know if i have enough everafter spindled to invoke both spells and i cant let you risk being stuck like this if i i grimaced if i get hurt i finished i dont think ceri can reverse the curse herself so shed have to twist a new one and for that shed need demon blood i wanted him to tell me i was being an ass and that he was with me to the end but i had to offer his brow furrowed are you done he said softly i said nothing and he leaned forward putting his lips beside my ear youre a dumbass witch he whispered his words soft but intent and i smiled if i could id pix you for a week for even suggesting i up and leave you here youre going to unwind that everafter in your head to were then youre going to pin that woman and then we will get the hell off this island with nick im your backup he said taking a flushed step backward not a comeeasy friend who flies away at the first sign of a problem you need me witch you need me to carry nick if hes unconscious hotwire the jeep to drive back to the beach and steal a boat if he cant swim and jax is fine he added hes a grown pixy and can take care of himself i made sure before we left that he knew the number to the church and could read cincinnati off the bus schedule the lines in his face eased and a crafty glint replaced the hard anger in his eyes i dont need to be small to get out of these cuffs he sent one eyebrow up turning into a scallywag five seconds easy the wash of relief flowing through me was distressingly shortlived but im not going to let her pin me i said im going to fight until i cant anymore if i die youre stuck like this his smile widened aw you arent going to die he said mischievously why because youre with me ooooh she can be taught hiding his hands from the guards he bent his thumb moving it in a stomachturning disjointedness so the cuffs could slide right off now get out there and get a mouthful of bitch ass he finished jiggling his wrists so the metal links fell back in place i snorted thanks coach i said feeling the first fingers of possibility ease my slight headache but as i looked over the noisy throng i grew depressed i did not want to do this it was a demon curse for gods sake and the easiest way to get out of this i thought ceri had said the payment wouldnt be that bad the smut would be worth escaping being drugged id seen her make the curse nothing had died to make it i was paying the price not some poor animal or sacrificial person was it possible for a curse to be technically black but morally white did that make using it right or was i just a chickenass taking the easy way out and rationalizing myself out of a lot of pain you cant do anything if youre dead i told myself deciding to worry about it later nauseated i looked over the heads of the growing conglomeration of weres the energy coming off them seemed to swirl around me like a fog making my skin tingle okayi was going to be a wolf i wouldnt be helpless like before pam might not feel any pain but if i got ahold of her neck she was going down in a modified sleeper a quick glace at pam and i shook my hands to loosen them as challenger it was my place to assume the field first breath held i took five steps into the clearing the noise increased and a swift memory of being a contestant in cincys illegal rat fights flitted through me and was gone what was it with me and organized beatings anyway pam turned head high she smiled at the women with her and touched the shoulder of the one with the most polish in parting light on her bare feet she came forward the crowds noise turning softer more intent it was easy to see the predator in her despite her diminutive size and she reminded me of ivy though the only similarity was their grace rache jenks said loudly the alarm in his voice bringing me around he pointed with his chin to walter approaching on the same path his wife had used there were two men with him one in a suit and the youngest in headtotoe red silk his walk a jewelryjangling swagger walter halted at the edge of the circle and on impulse i opened my second sight walters aura wasnt rimmed in that hazy brown sheenit was permeated with it the entire three packs had begun to accept his dominance i quickly scanned the other two alpha males auras theirs were clear of walters influence as were their wives but the visiting alphas had to know it was happening that they were voluntarily letting him do this to their packs scared the crap out of me whatever nick had stolen must be big for them to bind themselves for so long that walter was starting to claim them all it went against all were tradition and instinct it just wasnt done walter looked utterly satisfied he glanced at me his eyebrows rising as if knowing i could visually see the mental connection he was fixing over another alphas pack smirking he looked to pam and gestured pam reached for the tie to her robe wait i called and a ripple of laugher went through them they thought i was frightened i have a spell to were with and i dont want to get shot using it there was a collective hesitation and most of the conversations were stilled the street gang muttering the loudest i shifted from foot to foot waiting pam recovered smoothly coming to a halt a good ten feet from me you can were she said a mocking smile on her walter honey i didnt think earth witches could do that they cant he said shes lying so she can put a black spell on us i can were i said letting my second sight fade its a ley line ah charm and if i had wanted to put a spell on you i would have done it already im a white witch my stomach hurt and i had to go to the bathroom oh god i was a white witch but it was a black curse i had sworn i wouldnt and here i was jumping head first into the hole it didnt matter that the black was negligible it was going to be on my soul what in hell was i doing here walter looked at the crowd when a few called to get on with it pam he asked and the slight woman beamed playing up to them challengers choice she said and the assembled weres cheered walter nodded your choice he said to me do you want to start on two feet making part of the contest how fast you can were or do you want to were and then begin i know what challengers choice is i said snottily i have done this before and this isnt legal my alpha isnt here and there arent six other alphas to adjudicate in his absence walters face showed shock for an instant then he hid it we have six alphas he said she doesnt count i said pointing but all they did was laugh at me like i really thought they would do this by the book we start from four legs i said softly knowing she was going to were fast anyway so i might as well have a chance to catch my breath before we got on with it the crowd liked that and pam nonchalantly undid the tie to her robe letting it slip from her to pool at her feet and leave her stark naked she looked like a goddess with her perfect tan standing with one foot slightly before the other even her stretch marks added to her image of proud survivor the noise of the crowd never changed or acknowledged her new ah look i flushed dropping my gaze god help me i wasnt going to do the same jenkss clothes had vanished with even his scars when he turned i expected it would be the same for me and i wouldnt show up as a wolf in black tights and a lacy pair of underwearas amusing as that would be no way was i going to show them i was a nasty pasty color with freckles a shiver of adrenaline went through me that the crowd responded to and i watched a visiting alpha bring her a sheaf of pungent wolf s bane a murmur of approval rose when she curtly refused no one offered me any bitches not that it would have helped pam closed her eyes and my lips parted as she started to change id only seen hollywoods version and by god they had it right her features molded elongating in the face and thinning in the arms and legs in a gross caricature of human and wolf i had no idea where she was getting the power to shift since weres couldnt and didnt use ley lines to were like werefoxes did which was why they could control their size a talent werewolves envied pam collapsed to heri guess they were almost haunches nowand propped herself up with her emancipated arms her entire skin flashed to black and silky fur appeared a whine came from her and her eyes flashed open still human and grotesque her face was ugly with a long muzzle still holding human teeth she was neither wolf nor human caught in the middle and completely helpless and damn it was fast rache jenks shouted do something i looked across the cheering weres to him as pam fell over into a stifflegged posture shaking as her insides rearranged oh yeah heart pounding i shut my eyes immediately the smell of rising musk and the stink of my own sweat struck me over it was the smell of maggotinfested flesh from the as yet unseen pit i didnt think there was anyone still alive in it but i couldnt tell for sure the sound of the crowd beat on me the waves of force coming off them distracting i put my hands together over my chi and hoped it wasnt going to hurt too badly lupus i breathed my eyelashes fluttering i took a breath eyes flashing open when the everafter unrolled from my thoughts like a scab peeling away it had a delicious painfulness a feeling of returning to an earlier state a sheet of blackstained everafter filmed me and i couldnt see clearly my hearing was gone wrapped in a muzzy blanket my balance shifted and my knees and hands hit the earth almost seeming to sink i threw my head back and gasped at the feeling of electricity stacking me differently but it didnt hurt as the earth charm had when i turned into a mink this wasnt a cobbling together of parts and pieces but a pulse of growth from atoms to memories natural and painless as breathing i was alive as if every nerve was feeling for the first time as if the blood moved for the first time i was alive i was here it was exhilarating head up i laughed letting it spill from me a chortling chuckle that expanded into a howl the black everafter dropped from me and my hearing exploded into existence filling my ears with the sound of me i was alive damn it not just existing and everyone would know my exuberant howl rose silencing everyone in the distance there was an answer i recognized it it was aretha the wolf wed met when we first came on the island she met my voice with her own telling me she was alive too and then the price for me breaking the laws of nature hit me my voice cut off in a strangled gurgle unable to breathe i fell clawing at my new muzzle with dull nails panicking i felt the crushing weight of black soak in i shuddered and my eye stung as i forgot to close them and i rubbed my face into the earth tighter the band of blackness clenched around my soul no i thought seeing the gray of unconsciousness tingle at the edge of my sight i would survive i wouldnt let it kill me i could take this ceri had and a thousand times worse i could do this but it hurt it hurt like shame and despair made real my will rose accepting what i had done panting i forced my tongue into my mouth there was dirt on it and my teeth were gritty shaken i lay and did nothing content to feel my lungs work everything was in black and white except for the last few feet i could see color if it was close enough and as my eyes took in the world while i figured out how to get up my mind started inventing colors until it seemed natural the sounds too were alien piecing them together was beyond me and what i couldnt decipher retreated into a background hiss rache jenks shouted and i winced when my ears flicked backward appalled i felt my tail thump this is pathetic i held my breath to get up when i found i wasnt coordinated enough to do both at the same time yet frustrated i staggered to my feet feeling the new way my muscles worked and nearly falling again pam was still sprawled on the earth panting as she finished changing she had to be close karen had wered in about thirty seconds it was about that now the scent of ash and decayed flesh was choking under it i could smell the packs about me like fingerprints the scent of gunpowder on some the stink of grease on others mild expensive fragrance on the rest pam was a weird mix her alienness of being part human and part wolf like the taste of rotten eggs in my nose and on my tongue i sneezed just about going over the crowd gasped and i suddenly realized they were silent watching me in a mix of shock and awe so i had wered so what i had said i could shes red someone whispered surprised i looked at what i could see of myself holy crap i was i was a freaking red wolf with softly waving red fur that turned black about my feet hey i was pretty on all fours i swung my head up to jenks his eyes flicked to mine then out again telling me to pay attention to what was going on shes a red wolf someone in baggy pants said shaking his neighbors arm she wered perfectly his voice grew in awe look at her shes a fucking red wolf the murmur was lifted up and repeated and if a wolf could flush i did what did it matter what color i was all i had to do was pin pam as if hearing my thoughts pam surged to her feet in a splurge of motion she was huge having retained all her human mass lips curling from her long muzzle she let a soft growl slip from her her brown eyes fixed on me my pulse surged and my hind foot slipped back the crowd cheered at that hurting my ears pams growl continued promising me pain walter would probably try to stop her from killing me until i gave them the information they wanted but i doubted he was going to be successful take your best shot i barked and she lunged the packed dirt spurting out behind her pams rumble turned aggressive as she halved the distance between us my thoughts lit on karen her jaws around my neck and my crippling fear but then i saw the pride in her eyes and something snapped under the fur and lean muscle she was intelligent and with that comes a knowledge of paineven if she wouldnt feel it i forced my muscles to bunch and darted forward silent and low to the ground we met in a confusion of snapping teeth and stumbling paws she hadnt expected this and her reach for my throat landed on my hindquarters she twisted for my neck forefeet almost on me belly on the ground i ducked under her and found something to bite it was a narrow leg of fur and bone i bit down hard i would not die here because of another womans pride the ugly rasp of bone scraped my teeth like nails on a chalkboard a yelp of pain burst from her giving me a surge of hope she had felt it pam fell on me as i took her support away she rolled and i backed up on all fours i was covered in dirt and by the dull throb i think she had bit my hip the weres surrounding us screamed their approval the welldressed businessmen somehow looking uglier than the men in fatigues brandishing their weapons in salute of their alpha jenks looked ready to fly to my side held back by increasingly lax solders i wondered why they hadnt taken her pain other than when she wered then realized thats what they were after davids boss had wanted a quick resolution to an office problem but these weres i scanned their faces as they cheered they were savage cocky and looking for blood this was not normal were behavior even if we were in the woods away from even the pretense of is law it wasnt just the military and street weres either the ones in business suits and dress shoes were in on it and as pam and i circled to access the damage i had a sickening feeling the difference was from all of them binding together in a round they all had the ego of an alpha flowing through them but lacked the sophistication to deal with it they were wallowing in the natural high aggressive as an alpha but without the control id have been really worried about it if i didnt have pam to deal with across the clearing pam held a foot off the ground her eyes determined crouched low i snarled i knew it was a submissive posture but i wasnt a wolf inside rache jenks shrilled an instant before pam attacked i backpedaled but she found me i went limp when her larger jaws gripped my neck and shook me pain flamed and my air was cut off i all but panicked sending my forefeet to find her eyes they wouldnt reach she shook me again her strength terrifying my spine felt like it was on fire pain clouded my thoughts the screams of the watchers beat at me telling me to submit still in her grip i swung my hind feet up curling into a ball i dug at her face desperate she yelped when i found her eyes flinging me spinning to the feet of the watchers rachel jenks cried and i got to my feet shaking get nick i barked hackles raised as i limped forward before i got kicked i didnt know how this was going to end anymore i wasnt going to submit we didnt all have to die pam was panting the skin around one eye torn blood seeped from it and she tracked my movement accessing get nick i shouted again knowing he wouldnt understand ill catch you up i didnt know if it was the truth or a wish this is hard rache he said softly but i could hear him so could pam ill come back for you after i find him pams ears pricked as she realized we were still going to make a play for nick head tilted to protect her eye she sprang forward with a savage sound she was headed for jenks run i howled leaping to intercept her she skidded to a halt with me between her and jenks i had bitten her twice and she was learning that small meant faster i couldnt look to see if he left but by pams eyes tracking something behind me i had to believe he had no one was paying attention to him now determination swelled in me he was my vanguard and this time i had his back i wouldnt let this shewolf past me pam shifted her feet in frustration in what was probably an attempt to warn them she lifted her muzzle to the sky and howled the weres surrounding us joined her thinking she was trying to cow me their human voices almost matched hers you wont get past me i barked then in a bold show i lifted my own head and howled trying to drown out her voice i am alive and i will stay that way pams howl cut off in surprise and my voice rose against the rest its higher pitch sounding more authentic ringing with defiance from nearby came another howl aretha the surrounding weres went absolutely silent their faces wondering fear in some of them for a moment my voice twined with arethas alone and then they died together pam looked shocked that the wolf had answered me she stood with her tail drooping blood dripping from one eye and her rear foot held off the ground i hurt everywhere my back my hip and the smell of blood came from my pulsing ear when had she done that but jenks was waiting for me snarling i gathered myself and lunged pam fell back jaws snapping at my neck as i tried for her front leg i jerked out from under her a sharp stab in my ear telling me she had scored again i rolled and she followed flipping to my feet i met her yap with my own toothy aggressive grin she came at me without pause and i skittered away the watchers were silent now breathless someone was going to die and jenks wasnt with me anymore i found her neck my grip slipped when my teeth closed and she jerked back she had my leg in her mouth and a rush of adrenaline pulsed i had half a second before shed crush it i fell to the earth and pulled teeth closed on my footpad i yipped scrambling up and away panting we hesitated behind us the circle of weres had turned into knots of tense people no one had noticed jenks was gone pam gathered herself and i felt a burn of anger i didnt have time for this but she hesitated freezing as her attention went to the lakes edge behind me my fur rose and my skin prickled i didnt turn i didnt need to and alarm showed in pams eyes when she saw me track the second wolf skirting the edges of the parking lot behind her visible past the knots of people a frightened whisper rose fingers pointing and hands going to mouths as they realized aretha had braved the compound desensitized to the smell of weres and pulled by the sound of my fight with pam aretha had come and she didnt look happy ears pricked the wolf confidently padded across the lot and came under the shade of the surrounding trees the first roundness of her belly gave witness to the pups she carried and i felt afraid pam and i were fighting for dominance on her island her pack had surrounded us as we fought blind to everything else shit dont run pam i thought when she went frightened for all her wereness she was also human she was hurt and surrounded by a wild alphas pack and she stank like were not wolf pam i barked seeing her start to turn dont but she did spinning she ran betting they would fall on me as she went for the safety of the buildings as the joke goes you dont have to be faster than the wolf chasing you just faster than everyone else running away i jerked digging my feet into the ground to keep from following when three gray shadows streaked past me after her the crowd panicked falling into chaos and scattering women screamed and men shouted someone shot their weapon off and i skittered sideways nails gouging the packed dirt my pulse hammered but my eyes were riveted to the four wolves dodging trees and picnic tables terrified pam streaked past the security of walls and into the trees in seconds they were gone a yip of pain rose sharp over the noise of frightened people walter shouted for silence and in the new stillness there were unseen savage snarls and barks then a terrifying silence whitefaced walter gestured and a cluster of men with unslung weapons raced into the trees after them i felt sick this wasnt my fault a feminine gasp pulled me spinning around my heart pounded and i felt my knees go wobbly aretha had silently entered the clearing as if the surrounding people didnt exist ear flicking she stopped a good fifteen feet from me her fur the color of silver bark i looked at her with my wolf eyes seeing the grace and beautyand her utter alienness i might look like a wolf but i wasnt one and we both knew it i started freezing again when she lifted her muzzle an eerie soft howl rose from her picked up by three more voices along the ridge she was checking to see who had won adrenaline scoured through me aretha lowered her head her yellow eyes fixing on me a last time before she turned and padded across the lot satisfied the wind in the trees slipped down to ruffle the fur about my sore and battered body what in hell had just happened a twig snapped and i skittered like a shying horse heart pounding when i came to an ungraceful halt it was the street weres alpha pale but determined with his pack around him its not my fault i barked knowing he wouldnt understand the weres brimstoneweathered face was one of awe as he flicked his eyes from me to where aretha had vanished his tattoos from multiple packs made him look rough and uncouth but his face was as cleanshaven as jenkss bending he plucked a tuft of red hair that pam had pulled from me looking at it as if it meant something the shewolf he said to walter as his roving eyes told me he meant aretha she chose morgan to live and your alpha to die the surrounding weres started to talk their voices growing in anger as their shock wore off i panted my bruised paw held up off the ground while i waited feeling the seconds slip away a shudder rippled over me making my fur rise something was happening the street were tucked the red tuft behind his jacket as if hed made a decision the oldest stories say the statue belonged to a red were before it was lost he said and his wife joined him morgan held her ground when your alpha ran he said gesturing she won give sparagmos to her love will loosen that thief s memory when pain and humiliation wont i dont care who holds the statue as long as i can have a part of it you gave your allegiance to me walter exclaimed i said id follow you when you said you had it the young were said his hands making fists and his jewelry chiming his wife was a head taller than he was but it didnt make him look any less threatening you dont sparagmos does and shes claimed him dissolve my blood oath ill follow a red wolf as soon as a white one either way im not following you you lowlife cur walter snarled redfaced his white hair standing out starkly i have sparagmos and ill have the statue and ill have your head as an ashtray the crowd was splitting i could see it i could smell it old patterns were emerging both comfortable and familiar the hair on the back of my neck pricked and with a small effort i pulled my second sight into focus my heart quickened a pearly white now rimmed the street weres and an earthy red covered the ones in suits it had broken that fast the entire clearing had shifted the street weres were dropping back into the woods i could smell the whiff of brimstone if they went wolf nothing would contain them sir a griefstricken were in fatigues interrupted and i turned to the six men carrying pam their slow steps saying it was too late pam walter exclaimed grief raw in his voice the weres set her gently down and the man fell to kneel beside her savagely driving them away before his hands dove into her fur pulling her up into him no he said in disbelief his wifes body close to him arethas pack had torn open pams throat and her blood clotted her black fur and stained his chest his head going back and forth the powerful man struggled to find the pieces of his world scattered like the dead leaves shifting between us no walter shouted his head coming up and his eyes finding me i will not accept this that witch wolf is not my alpha and i will not give sparagmos to her kill her gun safeties clicked off holy shit panicking i leapt for the slice of parking lot i could see an instant and i was through a screamed curse spurred me on nails digging i reached the woods my feet slipped on leaves and weakstemmed plants and i almost went down struggling for balance i kept driving forward i listened for the sound of shots but i was awayfor the time being they had hummers and cell phones against that i had a sixfoot pixy and a threeminute head start tops pam was dead this wasnt my fault behind me came the distinctive calls of a mob organizing they were all people right now but that was going to change i had known the peace wouldnt last weres were weres they never bonded together they couldnt it went against everything they were made of thank god for that i thought as i tracked the scent of snapped twigs following jenks the pixy could find nick by smell if nothing else we could still get off this damned island maybe the breakup of the round would buy us a few minutes more nick i thought my heart racing from more than my escape so it wasnt the way we planned it so sue me fifteen my pace wasnt smooth in any sense of the word loping through the warming forest stumbling every time my front foot came down too hard there were booms in the distance that my wolf hearing couldnt identify but nothing close my back hurt in time with my steps and my front paw was throbbing the wind cut a sharp pain across my ear where it was laid open i went as fast as i could my nose a good four inches above the ground as i tracked the saplingsnapped scent of jenks i was on borrowed time the island was big but not that big and grief would likely make their feet faster not slower eventually someone would catch up to me if nothing else jenks would run into resistance when he found nick they had radios faster i thought promptly tripping pain iced through me and i lunged to catch myself before my face plowed into the ground my bruised foot gave way and cursing myself i held my head high and took the fall biting my tongue as i came to a sliding halt in the dirt i was tired of being a wolf nothing looked right and if i couldnt run there was little joy but i couldnt say my trigger word and switch back until i reached the mainland and tapped a line besides i thought getting up and shaking myself id be naked i sneezed the dirt and leaf mold out of my nose whining when my entire body spasmed in pain the sharp crack of clean wood on metal rang out my head came up and my breath heaved a man shouted just shoot him and there were three pops in quick succession jenks forgetting my hurts i jerked into a run the light brightened around me as the forest thinned shockingly fast i came out into what looked like an old state park with logs bolted into the ground to show parking spots a jeep was parked in the shade of a cementblock building painted brown and near the entrance i saw jenks attacking two men with a length of wood still sporting leaves i bolted forward like a dancer jenks swung the stick in a wide arc the wood hitting one man on the ear not watching him fall away in pain jenks spun jamming the splintered butt into the solar plexus of the second man with a silent ferocity he spun to the first bringing the stick down with both hands against the back of his neck the man fell without protest jenks shouted an exuberant cry of success as he spun the stick above his head in a wild spiral slamming it first against the back of a knee then the skull of the second man i came to a fourposted halt shocked he had downed both of them in six seconds rache he cried cheerfully tossing his blond curls out of his eyes to show his heman bandage his cheeks were red and his eyes were glinting i take it were going to plan b hes inside i can smell crap for brains from here heart pounding i vaulted over the downed were in fatigues blocking the door my nose taking in the stale coffee in the tiny kitchen the fortyyearold mold in the bathroom and the pine air freshener fighting the stale musk in the tiny living room festooned with weapons and a twoway radio frantically demanding that someone pick up my muscles tensed at the scent of blood under the masking odor of chlorine nails clacking on white tile i padded through the narrow hallway searching there was a closed door at the end of a dark hallway and i waited impatiently for jenks he reached over me pushing it open with a squeak it was dark the dim light coming from a dustcaked high window of wireembedded glass the air stank of urine there was a rickety table cluttered with metal and pans of liquid nick was gone and my hope crashed to nothing oh my god jenks breathed his breath catching i followed his eyes to a dark corner nick i whispered it came out in a whine he had moved at the sound of jenkss voice his head lolling up his eyes open but unseeing from under his long bangs they had tied him against the wall in a crucifix position in a cruel mockery of suffering and grace his clothes had burned patches singed hair and red skin showing past them black crusts of blood marked him his cracked and bleeding lips moved but nothing came out i will not he whispered you canti willkeep it jenks pushed past me cautiously touching a knife to judge the silver content before picking it up i was stuck in the threshold not believing it they had tortured him they had hurt him for that damned statue what in hell was it why didnt he just give it to them it couldnt be money nick was a thief but he loved life more i think you cant do anything here rache jenks said his voice catching as he started to saw at nicks bonds go keep an eye on the front ill get him down i jerked when nick began shouting clearly thinking they were at him again calling my name over and over knock it off crap for brains jenks yelled im trying to help you my fault nick moaned collapsing to lean forward against his bonds he took her he should have taken me i killed her rayray im sorry im sorry shaken i backed out of the room they hadnt told him i was alive sickened i turned tail and bolted nails sliding on the tile i tripped on the man at the door rolling into the yard the sun struck me jolting my horror into the beginnings of anger nothing was worth this the blue jays were screaming in the distance and the sound of an engine grew closer jenks i yipped i hear them he shouted back at me pulse racing i looked at the men sprawled in the packed dirt grabbing the shoulder of the nearest i dragged him into the building not caring if i broke the skin or not he might have been dead for all i cared i jerked him halfway down the hallway in short splurges of motion left him and went back for the second jenks was coming out the door as i got him past the sill and inside i dropped him my back hurting and my jaws aching good idea jenks said nicks arm draped over his neck and shoulder nick hung against jenks clearly unable to support his own weight his head was down and his feet moved sluggishly his breath came in pained gasps there were red pressure marks about his wrists and it didnt look like he could move his legs yet when he brought his head up his eyes were cloudy with a smear of gel arm moving slowly he tried to wipe them blinking profusely a dry cough shook him clenching his arm about his lower chest he held his breath to try to stop go jenks prompted and i tore my eyes from nick i felt sick again and as my paws hit the dirt outside i wondered just where jenks expected us to go there was only one road out of there and someone was coming up it and stumbling about with a sick man in the woods was a sure way to be caught justgo behind the building jenks said and i trotted an uneasy path beside him feeling small nick tried to help as his muscles started to regain their movement jenks eased him to the ground propping him up against the painted brick it was chill back there out of the sun and he held his legs and groaned i thought of marshals warmth amulets we had only one leftif they hadnt found our gear maybe nick and jenks could share it somehow my fur could keep me warm could i swim that far as a wolf stay here jenks said to me standing to look tall his brow was furrowed keep him quiet i can take care of them and then well drive out of here i put a foot on his shoe for his attention looking up at him pleadingly i hadnt liked running apart i didnt want to do it again we did better together than alone ill be careful jenks said turning toward the sound of an approaching vehicle if therere too many ill hoot like an owl i raised my doggie eyebrows and he chuckled ill just shout for you at my head bob he crept away silent in his black tights and running shoes i looked at nick he didnt have any shoes and his pale feet looked ugly nick i thought nudging him he stirred wiping the goo from his eyes and squinting youre too small for a were i thought you were a were good dog good dog he murmured sinking his fingers into my wavy red fur he didnt know who i was i didnt think he recognized even jenks good dog he said whats your name sweetheart how did you get on this hellhole of an island i took a heaving breath hating this he looked awful in the brighter light nick had never been a heavy man but in the week jaxs said he had been on the island he had gone from trim to emaciated his long hands were thin and his face was sallow a beard hid his cheekbones making him appear like a homeless man he stank of sweat filth and a deepseated infection looking at him one would never have guessed at his wickedly quick mind or know how easily he could make me laugh or the love i felt for his complete acceptance of who i was without any need to apologize a man whose danger was in calling demons and his willingness to risk everything to be smarter than everyone else until i had accidentally made him my familiar and he seized when i pulled a line of everafter through him my eyes closed in a long blink as i recalled the three months of heartache when he avoided me not wanting to admit that every time i pulled on a line he relived the entire terrifying moment in his mind until he couldnt even be in the same city im sorry nick i thought putting my muzzle on his shoulder and wishing i could give him a hug the familiar bond was broken now maybe we could return to the way we were but a wiser voice in me asked do you want to my head came up and my ears pricked at the sound of someone downshifting i padded to the edge of the building peeking around to see an open jeep rocking to a stop nick moved to follow and i growled at him good girl he said thinking i was growling at them stay my lip curled and i felt my annoyance rise good girl stay two of the four men with weapons got out calling out for nicks captors my pulse quickened as they entered the building jenks and i were running without even a sketch of a plan except for stay here ill take care of them what lameass kind of a plan was that shifting my front feet i was debating whether i should do something when jenks fell out of the tree and into the jeep two savagely powerful blows with his stick and the men in the vehicle silently slumped jenks jerked the cap off the last ones head even as he collapsed wedging it onto his head he grinned and gestured for us to stay a shout came from inside the building and nick and i shrank back heart pounding i watched jenks yank one of the men up there were three quick pops from the building as the two men came out and blood leaked out of the were in front of jenks shot jenks dropped the were and jumped into the tree like a monkey branches shook and leaves drifted down the two weres with guns shouted at each other stupidly running over and aiming into the canopy and i say stupid because they completely forgot there might be someone else here sweetheart nick shouted as i bolted out to help jenks thanks a hell of a lot nick i thought as both weres turned i barreled into the first my only goal being to knock him down the mans eyes were wide snarling i barked and yapped trying to stay on top of him in the hopes that his buddy wouldnt shoot me lest he hit him instead there was the pop of a gun and the crack of wood in my instant of distraction the were shoved me off crazy wolf he shouted turning the barrel of his weapon at me behind him jenks stood frozen in panic the first man was slumped at his feet but jenks was too far away to help me a boom of thunder echoed and the man pointing his weapon at me jumped my heart pounded and i frantically waited for the pain but the were spun leaving me to stare in surprise at the hole in his back my attention flicked behind him to nick propped up against the building with a shotgun nick no i barked but he took aim again and with his face white and his hands shaking he shot him a second time the weres gun went off as the slug hit him but it was a death pull nicks second shot had gone straight into his neck i sprang away and the were fell choking as his lungs filled drowning him in his own blood he clawed at his throat gasping god help me nick had killed him you sons of bitches nick cried from the dirt having fallen from the recoil this time ill kill you all you fucking dogface bastards ill kill you he took a shuddering breath ill kill you all he sobbed crying now frightened i looked at jenks the pixy stood under the tree whitefaced and scared ill kill you nick said hunched on all fours i slowly skulked over to him i was a wolf not a were he wouldnt shoot me right good girl he said when i nudged him he wiped his face and patted my head a broken man he even let me pull the shotgun from him and my tongue worked at the bitter taste of gunpowder good girl he murmured standing up and wobbling forward though clearly not wanting to touch him jenks helped him into the back of the jeep where nick collapsed jenks unceremoniously dumped the unconscious men in the front out of the vehicle and i scrambled into the passenger side trying to ignore that the man nick shot had finally stopped making noises jenks started the jeep and after a few jerks while he learned the practical aspect of how to drive a stick we started down the road i touched the radio with my nose and he turned it up so we could hear jenks looked at me the wind brushing his bangs back he cant swim he whispered and we only have one warmth amulet i can swim nick had his head in his hands his elbows on his knees against the jostling of the rough road they must have a dock somewhere jenks continued not paying him any mind but for a nervous glance they probably already have people waiting for us though ill kill myself before i let them take me back there nick said thinking jenks was talking to him thank you thank you for getting me out of that hell jenkss lips pressed together and his grip clenched the wheel as he shifted to a lower gear and took a tight turn i can smell an oil and gas mix to the south almost exactly where we came in its probably the marina nick pulled his head up the wind shifting his lank hair from his eyes youre talking to the dog sparing him a glance from under his new cap jenks turned away shes a wolf get it right crap for brains tinks knickers you have got to be the stupidest lunker ive ever lit on nicks eyes went wide and he clutched the side of the jeep jenks he stammered going whiter what happened to you jenkss jaw clenched but he stayed silent nick looked at me youre a person he said looking gaunt jenks who is she i trembled unable to say a thing jenks gripped the wheel tighter and the engine nearly stalled when he slowed to go around a turn and didnt downshift no one cares little green turds about you he said who do you think she is nick took a gasping breath leaning forward to slip to the floor of the jeep rachel he said and i watched his pupils dilate just before he passed out and his head hit the seat jenks took a quick look over his shoulder great just freaking great now im going to have to carry him sixteen i had scrambled back to sit with nick worried at the stink of infection and that he hadnt regained consciousness yet the wind from our passage as jenks jostled us down the road to the supposed marina lifted the hair about my ears giving me a fuzzy view of the sounds around me but an expanded picture of the smells the chatter from the radio was loud and heavy bringing jenks up to speed on pams death and the breakup of the round that we might have stolen a jeep and were listening apparently hadnt crossed anyones mind the survivalists had divided their forces to maintain dominance of the island as well as search for us it could only help jenks adjusted his new were cap slowing when bretts twang filtered out i swiveled my ears forward glad for the easier pace all teams keep a threetoone ratio of fur to feet the man was saying the cell is empty theyre armed two dead so watch your tail no sign of their boat so theyre probably headed for the dock i want a fivetooneratio there jenks slowed to pull off into the short grass eking out a living by the packed dirt i lifted my head in question meeting his worried eyes with mine why was he stopping they know were coming he said awkwardly twisting to make a threepoint turn and head back the way wed come i cant fight that many weres were going to have to swim my heart pounded and a whine slipped from me angular face tight jenks accelerated i wont let you drown he said or maybe we can find somewhere to hide until things settle he added knowing as well as i that the longer we remained the more likely it was that wed be caught but nick was unconscious and the idea of me dogpaddling all the way was daunting even if i would have a break traversing round island in between i couldnt swim it as a person what would being a wolf do for me the entire situation was crap but we had to get off the island shut up everyone shut up came a frantic voice through the radio and i leaned over nick my ears swiveling this is the lighthouse we have a problem unknown incoming force six boats from the mackinac ferry dock mixed weres the highpitched young voice said uniformed they know shes in trouble and theyre coming for her really somehow i didnt think it was an unexpected rescue but a second were faction taking advantage of the chaos damn it that would make mackinac island tricky bretts voice crackled out chilling me radio silence search leaders check in by cell phone the rest of you find them fire on them if you have to but they cant have sparagmos the radio turned to a grating hiss jenks pulled the jeep to the side of the road wake him up he said tightly undoing his belt and getting out this is where we came in my nose wrinkled when i scented the faint taste of decay on the breeze as the heat of the sun hit that deer carcass muscles tense i hesitated then licked the side of nicks nose not knowing what else to do hell it worked in the movies feet spread wide jenks looked up and down the road squinting from under his borrowed cap my tongue had made a long wet mark on nick but otherwise there was no change leaning into the jeep jenks jerked nicks head up by the hair and slapped him nick exploded into motion screaming obscenities he lashed out arms flung blindly frightened i jumped from the jeep my nails dug into the dirt and i stared at him wildeyed nick took a shuddering breath upon realizing where he was his haunted look turned into a glare and he stared at jenks standing belligerently with his hands on his hips and that pack hat on his head the jays yelled back at him and i wished they would shut up we walk from here crap for brains jenks said darkly lets go ever scuba dive nick eased himself out of the jeep stumbling when his bare feet hit the hardpacked road once or twice he rasped hunched into himself and holding his ribs my ears pricked and i wondered if he was serious if i wasnt so worried about nick i might be able to concentrate on keeping my own head above water jenks too seemed surprised saying nothing more as he led the way into the scrub one foot raised i hesitated jenks was going the wrong way toward the interior not the beach a questioning whine brought him around and he gestured for me to join him kneeling just inside the scrub off the road nick wobbled into the brush and i trotted to jenks worried the pixy peered into my eyes and i was thankful he didnt try to pet me nick stinks he said and nick cleared his throat in protest theyve got my scent and yours he added but they arent as obvious as nicks if you still had your scent amulets we might be able to slip their lines but not the way we are im betting both the island weres and the ones coming from mackinac will start their search from the beaches and move in so they catch us inland instead of on the beach i thought but jenks shifted his weight regaining my attention i want you to take crap for brains to that carcass and sit tight hide yourself in its stink ill drive the jeep down the road to confuse the trail then come back he wanted to separate again my black paws fidgeted and jenks smiled itll be okay rache he said ill go tree to tree like a squirrel they wont trail me to you once they pass us well slip out clear and easy it wasnt him leading them back to us i was worried about and i whined you can do this he said softly i know it goes against your nature to sit and hide and if it was just us id say charge ahead and kick anyones ass between us and the water i made a doggie huff nick couldnt do it we had to adapt to his condition agreeing i sent my tail thumping yeah it was degrading but everyone knew dogspeak and no one knew rachelwolfspeak but me jenks smiled standing to look tall above me his pleased expression shifted to one of annoyance and he looked at nick got all that he asked and nick nodded not looking up theres a deer carcass thirty feet from here go make nice with it with a numb weariness nick picked his way there old leaves crunching under his bare feet stay down until i get back jenks said carefully manipulating the keys so they wouldnt jingle i watched him retrace his steps glancing both ways before breaking the camouflage of the surrounding brush and vaulting into the jeep almost stalling it he eased onto the road and drove away with the enthusiasm of an eighteenyearold playing cops and robbers not liking this at all i turned and followed nick a dead deer he said squinting down at me as he lurched forward is that what i smell what could i say silent i nudged my shoulder into him to force him to the right trying to smell if aretha was nearby i didnt think so it had gotten noisy and though she wasnt afraid of weres it was likely shed taken her pack to the thicker parts of the island nick grimaced when we found the deer i sat wondering how we could make this work better the clearing was covered with evidence of our earlier tussle the smell of wolves jenks me and weres were faint under the stench of decaying tissue and saltwater but we couldnt just sit next to it and hope everyone avoided it because it stank blue eyes pinched nick looked over the situation there he said his swollen hand shaking as he pointed to a deadfall where a downed tree had left a hole where its roots had been if i can get the deer over there i watched him shake his sleeve down to use as insulation and grab the carcass by a hoof struggling he started dragging it the necessary twenty feet nick went ashen when he unearthed a maggot farm under it and gagging i kicked leaves to cover them nick though had a belly full of fear which was apparently stronger than revulsion jenks was gone and with that i could almost see him starting to think again with renewed strength he dragged the deer to the tree its roots in the air getting the carcass before the hollow under the roots he let the legs drop he looked at me and i bobbed my head though gross if he wedged himself between the deer and the fallen snag and maybe covered himself with leaves he would be hidden from sight and smell face twisted in disgust nick slowly found the ground between the deer and the exposed roots of the toppled tree jerking when sticks hit his bare skin past the burn holes carefully raking the debris collected in the lee of the hollow he covered himself meticulously placing the dry leaves on top as he worked from his feet upward good he asked when he finished his head lightly covered i nodded and he closed his eyes exhausted his filth melted into the surrounding forest like camouflage the scent of infection was hidden by the reek of decay nervous i eased closer trying not to breathe as i crawled into the space behind him settling myself so my head was on his shoulder my ears brushing the top of the miniature cavelike shelter it was a stretch but i curled my tail over my nose as a filter all that was left was waiting for jenks the sheltering roots made a roof against the open sky and the scent of dirt was a pleasant alternative it was all i could do to not jam my nose into it a blueeyed fly crawled over the deer laying eggs i couldnt see if it landed on me i was outta there while the jays called and the wind brushed the treetops i studied nicks haggard face so close beside mine the warmth of our bodies touching was guiltily pleasant his breathing was slow and i realized he was asleep when his eyes jerked in rem sleep i had no idea what he had endured but i couldnt imagine whatever they wanted could be worth it the screaming of the jays grew closer and with a wash of fear i realized their calls had meaning something small raced through the underbrush and was gone fleeing my ears pricked and i scanned what i could of the disturbed clearing softer then growing louder i heard a whisper of wind i could hear leaves moving then nothing the scent of oil gas and nylon touched my nose and a surge of adrenaline made me cold they were around us god save us we had gone to ground none too soon heart pounding i looked into the silent green afraid to shift my head a leaf fluttered down and i prayed nick didnt wake i couldnt see anyone but i could hear them it was as if ghosts were passing before me silent and invisible but for their scent my eyes flicked to where the sun glinted on smooth skin a trembling took my feet and i forced myself to not move there were two of them one on two feet one on four i didnt think they were the island weres but rather off the boats from mackinac islandtheir uniforms looked like government issue and their gear was more aggressive the taller were grimaced at the stink and i slitted my eyes to nothing when the one on four feet nudged his leg and silently pointed with his nose with a whisper the were checked in using the radio clipped to his lapel there was the pop of a channel opening thirty feet away and i saw a distant shadow of brown and green come to a halt waiting to see what they had found shit there was a line of them if we were found it wouldnt be two weres id be fighting but a platoon i caught the word jeep but there was no jubilation so i figured jenks was still at large only now did the two weres enter the clearing the one in fur finding the broken splat balls and the three damp spots where aretha and her pack had been doused with saltwater to break the sleepytime charm the other touched the ground where the deer had lain his head came up his eyes going right to the deer i panicked thinking he had seen us but with a click he got the attention of the were on four feet together they looked over the clearing where we had been attacked discussing with body signals what might have happened the deer they avoided the screaming jays grew closer calling from right overhead for an instant until they continued following the unseen line the were in fur snapped his teeth and the other rose taking a red flag from a pocket he jammed it into the ground marking the clearing silently they headed farther inland there was the soft scritch of cloth rubbing then nothing my blood pounded to lay there and wait for them to pass us had been one of the most frightening things id ever done the jays noise went soft and i exhaled started to pant waiting for jenks my thoughts returned to the soft sureness the invading weres had shown their sly hesitancy made the stark brutality of the three packs i had just escaped stand out all the more weres werent savagethey just werentand i felt a spike of worry remembering the ugly ferocity of them ringing me it had been more than them wanting to see a fight they had been like a different species younger and more dangerous lacking the control that the alphas gave them the trouble a cocky were pack in cincy could get into was enough to give me the shivers the only reason inderlanders and humans could coexist was because everyone knew their place in the social order i was so intent on my thoughts that i all but barked in surprise when jenks dropped out of the tree above me holy crap he whispered eyes dancing i was sure that one saw you damn that deer stinks worse than a fairys asswipe lets get out of here i couldnt agree more and leaving my disturbing thoughts about the strength weres found in packing up i crawled from my shelter leaping over nick in my haste his eyes flashed open and he came up on an elbow after seeing jenks leaves falling to hide the deers glassy eye i fell asleep he said sounding ashamed sorry were behind their line jenks didnt offer to help him stand and i waited while nick slowly gained his feet using the snag as support his hands were swollen and there was a soft sheen of moisture on some of the burns as they oozed bits of leaf chips stuck to them i whined at jenks to be nicer but he wouldnt look at me moving to play vanguard to the road i tried to find evidence of the invading weres passage as we went seeing nothing nick stumbled behind me stinking of dead deer and i tried to pick a way that would be easy for him his breathing grew labored as the forest thinned and we came out onto the road a quick dart across and the forest closed in again jenks was nearly silent to my wolf hearing and i was pretty quiet myself nick tried but every misplaced step brought a stumbling snapping of twigs and leaves being barefoot didnt help and i was wondering why we hadnt taken someones boots after a few moments i trotted to jenks giving the pixy a look i tried to make meaningful before i loped away to make sure no one was nearby sound didnt travel as well as one might think in the woods and as long as no one was close nick could make all the noise he wanted rache jenks hissed as i trotted off you playing scout he guessed and i bobbed my head in an unwolflike manner nick came even with him panting he leaned against a dead tree which promptly snapped with the sound of a gunshot while jenks cursed him in thinly veiled disgust i slunk through the brush starting a sweep to the left when i couldnt hear nick stumbling about anymore somewhere ahead of us was our scuba gear maybe we could hide out on round island unless by some miracle marshal was still there i prayed he wasnt not wanting to have to make that choice jenks and nicks forward progress was maybe a third of mine and it wasnt long before i had made a complete circuit and found nothing i started a backandforth pattern before them one ear on their progress one on the forest ahead sooner than expected the green light filtering through the leaves brightened and i heard the sound of what seemed surf but my heart almost stopped i realized that the hiss of what i had thought surf was radio static their radio silence is continued a voice said and i froze one paw lifted as i slowly crouched all of my muscles protesting in the background were sporadic thumps echoing against water i was sure this was where we came in and not the marina and brett had said they hadnt found our boat which meant they hadnt found the scuba gear either it must be the six boats we had heard about great just great out of the frying pan and into government control they havent regained him a higher masculine voice said through a radio the third air tank and gear says shes probably headed right for you move the boats behind the curve of the shore and keep watch with any luck theyll walk right in on you if you retrieve him dont wait move out and radio from the water aye sir the were said and the radio retreated to a hiss damn it i thought they had seen the tanks from the water and landed right where we had to leave they knew everything the island weres did having listened in to their efforts to regain us someone else wanted nick too just what the devil was this thing i tried not to pant my head weaving as i attempted to spot them i caught a glimpse of a green outback hat and a cleanshaven face the noise behind them became loud with decisions being made and i got scared slowly i backed away carefully putting my feet down until i couldnt hear voices anymore turning tail i made a beeline to jenks i found them together jenks looking marginally more accommodating as he held nicks elbow and helped him over downed sticks nick moved like an eightyyearold man head down and struggling for balance jenks heard me and brought them to a stop trouble he mouthed i nodded and nick groaned looking desperate behind his beard shut up jenks whispered and i shifted my sore front paw nervously show me jenks said and leaving nick to fend for himself i led him to my spot jenkss motions grew slower almost seductive as the brush grew thicker at the edge of the island until he eased into a crouch beside a tree at the edge of the brush i settled in beside the large pixy panting as i relished the cooler air coming off the water marshal is gone jenks said his viewpoint higher than mine good man therere four weres with semiautomatics that might be a were in fur in the shadow of that tree in any case our gear is gone probably on one of the boats his eyes squinted tinks panties if i was myself i could just flit over and see or get them to shoot themselves or stab them in the eye with a thorn how do you do this rache being the same size as everyone my teeth parted and i gave him a canine grin jenks adjusted his weight eyes fixed on the peaceful beach littered with boats drawn up onto the rocky shore two men were standing guard while two more prepared to move the first boat out i have an idea he whispered you go over to that pile of breakwall rock and when theyre looking at you ill circle to come up behind them and whack them a good one his eyes were glinting and while i wasnt keen on the looseness of the plan i did like his confidence in it and since we didnt have much of a choice i flicked my ears good jenks whispered get wet before they see you so you look black not red giving me a smile that made him look like he was plotting to steal the teachers apple not a boat from four weres with semiautomatics jenks dropped back to tell nick the plan i headed out skirting the brush line my pulse quickened i didnt like being a decoy but since i could probably cross the beach in four seconds coming to jenkss aid wouldnt be hard my knees went wobbly at the expanse of stony beach between me and the surf line the sun was sparkling on the water and the waves looked formidable past the slight protection of the inlet two weres with weapons were facing the forest while two more readied to move the first boat confident they would hear anyone coming from the water long before they were close enough to be a threat they were right a last slow breath and i trotted out walking right into the cold water and rolling immediately i lost my need to pant the water freezing without marshals amulet my first feeling that having this second faction of weres seeing our gear was bad luck shifted to possibly good luck nick couldnt survive water this cold and now jenks and i would only have to take out five people not whatever they had at the marina waiting for us there was an attentiongetting yap and i swung my head up going still as a startled wolf might but i would have frozen anyway five people were watching me four with weapons and one with teeth i think it was this last one that scared me the most damn he was big my pulse jackhammered i had nowhere to go but the woods and if i was recognized as being more than a wolf they would be on me in seconds fortunately their expressions were curious not suspicious a small movement behind them evolved into jenks and i fought with my instincts to watch him instead pricking my ears and staring at them as if wondering if they were going to throw me the meat from their picnic lunch the men were talking softly their hands loose on their weapons two wanted to lure me closer with food and they told the one in fur to back off before he scared me idiots i thought sparing them no pity when jenks fell on them from behind screaming wildly he swung his leafborn stick and bludgeoned the first into unconsciousness before the rest even knew they were under attack i sprang into movement feeling like i was in molasses until i was free of the water jenks was a blur as he fought but it was the were in fur that i was worried about and i ran across the rocky beach flinging myself at his hindquarters even now they didnt get it and he turned with a yelp surprised to find me on him snarling i fell away hackles raised giving a short bark of realization he sprang forward ears back holy shit he was huge almost four times my current weight spine protesting i skittered back my only goal to remain out from between his teeth immediately i knew i was in trouble i couldnt put any distance between us pam had fought like a choreographed dancer this guy was military and i was way outclassed fear slipped into me and i shifted directions erratically zigzagging across the rocky beach my bruised foot slipping on the smooth stones a great paw hit me and i went sprawling adrenaline pulsed and i yipped as he fell on me on my back i clawed at his face struggling to wiggle out his breath was hot and his tongue was tattooed with a clover enough jenks shouted but neither of us paid any attention until a short burst of gunfire sent him jerking off me panting i flipped to my feet three men were unconscious bleeding about their heads a fourth looked sullen but beaten soundly jenks stood alone the sun shone on his black tights and blond curls and the semiautomatic in his hands gave his peter pan pose some threat nick he yelled hefting the weapon get out here i need you to watch them for a sec think you can do that crap for brains the two weres tensed when nick wobbled out but at jenkss threat they remained still they shifted again when jenks handed nick his weapon glancing among themselves as nick held it with markedly less proficiency faces ugly they settled back clearly waiting with that gunfire we had only minutes until all hell broke loose and while nick held them at a musclefatigued shaking standstill jenks took the spark plugs from all but one boat throwing them into the water with all the weapons he could find rache he said gesturing from the boat he had chosen and i willingly jumped onto it nails skittering on the fiberglass deck slipping i fell into the cockpit and the fake grass carpet our gear and wet suits were a pleasant surprise i hadnt been looking forward to finding out what their loss would have done to my credit card balance marshal would be pleased nick was next wading out to the side and handing jenks the weapon before lurching over the side cracked lip between his teeth he cranked the engine as the requests for information coming from the radio on the beach grew intense still in the water jenks pushed the boat out with one hand keeping the weapon trained on them with the other my mouth dropped when he flung himself up into a blackflip to land on the bow of the boat the semiautomatic never lost its aim the two weres blinked but didnt move what by cerberus are you one asked clearly shocked im jenks he called back clearly in an expansive mood catching his balance when nick revved the engine jenks turned the near fall into a graceful motion slipping into the cockpit to stand beside me weapon still pointed nick idled us around then jammed the lever full throttle staggering i caught my balance jenks doffed his hat to the watching weres and laughed throwing his weapon into our wake we sped away as the first of the returning weres came boiling out of the forest all snapping teeth and barking voices someone was already in the water looking for the spark plugs we had done itfor the moment all that was left was to make it across the straits without swamping ourselves in the heavy waves and get lost in the general populace then there was the matter of how to get nick safe and me seeing that my cover was blown and every were east of the mississippi knew i had nickwho knew where the statue was whatever the statue was i squinted into the wind my breath escaping in a doggy huff when i realized nicks rescue was only starting what could he have possibly stolen that was worth all this jenks reach across and tunked the gas lever to slow us down how did you know how to use that weapon nick asked him his voice rough and his hands shaking on the wheel he was squinting in the bright light as if he hadnt seen it for days he probably hadnt jenks grinned as we jostled over the waves hitting every one wrong his bandage was falling off but his mood was both exhilarated and triumphant ahnold he said hitting an austrian accent hard and i barked in laughter i watched the island retreat behind us relieved no one was followingyet it would only take minutes to lose ourselves in the light boat traffic maybe fifteen to reach the mainland we would ditch the boat keeping the gear to return to marshal when we could i didnt care if we had to take it to cincy with us he was going to get his stuff back jenks tunked the speed down some more and nick tunked it back up i couldnt blame him but the waves were bouncing us around like a piece of popcorn jenks handled the jostling better than me despite my four feet against his two and he started rummaging opening every panel and lifting every seat it was his pixy curiosity and feeling ill i wobbled to nick put my head into his lap and gave him the sadpuppydogeyes look hoping hed slow our pace burn my britches if it didnt work and smiling for the first time since id found him he dropped a thin hand to my head before he decreased the speed sorry rayray he murmured over the noise of the engine i canti cant go back he swallowed hard and his breath quickened but you did it thank you i owe you one i owe you my life hands trembling he met my eyes his grip on the plasticcoated wheel clenching and releasing i thought you were dead you have to believe me i did he wouldnt have left that rose in the jellyjar vase if he hadnt jenks made a call of discovery anyone hungry he shouted over the wind and engine i found their food stores nick jerked im starved he said all but panicked as he looked over his shoulder jenkss first ugly face emptied when he saw nicks eyes yeah he said softly gesturing for nick to move i guess you are you eat ill drive i jumped up onto the copilots chair to get out of the way and nick stood unsteadily gripping the boat and shaking with the thumping of the waves he wobbled to the back bench taking a moment to arrange the wool blanket jenks had found about his shoulders before settling himself and ripping open energy bars with his teeth since his nails were torn to the quick jenks took his place behind the wheel he turned the boat slightly to the bridge and the ride smoothed out i watched the play of emotions over his smooth face i knew he was as mad as a jilted troll at the altar that nick had led his son astray but seeing nick beaten abused and so weak he could hardly open that stupid wrapper it was hard not to feel sorry for him just wanting jenks to lighten up a little i put my head in his lap and peered up at him dont look at me like that rache jenks said his eyes scanning the approaching shoreline for the rundown marina we had planned out earlier as a possible landfall i saw you pull it on nick and it doesnt work on me i have fiftyfour kids and it wont work sighing heavily i arched my wolf eyebrows sure enough he glanced down tinks panties he muttered okay ill be nicer but as soon as hes better im going to punch him pleased i pulled my head up and gave him a lick on his cheek dont do that he muttered wiping the moisture away but his embarrassment was tinged with understanding id be content with that but before i could teeter back and see if nick would open one of those governmentissue energy bars for me jenks stood one hand on the wheel the other holding his cap to his head ah rache he said over the roar of the engine and the brush of wind your eyes might be better than mine is that ivy on the dock seventeen squinting into the wind i sat on the copilots chair watching the decadesold rusted gas pumps on the dock become clearer ivy was standing with the sun glinting on her short black hair leaning casually against a piling she was in jeans and a long sweater but with the boots and shades she managed to look svelte as well as ticked a frumpy older man was next to her and worry went through me at what had gone so wrong in cincinnati that she had to come and get me unless shes here because she thinks i cant handle this the man beside her looked both nervous and excited in his faded overalls holding himself a careful five feet away as the breeze shifted his plaid coat open to the wind they probably didnt get many living vamps up here and he was clearly more curious than wary jenks decreased our speed and i could hear the sounds from the shore my emotions were swinging from one extreme to the other if ivy had come because she didnt think i could do this i was going to be pissedeven if it wasnt going that well if she was up here because there was a problem back home i was going to be worried id thought she couldnt even leave cincinnati so whatever it was it must be bad my weight shifted as the boat slowed and i fidgeted with worry jenks cut the gas to idle and we drifted closer can we tie up here he shouted to the man who was probably manager of the marina you bet he called back voice high and excited take her right down to slip fiftythree your friend already paid for it he pointed where he wanted us to go looking flustered thats a big dog you got there we have a leash law this side of the straits i watched ivy for her reaction to seeing me as a wolf but her expression behind the sunglasses was amused as if it was all a big joke come on down when you get settled the man said hesitating when he saw nick hunched under his blanket i need to register you swell proof we were here ivy was already walking down the empty dock to the slip the man had indicated behind me nick shuffled around finding the docking ropes and flinging bumpers over the sides you ever dock a boat before he asked jenks no but im doing okay so far i stayed where i was while the two men figured it out easing our way into the slip in sudden bursts of engine and calls to go forward or reverse ivy stood on the dock and watched as did a few people readying their boats for the water nervous i slunk to the lowest part of the boat to hide the island weres and the weres we stole the boat from would track us down and a big red dog was memorable we had to start putting distance between us and our borrowed boat jenks cut the engine and levered himself out landing lightly on the wooden dock to tie off the back end ivy rose from her crouch where she had tied the bow what in tinks contractual hell are you doing here jenks said then glanced at the people nearby sanding the bottom of their boat didnt think we could handle it he added softer ivy frowned nice bandaid jenks she said sarcastically and he reached to touch it youre big enough to bite now mosquito so shut up youd have to catch me first he said flushing give us some credit it was only a snag and drag i would have told him to lighten up but my thoughts were spiraling around the same question clearly angry ivy nudged the rope over the edge so no one would trip on it hello nick she said running her gaze over his blanketdraped barefoot hunched form someone rocking your boat under her disapproving eye nick tried to pull to his full height cutting the motion short with a grunt he looked awful his beard was nasty his hair greasy and his smell was pungent now that the wind wasnt pulling it away hi ivy he rasped piscary send you out for some fudge stiffening she turned my pulse quickened at the reminder of the undead vamp she shouldnt have been here there was going to be a price to pay which made me think it had to be more than her checking on jenks and me she could have called if that was all it was i made a little woof to get jenkss attention but it was obvious by his sudden concern that hed come to the same conclusion hands on his hips he took a breath as if to ask glanced at nick then let it out hey uh ivy he said a whole lot nicer we need to get out of here ivy followed his gaze to the smear the island made on the horizon are you hot she asked and when he nodded she added then lets get him in the van finally we were moving you brought the van jenks hopped back into the boat the fiberglass under my feet barely trembling how did you know we were here i drove around until i found your motel she said eyes on me the towns not that big ive got kists corvette parked at the restaurant across the street from your room at least they were being nice to each other i wanted some clothes and a moment to change and if ivy brought the vanwhich wed packed in case we needed to bug out in a hurrythen all the better head weaving to gauge the distance i jumped to the dock my nails skittering there was an ooooh of appreciation from the people across the inlet sanding the bottom of their boat and i flicked my ears back and then forward ive got to go register jenks said as if proud of it then hesitated his earlier annoyance gone im glad youre here he said surprising me she cant drive anymore and im not getting in a car with crap for brains behind the wheel thats enough i snapped having it come out as aggressive barks the entire marina took notice drooping i sank to the damp planks like a good dog it was tuesday but being the last tuesday before memorial day there were a few retirees working on their boats jenks snickered with a jaunty step he headed to the birdspotted dockmasters office i still didnt know why ivy was there and probably wouldnt as long as nick was listening on the dock ivy dropped to one knee peering at my eyes to make me uncomfortable there was a new sparkle of gold in her earlobes when had she started wearing earrings are you okay she asked as if trying to see if it was really me i shifted to snap at her and she grabbed the ruff around my neck holding me youre wet she said the warmth of her fingers finding my damp skin under the fur that a mouthful of nasty teeth had just missed her arm seemed to have made no impression theres a blanket in the van you want to change flustered i pulled back gently and this time she let go i bobbed my head turning to look at nick seeing my attention on him he drew the blanket tighter to hide his burned clothing shivering i wanted to talk to ivy but i wasnt about to turn witch where everyone could see having the surrounding locals watch her talk to a big dog was bad enough lets get out of here she said standing up and stepping into the boat let me help you with yourscuba gear she finished after pulling off the tarp her eyes went to mine you can dive she asked and i shrugged in as much as a wolf could shrug with a rough motion ivy drew the cover back before the curious people still sanding that same threefoot section of boat could see she eyed me then the shack where jenks was wanting to talk to me alone hey nick she said a ribbon of threat in her voice its going to take some time to get this packed they have facilities for people who have their boats here you want to shower while we load the van nicks long face went longer as his lips parted why do you care if im comfortable true to form ivy sneered i dont you reek and i dont want you stinking up the van brow furrowed she looked to the shack on the dock hey old man she shouted her voice echoing on the flat water in the harbor and jenks poked his head out of the dock office buy him a shower will you weve got time we didnt but jenks nodded vanishing back inside my wolfen brow furrowed and nick didnt seem happy either probably guessing we were getting rid of him for a moment lifting a cushion he brought out a pair of gray flannel governmentlooking sweats and sizeeleven sneakers that had been tucked away for a returning were to slip into theyd likely be too small but it was better than what he was wearing hunched under his blanket he tottered to the edge of the boat halting before ivy since she was blocking his path youre one lucky bastard she said hand on a hip i would have let you rot hand clenching his blanket closed he edged past her ask me if i care ivy gathered herself to come back with a remark but then he reached for a piling to pull himself out and the blanket slipped to show the burn marks horrified she met my gaze unaware that she had seen nick clutched his things close and made his meticulous way to a nearby cinderblock building following the bluelettered sign that promised showers the dockmaster ambled out of his office plastic token in his hand while the man gave nick a bar of soap and a sympathetic touch on his shoulder jenks made his slow way to us nicks gaunt battered silhouette vanished around the corner bare feet popping against the cement turning i found ivy beside the captains chair my god what did they do to him she whispered like i could talk jenks came to an awkward scuffling halt on the dock above us squinting as he looked at the island we dont have time for him to shower he said adjusting his clan cap his bandaid gone he had turned the cap inside out so the emblem was hidden and it looked good on him probably start a new trend he is not getting into kistens van smelling like that ivys gaze went to the tarp hiding the gear what do you want to do with these jenks looked at me for direction and i huffed bring em he said marshal will want them back though i suggest we keep them until were clear marshal ivy questioned grinning jenks resettled the tarp in the limited floor space and started moving the equipment onto it a local witch rachel sweettalked into letting us rent his equipment nice guy he and rachel have a date when this is over i whined and jenks laughed ivy wasnt amused and she pushed off from the captains chair saying nothing and avoiding my gaze as she helped stack the gear into the sling of the tarp between her vampire strength and jenkss pixy stamina they lifted the tarp with all the equipment onto the dock the watching people none the wiser for what was in it while i sat on the dock and watched jenks and ivy wiped the boat free of fingerprints under the pretense of cleaning it snapping the weather tarps into place as they went they worked their way from the bow to the stern eliminating every shred of easily traced evidence that we had been in it jenks was the last to leave vaulting to the dock to land beside me in a show of athletic grace that made ivys eyes widen in appreciation got your people legs i see she murmured then grabbed one end of the tarp jenks grinned and looking as if the rolled up tarp weighed no more than a cooler the two of them headed for the van i trailed behind sullen and bad tempered i had been up nearly twentyfour hours and i was tired and hungry if one of them tried to put a leash on me i was going to take that someone down jenks quickened his pace after they reached the gravel parking lot in a good mood despite having missed his afternoon nap how did you know we might show up here he said as he dropped his end of the bundle and slid the side door to the van open with a harsh scraping sound dad jax shrilled exploding out to make circles about us how did it go wheres nick did you see him is he dead oh wow ms morgan is a wolf ah jenks said we got him hes in the shower he stinks i went to jump into the van stopping when rex took one look at me swelled into an orange puffball and vanished in a streak of common sense under the front seat poor kitty thinks im going to eat her hey ms morgan the little pixy said landing on my head until i flicked my ears at him nick is going to be mad wait until you see what ivy brought jenks frowned thats ms tamwood son he said unloading the tarp into the van jax flitted into the van darting among the belongings wed shoved in pellmell earlier the small pixy flitted to the floor and in a high voice tried to coax rex out using himself as bait i sat in the sun and watched mildly concerned that no one was stopping him i wanted a pair of shorts and a shirt so i could change too but i was in a hurry and figured i could change in the van behind the curtain jax had turned his efforts to get rex out to obnoxious clicks and whistles and it hurt my head ivy yanked open the drivers side door and got in leaving it ajar to let the cool afternoon breeze shift the tips of her hair you want to take nick to canada before you head home or are you going to just cut him loose i made a sick face but seeing as i was a wolf it probably looked like i was going to hawk up a bird it wasnt that simple anymore but i had to change before i could explain the van smelled like witch pixy and ivy and i didnt want to get in until i had to i could see my suitcase but opening it was a different matter jenks stepped into the van lurching for jax and missing mumbling almost aloud he began arranging things so wed all fit all the while keeping a tight watch on his son what is it rachel ivy asked warily watching me through the rearview mirror you dont look happy for someone who just finished a run even if it was pro bono jenks dropped my suitcase onto a box and opened it up it went great he said his youthful face eager as he sifted through my things by the seat of our pants the way rache works best i hate it when you work like that ivy said but i felt better that jenks at least was thinking about me not having hands they caught us but rachel worked out a deal to fight their alpha for nick jenks held up a pair of my panties so everyone could see ive never seen a were go wolf that fast it was incredible ivy almost as fast as rachels magic i felt a spike of worry remembering their savagery when they were bound under a common cause and one were it still had me on edge ivy went still then turned in her seat to look at him my tail swished in an apology and a faint wrinkle showed in her brow deal jenks nodded hesitating between the longsleeve tshirt and the skimpier tank top if she pinned their alpha we got nick i didnt see it all cause i was looking for crap for brains but the sound of the fight brought in a real wolf pack the alpha rachel was fighting ran away i say that means rachel won i breathed easier when he put the tank top back wasnt her fault their alpha got chewed by real wolves ivy took a breath in thought holding it i met her eyes knowing she had figured out the real problem and i winced a quick shot of adrenaline shivered through me they know who you are ivy said her gaze following mine to the island behind us hearing the concern in her voice jenks straightened until his head brushed the ceiling aw hell he said we cant go home theyll follow us even if we dont have nick damn it all to disneyland wheres crap for brains jax what did you two steal anyway how are we going to convince four were packs that we dont have it or that nick told us where it is jax was gone id seen him zip out of the van three pixy heartbeats after his dad had started using disneys name in vain angry jenks jumped into the parking lot and headed for the showers arms moving and face red hey crap for brains he shouted i rose stretching before i loped after jenks he skidded to a halt when i stopped in front of him and leaned into his legs to try to tell him it was okay that wed find a way around this latest problem jenks peered down at me his shoulders stiff ill be nice he said his jaw tight but were leaving and were leaving now weve got to get under the leaves and hope spiders spin webs above us before they start looking i wasnt sure how spiders fitted into his equation but i padded back to the van while he pounded on the shower door ivy got the engine going and when i jumped into the front passenger seat she leaned over to crack the window for me the dusky scent of incense slipped over me familiar and rich with undertones only my subconscious had been aware of before comforting the thump of a metal door closing pulled my attention to the lot jenks slipped into the van clearly upset fifteen feet behind him i saw nick beard gone and hair dripping spotting his gray sweats he was moving better head up and looking around i had been right that the shoes were too small he was still barefoot the sneakers dangling from two fingers youre too good to him rachel ivy said softly you should be spitting mad and you arent hes a liar and a thief and he hurt you please she whispered think about what youre doing dont worry about it i thought enduring the indignity of thumping my tail in an effort to convey i wasnt going to let nick back into my life but when the memory of his battered body and his will to remain silent against drugs and pain returned to me i had a hard time staying angry with him eighteen good god i whispered sitting on the vans cot and looking at my legs horrified they were hairynot wolf hairy but an icouldntfindmyrazorthelastsixmonths hairy utterly grossed out i took a peek at my armpit jerking away oh thats justnasty you okay rachel came ivys voice from the front of the moving van and i snatched up my longsleeve black shirt and covered myself though a heavy curtain was between me and the rest of the world passing at an awkward startandstop thirtyfive miles an hour fine i said hurriedly slipping into it and wondering why my nails were the right length though theyd lost their polish my red frizz was longer though bumping about past my shoulders where it had been before al cut a chunk out of it last winter i had a feeling my extrahairy condition might be laid at the feet of ceri she had twisted the curse to switch me back and apparently they hadnt shaved in the dark ages i was thankful as all hell that jenks jax and rex were in kistens corvette behind us getting dressed in the back of a van was bad enough doing it with pixies watching would have been intolerable id done that before i didnt want to do it again shuddering at the long red hair on my legs i shook out a pair of socks wishing i had footies my face scrunched up as i put them on this was going to change as soon as i found ten minutes to myself in the bathroom with a bottle of nair why jenks had shown up smooth as a babys butt was beyond me maybe pixies didnt have hair except atop their heads i jerked my jeans on flustered when the distinctive sound of my zipper going up filled the silence grimacing i drew the curtain aside and fluffed my hair before me rose the bridge taking up much of the skyline the traffic was still stopandgo even more so now that it was down to one lane in either direction due to construction but nick had his truck across the straits in st ignace so thats where we were headed hi guys i said finding a place to kneel where i could see out the front im back ivy glanced at me through the rearview mirror her gaze lingering on my frizzing red curls nick looked up from rummaging in the console for change for the bridge toll smiling though a faint tremor showed in his pianistlong hands as he shuffled about finding the right amount he sat back and pushed his damp hair from his forehead the shower had done him good after a week of deprivation his narrow physique was positively gaunt making his cleanshaven cheeks hollow and his adams apple more prominent where his lean frame had made him look scholarly before it now only left him skinny the gray sweats hung loose on him and i wondered when his last hot meal had been his blue eyes though had regained the sheen of intelligence as the shower energy bars and distance all helped him deal with what hed endured he was safefor the moment my mind pinged back to him leaning against the brown cinderblock building a broken man weeping as he pulled the trigger on the shotgun ivy cleared her throat and i met her gaze through the oblong glass returning her accusing stare with a shrug she knew what i was thinking watch the car i exclaimed and she jerked her attention back to the road i was already reaching for a handhold when she hit the brakes narrowly missing the bumper of the toyota before us swinging forward from the momentum i glared at her nick had braced himself against the dash and though his look was full of disgust he said nothing ivy smiled at the irate driver we had almost hit showing her pointy canines so the guy would back off and be glad we werent stopping to make sure everyone was okay as we waited for the light i stretched for my bag and charms nick was hurting and there was no need for it yeah i was mad at him but him being in pain wouldnt help anyone the smoothness of two pain amulets filled my hand and i slowly dropped one i didnt hurt at all since turning back into a person my sore back and nipped hand completely pain free wondering i dug deeper for a finger stick the prick of the blade was easily dismissed and i massaged the three drops out the clean scent of redwood rose and the blood soaked in ah rachel ivy called intently and i stuck my finger in my mouth what there was a short silence then never mind she cracked the window and with the cool air off the water shifting my hair i decided to hang back here for a while getting her home asap was an excellent idea vamps were homebodieshighmaintenance partytillyoudie dontlookatmefunnyorillkillyou homebodies but homebodies nevertheless and for obvious reasons i still didnt know why she was here how she was going to handle her hunger without the net of people she had left in cincinnati worried me maybe itd be easier out of piscarys influence god i hoped so the van eased into motion and i rifled through my bag for a complexion charm it was too bumpy to put on makeup but i could at least look rested and relaxed and it would get rid of the bags under my eyes i thought morosely flipping open my little compact mirror squinting in the dim light i looked closer hey ivy i bolted forward hunched as i lurched up to the front are my freckles gone eyes wide i leaned out between ivy and nick tilting my head so they both could see ivy glanced from the road to me then back again a slow smile spread across her face telling me my answer before she said a word open your mouth she said bewildered i did and she looked making me nervous when she smoothly halted without watching the car that had stopped before us from my right came nicks soft are they gone and ivy nodded whats gone shoving the pain amulet at nick i opened my mouth and tried to see what they were looking at my fillings are gone i exclaimed shocked pulse hammering i looked at my wrist thats still there i said looking at als demon mark and wanting to check the underside of my foot for newts which i didnt because of all that hair i looked at my elbow instead but the scar from when i fell off my bike isnt i added twisting i tried to see the back of my shoulder where id cut myself falling into the lawn mower doing cartwheels ah i had been doing the cartwheels not the lawn mower your neck is unmarked ivy said softly and i froze meeting her eyes in the mirror there was the faintest swelling of black do you want me to see if its really gone she asked i leaned back suddenly aware of her nick cleared his throat in a subtle show against it which halted my first impulse to say no if it was gone it would be worth all the blackness i had put on my soul despite my better judgment i nodded ivy exhaled long and slow the sound setting my blood to thrum her eyes dilated to a full black and i stiffened fixed to them through the rearview mirror though her fingers were still on the wheel i felt as if she was touching my neck with a shocking intimacy pressing with a light but demanding insistence i inhaled and like a sudden flame from a match it sparked a tingling assault heat poured through me following the line from my neck to my chi a small sound escaped me and if id been able to think i would have been embarrassed ivy broke our eye contact through the mirror holding her breath as she struggled to pull her hunger back its still there she said her voice both rough and smooth wavering where i sat her eyes met mine and darted away sorry she added fingers clenching the wheel blood pounding i retreated to the cot to ask her to do that had been stupid slowly the tingling vanished my scar wasnt puckering my skin but obviously the vampire virus was still fixed there i was terribly glad i was a witch and couldnt be turned ever i had a feeling that was one of the reasons ivy put up with so much of my crap the van was uncomfortably silent windy now that ivy had rolled the window completely down it was cold but i wasnt going to say anything my perfume which blocked my scent from mixing with ivys was in here somewhere maybe i ought to find it the tension slowly eased as we moved to the bridge i looked at my hands in the dusk of the van seeing them smooth and perfect every flaw that marked my passage through time gone it seemed like the curse had reset everything no freckles no childhood scars no fillings panic slid through me frightened i lurched to the front kneeling between them nick i whispered what if i lost what trents dad nick smiled smelling like hotel soap as he took my hand youre fine rayray if the vamp virus is still fixed in your cells then whatever trents father changed will be there too i felt unreal as i pulled my hand from his are you sure your freckles are gone but you still have your sensitivity to vampires that would suggest the charm resets your form by your dna and if your dna was changed by a virus or his eyes flicked to ivy staring out the window her grip deceptively loose on the wheel something else the change is carried over smiling he leaned closer i froze then jerked back when i realized he was going to kiss me face emptying of emotion nick settled in his seat flushing i moved away i didnt want him to kiss me what in hell is wrong with him it wasnt a charm it was a demon curse ivy said darkly jerking the car into motion though the traffic was stopandgo the roughness had been on purpose she put a hell of a lot of black on her soul while saving your ass crap for brains nicks eyes widened and he turned in his seat his expression grew haunted a demon curse rayray please tell me you didnt buy a demon curse to help me im a white witch nick i said tartly my words harsher at the reminder of what id done to myself i didnt make a deal with anyone i twisted the curse myself well ceri twisted it actually but pointing that out didnt seem prudent but you cant he protested its demon magic ivy tunked the brakes and i caught my balance when the van stopped quick at a new yellow light behind us jenks blew the cars horn which ivy ignored are you calling her a liar she said turning in her seat to look at nick squarely his long face reddened his newly shaved cheeks a shade paler im not calling her anything but the only place you can get a working demon charm is from a demon ivy laughed it was ugly and i didnt like it you dont know shit nick stop it both of you i exclaimed god youre like two kids fighting over a frog angry i retreated to sit on the cot leaving two silent sullen people in the front the soft clinks of the toll money slipping through nicks fingers were loud as we crept forward in the slow line i forced myself to be calm most likely nick was right that i wouldnt suddenly find myself dying from a childhood disease again but it was still a worry look there he said suddenly his voice thick with warning rayray stay down immediately i crowded to the front to earn ivys huff of impatience before us spread the bridge its glory marred by construction crews we were nearly on it and the guy holding the slow sign was watching everyone far too intently i could tell from three cars away that he was a were a celtic knot tattoo encompassing his entire right shoulder damn it ivy muttered her jaw clenching i see him rachel hold on i braced myself when ivy flicked the turn signal and pulled a right to get out of the bridge traffic at the last moment peering out the dirty square of a window in the back i saw jenks following jax and rex were scampering about on the dash and i dont know how jenks managed to keep the car on the road the van rocked as it found its new momentum and i felt ill now what i said finding jenkss old flipflops and putting them on ivy sighed her grip on the wheel tightened and relaxed glancing into the rearview mirror her eyes met mine nicks truck would have to wait i listened to the traffic and nicks frightened breathing i could almost hear his heart see it pulse in his neck as he fought the fear of his entire week of torture im hungry ivy abruptly said anyone want a pizza nineteen eyes on the rearview mirror ivy eased the van to a halt in the restaurant lot in the shade between two semis the sound of traffic was loud through her window and i couldnt help but be impressed at being so well hidden this close to the main road shifting the gearshift into park she undid her seat belt and turned rachel theres a box under the floorboard will you get it for me sure while ivy got out i scuffed back the throw rug and pried up the metal plate to find instead of a spare tire a dusty cardboard box trying to keep it from touching me i set it on the drivers seat ivy looked out from between the two trucks when jenks parked across the lot she whistled and jax darted up before his dad could even get out of the car whats up ms tamwood the small pixy said stopping before her why did we stop are we in trouble do you need gas my dad has to pee can you wait for him i was pleased to see that jax was wearing a scrap of red tucked into his belt it was a symbol of good intentions and a quick departure should he stray into another pixys territory seeing him learning the ropes made me feel good even if the reason behind it was depressing the weres have the bridge ivy said gesturing for jenks to stay where he was beside kistens car he was fumbling with his insideout cap and with the jeans he now had on over his running tights and his aviator jacket he looked good tell your dad to get a table if it looks okay ivy added squinting from behind her sunglasses ill be there in a sec sure thing ms tamwood he was gone in a clattering of wings a light breeze shifted ivys hair and standing beside the open door she pried the dusty flaps up to pull out a roll of heavy ribbon a faint smile quirked the corner of her mouth and nick and i waited for an explanation i havent done this in years she said looking to the narrow slice of visible parking lot i dont think they saw us she said but by tonight they will have tracked you and jenks to your motel and that lady will tell them you were driving a white van if were going to be in town longer than that we need to change a few things i recognized the thick tape in her hands as magnetic striping and my eyebrows went up cool a vehicle disguise theres a license plate somewhere in there she said and i nodded going back for it and the screwdriver nick cleared his throat sounding impressed what is that magnetic pinstripe ivy didnt look at him kisten has black lightning and flaming crosses too she said and illegal flash paint i mentally added when she shook a can of specially designed spray paint she moved the box to the running board of the nearby semi the door thumped shut sealing nick and me inside by the time i get done with her she could win the goth division in a car show she said smirking i handed her the ohio plate and screwdriver through the window even the tags were up to date sit tight she said taking them nobody moves until i get jenkss take on the restaurant im sure its fine i said moving to the front seat im so hungry i could eat a seat cushion ivys brown eyes met mine from over her sunglasses and her motion of shaking the spray can slowed its not the food im worried about i want to be sure its mostly human her face went worried if there are any weres were leaving oh yeah worried i slumped behind the wheel but ivy looked unconcerned taking a rag from the box and starting to wipe the road dust off the van i was glad she was there sure i was a classically trained runner and while subterfuge was a part of that hiding from large numbers of people out to get you wasnt this stuff was what she had cut her teeth on i guessed nick undid his belt when ivy edged out of sight i could hear her work the sporadic hisses of paint followed by squeaks as she wiped down the bumpers before the illegal paint took the smell of fixative tickled my nose i glanced at nick and he opened his mouth hey a disguise sounds like a good idea i blurted twisting to reach my bag ive got a good half dozen in here theyre for smell not looks since weres track by smell and will find us that way long before they see us they took the ones i had on the island but i made extra i was babbling and nick knew it he puffed his breath out and settled back while i rummaged for them a disguise sounds good he said thanks no prob i answered bringing out a new finger stick along with a handful of amulets i broke the safety seal and arranged four amulets on my knees i didnt know how to treat nick anymore we had done well together until it fell apart but it had been a long lonely three months until he finally left i was mad at him but it was hard to stay that way i knew it was my need to help the downtrodden but there it was the silence was uncomfortable and i pricked my finger anew i invoked them all to make the scent of redwood blossom then handed him the first thank you he said as he took it lacing it over his head where it fell to clink against his pain amulet for everything rayray i really owe you what you didi can never repay you for that it was the first time wed been alone since pulling him out of that back room and i wasnt surprised at his words i flashed him a blank smile then looked away draping my amulet over my head and tucking it behind my shirt to touch my skin its okay i said not wanting to talk about it you saved my life i saved yours so were even huh he said lightly thats notwhat i meant i watched ivy spray an elaborate symbol on the hood her hidden artistic talents making something both beautiful and surprising as she blurred the gray paint into the white of the van to look very professional glancing at me in question she tossed the can to the box and went to the back to change the plate nick was silent then you can were now he asked stress wrinkles crinkling the corners of his eyes the blue of them seemed faded somehow you make a beautiful wolf thank you i couldnt leave it at that and i turned to see him miserable and alone damn it why did i always fall for the underdog it was a oneshot deal i have to twist a new curse if i want to do it again itsnot going to happen again i had so much black on my soul id never be rid of it i wanted to blame nick but i was the one who took the curse i could have submitted to the drugs and stuck it out until someone came to rescue my ass but noooo i took the easy way by using a demon curse and i was going to pay for it dearly his head went up and down not knowing my thoughts but clearly glad i was talking so it isnt like youre a were now in addition to being a witch i shook my head startled when my longer hair brushed my shoulders he knew the only way to become a were was to be born one he was trying to keep the conversation going ivy came to the door smelling of the fixative and wiping the gray from her fingers with a rag here she said handing the old plate through if you look in the console there should be an altered registration taped to the top can you switch them out you bet swell lets add falsifying legal documents to the list i thought but i took the kentucky plate and screwdriver giving her two amulets in their place these are for you and jenks make sure he puts it on i dont care what he says it makes him smell like ivys long fingers curved around them shifting so they dangled from the cord and wouldnt effect her scent disguise good thinkingfor you showing the faintest blush of nervousness she handed one of them back im not wearing one ivy i protested having no clue why shed never accept any of my spells or charms they dont know what i smell like and im not wearing it she said and i put up a hand in surrender immediately her brow smoothed and she dug in a pocket for the keys to the van handing them to me through the window ill be right back she said if im not out in four minutes go i took a breath to protest and she added i mean it come rescue me by all means but plan it out dont burst in with your hair flying and in flipflops a half smile came over me four minutes i said and she walked away i watched her in the side mirror her shoulders were hunched and her head was downand then she was gone ive got a bad feeling about this i said what nick said softly that shes walking into a trap i turned to him no that shes not going to leave until its over worry filled his eyes he was going to say something i didnt want to hear rachel by the turn im hungry i hope she hurries up i babbled rachel please just listen i closed the console and eased into the seat this conversation would happen whether i wanted it to or not breath slipping from me i looked at him to find his haggard face determined i didnt know you were alive he said panic in his eyes al said he had you he did and you never answered your phone i called god knows i did its at the bottom of the ohio river i said flatly thinking he was a wimp for not calling the church then i wondered if he had and ivy simply hung up on him the paper said you died in a boat explosion saving kalamacks life i almost did i said remembering waking up in trents limo having passed out after i pulled the mans freaking elfass out of the freezing water nick stretched a swollen hand across the consol between us and i jerked out of his reach making a frustrated sound he put an elbow on his closed window and looked at the nearby semi damn it rayray i thought you were dead i couldnt stay in cincinnati and now that i find youre alive you wont even let me touch you do you have any idea how i mourned i swallowed the memory of the budded red rose in the jelly jar vase with the pentagram of protection on it lifting through me my throat tightened why did it have to be so confusing i missed you he said brown eyes thick with pain this isnt what i had planned me neither i said miserable but you left me long before you left cincinnati it took me a long time to get over you lying to me about where you had been and im not going back to the way things were i dont care that it wasnt about another woman maybe that i could understand but it was money youre a thief and you let me believe you were something else nick slumped into a defeated stillness ive changed i didnt want to hear this they never changed they simply hid it better im seeing someone i said my voice low so it wouldnt shake hes there when i need him and im there for him he makes me feel good i dont want to return to how things were so dont ask me to you were gone and he i wiped a hand under my eye embarrassed that they were wet he was there i said he helped me forget you you bastard you love him whether i love him or not isnt relevant i said hands in my lap hes a vampire nick asked not moving one inch and i nodded you cant trust that he protested long hands gesturing weakly hes just trying to bind you to him you know that god you cant be that naive didnt you just see what happened with your scar with ivy i stared at him my feelings of betrayal rising anew both angry and frightened you told me once that if i wanted to be ivys scion that you would drive me back to the church and walk away that you loved me enough to leave if it meant i would be happy my heart was pounding and i forced my clenched hands apart well whats the difference nick he bowed his head when he looked up his face was tight with emotion i hadnt lost you then i didnt know what you meant to me i do now rayray please its not you making decisions anymore but vampire pheromones youve got to get out before you make a mistake you cant walk away from a movement in the mirror caught my eye ivy thank god i reached for the door handle dont talk to me about making mistakes i said grabbing my bag and getting out i slammed the door glad to see ivy for the distraction if nothing else the van was now gray at the bottom shading to white at the top and plastered with professionallooking decals the cloying scent of fixative was a fading hint ivy was watching the nearby road as she approached her subtle finger motions telling me to stay between the shelter of the dirty trucks rocking to a halt i crossed my arms and waited by the back bumper lips pressed while nick shut his door and shuffled forward all clear inside i said brightly when ivy joined us good im starved just a minute i want my stuff slipping past me she yanked the drivers side door open and retrieved a rolleddown paper bag from under the front seat she shut the door hard before pushing past nick and pulling me into her wake a pause at the head of the shelter the two semis made and we started for the restaurant my flipflops noisy next to her vampsoft steps behind us i could hear nick by all rights as the most vulnerable member of the group he should have been between us but i didnt feel like protecting him and the danger was minimal your hair is longer ivy said as we crossed the paved lot to the low woodslatted building snuggled in among the pines squirrels end howredneck you arent kidding i said wincing at the memory of my legs you didnt happen to bring a razor with you did you her eyes widened a razor never mind like i was going to tell her i looked like an orangutan are you okay she asked again her voice heavy with concern i didnt look at her i didnt need to she could read my emotions on the wind easier than i could read a billboard at sixty miles an hour yeah i said knowing she wasnt asking about the run but about nick what did he do she said her arms moving stiffly did he make a pass at you i glanced askance at her then back to the nearing door not yet she snorted sounding angry he will and then ill kill him annoyance sifted through me the jolts from my steps going all the way up my spine i can take care of myself i said not caring that nick was listening i can take care of myself too she said but if im making an ass out of myself id hope youd stop me i am handling this i said forcing my voice to be pleasant how about you i asked turning the tables i didnt think you could leave cincinnati her expression went guarded its only for a day piscary will get over it i was silent and she added what like the city will fall apart because im not there get real rachel my head nodded but i was still worried i needed her help planning how to get out of my latest fix but she could do it by email or phone if she had to we should be safe enough here for a while she said her eyes canvassing the building as we slowed at the door and nick came even with us its all humans good i replied faintly feeling out of place and vulnerable paper sack crinkling ivy opened the door for me with her free hand leaving nick to handle the swinging blurredglass door by himself i had shifted back to witch with absolutely nothing in my stomach at all and starved i breathed deeply of the smell of grilled meat it was nice in there not too bright not too dim no smoky smell to ruin it there were animal parts on the walls and few people seeing as it was tuesday afternoon maybe a tad too cold but not bad the menu was on the wall and it looked like basic bar food there were no windows but for the door and everyone seemed willing to mind their own business after their first long look the short bar had three fat men and one skinny one each sitting on green vinyl stools torn to show the white padding they were shoving food in their mouths as they watched a recap of last weeks game talking to a matronly woman with big hair behind the bar it was only three in the afternoonaccording to the clock above the dance floor whose hands were fishing poles and numbers were fly lures a dark jukebox filled a distant corner and a long light with colored glass hung over a redfelted pool table the bar had northern redneck all over it which made me all warm and fuzzy i didnt like being the only inderlanders in the place but it was unlikely anyone would turn ugly someone might get stupid after midnight with seven shots of jäger and a room of humans to back him but not at three in the afternoon and only five people in the place counting the cook jenks and jax were at a table in the rear a bank of empty booths between them and the wall the large pixy waved for us to join them and i felt a moment of worry that he had his shirt open to show his scent amulet i was guessing he was proud he was big enough to have one and wanted to show it off but i didnt like flaunting my inderland status they had an mpla mixed public licenseposted but it was obvious that this was a local human hangout im going to the restroom nick muttered he made a beeline for the archway beside the bar and i watched him the idea flitting through me that he might not come back i looked at jenks and after i nodded the big pixy sent jax to follow him yeah i was stupid when it came to matters of the heart but i wasnt stupid ivys presence hung a shade too close for comfort as we wove through the empty tables past the pool table and the graytiled dance floor jenks had his coat off and his back to the wall and ivy took the chair beside his before i could peeved i put my fingers on the worn wood of the chair across from her twisting it sideways so i could see the door the guys at the bar were watching us and one moved down a stool to talk to his neighbor seeing that ivy frowned stand up pixy she said her low voice carrying an obvious threat i dont want rachel sitting next to crap for brains in a heartbeat jenkss amusement turned to defiance no he said crossing his arms i dont want to and you cant make me im bigger than you ivys pupils swelled i would have thought youd be the last person equating greater size with greater threat his foot under the table jiggled squeaking right with an abrupt motion he pushed his chair out snatching up his coat and edging from behind the table to take the seat next to mine i dont like sitting with my back to the door either he grumbled ivy remained silent the brown returning to her eyes quickly i knew she was carrying herself carefully very aware that the clientele wasnt used to vampires and voluntarily putting herself on her best behavior that jenks had moved to suit her hadnt gone unnoticed and i fixed a cheerful smile to my face when the woman approached setting down four glasses of water with moisture beading up on them no one said anything and she fell away a full four feet pulling a pad of paper from her waistband what she wanted was obvious why she hadnt said anything in greeting was obvious too we had her on edge ivy smiled then toned it down when becky by her name tag paled putting the flat of my arms on the table i leaned forward to look brainless hi i said whats the special the woman darted a glance at ivy then back to me ah no specialmaam she said reaching nervously to touch her white hair which had been dyed blond but mike in the back makes a damn uh he makes a good hamburger and weve got pie today nick silently joined us with jax on his shoulder looking uncomfortable as he took the last seat next to ivy and across from jenks the woman relaxed a notch apparently realizing he was human and deciding the rest of us were probably half tamed i didnt know how they did it since they couldnt smell inderlander on us as we could on ourselves must be some secret human finger motion or something hamburger sounds good ivy said her eyes down to look meek but with her stiff posture it only made her look pissed four hamburgers all around i said wanting to be done with it and eating and a pitcher of coke nick scooted his chair closer to the table jax leaving him for the warmer light hanging over the table id like two hamburgers please the gaunt man said a hint of defiance in his voice as if he expected someone to protest me too jenks chimed up bright eyes wickedly innocent im starved nick leaned to see the menu on the wall does that come with fries fries jenks exclaimed and jax sneezed from the lamp hanging over the table pixy dust sifted down along with the mundane type tinkknocksyourknickers i want fries too the woman wrote it down her plucked and penciledin eyebrows rising two halfpound burgers with fries for each of the gentleman anything else nick nodded a milk shake cherry if you have it she blew out her breath taking in his gaunt frame how about you hon becky was looking at jenks but he was eyeing the jukebox coke is fine does that thing work the woman turned following his gaze to the machine its busted but for five bucks you can use the karaoke machine all you want jenkss eyes widened most excellent he said in a surferboy accent from above us came jaxs exuberant shout that all the bugs in the lamp shade had been dried out by the heat and he was going to eat their wings like chips if she didnt mind oh god and it had been going so well ivy cleared her throat clearly appalled when jax flitted from lamp to lamp growing more excited by the amount of pixy dust he was letting slip ah i think that will do it i said and the woman turned away bumping into a table as she watched jax on her way to the kitchen the hair on the back of my neck had pricked everyone in the bar was looking at us even the cook jenks followed my gaze his blond eyebrows high let me take care of this he said standing up rache do you have any money i spent mine at the butterfly shack ivys eyes darkened i can handle this a small noise came from jenks like at the fib he scoffed sit down weenie vamp im too big to get shoved into a water cooler feeling the tension rise i shuffled in my bag and handed jenks my wallet i didnt know what he had in mind but it was probably a lot less scary than what ivy had planned and it wouldnt land us in the local jail either leave some in there okay he gave me a lopsided charming smile his perfect teeth catching the light hey its me making a click to tell jax to join him he ambled to the bar his pace more provocative than it ought to have been the man couldnt have any idea how good he looked no honey toddies i shot after him and he raised a backward hand ivy wasnt happy when i met her gaze what i protested youve seen him on honey nick snickered and set his glass of water down jax flew a glittering path to the karaoke machine ahead of his dad jenkss pace intent as he followed becky had her eyes glued to the small pixy as she talked on the phone and i had a feeling he was intentionally dusting heavy i wondered how this would get everyones eyes off us a distraction maybe the father and son clustered at the screen a reading lesson ensuing while they looked at the song menu ivy glanced at them then nick go help them she muttered nick pulled his gaunt face up to hers why ivys jaw clenched because i want to talk to rachel frowning nick rose his chair scraping on the wooden floor our drinks arrived and the woman set his cherry shake three glasses of coke and a condensationwet pitcher on the table milk shake in hand nick shuffled to jenks and jax looking tired in his gray sweats i sipped my coke feeling the bubbles burn all the way down my stomach was empty and the smell of the cooking meat was giving me a headache setting the glass aside so i didnt slam it i slumped relying on ivy to keep an eye on my back i watched her relax muscle by muscle until she was calm im glad youre here i said i really made a crap pit of everything he was in the middle of a survivalist group for gods sake i never expected that i should have done more recon i thought but i didnt need to say it it was obvious ivy shrugged glancing at nick jenks and jax you got him out i wasnt planning on staying she added but since im here ill stick around i blew my breath out relieved thanks but is thatprudent i hesitated then ventured piscarys going to be royally ticked if you arent there by sundown her gaze tracked jax flitting madly from nick to jenks so what she said fingers fidgeting with her new earrings he knows ill be back its only a sixhour drive yes but youre out of his influence and he doesnt my words cut off when she rolled her fingertips across the table in a soft threat he doesnt like that i boldly finished pulse quickening here surrounded by humans was probably the only place id dare push her like this she was on her best behavior and i was going to use it for all it was worth ivy bowed her head the black sheet of her shorter hair not hiding her face the dusky scent of incense became obvious and a soft tickle shivered through me it will be okay she said but i wasnt convinced she lifted her head and a faint blush of worry or perhaps fear colored her kisten is there she said if i leave no one cares but the higherupswho arent going to do anything anyway kisten is the one who cant leave if he does it will be noticed talked about and acted upon by idiots who havent had their fangs for a month were fine this really wasnt what i had been worried about part of me wanted to take her explanation at face value and drop it but the other part the wiser stupider half of me wanted her to be honest so there would be no surprises i turned when the front door opened and a woman came in talking loudly to becky as she shrugged out of her coat and headed for the back ivy i said softly what about your hunger you dont have your usual i stopped not sure what to call the people she tapped for blood donors special friends significant others i settled on support net ivy froze sending a jolt of adrenaline through me crap maybe i should keep my mouth shut sorry i said meaning it its not my business your timing sucks she said and the tension eased i hadnt overstepped the friendship boundaries well i said wincing i dont know what you do i cant go out and knock up a streetwalker she said bitterly her eyes were hard and i could tell she wasnt responding to me but to a deeper guilt if i let it be a savage act that i can satisfy with anyone ill be a monster what kind of a person do you think i am thats not what i said i protested cut me some slack will you i dont know how you take care of yourself and i was too afraid to ask until now all i know is you go out anxious and jittery and come home calm and hating yourself my admission of fear seemed to penetrate and the creases in her forehead smoothed she uncrossed her legs then crossed them under the table sorry it surprised me you asked i should be good for a few days more but the stress ivy cut her thought short and took a breath i have a few people we help each other and go our separate ways i dont ask anything from them and they dont ask anything from me theyre vamps in case youre interested i dont make ties with anyone elseanymore single bi vamp looking for same for blood tryst not relationship i thought hearing her unspoken desire in her last sentence but i wasnt ready to deal with it i dont like living like this ivy said her words unaccusing and her eyes a deep honest brown but its where i am right now dont worry about it ill be okay and as far as piscary is concerned he can burn in hellif his soul hadnt already evaporated her face was expressionless again but i knew it was a front so youre going to stay i asked both embarrassed and proud that i had learned i could ask for help when i needed it and boy did i need it she nodded and i exhaled reaching for my drink thank you i said softly the idea of leaving everything to play dead the rest of my life scared the crap out of me the way a death threat couldnt i liked my life and i didnt want to have to leave it and start over it had taken me too long to find friends who would stick with me when i did something stupid like turning a simple snag and drag into an interspecies power struggle shifting one shoulder up and down in a half shrug ivy reached under her chair for that paper bag do you want your mail she asked seeing as i brought it all this way she was changing the subject but that was fine by me i thought you were kidding i said as ivy set the sack on the table and i dragged it closer jenks and jax were excited about something they had found on the list and people had given up watching them in glances and were blatantly staring at least they werent looking at us its the package im curious about ivy said glancing at nick and jenks while they pointed at the screen i dumped everything out putting the obvious thankyouforsavingmyass note from a previous run back in the bag along with the insurance bill from davids company and a late season seed catalog what was left was a paperwrapped parcel the size of my two fists i looked closer at the handwriting my eyes jerking to nick in the corner its from nick i said reaching for a table knife what is he sending me when he thinks im dead ivys face held a silent distain clearly directed at nick id be willing to bet its whatever the weres are after i thought it was his handwriting but i wasnt sure very conscious of nick slurping his shake and reading track titles over jenkss shoulder i pulled the package off the table and put it in my lap my pulse quickened and i made short work of the outer wrapping fingers cold i opened the box and pulled out the heavy drawstring bag its got lead in it i said feeling the supple weight of the fabric its wrapped in lead ivy i dont like this she casually leaned forward to block nicks view well what is it licking my lips i tugged the opening wider and peered down deciding it was a figurine i gingerly touched it finding it cold more confident i drew it out and set it on the table between us staring at it i wiped my hands off on my jeans that isreally ugly ivy said i think its ugly her brown eyes flicked to me is it ugly or just weird goose bumps rose and i stifled a shiver i dont know the statue was a yellowish color with stained striations running through it bone i guessed very old bone it had left the cold feeling on my hands that bone does it stood about four inches high and was about as deep and it felt alive like a tree or a plate of moldy cheese i furrowed my brow as i tried to figure out what it was a statue of touching only the base i turned it with two fingers a noise of disgust slipped from me the other side had a long muzzle twisted as if in pain is it a head i guessed ivy put her elbow on the table i think so but the teeththose are teeth right i shivered feeling like someone had walked over my grave oh i whispered realizing what it reminded me of it looks like pam when she was in the middle of wereing ivy flicked her eyes to mine and back to the statue as i watched her face went paler and her eyes went frightened damn she muttered i think i know what it is cover it up we are in deep shit twenty i jerked when nick suddenly appeared at the table his long face was flushed angry and frightened all at the same timea dangerous mix what are you doing he hissed at ivy snatching the statue up and holding it close you brought it here i sent it to her so no one would find it i thought she was dead they couldnt make me tell who had it if i sent it to a dead woman and you brought it here you damned fool vampire sit ivy said her jaw clenched and her eyes shifting to black give it to me no nicks grip tensed to a whiteknuckled strength save the aura shit for someone it works on im not afraid of you he was and ivys hand trembled nicholas im hungry im tired i dont give a crap about your stupid ass my partner is in deep shit because of you give it to me adrenaline pulsed hurting my head nick was near panic the karaoke machine started up with something sad and melancholy jenks was watching us but the rest of the bar hadnt a clue that ivy was about ready to lose it pushed to the edge from stress and being far from home nick i soothed itll be okay give it to me ill put it away nick shifted and ivy jerked almost reaching for him licking his cracked lips nick said youll hold it for me ill keep it i assured him fumbling for the leadlined bag and extending it here hollowcheeked face frightened he carefully placed it into the pouch his swollen fingers started curving around it and i pulled it to me tightening the drawstrings it wasnt any magical hold it had on him it was greed hand shaking ivy grabbed her drink and downed it to ice i kept an eye on her while i put the statue in my bag then put the bag on my lap it felt heavy like a dead thing from the corner came jenks singing ballad of the edmund fitzgerald the skinny guy at the bar was watching him having turned completely from the game recap jenks could sing sit ivy breathed and this time nick did taking jenkss spot beside me and putting jenkss coat on the chair beside ivy where did you find that she muttered its mine i shifted in my chair smelling our food coming the woman didnt look at anyone as she placed the food down and left the tension was so thick even she could sense it i stared at my plate there was my fabulous burger oozing juice with lettuce onions mushrooms cheese and oh god there was bacon on it too and i couldnt eat it because we had to argue about nicks ugly statue first well to hell with that i thought removing the top bun and picking the onions off ivy refilled her glass from the pitcher a growing rim of brown around her pupils i didnt say whose is it i said where did you find it nick pulled his plate closer clearly wanting to ignore her but making the healthy decision not to i cant believe you brought it here he said again motions jerky as he rearranged his pickles i sent it to rachel so it would be safe ivy glared at him if you use smart people in your takes without telling them dont complain when they do the unexpected and ruin your plans i thought she was dead nick protested i never expected anyone to come help me i ate one of jenkss fries there wasnt any ketchup on the table but asking for some would get us thrown out humans blamed the turn on tomatoes but they were the ones who had done the genetic tinkering and why are they willing to pack up to get ahold of it i asked nick looked ill i dont have to tell you anything my lips parted in disbelief and i turned to ivy hes still running his scam im not his eyes were wide in an innocence that couldnt reach me anymore but the weres cant have it dont you know what it is his last words were a hushed whisper and ivy glanced past me to the door as three underdressed giggling women pranced in immediately becky started in with a highpitched chatter her eyes tracking to jenks i think she had called them about fresh meat i know what it is ivy said dismissing the women where did you find it one of the guys at the bar was humming while we sat hunched over our food and argued jenks had some guy at the bar singing about a tanker that had sunk fortysome years ago shaking my head in wonder i returned my attention to nick were waiting i said then wrangled my burger to my mouth my eyes closed as i bit into it sweet bliss it was good his eyes stressed nick picked up one of his burgers leaning his elbows on the table rachel you saw how there were three packs on that island didnt you all working together i scrambled for a napkin it was freaking weird i said around my full mouth you should have seen how fast their alpha wered and they were nasty too like alphas without the restraint cocky little bastards my words trailed off as i took another bite thats what it does nick said and ivy swore under her breath i found it in detroit then its the focus she whispered and i waved a hand for their attention fry weaving between the two of them but they werent listening to me that thing cant be the focus ivy added it was destroyed five millennia ago we dont even know if it even really existed and if it did it sure as hell wouldnt be in detroit thats where i found it nick said then took a bite a small moan came from him you cant destroy something that powerful he mumbled not with rocks and sticks and not with magic he swallowed maybe with a car crusher but they didnt have them back then what is it i insisted only marginally aware of the flirting going on across the room between the stanzas of men dying on the waves get a clue jenks ivy pushed her untouched plate with her burger away its trouble she said i was going to make him give it to the weres but now damn it i shouted and the three women ogling jenks giggled and jiggledin that order i lowered my voice someone tell me what i have sitting on my lap before i explode youre the professor ivy said bitingly to nick taking a fry from jenkss plate you tell her nick washed a bite of his first burger down and hesitated vamps can either be born or bitten but the only way to become a were is to be born one duh i said witches are like that too along with most of inderland well nick paused his eyes flicking everywhere the were holding that thing can make a were by a bite i chewed and swallowed and they want to kill you for that ivy brought her head up think about it rachel she cajoled right now vampires are at the top of the food chain i made a telling face at her as i took another bite wrangling a piece of bacon what i mean is we have more political power than any other inderlander species she amended because of how were structured everyone looks to someone else the top vampires owing so many favors that theyre as effective as a political house member its a tight web but we generally get what we want humans would get itchy with their trigger finger except that our numbers are held static by only the undead being able to infect a human with enough virus to make it even possible to turn them i stole another of jenkss fries wishing i had ketchup weres though nick said dont have political power as a group because they wont look to any but their pack leader and their numbers cant increase any faster than their birthrate leaning forward nick tapped the table with a swollen finger his entire mien changing as he became the instructor the focus makes it possible for the number of weres to increase very quickly and the multiple packing you saw on the island is nothing to what will happen when it gets out that the focus is intact everyone will want a part of it merging their pack into the one that holds it you saw what they were like can you imagine what would happen if a vampire ran into a pack of weres acting like that jenkss halfeaten fry dangled from my fingers forgotten slowly it was starting to sink in and it didnt look good the problem wasnt that the focus would allow weres to pack up the problem was that the focus would keep them packed up worried i glanced at ivy seeing me understand she nodded the island weres had been together for days maybe weeks and that had been with only the promise of the focus if they had it the round would be permanent i thought back to the ring of weres surrounding me on the island the three packs united under one were holding the strength of six alphas their cocky savage attitude had been shocking walter had not only drawn his dominance from them but also channeled it back into every member without the tempering calm and moral strength that all alphas had that wasnt even bringing up how fast they could were if they muted each others pain add to that their new aggressiveness and a resistance to pain i set jenkss fry down no longer hungry weres were fairly submissive in inderland society the alphas the only ones having enough personal power to challenge the vampires political structure remove that submissive posture and the two species were going to start clashing a lot thats probably why the vamps had hidden the focus in the first place crap if the vampires knew about it they would be after me too this isnt good i said feeling ill making a puff ivy leaned back you think from across the bar jenks finished his song immediately falling into a sleazy version of american woman gyrating his hips and making the three women and one of the truck drivers cheer and whistle jax was above him making sparkles i wondered if anyone had any inkling the world was changing starting right here in this little bar wiping my fingers clean i reached for the bag on my lap it can shift the balance of inderland power i said and ivy nodded the tips of her hair swinging with the explosive destruction of dropping a tiger into a dog show she said dryly its believed that weres used to have a political structure very similar to that of the vampires better since weres never betrayed another as vampires are known to do for blood their hierarchy revolved around who held the focus and eliminating it shattered the weres social structure politically castrating them and leaving them squabbling in small packs nick started on his second burger they were going to forcibly convert humanity according to the demon texts he said taking off the top bun to eat it like an openfaced sandwich those who wouldnt voluntarily become a were were killed entire families whelped or murdered in the name of were conquest over vampires they would have had a good chance of succeeding but the witches crossed from the everafter about that time and sided with the humans and vampires using witch magic we beat them back nervous i slipped my flipflop off and on to make a popping sound i wondered what he had given a demon for learning this id never heard it before but ivy had so maybe i just hadnt taken the right class i couldnt help thinking that perhaps witches were really at the top of the food chain our independent ways and lack of political structure aside every earth spell on the market whether used by human vampire or were was made by a witch without us their little political wars would be fought with sticks stones and nasty words the focus was destroyed ivy said her voice low and her eyes thick with worry nick shook his head gulping down a swig of soda he said its demon made and only a demon can destroy it it has been passed from vampire to ranking vampire for generations until you sold a piece of your soul for it i whispered and nick went white stupidass human i thought then hid my own wrist jenks finished his song amid cheers and friendly shouts he bowed and blew kisses stepping off the stage and making his lightfooted way to us a camera flashed and i wished i had remembered mine jax flitted over the ladies at the bar charming them thoroughly and helping his dad avoid them the mood of the bar had shifted dramatically thanks to jenks now even the looks our way from the truckers had a touch of daring voyeurism foods here jenks said handing me my wallet before dropping down and grappling with the first of his burgers with the enthusiasm of a starving adolescent jax stayed with the women distracting everyone and staying safely out of the adult conversation whatd i miss jenks added taking a bite i sucked at my teeth and gave ivy a wry look nick swiped a were artifact that can tip the balance of inderland power and start a vampirewere war i said putting my wallet away next to the were statue i needed to call david and get his take on this on second thought maybe i shouldnt jenks froze his cheeks bulging with food he met everyones eyes to figure out if we were joking but it wasnt until nick nodded that he remembered to swallow holy crap he said thats about it i sighed what are we going to do with it we cant give it to them nick picked at his fries im the one who started this ill take it and disappear in a smooth motion of grace ivy reclined in her chair she looked calm and possessed but i could tell by her fingers searching for her missing crucifix that she wasnt its not that simple now professor they know who rachel is jenks they might give up on but by saving your ass rachel put her own on the line she cant go back to cincinnati as if it never happened they will follow her through hell for that thing putting the flat of one arm on the table she leaned forward her face threatening they will hurt her just like they hurt you to get it and im not going to let that happen you dumb little shit stop it i said as nick reddened we cant give it back what else do we have ivy picked a sesame seed off her burger looking sullen nick too had a chip the size of montana on his shoulder jenks was the only one whose face was creased in thought not anger can you make everyone forget about it he asked as he chewed or at least forget about us i pushed my plate away too many people id miss someone not to mention it would be a black earth charm im not doing it but id twist demon curses no accounting for tastes i guess but ceris curse hadnt involved hurting people other than me jenks chewed slowly how about putting it into hiding again im not putting it back nick protested i spent a years income getting it ignoring him i frowned was he still running his take theyd still come after rachel ivy said if you cant make everyone forget she said to me i can only think of one thing to get your life back after crap for brains screwed it up nick took an angry breath you call me that again and im going to ivy moved i jumped managing to keep my reaction to a small hop when she sent her arm forward and grabbed nick under his chin nicks eyes widened but he didnt move he had grown up in the hollows and knew that moving would only make things worse ivys eyes were almost entirely black youll what crap for brains ivy i said tiredly stop it jenks looked from me to ivy his eyes bright and his face worried lighten up ivy he said softly you know she always sides with the underdog jenkss words penetrated where mine hadnt and in a flash of brown ivys pupils returned to normal smiling beatifically she let go catching nick by the collar of his sweatshirt before he could rock back pretending to adjust it for him sorry nickie she said her pale fingers patting his hollow cheek a smidgen too hard as i tried to purge the adrenaline from me nick scooted his chair away cautiously rubbing his throat moving a shade too fast ivy refilled her glass from the pitcher theres only one solution she said bending her straw exactly upright professor here has to die whoa whoa whoa i exclaimed and nick stiffened his face red in anger ivy thats enough jenks pulled his plate of fries closer hey im right there with you he said his eyes roving the bar probably for the nonexistent ketchup it would solve everything he hesitated wiping his fingers on a napkin you grab him and ill get your sword from the van hey i shouted angry i knew they werent serious but they were starting to tick me off i lowered my voice when the giggling women at the bar looked at us nick relax they arent going to kill you snickering jenks started on his fries and ivy took on a confident almost seductive stance slouching in her chair and smiling with one side of her mouth all right she said if youre going to get bent out of shape about it we wont kill him well stage his spectacular public death along with the destruction of that thing nick stared at ivys confident figure i will not let you destroy it he said vehemently she arched her eyebrows you cant stop me its the only option we have to get those weres off rachels tail so unless you have a suggestion i suggest you shut up nick went still i eyed his brow furrowed in thought then slid my gaze to jenks jenks was watching him too his mouth full but his jaws not moving we exchanged a knowing look someone who endured a week of torture wouldnt give up that easy ivy didnt seem to notice but ivy didnt know nick like i was starting to know nick god why was i even trying to help him i thought jiggling my foot to make my flipflops pop depressed i reached for my soda so you stage my death and the destruction of the focus the apparently subdued human said and jenks returned to eating pretending ignorance i think theyre going to notice when the ambulance takes me to the hospital instead of the morgue ivys eyes tracked someone headed our way glass in hand i turned to find becky with three drinks holding umbrellas and cherries on sticks my eyes went to the flirting women and i cringed ohhow nice they were trying to pick him up i can get us a body ivy said into the silence i choked on my drink coughing at the string of thoughts that remark engendered but becky had come forward and i couldnt say a wordeven if i could catch my breath here you go hon she said smiling as she set the drinks squarely before jenks from the ladies at the bar oh wow jenks said apparently forgetting what accepting drinks from strangers meant when one was over four inches tall look pixy swords he reached for the cherry picks eyes glinting and i interrupted with a quick jenks ivy exhaled sounding tired and jenks glanced from one of us to the other what he said then reddened wincing he looked up at becky hey um im married he said and i heard someone swear from the bar it wasnt the trucker thank god maybe he said pushing them reluctantly to her you should return them to the ladies with my uh regrets well shoot becky said smiling you just keep them i told them a hunk like you would be already hooked landed filleted and cooked her smile widened and eaten ivy exhaled and nick didnt seem to know whether to be proud or embarrassed for his species jenks shook his head probably thinking of matalina as he pushed them away did you say you had pie ivy asked yes maam becky smoothly took up the drinks pixy swords and all i have butterscotch or apple ill bring out a wedge of apple seeing as youre allergic to butterscotch ivy blinked but her smile never faltered thank you she pushed her untouched hamburger at her and the woman obligingly took both it and my plate put a scoop of ice cream on it she asked and coffee everyone want coffee she looked inquiringly at us smiling in a way that made me decidedly nervous especially after that i can get us a body remark and i nodded coffee why not sugar and cream jenks added faintly and becky sashayed away loudly proclaiming to the three women at the bar that she had known it all along ivy watched her go then looked at me with a questioning scrutiny i suddenly realized becky must have talked to terri from the grocery store feeling another one of my stellar embarrassing moments coming on i hunched forward and took another sip hiding behind the glass no wonder the entire bar was being nice to us they thought i was a nympho who liked doing it with three people and pudding why am i allergic to butterscotch ivy asked slowly my face flamed and jenks stammered ah rachel and i are lovers with a thing for foursomes and pudding apparently she thinks you and nick are alexia and tom youre allergic to butterscotch and crap for brains likes pistachio stop calling me that nick muttered ivy let her breath out her eyebrows were arched and she looked bemused okay i set my drink down can we get back to how were going to kill nick and whats this about a dead body youd better start talking quick ivy cause im not going to play hideandseek with a dead guy in my trunk i did that in college and im not going to do it again a smile quirked ivys mouth really she asked and i flushed well he wasnt dead i muttered but they told me he was scared the crap out of me when he kissed my ear when i tried to lug him into i stopped when i felt becky at my elbow a tray of coffee and pie in her hand smirking becky gave everyone their coffee and set a piece of pie à la mode in front of ivy humming american woman she took jenkss and nicks empty plates and left i eyed the ice cream and then my fork you going to eat all that i asked knowing from experience ivy rarely finished anything glancing at me for permission ivy took my coffee cup off its saucer and put the ice cream in its place i pulled it closer feeling the tension start to ease i didnt have a spoon but my fork worked and i wasnt going to ask becky for one ivy carefully cut the point from her pie and pushed it away to eat last i propose we pull a kevorkian she said and i went cold from more than the ice cream thats illegal jenks said quickly only if you get caught ivy said eyes on her pie i have a friend of a friend no i set my fork down im not going to help a vampire cross over i wont ivy youre asking me to kill someone my voice had risen and ivy tossed her hair from her eyes hes twenty and hes in so much pain he cant use the can without someone helping him no i said louder not caring people were starting to look absolutely not i turned to jenks and nick for support appalled to see their acceptance of this you guys are sick i said im not going to do that rachel ivy said persuasively brown eyes showing an unusual amount of emotion people do it all the time this people right here doesnt flustered i pushed the ice cream away wondering if it had been part of her plan to get me to accept she knew i was a sucker for ice cream i scowled at the laughter from the bar turning to see becky gossiping to the truck drivers bent over with her rear in the air it occurred to me they probably thought i had just been propositioned for something even a redheaded nympho would say no to crossing my arms in front of me i glared at ivy hed do it himself ivy said softly god knows he has enough courage but he needs his life insurance check to set himself up and if he kills himself he loses it hes been waiting a long time no ivys lips pressed together then her brow smoothed ill call him she said softly you talk to him and if you still feel the same way well call it off it will be up to you my head hurt if i didnt say yes now i would look meaner than satans babysitter alexia i said loud enough for the bar to hear you are one sick bitch her smile widened thats my girl clearly pleased she picked up her fork and ate another bite of pie can you make a charm to make someone look like little professor here nick stiffened and jenks chuckled little professor as he dumped a fourth packet of sugar into his coffee i felt like i was in my high school lunchroom plotting a prank yeah i can do that i said sullen i pushed the melting ice cream around on my plate doppelganger charms were illegal but not black why not i was going to freaking kill someone good ivy speared the last of her pie going still in thought before she ate the point and i knew she was making a wish and people thought i was superstitious now all we have to do is find a way to destroy that thing she finished at that nick stirred youre not going to destroy it its over five thousand years old i sent my flipflops popping i agree i said and nick shot me a grateful glance if we can substitute a fake nick then we can substitute a fake statue ivy leaned back in her chair with her coffee i dont care she said but you she pointed a finger at nick arent going to get it rachel is going to put it into hiding and yougetnothing nick looked sullen and i exchanged that same knowing look with jenks this was going to be a problem jenks stirred his coffee so he said how are we going to knack nick i thought his verbiage left something to be desired but i let it pass ignoring my melting bribe i dont know im usually on the savingyourbutt end of things blowing across his mug jenks shrugged im partial to crushing their chest until their ribs crack and their blood splatters like jello in a blender without a top he took a sip wincing thats what i do to fairies i frowned appalled when he added two more packets of sugar we could push him off a roof ivy suggested drown him maybe weve got lots of water around here jenks leaned conspiratorially toward ivy his green eyes darting merrily between mine and hers id suggest jamming a stick of dynamite up his ass and running away but that might really hurt whoever is taking his place ivy laughed and i frowned at both of them the karaoke machine had started up again and i felt ill when love shack began bouncing out oh my god the skinny trucker was up on the stage with the three bimbos as backup i looked then looked again finally i tore my eyes away hey i said feeling the weight of the last twentyfour hours fall on me ive been up since yesterday noon can we just find somewhere to crash for the day immediately ivy grabbed her purse from under her chair yeah lets go i have to call peter it will take him his scion and his mentor a day to get up here you sleep jenks and i will come up with a few plans and you can pick the one that your magic will work the best with she glanced at jenks and he nodded both of them turned to me sound okay sure i said taking a slow breath to steady myself inside i was shaking i wasnt too keen on picking any plan that involved killing someone but the weres wouldnt give up on nick unless he was dead and unless there was a body they would know it was a scam and i wanted to go home i wanted to go home to my church and my life they would hound me to the ends of the earth if they knew the focus was found and in my possession i stood feeling as if i was slipping into places that i had once vowed i would never go if we were caught we would be tried for murder but what choice did i have twentyone the scent of cinnamon and cloves was thick in the motel room making it smell like the solstice nick was making ginger drops and the warmth of the tiny efficiency oven was pleasant at my back it wasnt unusual for him to bake but i thought it more likely he was trying to bribe me into talking to him than a desire for homemade cookies and since jenks had the tv on a kids show for jax and ivy wouldnt let nick plan his own demise the human had little to do the weres knew jenks so ivy had gone shopping while i slept laden down with a grocery list and my shoe size all of us going out for food three times a dayor in jenkss case sixdidnt seem prudent we had found a suite five minutes from the bar and after giving the lowceilinged rooms done in brown and gold the onceover i stated clearly that i had the van ivy took the bed in the tiny room off the main room nick got the bed in the main room and jenks wanted the sofa sleeper happily opening it up and putting it away twice before ivy and i finished unloading the van she didnt want nick touching anything the van was tight and cold but it was quiet and with the circle id put up while i slept safer than the motel i had woken cranky and stiff that morning at an ungodly nine oclock unable to go back to sleep after my twelvehour nap and since jenks and jax were both up and nick of course was awake i thought id take the opportunity to get a jump on the magic prep yeah right want to lick the spoon rayray nick said his gaunt face looking more relaxed than id seen it sincelast fall i smiled trying to keep it noncommittal no thanks i bent my attention back to the laptop screen with kistens help ceri had emailed me the earth charm i needed to make the disguise amulets with her additions to turn it into an illegal doppelganger spell it was still white but i wasnt familiar enough with the additional ingredients to sensitize it to mimic a particular person stretching i pulled my scratch pad closer and added pumpkin seeds to my list the bulb over the oven glinted on my nospell charm bracelet and i jiggled the black gold making an audible show of my break with nick ignoring it he continued to wedge blobs of cookie dough onto a nastylooking pan then he hesitated clearly wanting to say something but deciding against it the first batch of cookies had come out of the oven not long ago and the smell was heaven i was avoiding the cookies on some vague principle but jenks had a plateful as he leaned over jaxs work on the table by the curtained window though the tv was on neither was paying attention to it absorbed in their practice rex sat in the warmth of jenkss lap her pretty white paws tucked sweetly under her as she stared at me from across the room that jax was strutting atop the table didnt seem to be important to her right now ever the vigilant father jenks had a gentling hand about her fur in case she remembered jax and took a swipe at him but the kitten was fixed on me giving me a mild case of the creeps i think she knew i had been that wolf and was waiting for me to turn back her ears swiveled to the back room and a sudden thump sent her skittering jenks yelped when her claws dug into him but she was already under the bed jax was after her in a sprinkling of gold pixy dust coaxing in a highpitched voice that grated on my eyeballs from ivys room came a torrent of muffled curses great now what the door to ivys room was flung open she wore her usual silk nightie and her short black hair was tousled from her pillow lean and sleek she stomped across the nasty carpet looking intent on mayhem the electric company theme song bounced as she strode into the kitchen eyes wide i turned to keep her in view nick stood in the corner satisfaction gleaming in his eyes the bowl of dough in his long hands lips pressed tight ivy grabbed an oven mitt pulled open the oven and yanked out the tin of baking cookies it made a muffled clatter when she dropped it onto the tin with its blobs of uncooked dough waiting to go in the oven her brown eyes fixed on nicks for an instant then she grabbed the two tins with the oven mitt and strode to the door still silent she opened it dropping everything on the walk outside her speed was edging into a vamp quickness when she returned jerking the bowl out of nicks unresisting grip and swiping the cookies cooling on the counter into it ivy i questioned morning rachel she said tightly ignoring jenks she opened the door and dropped the metal mixing bowl onto the walk with the rest plucking the cookie out of jenkss hand she flicked it over the threshold slammed the door and vanished into her room bewildered i glanced at jenks the pixy shrugged then turned the volume down on the tv i followed his gaze to nick his expression was positively vindictive my eyes narrowed and i leaned back crossing my arms what was that all about i asked ooooh i forgot he said lightly snapping his healing fingers vampires are sensitive to the scent of cloves golly the smell must have woken her up my jaw tightened i hadnt known that apparently neither had jenks since he was the one who had gone shopping nick turned to the sink a little too slowly to hide his smile i took a breath deciding he was lucky ivy hadnt smacked him hard enough to knock him out in the shape he was in it wouldnt take much my eyes fell on the pain amulet he was wearing thinking the entire situation was stupid jenks told me earlier that ivy had been on the internet all last night as nick tried to sleep payback my fingers tapped the laminated table standing i closed the lid on my laptop then slid my demon curse book off the table and into my arms ill be in the van i said blandly rachel nick started but i snatched up my list and pencil and walked out of the kitchen the heavy book making me awkward and unbalanced it kind of went with my mood whatever nick i said tiredly not turning around jenks was a mix of wary alertness the paper on the table before him was strewn with jaxs work he was getting better ill be in the van if you need me i said in passing sure his eyes went from me to jax trying to coax rex out from under the bed the sight of a pixy holding up a bedspread calling kitty kitty kitty looked risky even to me rachel nick protested when i opened the door but i didnt turn reversing my steps i snatched up my bag with the focus in it no need to leave that sitting around you stupid lunker jenks said as i left dont you know she always sides with the door clicked closed cutting off his words the underdog i finished depressed i leaned against the door the focus tucked between me and my demon book my head bowed not this time i wouldnt side with nick and despite the cookie incident nick was the underdog birdsong and the chill of morning pulled my head up it was quiet and damp the rushhour traffic nonexistent the sun was trying to break through the light fog giving everything a golden sheen the nearby straits were probably beautiful not that i could see them from where i stood gathering my resolve i shifted the weight of the demon book and dug in my pocket for the vans keys wed parked in the shade of a huge white pine between the road and the motel so i could set a circle without people running into it the new hundreddollar running shoes that ivy had bought me were silent on the pavement and it felt odd being up this early creepy habit made me shift through the keys so they didnt clink and only the muffled thunk of the van unlocking broke the stillness until i lugged the side door open in a sound of sliding metal and rolling rubber still peeved i stepped up and in and slammed the door shut in frustration i dropped the demon book on the cot and sat next to it elbows on my knees i kicked my bag under me i didnt want to be there but i wanted to be in the motel room less the silence grew and i reluctantly slid the curse book onto my lap i was here i might as well do something wedging off my shoes i sat crosslegged with my back to the drape drawn between me and the front seat it was dim and i tugged the little side curtain open to let in the light my lightning charm rasped on the yellowing pages as i leafed through the tome looking for anything familiar there wasnt a table of contents making it difficult to satisfy my curiosity big al used demon magic to look like people he had never seen plucking their description and voice from memories like i picked flowers from my garden i wasnt going to twist a demon curse for a disguise when i could use an illegal white earth charm but comparing the two might give me insight into how the three branches of magic pulled on each others strengths the latin word for copy caught my attention and i leaned closer feeling my legs protest i needed to get out and run i was stiffening slowly i pieced it out deciding the word actually translated into transpose there was a difference the curse didnt make someone look like someone else it moved the abilities of one person into another my lips parted thats how al not only turned himself into ivy but took the abilities of a vampire as well my eyebrows rose and i wondered whom al got his vampiric abilities from piscary in return for a favor a lesser vampire he had in the everafter ceri would know gaze dropping to my bag my pulse quickened at the thoughts sliding through me i couldnt duplicate the focus without commissioning an artistwho would take forever and then have to be charmed into forgetfulnessbut maybe if i moved its power to a new thing demon curse rachel i whispered youre a bad girl to even think it the sound of a motel door opening and closing pulled a thread of caution through me i didnt hear footsteps berating myself for not having done it sooner i tapped a line rhombus i whispered instigating a series of hardpracticed lessons that flicked a fiveminute setup and invocation of a circle into a heartbeat the zing of everafter tingled through me making it feel as if my body was humming it was fascinating that the line here tasted different more electrical almost i think it was all the ground water yikes came jenkss soft voice when she wants to be alone she doesnt leave any bones about it does she there was a highpitched answer and i pushed the book off my lap and lurched past the curtain and into the front jenks i called tapping the glass before i stuck the key in the ignition and rolled the window down whats up the tall pixy turned from unlocking kistens corvette smiling he squinted in the haze and crossed the parking lot two amulets about his neck and a red baseball cap on his head one was for scent the other an overthecounter charm turned his hair black it wasnt much but it would do his feet edged the black haze of everafter between us and i dropped the circle my pulse temporally quickening at the surge of power before i disconnected from the line i need some more toothbrushes he said coming closer and maybe some fudge knealing on the seat i put my crossed arms on the windowsill toothbrushes he had six open on the bathroom counter you know you can reuse those i said and he shuddered no thanks besides i want to take jax on a lesson on lowtemperature runs so ivy can smack crap for brains a good one if he wants to keep antagonizing her hi ms morgan jax chimed out jenkss hat lifting to show jax peeping from under it a smile curved over me hi jax keep your dads back okay you bet pride crinkled jenkss eyes jax do a quick reconnaissance of the area watch your temps and be careful i heard blue jays earlier okay jax wiggled out from under his dads hat and zipped off in a clatter of wings i exhaled a mix of melancholy and pride over jax learning a new skill will you stop calling nick crap for brains i asked tired of playing referee you used to like him jenks made a face he turned my son into a thief and broke my partners heart why should i give him a draft of consideration surprised my eyebrows rose i hadnt known my falling out with nick bothered him dont get all girly on me jenks said gruffly i may only be eighteen but ive been married for ten years you turned into a slobbering blob and i dont want to see it again its pathetic and it makes me want to pix you his face grew worried ive seen how you get around dangerous men and you always fall for the underdog nick is both i mean hes dangerous and hes been hurt and hurt bad jenks rushed on mistaking my sick look for fear crap was i that transparent hes going to hurt you again if you let himeven if he doesnt mean to disconcerted i brushed the dampness of fog from my arm dont worry about it why would i go back i love kisten jenks smiled but his brow was furrowed then why did we come out here i fixed my gaze on the curtained windows of the motel he saved my life i might have loved him and i cant pretend my past didnt happen can you there wasnt much jenks could say to that you need anything while im out he said clearly changing the subject my lips curved upward yeah can you get one of those disposable cameras jenks blinked then smiled sure id love a shot of you and me together in front of the bridge still smiling he whistled for jenks and turned away the reminder of why we were there intruded and my stomach clenched uh jenks i could use something else too his eyes went expectant and i licked my lips nervously youre a bad girl rachel i need something made from bone i said jenkss eyebrows rose bone i nodded about fistsized dont spend a lot of money on it im thinking i might be able to move the curse from the statue to something else it needs to have been alive at some point and i dont think wood is animate enough feet scuffing jenks nodded you got it he said turning to the dry desperatesounding clatter of pixy wings it was jax and the exhausted pixy almost fell into his dads hand tinks diauh diapers jax exclaimed changing his oath midphrase its cold out here my wings dont even work jeez dad are you sure its okay for me to be out here youre fine taking off his hat jenks raised his hand and jax made the jump to his head jenks carefully replaced his cap it takes practice to know how long your wings will work in low temps and get yourself to a heat source in time thats what were doing this for yeah but its cold jax complained his voice muffled jenks was smiling when he met my gaze this is fun he said sounding surprised maybe i should go into business training pixy backups i chuckled then turned solemn it would make his last months more enjoyable if he could teach what he could no longer do i knew jenkss thoughts were near mine when the emotion left his face jenkss school for pixy pirates i quipped and he smiled but it faded fast thanks jenks i said as he made motions to return to the car i really appreciate this no prob rache he touched his hat finding stuff is what pixies do fourth best i snorted pulling myself in and already knowing what jenks thought pixies did first best and it wasnt saving my ass like he told everyone rolling up the window against the chill i returned to my cot wondering if kisten had a second blanket in there somewhere the rumble of the corvette rose fading to the ambient sound of passing traffic when jenks drove off bone i mumbled writing the word beside the latin my breath caught then slipped from me in chagrin when the pencil faded thats right ceri had used a charm to fix the print to the page next time i talked to her id ask why i mumbled feeling my mood sour it wasnt as if i was going to make a practice of using these curses right eyes closing i let a sound slip from me as i pushed my fingers into my forehead i am a white witch this is a oneshot deal too much ability leads to confusion over whats right and wrong and obviously i was confused enough already was i a coward or a fool god help me i was going to give myself a headache the squeak of the motel door opening brought my head up there wasnt an accompanying sound of a car starting and my face blanked when a tap came on the back door of the van a shadow moved past the dirtsmeared window rayray i should have reset my circle i thought sourly forcing my shoulders down and trying to decide what to do for an entire five seconds an eternity for me rachel im sorry i brought you some hot chocolate his voice was apologetic and i exhaled closing my big book of demon curses i went to the back door thinking i was making a mistake when i opened it nick stood there in his borrowed gray sweats looking like he was ready for a run in the park tall lean and battered a survivor he had a foam cup of instant hot chocolate in his hands and a pleading expression in his eyes his hair was swept back and his cheeks were cleanshaven i could smell the shampoo from his shower and i lowered my eyes at the memory of how silky his hair was when it was toweled dry and still damp a whisper over my fingertips jenkss warning resounded in me and i stifled my first feeling of sympathy yes he had been hurt yes he had the potential to be dangerous but damn it i didnt have to let it get to me can i come in he asked after id silently stared at him for a good while i dont want to sit alone in that motel room knowing a vamp is sleeping behind a flimsy door my pulse quickened youre the one who woke her up i said hand on my hip he smiled to turn himself charmingly helpless he wasnt he knew i knew he wasnt i got tired of being called crap for brains i didnt know everyone would leave so you pushed her buttons relying on jenks and me to buffer the retaliation i asked i did say i was sorry and i never claimed it was smart he raised the hot chocolate do you want this or should i go logic railed against emotion i thought of ivy knowing i wouldnt want to be alone in the same motel room with an angry vampire either and there wasnt much sense in saving someone if you were going to let your partner take him apart the first chance she got come on in i said sounding like it was a concession thanks it was a grateful whisper his relief obvious he handed me the hot chocolate and using the side of the van to steady himself stepped up and in his pain amulet swung and he tucked it behind his shirt as he straightened in the low height i could tell by his stiff motions and his grimace that the amulet wasnt working to cover all the pain i had only the one pain amulet left until i made more and hed have to ask for it clearly cold nick shut the door sealing us in the same darkness that i had been in before but now it was uncomfortable my hands on the hot chocolate i sat dead center on the cot forcing him to sit on the pile of boxes across from me there was more room than before because ivy had dumped off marshals stuff at the high school pool but it was still too close gingerly settling himself nick tugged his sleeves down to hide his shackle marks and set his clasped hands in his lap for a moment the silence was broken only by the hush of traffic i dont want to bother you he said watching me from under his fallen bangs too late its okay i lied crossing my legs at my knees very conscious of the demon text beside me on the bed i took a sip of hot chocolate then set it on the floor it was too early for me to be hungry the silence stretched how is the amulet holding up a relieved smile came over him great good he rushed to say some of the hair on my arms is starting to grow back by this time next month i might looknormal thats good great if we managed to evade the weres and live that long his eyes were worried as he glanced at the book beside me taking up the space so he wouldnt do you need any help with the latin i dont mind interpreting it for you his long face scrunched up id like to do something maybe later i said guardedly my shoulders eased at his admission of uselessness ivy and jenks were making a point to keep him out of everything and it would have bothered me too i think i have a curse i can use i want to talk to ceri about it first rachel oh god ive heard that tone before usually coming out of me he wants to talk about us if she says the imbalance wont be too bad i rushed to say im going to move the magic from the focus to something else so we can destroy the old statue it shouldnt be too hard rachel i pulse quickening i tugged the demon book closer hey why dont i show you the curse you could he moved and my eyes jerked up he didnt look dangerous he didnt look helpless he looked frustrated as if he was screwing his courage up i dont want to talk about the plan he said leaning over the space between us i dont want to talk about latin or magic i want to talk about you and me nick i said my heart pounding stop he reached for my shoulder and i jumped lashing out to block his hand before he could touch me startled he jerked away damn it rachel he exclaimed i thought you were dead will you justwill you just let me give you a hug youre back from the dead and you wont let me even touch you im not asking to move in with you all i want is to touch youto prove to me youre alive i let out my held breath then caught it again my head hurt i did nothing as he shifted to sit beside me moving the book out of the way our body weight slid us closer and i shifted to face him my knees forcing us apart i missed you he said softly his eyes scrunched with old pain and this time i did nothing as his arms went around me the scent of cinnamon and flour filled my senses instead of musty books and the snap of ozone his hands were light almost not there i felt his body relax and he exhaled as if hed found a piece of himself dont i thought tensing please dont say it things would have been different if i had known you were alive he whispered his breath shifting the hair about my face i never would have left i never would have asked jax to help me i never would have started this fool snatch god rachel i missed you youre the only woman ive met who understands me who i never needed to explain why hell you didnt even leave when you found out i called up demons ii really missed you his hands clenched for an instant and his voice cracked he had missed me he wasnt lying and i knew what it was like to be alone and the rarity of finding a kindred soul even if he was screwed up nick i said my heart pounding my eyes closed as his hands moved pulling through my hair i reached up stilling them bringing them back down to my lap the memory of him tracing the lines of my face filled me i remembered the touch of his sensitive fingers following my jawline running down my neck to follow the curves of my body i remembered his warmth his laughter and his eyes sparkling when i twisted a phrase to mean something entirely new and naughty i remembered the way he made me feel needed appreciated for who and what i was never having to apologize for it and the contentment i found in sharing ourselves wed been happy together it had been great and i made a good decision nick i pulled away my eyes opening when his hand brushed my cheek you left i got myself together i wont go back to where we were his eyes went wide in the low light i never left you not really not in my heart i took a breath and let it go you werent there when i needed you i said you were somewhere else stealing something his expression went empty and a flash of anger pressed my lips together daring him to deny it you lied to me about where you were going and what you were doing and you took jenkss son with you you turned him into a thief with your promises of wealth and excitement how could you do that to jenks nicks eyes were emotionless i told him it was a dangerous job and it didnt pay well to a pixy you live like a king i snapped feeling my heartbeat quicken the familiar bond is broken we can start over no i shifted from him feeling the betrayal again damn him you cant be part of my life anymore youre a thief and a liar and i cant love you i can change he said and i groaned with disbelief i have changed he said so earnestly that i thought he might believe he had when this is over ill go back to cincinnati ill get a noon to midnight job ill buy a dog get cable tv ill stop it all for you rachel his hands went out and took mine and i looked at my fingers cradled between his long pianist hands damaged and raw but sensitive enfolding mine as his arms had once protected me kept me alive when i was bleeding my life out i love you that much he whispered my head pounded and he brought my fingers to his lips and kissed them let me try dont throw this second chance away i couldnt seem to get enough air no i said voice low so it wouldnt tremble i cant do this you wont change you might believe you can and maybe you will but in a month a year youll find something and then it will be just one more rayray then ill stop forever i cant live like that my throat was tight and i couldnt swallow i pulled my eyes to his reading in his shocked expression that he had been about to say that right now that he still wanted to walk away from this with money in his pocket that he may have meant everything hed said but also wanted to convince me to put my ivys and jenkss life on the line for money he was still running his damn snatch even while knowing that if the statue wasnt destroyed it would put my life in jeopardy betrayal bubbled up making my stomach clench i have a good life i said feeling his grip on my fingers loosen it doesnt include you anymore nicks jaw clenched and he drew back but it includes ivy he said bitterly shes hunting you shes going to make you her toy its always the thrill of the hunt for vampires thats all and once she gets you shell drop you and move on to someone new thats enough i said my voice harsh it was my greatest fear and he knew it he smiled bitterly shes a vampire she cant be trusted i know shes killed people she uses them and abandons them thats what they do i was shaking in anger kistens bracelet hung heavy on me like a sign of ownership she only takes blood from people who freely give it and she doesnt abandon them i shouted unable to keep my voice down she never left me nicks face went hard at the accusation i may be a thief he insisted but i never hurt anyone who didnt deserve it even by accident my breath was fast and i stood he looked up at me his face rigid with frustration you hurt me i said a hopeless look flashed across him he reached for my hands and i stepped back so shes a vampire i said loudly im a witch what makes you any safer what about you nick you call up demons what did you give that demon for the location of thatthing shock flashed over him for my having turned this on him clearly uncomfortable he glanced at my bag on the floor and eased away nothing important he wouldnt look at me and my predatory instincts stirred what did you give the demon i prompted jax said you gave him something nick took a quick breath his eyes met mine rachel i thought you were dead a cold feeling of worry slid through me jax had said the demon showed up as me had the demon known about me or just plucked my image out of nicks head what demon was it i asked thinking of newt the insane demon who shoved me back into reality last solstice was it al i said softly seething inside no it was someone else he said looking sullen al didnt know where it was someone else okay nick knew more than one demon what did you give it for the location of the focus i asked trying to at least look calm nicks eyes lit up and he scooted forward on the cot thats just it rachel al always wanted useless stuff like what your favorite color was or if you used lip gloss but all this one wanted was a kiss the air slipped out of me and i couldnt seem to make my lungs move to pull more in nick gave al information about me in return for favors all it wanted was a kiss i managed still trying to grasp what nick had done id feel betrayed later right now i only felt sick hand on my stomach i turned sideways had the demon looked like me when nick kissed it oh god i didnt want to know what somehow i took a breath what demon was it i asked knowing he wouldnt be able to tell me without risking his soul sure enough nick stood up his hands spread placatingly i dont know i went through al for that one he took his own cut for brokering my question but it was worth it i turned and nick blinked at the fury creasing my brow you son of a bitch i whispered youve been selling me out to demons youve been buying demon favors with information about me what did you tell them eyes wide nick backed up rachel my breath hissed out in a quick motion i leapt at him pinning him against the door with my arm under his neck what did you tell al about me its not that big of a deal his eyes were bright and what looked like a laugh was quirking his lips he thought it was funny he thought i was overreacting and it was all i could do to not crush his windpipe right there and then just stupid stuff he was saying his voice high but light your favorite ice cream what color your eyes are after a shower how old you were when you lost your virginity god rachel i didnt tell him anything that could hurt you outraged i pushed into his neck then rebounded to stand two steps away how could you do that to me i whispered nick rubbed his throat and moved from the door trying to hide that id hurt him i dont know why youre so upset he said sullenly you wouldnt believe the information i got in return i didnt tell him anything important until i thought you were dead my eyes widened and i reached for the wall before i fell over you were doing this before we broke up his hand still on his throat nick looked at me his own anger growing im not stupid i didnt tell him anything important ever what is the big deal with an effort i unclenched my teeth tell me this nick i said did the demon look like me when you kissed it was that part of the deal that you pretended it was me he said nothing my finger trembled as i pointed to the door get out the only reason im not handing you back to the weres is because they have to see you die and right now im thinking of taking the pretend part out if you ever tell another demon anything about me illill do something bad to you nick so help me god ill do something very bad furious i yanked the heavy side door open the sound of the metal scraping shocked through me god he had been buying demon magic and favors with information about me for months even while we were together rachel get out my voice was low in threat and i didnt like the sound of it at the scuff of his feet hitting the pavement i shoved the door shut breath held i clasped my arms about myself and just stood there my head hurt and the tears welled up but i wasnt going to cry damn him damn him to hell twentytwo miserable i wouldnt leave the van afraid if i saw ivy or jenks i would blurt out what nick had done some of my reticence was because i needed him to finish this run and if they leaned on him hard he might leave some of it was shame for having trusted him hell most of it was nick had betrayed me on so many levels and he didnt even get why i was upset i hadnt been prepared for this god what an ass i ought to give him back to the weres i whispered but they had to see him die with the focus there was no guarantee that hed stop telling al where i was ticklish or that i sometimes hid the remote from ivy just to get a rise out of her or any of the hundreds of things i had shared with him when i thought i loved him i shouldnt have trusted him but i wanted to trust damn it i deserved to be able to trust someone bastard i muttered wiping my eyes you son of a bitch bastard the chatter of the maids and the thumps of their cart as they wheeled it down the cracked sidewalk were soothing it was past noon and the motel was empty but for us being wednesday it would likely stay that way i lay curled up on the cot my head on the clean smell of the borrowed hotel pillow and my shoulders covered by the thin car blanket i wasnt crying i was not crying tears were leaking out as i waited for the ugly feelings to fade but i wasnt crying damn it sniffing loudly i reassured myself that i wasnt my head hurt and my chest hurt and i knew if i cared to unclench my hands from the blanket clutched under my chin that they would be trembling so i lay there and wallowed falling into a light doze as the heat of the day warmed the van i barely heard the sound of jenks and jax returning to the room but the shout filtering through the open door jerked me awake i thought he was with you ivy shouted where is he jenkss response was unheard and i jumped at the hammering on the van door sitting up i put my sock feet on the floor drained of emotion nick ivy shouted get your ass out here numb i stood grabbed the sliding door and pulled it back with a crunch of metal to look at ivy with bleary empty eyes ivys anger froze her eyes almost black as she scanned the van and saw me hunched under my blanket the fog had lifted and a cold breeze shifted the tips of her sinblack hair shimmering in the light behind her jenks lingered in the doorway to the motel room jax on his shoulder six bags with colorful logos in his grip and a question high in his eyes hes not here i said keeping my voice low so it wouldnt rasp oh god ivy whispered youve been crying where is he what did he do to you the protective tone in her voice hit me hard miserable i turned away my arms about my middle she followed me in the van unmoving when her weight hit it im fine i said feeling stupid he i took a deep breath and looked at my hands perfect and unmarked my soul was black but my body was perfect hes been telling al stuff about me in return for favors he what jenks was suddenly beside her jax did you know about this he said tightly the depth of his anger looking wrong on his youthful features no dad the small pixy said i only watched the one time ivys face was pale ill kill him where is he im killing him right now i took a breath more grateful than i probably should have been that they would defend me like this maybe i was just trusting the wrong people no you arent i said and jenks jiggled on his feet clearly wanting to protest he didnt tell al anything too bad rache jenks yelped you cant defend him he sold you out my head jerked up im not defending him i exclaimed but we need him alive and cooperative the weres have to see him die along with thatthing i said nudging my bag with a foot ill think about beating him to a pulp later i looked up at ivys blank expression im going to use him then cut him lose and if he ever does anything like that to me again i didnt need to finish the thought jenks shifted from foot to foot clearly wanting to take things into his own hands where is he the pixy asked grimfaced my breath came and went i dont know i told him to go away go ivy exclaimed and i made a wry face out of the van hell be back i still have the statue depressed i stared at the floor jenks hopped out of the van and the light coming in brightened ill find him bring his punkass back here its been a while since wetalked my head came up jenksi warned and he held up a hand ill behave he said gaze darting over the parking lot and to the nearby bar his face frighteningly hard i wont even let him know you told us what he did to you ill pick out a movie from the front office on the way back and we can watch it all nice and friendly like thanks i whispered my head was down and i didnt hear him leave but i looked up when jaxs wings clattered and found them gone ivy was watching me and when i shrugged she shut the door to seal out the cold air the sound of the metal on metal struck through me and i gathered myself into some semblance of order ivy hesitated looking torn between wanting to comfort me and afraid id take it the wrong way and there was the blood thing too it had only been a day since she had sated it but it had been a very stressful day today wasnt looking any easier i looked at the matted throw rug wondering what kind of person i was afraid to hug my friends and sleeping with people who used me ill be okay i said to the floor rachel im sorry my throat hurt i put my elbows on my knees set my head into my cupped hand and closed my eyes i dont know maybe it was my fault for trusting him i never dreamed he would do something like this i sniffed loudly whats wrong with me ivy i was disgusted with myself the emotion edging into selfpity and i met her gaze in surprise when ivy whispered theres nothing wrong with you yeah i shot back and she went to the vans tiny sink and plugged in the electric kettle lets take a look at my track record i live in a church with a vampire who is the scion of a master vampire who would just as soon see me dead saying nothing ivy got out an envelope of cocoa so old it was stiff with moisture i date her old boyfriend i continued bitterly who used to be said master vampires scion and my exboyfriend is a professional thief who calls demons and trades information about me for tips to steal artifacts that can start an inderland power struggle theres something wrong when you trust people who can hurt you so badly its not that bad ivy turned with the chipped mug in her hand head down as she broke chunks of cocoa against the side of the mug with an old spoon not that bad i said with a bark of laughter its been hidden for five thousand years piscary is going to be majorly pissed along with every master vampire in every city on the entire freaking planet if we dont do this right theyre all going to be rapping on my door i wasnt talking about that i meant about you trusting people who can hurt you i flushed suddenly wary of her standing over there at the end of the van in the dark oh the water from the kettle started to steam blurring her features as it rose you need the thrill rachel oh god i stiffened glancing at the closed door ivys posture shifted irritably and she flowed into motion get off it she said setting the mug on the tiny counter space and unplugging the kettle theres nothing wrong with that ive watched you ever since we partnered in the is every guy who tried to date you you drove away when you found out the danger was only in your imagination what has that got to do with nick selling me out to a demon i said my voice a shade too loud for prudence you trusted him when you shouldnt have so you could find a sense of danger she said her expression angry and yes it hurts that he betrayed that trust but thats not going to stop you from looking for it again youd better start picking where you find your thrills a little better or its going to get you killed flustered i put my back to the wall of the van what in hell are you talking about ivy turned to face me being alive isnt enough for you she said you need to feel alive and you use the thrill of danger to get it you knew nick dealt in demons yes he overstepped his bounds when he traded information about you to them but you were willing to risk it because the danger turned you on and once you get over the pain youre going to trust the wrong person againjust so you can find a jolt in that it might all go bad i was afraid to speak the scent of cocoa rose as she poured hot water into the mug afraid she might be right i considered it looking over my past it would explain a lot all the way back to high school no no freaking way i do not need a feeling of danger to get turned on i protested hotly im not saying thats bad she said neutrally youre a threat and you need the same i know because i live it all vampires do thats why we keep to our own but for cheap thrills and onenight stands anyone less a risk than ourselves isnt enough to keep up keep around keep alive or understand only those born to it are capable of understanding and you i didnt like this i didnt like it at all i have to go i said shifting my weight to stand the palm of her hand flashed out hitting the side of the van to bar my way and stop me cold face it rachel she said when i looked up frightened youve never been the safe nice girl next door despite everything you do to be that person thats why you joined the is and even there you didnt fit in because knowing it or not you were a possible threat to everyone around you people sense it on some level i see it all the time the dangerous are attracted by the lure of an equal and the weak are afraid then they avoid you or go out of their way to make your life miserable so youll leave and they can continue deluding themselves that theyre safe you trusted nick knowing he might betray you you got off on the risk i swallowed a surge of denial remembering the misery of high school and my history with bad boyfriends not to mention my idiotic decision to join the is and then my even more idiotic attempt to quit when denon started giving me crap runs and the thrill was taken away i knew i liked dangerous men but saying it was because i was equally dangerous was ludicrousor would have been if i hadnt just spent yesterday as a wolfwitch hybrid courtesy of a demon curse that my blood kindled and i now sat in a brandnew rachel skin with no freckles or wrinkles so youre a threat ivy said the scent of cocoa rising between us as she sat on the boxes across from me so you need the rush of possible death to keep your soul awake and turn you on thats not bad it just says youre one powerful bitch whether you know it or not tilting forward she handed me the chipped mug dangerous doesnt always equal untrustworthy drink your cocoa and get over it then find someone to trust whos worth trusting you back jaw clenched i looked at the mug in my grip it was for me i had made her cocoa the night piscary had raped her mind body and soul i pulled my eyes up her tight jeans and her long shapeless black sweater that hung midthigh thats why i wait she whispered when our eyes met i took a hasty breath when i realized the unseen scar beneath my new skin was tingling ivy must have sensed it for she stood im sorry she said reaching for the door ivy wait what shed told me scared me and i didnt want to be alone i had to figure this out maybe she was right oh god was i really that screwed up her long fingers gripped the handle ready to pull the door open the van stinks of us both she said not looking at me i should be good for a few days more but the stressive got to get out of here im sorrydamn it she took a deep breath im sorry but i cant comfort you without my blood lust getting in the way she looked up at me her smile faint and carrying old pain not much of a friend am i without getting up i fumbled my fingers past the curtain of the window above me and pushed the bottom out to open it my heart pounded and i took in the pinescented air and hush of the passing traffic youre a good friend does that help i asked in a small voice ivy shook her head come back to the room jenks will drag nick in soon we can all watch a movie and pretend nothing happened it should be tremendously awkward tons of fun ill be fine as long as i dont sit next to you her expression was calm but she sounded bitter my face scrunched up and i curved my fingers around the warmth of the cocoa i didnt know what to think but i was very sure i didnt want nick to know he had made me cry you go ill come in when my eyes arent so red i felt a sense of loss when ivy stepped out of the van and then turned with her arms about her in the chill it was obvious she knew the longer i stayed out here the harder it was going to be for me to find the courage to come in dont you have a complexion charm she asked they dont work on bloodshot eyes i hedged damn it what was wrong with me ivy squinted in the glare and sharp breeze then her face brightened i know she said coming back in and slamming the door shut behind her to seal out the cold i watched her push aside the front curtain and rummage in the console her eyes had returned to normal the fresh air doing as much as the shift in topics kisten probably has one in here she muttered then turned with a tube of what looked like lipstick tada tada huh i pulled myself straighter as she maneuvered around the clutter and sat on the cot beside me lipstick i said not used to having her that close no you put it under your eyes and the vapors keep the pupil constricted itll take the red out too kist uses it for hangoversamong other things oh i abruptly felt twice as unsure not having known there was such a thing i had always trusted a vampires pupils to give away their mood legs crossed at the knees she uncapped it and twisted until a column of opaque gel rose close your eyes and look up my lips parted i can put it on a puff of annoyance came from her if you put on too much or get it too close to your eye you can damage your vision before it wears off i told myself i was being stupid she looked okay she wouldnt have come back in if she wasnt ivy wanted to do something for me and if she couldnt give me a hug without her blood lust tainting it then by god i would let her put that gunk under my eye okay i said resettling myself and looking up you need the thrill of danger flitted through my mind and i quashed it ivy shifted closer and i felt a light touch under my right eye close your eyes she said softly her breath stirring a curl my pulse quickened but i did and my other senses kicked in stronger the gel smelled like clean laundry and i stifled a shudder when a cold sensation moved under my eye you ah dont use this a lot do you i asked starting when her finger touched my nose kisten uses it when he works she said shortly she sounded finedistracted and calm i dont i think its cheating oh i seemed to be saying that a lot today the cot shifted when she moved back and away from me i lowered my head and blinked several times the vapors leaving a stinging sensation that i couldnt imagine was making my eyes any less red its working she said with a small contented smile answering my question before i asked it i thought it would on witches but i wasnt sure she motioned me to look at the ceiling again so she could finish and i lifted my chin and closed my eyes thank you i said softly my thoughts becoming more conflicted and confused ivy had said vampires only bothered to get to know people as powerful as themselves it sounded lonely and dangerous and it made perfect sense she was looking for that mix of danger and trustworthiness was that why she put up with my crap she was looking to find that in me a ribbon of angst pulled through me and i held my breath so ivy wouldnt sense it in my exhalation that i needed danger to feel passion was ridiculous it wasnt true but what if she was right ivy had once said that sharing blood was a way to show deep affection loyalty and friendship i felt that way about her but what she wanted from me was so far from what i understood that i was afraid she wanted to share with me something so complex and intangible that the shallow emotional vocabulary of human and witch didnt have the words or cultural background to define it she was waiting for me to figure it out and i lumped it all with sex because i didnt understand a tear slipped from under my eyelid at ivys loneliness her need for emotional reassurance and her frustrations that though i could understand what she wanted i was afraid to find out if i had the capacity to meet her halfway to trust her and my breath caught when she wiped the moisture away with a careful finger unaware that it was for her my heart pounded the underside of my other eye grew cold and she leaned away breath shallow with the thoughts pinging through me i looked down blinking profusely there was the click of ivy putting the top on the tube and she gave me a guarded smile i felt poised on the chance to make tomorrow vastly different from today and a pulse of emotion struck through me unexpected and heady maybe i should listen to those who were my closest kin in terms of my soul i thought maybe i should trust those willing to trust me back there you go ivy said not knowing that lightning was falling through my thoughts realigning them to make space for something new i looked at her beside me her legs crossed at her knees while she lifted the front curtain to toss the tube to the front seat in a thoughtless motion she reached out and smeared a pinky under my eye to even it out the scent of clean laundry wafted up my god she whispered her brown eyes on her work your skin is absolutely perfect its really beautiful rachel her hand dropped and my gut tightened she gathered herself and stood and i heard myself say dont go ivy jerked to a stop she turned with an exaggerated slowness her posture wiretight as she stared im sorry she said her voice as numb as her face i shouldnt have said that i turned my lips in to moisten them heart pounding i dont want to be afraid anymore her eyes flashed to black a spike of adrenaline pulled through me to set my heart racing ivy fumbled behind her her face paling when she found herself on unfamiliar territory i need to leave she said as if trying to convince herself feeling unreal i reached out and shut the window drawing the curtain i dont want you to i couldnt believe i was doing this but i wanted to know i had lived my life not knowing why i never fit in and with her simple explanation i had both found an answer and a cure i was lost and ivy wanted to kick the rocks from my path i couldnt read the words but ivy would set my fingers to trace the letters to redefine my world if she was right my hidden threat had made me a pariah among those i would love but i could find understanding among my strengthcrippled kin if that meant i needed to find another way to show someone that i cared maybe i should hide my fears until ivy could silence them she trusted me maybe it was time i trusted her ivy saw my decision her face stilling when her instincts hit her hard this isnt right she said dont make me be the one to say no i cant do it so dont a thread of fear slid through me turning into a sliver of delicious tension to settle deep in my groin and tingle my skin god what was i doing i felt her will battle her desires and i watched her eyes finding no fear in their absolute blackness i was covered in her scent mine was laced about the van like silk scarves mixing with hers teasing luring promising piscary was too far away to interfere the chance might never come again youre confused she said holding herself carefully unmoving and still my lips tingled when i licked them i am confused im not afraid i am she breathed and her dark lashes drooped to rest atop her pale cheeks i know how this ends ive seen it too many times rachel youve been hurt and arent thinking clearly when its done youll say it was a mistake her eyes opened i like how everything is ive spent the better part of a year convincing myself that id rather have you as a friend who wont let me touch her than someone i touched only to frighten away please tell me to leave adrenaline coursed to settle deep i stood out of breath my thoughts lit upon the dating guide she had given me and the sensations both exquisitely alluring and darkly terrifying that she had pulled from me before i learned what not to do the idea flitted through me that i was manipulating her even now knowing that she couldnt best her drives when someone was willing i could manipulate ivy to any end and it sent a surge of anticipatory terror through me standing before her i shook my head tell me why she whispered her face creased in a deep pain as if feeling herself starting to slip into a place she had been both fearing and wanting to go because youre my friend i said voice trembling because you need this i added relief showed in the depths of her eyes black in the dim light not enough i want to show you so badly that it aches she said her voice a gray ribbon but i wont do this if you cant admit its for you as much as me if you cant then its not worth having i stared in a near panic for what she was asking me to come to grips with i didnt even know what to call the emotions that were making my eyes warm with unshed tears and my body long for something i didnt understand seeing my frightened silence she turned away her long fingers gripped the handle to open the door and i stiffened seeing everything dissolve to become an embarrassing incident that would forever widen the chasm between us panicked i said because i want to trust you because i do trust you because i want this her hand fell from the door as my pulse thundered i saw her fingers tremble knowing she heard the truth in my voice even as i accepted it she felt it she smelled it in the air with her incredible senses and her even more incredible brain that could decipher it why are you doing this to me she said to the door why now she turned her haunted eyes shocking me breath shallow i stepped closer reaching out but hesitating i dont know what to do i said i hate feeling stupid please do something she didnt move a tear had slipped from her and i reached to wipe it away ivy jerked catching me about the wrist her fingers were stark next to the black gold of kistens bracelet their long whiteness covering my demon mark i stifled my instinctive jerk going pliant when she pulled me close leading my hand to the small of her back this isnt right she whispered our bodies not touching but for her hair mingling with mine and my arm around her waist and her grip on my wrist so make it work i said and the brown ring about her eye shrank she took the air deep into her closing her eyes and scenting the possibilities of what i would and wouldnt do her eyes were black when they opened the last sliver of brown gone youre afraid im not afraid of you im afraid i wont be able to forget im afraid it will change me ivys lips parted it will she breathed inches away i shivered and closed my eyes then help me not be afraid until i understand her fingers lightly touched my shoulder and i jumped eyes flashing open something shifted i took a breath then gasped when she slid into motion i staggered backwardher one hand gripping my shoulder the other still holding my wrist behind herand she followed until my back hit the wall eyes wide and fixed to hers i held my breath unwilling to object id seen this before god id lived it expression intent ivys unchecked blood lust struck a chord and made my blood pound her fingers pressing into me grew firmer and her breath quickened i told myself this was what i wanted believing it accepting it dont be afraid she breathed as she held herself poised im not i lied a tremble shaking me oh god it was going to happen if you are youll trigger paralysis its not under my conscious control and its triggered from your fear her gaze broke from mine and i felt a delicious dropping sensation plink through me when she looked at my neck i closed my eyes as a slurry of bliss and fear rose inside me i took in the feeling of her being so close accepting it did i need danger to remember i was alive was it wrong did it matter if no one but me cared head bowed ivy leaned close please dont be afraid she said her words a tingle against my skin to pulse deeper i want you to be able to touch me backif you want to her last words sounded lost and alone afraid to risk the hurt again my eyes flashed open ivy i pleaded i told you this is all i can give she moved and my words froze when she put a finger to my lips its enough ivys featherlight touch sent a spark of adrenaline through me i took a clean breath when the weight of her finger fell away i exhaled and her free hand slipped into the narrow space between the wall of the van and the small of my back my eyes shut as her fingers pressed into me pulling me forward breath shaking i locked my knees wise to the sudden rush that would send me tumbling down i felt emotion rise knowing she was experiencing it too ivy i sounded frightened and she pushed my hair aside whispering how ive wanted this her lips brushing the smooth skin under my ear the warm dampness of her breath made me shiver at the mix of the familiar and the unknown with a soft exhalation she shifted her head and her lips found my collarbone teasingly shy of my old scar tendrils pulsed in time with my heart building on the ones before to an unseen height oh god save me from myself tension pulled my eyes open when her fingers traced a trail down my neck sensation blossomed and i threw my head back and sucked in the air her arm slipped around my waist catching me before i fell rachel igod you smell good she said and a torrent of heat flowed through me as her lips brushed against me with her words the smoothness of her teeth across my skin sent my pulse pounding as i fought for breath you wont leave she asked promise you wont she wasnt asking me to be her scion she was only asking me not to leave i wont leave you give this to me shaking inside i whispered yes ivy exhaled sounding as if she had been freed my blood rose mixing with my lingering fear of the unknown to drive her to a fever pitch her lips touched my lower neck and vertigo spun the room burning tracings of desire to settle deep and low in me i exhaled into the promise of more to come calling it to me i breathed it in like smoke the rising passion starting a feeling of abandonment inside i didnt care anymore if it was right or wrong it just was her grip on my shoulder tightened and slowly there was a gentle pressure upon my skin and her teeth slid into me without preamble i groaned at the rush of fear and desire my knees gave way and ivy shifted her hold her touch was lightkeeping me upright while i went flaccid my body struck into overloadbut her mouth on my neck was savage with a fierce need and then she pulled on me my air came in a rush gasping i stiffened my hands springing up to clutch at her clenching when she threatened to pull away in fear that she had hurt me no i moaned fire running through me dont stop ohgod my words hit her and she dug her teeth into me harder my breath exploded for an instant i hung unable to think it felt that good my entire body was alive and aching a sexual high flowed through me a torrent of promise somehow i took a breath then another they were fast stumbling over each other i clutched at her wanting her to continue but unable to say it her lips pulled away from me and in a rush of sensation the world spun back into something i could recognize we had moved from the wall of the van and stood against the closed door ivy was holding me upright against her with the fierce demand of possession though she had taken her lips from me her breath came and went on my broken skin almost an exquisite torture there was no fear ivy i said hearing it come from me as almost a sob and with that small encouragement that everything was okay she bowed her head to me again her mouth finding me to draw from me both my blood and my volition i tried to breathe failing i clutched her to me tears slipping from under my closed eyes it was as if her soul was liquid fire and i could feel her aura swirling about mine she wasnt just taking my blood she was taking my aura but i wouldnt miss what she could steal and i wanted to give it to her to coat her in a small part of me and protect her her needs made her so fragile the vampire pheromones rose like a drug making her teeth into spikes of arousal my fingers spasmed and my rough touch sparked through her she lunged into me again her teeth bringing me to a gasping stiffness i couldnt think and i held her to me frantic shed leave through our auras mixing i could sense her desperate need her want for security her desire for satisfaction her unearthly hunger for my blood knowing that even if i gave it freely she would be haunted by shame and guilt compassion swirled from nowhere in the high i was lost in she needed me she needed me to accept her for what she was and when i realized that i had it within myself to give her at least this small part of me the last of my fear melted away my eyes opened unseeing on the wall of the van i trusted her i thought as the edges of our auras blurred into one and the last of my barriers began to fall and ivy knew the instant they did a soft sound came from her delight and wonder as she held my head unmoving and her lips worried my neck her hand slipped lower until it found my waist her long fingers hesitated and while she pulled harder to make a silver spike dive through me her cool palm slipped under my shirt to brush my middle fingertips searching i jerked and she followed me ivy i heaved a new fear slicing through the ecstasy wait but i thought she whispered her voice a dark heat and her hand went unmoving you said the blood was enough i continued hovering near panic trying to focus but finding it hard to open my eyes my heart was pounding i couldnt get enough air and i couldnt find the desire to push her away i blinked wavering when i realized she was entirely supporting my weight icant i misunderstood she said cradling my head against the hollow between her shoulder and her neck the touch of her hand upon my neck grew firmer losing its gentle feeling to become dominating im sorry do you want me to stop entirely a hundred thoughts dropped through me of how stupid i was of how vulnerable i had made myself of the risk i was taking of the future i was mapping for myself of the glorious adrenaline rush she was taking me on no i breathed lost in the thought of what it would feel like to bury my face in the hollow between her ear and neck and return the favor a low sigh of pleasure rose soft and almost unheard and her hand slid from my shoulder to find my back pressing me closer she pulled on me again i gasped my hands clutching at her as i imagined the warmth of my blood filling her knowing how it would taste knowing how it filled the terrible hollow her future as an undead bestowed upon her i jerked wiretight as teeth drove into me again the desire to respond in kind and the need to hold back touched every part of me alight oh god the twin emotions of denial and desire were going to kill me so intense i couldnt tell if they were pain or pleasure ivys breath on my skin grew ragged and my muscles loosened when the last of my fear slipped from me and like the ting of a bell faded to nothing she held me upright her grip now devoid of any tenderness while her teeth dug deeper and the hunger pooled into her filling old chasms pulling on me to take the blood i willingly gave her i took a shuddering breath feeling the vamp pheromones soak into me soothing luring promising a high like no other it was addictive but i was beyond caring i could give ivy this i could accept what she gave in return and as she held me upright and filled her body with my blood and her soul with my aura tears slipped from me ivy i whispered breathlessly as the room spun with vertigo im sorry i took so long to listen she didnt answer and i groaned when she jerked me against her her mouth becoming deliciously savage sending jolts through me as she searched for more both of us lost in a haze of fulfillment but faint in the back of my thoughts a warning stirred something had changed her touch wasnt careful it had becomeharsh my eyes opened and i stared unseeing at the dark wall of the van as my pulse went thready it was getting hard to think around the swirl of intoxicating elation my breath was ragged from a heavy lethargy not passion she was taking too much and i moved my hand from where it was holding her shoulder to gently push her away and see her eyes it wasnt much of a push but ivy felt it her grip on me tightened turning painful even through the vamp pheromones my thoughts pinged back to her tenderness before i reaffirmed it would only be blood we sharedand terror struck through me god help me i had asked her to take the softer emotions of love away i had asked her to divorce herself from the caring and love kisten said she shackled her blood lust withwhich only left hunger she wasnt going to stop she had lost herself fear scoured through me she tasted it on the air and without a sound she jerked me off balance crying out i fell ivy followed and we landed together against the tiny counter ivy let go i exclaimed then moaned when she bit deeper until it hurt adrenaline surged i fought to get free and ivys grip broke she fell away and breathing heavily i held my hand to my bleeding throbbing neck and stared at her her look was knowing like that of a predator and as ecstasy pounded through me in time with my heartbeat my legs gave out and i slid helplessly to the floor ivy stood above me my blood red within her mouth she looked like a goddessabove all law both of the mind and soul her eyes were black and she smiled without memory knowing that i was hers to do with what she wanted with no concept of right or wrong ivy was gone controlled by the hunger i forced her to feel without the buffer of love oh god i had killed myself i saw her thought to finish this an instant before she moved ivy no i exclaimed putting up an arm to fend her off it did no good i shrieked when she fell on me it was every nightmare come true i was helpless as she pinned my shoulders to the floor of the van i took a breath to scream but it turned into a moan of passion when she found my neck a feeling of silver ice cracked through me ecstasy brought me to a heaving archedback pose for an instant before i fell gasping for air we settled against the floor again as one her hair falling soft about my throat in a silken brush as she buried her teeth deep and pulled once more moaning i hung in a haze of pain fear and elation her teeth inside me both fire and ice i stared at the ceiling focus gone while the heavy lethargy of paralysis filled my veins and exquisite rapture struck me alight even as i lost the will to move ivy had done as i asked she had abandoned her feelings of love and was out of control and as she let go of my arms to pull my neck to her mouth i floated in realization that had come too late i had asked her to change for me and i was going to die for my temerity and stupidity a seeping numbness filled me my pulse went faint and my limbs went cold i was going to die i was going to die because i was afraid to admit i might love ivy i felt the distant thump as my hand fell from ivy to hit the dirtcaked rug it echoed through me coming again and again growing in strength as if it was my failing heartbeat someone was shouting distantly but it paled in importance next to the glimmers of light that rimmed the edge of my sight mimicking the exquisite sparkles in my mind and body i exhaled as ivy took everything shivering as my aura slipped from me along with my blood ivy was the only warm thing in the world and i wished she would press closer so i wouldnt die cold the thumping of my heart seemed to hesitate at the frightening sound of metal tearing cold and light spilled over us and i moaned when ivy pulled away from me ivy jenks shouted and i realized that the thumping hadnt been my heart but jenks pounding at the back door what are you doing shes mine ivy snarled unreal and savage i couldnt move there was a thundering bump and the van rocked the air flashed cold and i whimpered i hunched into myself pulling my knees to my chest my fingers went warm at the blood coming from me as i found my neck then cold i was alone ivy was gone someone was shouting you stupid stupid vampire bitch he exclaimed you promised you promised me i clutched in upon myself squinting in the cold shivering violently as i looked out the back of the van something had happened i was cold it was bright ivy was gone there was the snap of dragonfly wings jenks i breathed eyes slipping shut its me ms morgan jaxs higher voice said and i felt the warm wash of pixy dust over my fingers clamped to my neck tinks knickers youre bleeding yourself out but ivy was crying forcing my thoughts out of the dark van and into the sun rachel ivy shouted panic in her voice oh god rachel there was the ting of metal scraping and a scuffle of feet get back jenks demanded and i heard ivy cry out in pain you cant have her i told you id kill you if you hurt her shes bleeding ivy begged let me help i managed to crack my eyes i was on the floor of the van the scent of the matted green rug pressing into me musty and sharp i could smell blood and cocoa shivering i tried to see past the bright glare of the sun dont move ms morgan jax said intently and i struggled to comprehend my fingers were both warm and cold from my blood there was another scrape of metal on stone and i pulled my eyes to it trying to focus the back of the van was open jenks was standing between ivy and me her long sword in his hand ivy was hunched and holding her bleeding arm tears dampening her cheeks with desperate sorrow my eyes met her panicked ones and she lunged for me jenks blurred into motion ivys katana slashing she fell away sprawling to roll on the pavement as she scrambled to remain out of his reach my pulse leapt in fear when he followed the sword clanging into the pavement three times always an instant after she moved my god he was fastand i think it was only his desire to stay between her and me that kept him from following to give a killing stroke jenks get out of my way she cried as she rolled to her feet with her hands raised placatingly she needs me she doesnt need you he snarled you almost killed her you stupid vampire you couldnt wait to get out from piscarys influence could you you seduced her and then almost killed her you could have killed her it wasnt like that ivy pleaded crying now let me get to her i can help why the hell do you care there was another clang of stone and metal and i forced myself to breathe when my vision started to go black rachel ivy cried drawing my gaze to her im sorry i didnt know this would happen i thought i was better i really did im sorry im sorry jenks made a fierce cry lunging ivy sprang back arms pinwheeling he followed her down and the two froze when she landed against the pavement blood leaked from between her fingers clenched about her upper arm and my heart seemed to hesitate when jenks ended his last sword swing inches from her throat fighting my numb daze i dragged myself to the door he was going to kill her he had killed before to save my life he was going to kill ivy jenks stood with his feet widespread and his stance terrible you stupid selfish whore of a vampire he intoned you said you wouldnt you promised now youve ruined everything you couldnt accept what she could give so you took it all i didnt ivy sprawled in the sun with her sword at her throat the sun glinting on it and her tears i told her no i told her to stop she wept she asked me to she wouldnt ask for this he spat jerking the sword so it touched her white skin to leave a line of red you ruin everything you love everything you screwedup bitch but ill be damned before i let you ruin rachel ivys eyes darted to mine her face tearstreaked and terrified her mouth moved but no words came out my gut twisted when i saw her accept his words as truth jenks held the sword to her throat he was going to use it and ivy would do nothing to stop him jenks shifted his grip he pulled the sword back ivy looked at me too lost in guilt to do anything no i whispered panicking my grasping fingers reached the edge of the van and feet scrabbling weakly i pushed myself forward jax was in my way shrilling something and his dragonfly wings sparkling in my darkening vision jenks stop i cried out falling out of the van ice hard and cold the pavement hit my shoulder and hip scraping my cheek i took a breath that was more like a cry focusing on the gray pavement as if it was my coming death oh god ivy was going to let jenks kill her rachel there was the clatter of the sword falling and suddenly jenks was there his arms picking me up and cushioning me against the hard ground struggling i focused on him shocked he was so close he didnt like anyone touching him it wasnt her fault i breathed focusing on his eyes they were so green i forgot what i wanted to say my breath sounded harsh and my throat hurt it wasnt her fault shhhh he whispered his brow creasing when i moaned as he hoisted me into his arms and lurched to his feet its going to be all right youre going to be all right shes going to leave you dont have to worry about her again i wont let any vampire hurt you i can do this ill stay big and make sure no one hurts you again itll be okay ill make sure youre safe the vampire saliva was wearing off fast as he carried me i could feel a heavy pain starting to take hold and unconsciousness gather i was cold and shivers shook me jenkss motion stopped and he cradled me close as he stood over ivy his arms filled with a hard tension leave jenks said get your things and go i want you out of the church by the time we get back if you stay youre going to kill her just like everyone else stupid enough to love you a sound broke from her and he walked away pace fast as he headed for the warm darkness of the motel room i couldnt find the air to speak ivys heavy sobs came one after the other i didnt want her to leave oh god i had only wanted to show i trusted her i only wanted to understand herand myself jenkss shadow fell over me and i trembled tears spilled from me as i saw everything crash down to ruin i could hear her crying alone and lost she was going to leave she was going to leave because of what i had asked her to do and as i listened to ivy crying alone and guiltstrewn on the pavement something broke inside i couldnt lie to myself anymore it was going to kill me i asked her to bite me i whispered jenks dont leave her there she needs me i asked her a sob rose in me hurting as it broke free i only wanted to know i didnt think shed lose control like that jenks jerked to a stop under the motel overhang rachel he said bewildered there was the snap of dragonfly wings and i wondered how he could carry me if he was a pixy i couldnt see ivy but her sobs had stopped and i wondered if she had heard me i choked on my harsh breath jenkss shocked eyes were inches from mine i had promised i wouldnt leave and i refused to let her run away in guilt i needed them both i needed ivy i had to know i whispered and jenkss face went panicked please i breathed my vision starting to mercifully darken please get her dont leave her alone my eyes closed i hurt her so badly dont let her be alone i said but i didnt know if it made it into words before i passed out twentythree i was moving and it was confusing the hell out of me i didnt think i was unconscious and i certainly didnt know what was going on but someone had their arms around me and i could smell the sharp scent of chlorophyll piecing together if i was outside with my eyes shut or inside with my eyes open was beyond me i was cold but id been cold for forever i did recognize the dropping sensation followed by a bed pressing into me i tried to speak but failed a wide hand cradled my head and the pillow under it was pulled away i sank deeper into the comforter as someone propped up my knees and tucked the pillow under it stay with me rache came a voice accompanied by the smell of fudge and i tried to remember how to open my eyes hands were on me light and warm dont pass out let me get some water in you first then you can rest my head lolled accompanied by a pulsing pain in my neck the voice had been soft but there was panic under it the thought of water gave me a name to the feeling i couldnt figure out im thirsty yes thats what im feeling i felt sick and my lids fluttered as i hung in a state too fatigued to move i remembered this i had done this before wheres keasley i whispered hearing it come from me in a soft breath of air no one heard me over the sound of running water jax get a straw the intent voice said in the trash by the tv there was the sound of cellophane crackling and someone moved my legs to wedge another pillow under them it was as if a veil dropped away and suddenly everything had meaning my eyes opened and reality realigned itself i was in the motel room i was on the bed with my feet propped higher than my head i was cold jenks had carried me in and that winged spot of sunshine hovering by the tv was jax oh god i had asked ivy to bite me taking a deep breath i tried to sit up jenks abruptly had his hands on me pressing my shoulder down hes got big hands i thought trying to focus and warm not so fast he said can you swallow my eyes flicked to the plastic cup in his hand i licked my lips i wanted it but my neck hurt it hurt bad wheres ivy i slurred jenkss expression closed i focused on his green eyes while the edges of my sight grayed nausea tightened my gut kisten said she had forgotten control while under piscarys ungentle touch possibly killing people in the throes of blood passion id thought she was better kisten said she was better she looked better apparently by asking her to divorce her feelings of love from her hunger id taken away what she had used to shackle it in three minutes i threw her back into the pit of depravity she had struggled so long to escape i had done it to her me im sorry i said starting to cry and he took both my hands in one of his to stop them from moving upward to my neck i only wanted to understand i didnt mean to tip her over the edge jenks dont be mad at her his fingertips brushed the hair from my forehead but he wouldnt meet my gaze not yet ready to believe though his smooth features looked too young for someone who had adult kids the deepset pain born in understanding said he had endured a lifetime of joy and sorrow let me get some water in you before you pass out he said turning away jax he snapped sounding very unlike himself wheres that straw i dont want her lifting her head which one is hers dad the adolescent pixy said his voice high in worry it doesnt matter just get one the reflected light on the ceiling darkened and from the open door came a hesitant she had the sprite and her cup is the one with all the buttons punched in jax rose three feet in a glittering column of sparkles how about that those plastic dents are of some use after all get the hell out of here jenks said seething the warmth of his fingers slipped from me as he rose to stand above me guilt hit hard and i wanted to curl up and die what had i done i couldnt fix this all id wanted was to understand ivy and now i was lying in a motel room with holes in my neck and my two best friends fighting my life was a pile of shit jenks i whispered stop she wants me here ivy came back with immediately i could tell she was still in the threshold and she sounded desperate it was an accident ill never touch her again i can help i know what to do i bet you do he said snidely putting his hands on his hips now that he was sixfootfour it didnt look as aggressive somehow we dont need you get out i wished they would figure this out so someone would give me some water jax hovered above me a red straw taller than he was in his grip feeling distant and unreal i made my eyes wide so i could focus on him dad the small pixy called worried but they werent listening you little twit ivy snapped it was an accident didnt you hear her i heard her he left me his feet silent on the carpet shell say anything you want now wont she you bound her to you damn it ivy you weakwilled jealous sack of vampire spit you said you could handle this you promised me you wouldnt bite her his shouting was furious and i went even colder what if she had bound me to her would i be able to tell i desperately wanted to turn my head but jax was standing on my nose his bare feet warm the scent of sugar and wax coming from the drop hanging on the end of the straw i wanted it then felt guilty for wanting water when my friends were going to kill each other im not going to tell you again jenks get out of my way there was an intake of breath and jax let out a yelp and darted to the ceiling i heard a grunt followed by a rolling thump adrenaline surged and i pushed myself up then slumped against the headboard neck protesting they were grappling on the floor moving too fast for my bloodstarved brain to follow the small end table had been knocked over and they were a confusing tangle of legs and arms youre a lying manipulative vampbitch whore jenks shouted twisting violently out of her grip she leapt at him from a crouch and the two crashed to the wall jenks moved blindingly fast flowing out from under her grabbing her arm and landing atop her back pinning her to the carpet my god he was quick ow ivy said to the wall abruptly still with jenks atop her her arm held at an awkward angle his other hand held a dagger to her kidneys when had he gotten a dagger damn it jenks she said making a little wiggle get off tell me youre going to leave and not come back he said breath fast and blond hair in disarray or ill break your arm and youre going to stay away from rachel got it and if i see her trying to get to you because you bound her to you ill find you and kill you twice ill do it ivy dont think i cant my mouth went dry and i started to shake i was going into shock my hand pressed to my neck was sticky i wanted to tell them to stop but it was all i could do to stay upright ivy wiggled stiffening when jenks poked her listen to me pixy man she said her face turned to the wall youre quick youre fast and if you stick that into me im going to smack you into the everafter i didnt bind her to me i tried to leave and she asked me to stay she wanted to know damn it jenks she wanted to know focus blurring i tried to pull the bedspread over me my fingers as strong as string accomplishing nothing jenks started at the movement realizing i was upright and watching his angular beautifully savage face lost its emotion you seduced her he said and i dropped my eyes shamed all i had wanted was to understand how could so much go wrong from wanting to understand her cheek pressed against the carpet ivy made a helpless bark of laugher she seduced me she said and i wavered from the pain and blood loss knowing it was the truth i left but she called me back i would have left even then but she said she wanted this for her not for me but for her i told you if she ever admitted that i wouldnt walk away i didnt lie to you my breathing had quickened giving me a feeling of disjoined airiness i was hyperventilating jax was flitting over me trying to dust my bite but only making me squint to see through the sparkles at least i think the sparkles were from him god i hurt i was going to either die or throw up jenks pricked ivys sweater with his knife and she jerked if youre lying to me ivys shoulders lost all their tension and she surrendered visibly i thought i was better she said guilt slamming into me at the pain in her voice i worked so hard jenks i thought id finallyshe didnt wantshe couldnt handle the sex so i tried to separate it from the blood i wanted something of her and she was able to give me the blood ii lost control of the hunger again damn it i almost killed her his eyes on me jenks let go of her arm it hit the floor with a thump ivy slowly pulled it into a more comfortable position you didnt separate the sex from the blood you took the love from it jenks said and i wavered my pulse hammering what had i asked her to do you take that away and all thats left is the hunger my breath came in short splurges as i fought to remain upright did everyone know more about vampires than me jenks was a pixy and he knew more about vampires than i did i tried ivy whispered she doesnt want me to touch her that way she took a shuddering breath broken jenks flicked a glance at me seeing my cold face and realizing that she was telling the truth slowly he slid off her and ivy pulled herself upright knees to her forehead arms wrapped about her shins she took a gasping breath and held it rachel didnt think it was wrong did she jenks pressed she said she was sorry for waiting so long ivy whispered as if she didnt believe it but she saw the hunger jenks she saw it raw and i hurt her with it shes not going to want anything to do with meknowing that it was a very small voice vulnerable and afraid and jenks watched me not her why are you trying to hide what you are he said softly his words for both of us do you think seeing your hunger shocked her do you think shes so shallow that shed condemn you for it that she didnt know it was in you and loved you anyway ivy shook with her head on her knees and tears slipped from me my head hurt and my neck throbbed but it was nothing compared to my heartache she loves you ivy god knows why she made a mistake in asking you to separate the love from the hunger and you made a mistake thinking you could i wanted what she could give me ivy said curled up into herself just that much would have been enough never again she said never never jenks shes safe youre right i destroy everything i touch i struggled to keep from passing out she wasnt a monster ivy her head jerked up her face was white and tracked with tears i thought you were unconscious she said scrambling to her feet and wiping her face blinking i wavered where i sat guilt lay thick on me and jenks sat crosslegged by the open door in a patch of sun a faint sad smile on him she stood in a frozen quandary are you okay she asked clearly wanting to rush over but afraid to between the blood loss and the absurdity of the question i almost laughed uhhuh i said giving up on trying to have this make sense can i have some water i whispered then tipped over my neck sent a stab of pain to shock me and i couldnt breathe my face was buried in the covers i tried to cry out but was helpless damn it even my arms wouldnt work oh god ivy said her hands cold as she pulled me up i took a grateful breath trying to focus through the hurt jenks was at my feet and he tugged them down until i was flat on my back and looking up at them with wide eyes teetering on unconsciousness again now that the adrenaline had played itself out the asinine relief that i had shaved my legs lifted through me and was gone here dad jax offered that red straw in his twofisted grip jenks grabbed that absurdly small cup of water never sloshing it as he retrieved it from the nightstand shes bleeding again he said his voice and face grim dust her dont give her the water yet ivy was a confusing blur as i tried to focus ive got something to put in it struggling to keep from passing out i watched her snatch up her purse and rummage through it my stomach clenched when she brought out a small vial brimstone i whimpered waiting for jenkss protest but all i heard was his soft not so much this time ivys oval face scrunched in anger as she unscrewed the top i know what im doing jenks glared at her shes too weak for what you usually give her she cant eat enough to support that high a metabolism with all the blood you took out of her and you know all about that dont you pixy she said sarcastically so much for playing nice tired i let my eyes shut while they argued hoping i didnt die in the interim and make the problem moot i wasnt ever going to get my water ever rachel it was close and direct startled i opened my eyes jenks was kneeling beside the bed with that cup and straw in his hand ivy was behind him her arms crossed over her chest cheeks spotted with red anger and worry warred in her expression id missed something no brimstone i slurred my hands rising to push it away my throat tightened as my emotions swung from one extreme to the next they were so worried about me jenks furrowed his brow looking too severe for someone so young dont be stupid rache he said catching my arms and easily forcing them down you either take it with brimstone or youll be flat on your ass for four weeks he was swearing i knew i must be doing better i could smell the water i couldnt move my arms under his soft restraint and i felt sick why were they making me do this i looked at the straw and taking that as a yes jenks slipped it between my lips breath held i sucked it down thinking the rusty water tasted better than the last cold beer id had tears started leaking out my emotions thoroughly out of control i thought of ivy doing the same to me bleeding me dry with that same metallic taste of me in her mouth i started to cry choking on the water damn it what in hell was wrong with me thats enough ivy said softly through my watering eyes i saw her reach out in concern her hand touching jenkss shoulder he jumped and ivy pulled away her face full of an inner pain she thought she was a monster she thought she couldnt touch anyone without ruining them and i had proved her right the enormity of her lifes misery fell on me and i started to shake shes going into shock ivy said oblivious to the real reason id hurt her i thought i had been strong enough to survive her and by failing id hurt her jenks set the cup aside and rose ill get a blanket ive got it she said already gone my hands fluttered and i realized i was getting sticky blood all over the bed they were trying to help but i didnt deserve it i wished it had never happened i had made a mistake and they were both being so nice about it another tremor shook me i tried to scrunch up into myself for warmth his green eyes pinched jenks pulled me upright slipping in behind me curving his arms around me he kept me from shaking apart ivy wasnt pleased what are you doing she asked from across the room her lips pressed tight as she shook out a brown motel blanket im keeping her warm jenks smelled like green things his arms wrapped around me and his front pressed into my back my head was spinning and my neck was a hurting ache i knew i shouldnt be sitting up like that but i couldnt remember how to say down i think i was still crying since my face was wet and those noises in the background sort of sounded like me ivy sighed then came forward shes going to pass out if you keep her head up like that she muttered as she draped the blanket over us pixy dust will hold her together for only so long jenks said softly and i dont want jax to be fighting the gravity blood flow when he stitches her up my eyes flashed open stitches crap not again id just gotten rid of my scars wait i said panic bringing me stiff at the thought of what it was going to feel like now that the vampire saliva was dormant no stitches i want my pain amulet they didnt seem to understand me ivy bent close looking at my eyes not me we could take her to emergency from behind me jenks shook his head the weres would track us from there im surprised they havent found us already i cant believe you bit her we have four were packs scenting for our blood and you think now is a good time to change your relationship shut the hell up jenks my stomach turned i wanted my pain amulet i wasnt a brave person id seen the movie where they stitched up the guy with no anesthetic and bailing wire it hurt wheres my amulet i pleaded heart pounding wheres keasley i want keasley ivy pulled away shes going incoherent her brow furrowed wrinkling her usually placid face rachel she said loudly and with exaggerated slowness listen to me you should be stitched just four tiny stitches i didnt rip you it will be okay no i exclaimed my vision darkening i dont have my pain amulet ivy gripped my shoulder through the blanket her eyes were full of compassion dont worry with your head up like this youre going to pass out in about three seconds she was right twentyfour jenks stop picking everything up before you break something i said then drew my hand back from one of the ceramic knickknacks neatly arranged on the store shelves it was a pumpkin with a little cat beside it and it reminded me of rex what grinning jenks tossed three ceramic bells into the air and juggled them i pointed at the handwritten sign with you break it you buy it on it i was tired hungry and my new stitches hidden under my red turtleneck ached cause i was stupid and i deserved to hurt even so the last thing i needed was to pay for broken merchandise jenks watched my mood his roguish smile fading tossing all three up high into the open second story he seriously caught them one by one and set them back where they belonged sorry he said meekly i puffed my air out and touched his shoulder to tell him it was okay between the blood loss and ivys forcefed brimstone i was damn tired hands behind his back jenks continued perusing the shelves looking for a chunk of bone he hadnt found any yesterday and i needed it to finish this run and get the hell home under the disguise amulet jenks looked very different with black hair and a darker complexion he had his new aviator jacket on over the tshirt he had bought in the previous store making him a sexy leggy hunk o pixy ass in jeans no wonder he had fiftyfour kids and matalina smiled like mona lisa married pixy i told myself forcing my eyes back to the shelf of ceramic animals fiftyfour kids beautiful wife sweet as sugar who would kill me in my sleep while apologizing for it jenks wasnt happy about me being out here but when i had woken up at a late three pm and found ivy and nick had taken the bus across the straits to get his truck i had to get out as usual the brimstone had made me hungry and nauseous filling me with a brash stupidity that i was sure came from the upper that made brimstone so popular on the streets seems if you took enough medicinal grade you still got a buzz thanks a hell of a lot ivy it was her fault i was restless moving seemed to help though i knew ivy would disagree i thought it unlikely that the weres would look for us here when it was more likely we had hightailed it to cincinnati but i wasnt going home until this was done i wouldnt take a war back to my streets my neighbors oh wow jenks breathed rachel look at this i turned finding him standing proudly before me with a red and black striped hat on his head the thing must have been a foot tall like a weird top hat thats nice jenks i said im going to get it he said beaming i took a breath to protest then let it out it was on sale five bucks why not my fingers trembled as i sifted through a display of beads trying to decide if they were made of bone id been out here with jenks for an hour and though he was loaded down with fudge tshirts and useless bricabrac only a twelveyearold or a pixy could love i hadnt found anything suitable yet i knew it wasnt smart to be out there but i was a runner damn it and i could take care of myselfas long as i had jenks to back me up anyway that and my splat gun tucked in my shoulder bag loaded with sleepytime charms a smile quirked the corners of my mouth as i watched jenks ogle a rack of plastic dinosaurs he still had that hat on but with his physique the man could wear anything feeling my attention on him he glanced up and away sure he was oohing and ahhing over the trashiest stuff but his eyes were constantly shifting scanning the area more closely than a candy shop owner with a store full of elementary kids i knew he wished jax was with us to play scout but the pixy had gone with ivy and nick ivy wasnt letting nick out of her sight since jenks had found him in squirrels end trying to leave his sorrow in an empty glass if she hadnt hated him before she did now seeing that he had put everything in jeopardy to slam down a few in the comfort of humans rache jenks was suddenly at my elbow come and look at what i found its made of bone i think its perfect lets get it and get out of here his brow was creased in concern because of my increasing fatigue and deciding i had pushed my luck far enough i shuffled after him i was tired the blood loss starting to win out over ivys brimstone cocktails hiking my bag higher i stopped beside a case full of american indian stuff tomahawks little drums carved totem poles strings of beads and feathers there was some turquoise in there and realizing by the price tags that it wasnt tourist crap but real artwork i leaned forward didnt indians carve stuff out of bone look at that necklace jenks said proudly pointing through the glass its got a hunk of bone for the pendant you could get that put the demon curse in it and bang not only do you have a new focus but youve got yourself some kickass native american bling hunched over the display case i glanced wearily up at him oh he exclaimed and i followed his gaze to an ugly totem shoved into the corner of the case as if in apology look at that that would look great in my living room i exhaled slowly dubiously eyeing it the thing stood about four inches high and the animals portrayed were so stylized i couldnt tell if they were beaver deer wolves or bear blocky teeth and big eyes it was ugly but a right kind of ugly im getting it for matalina he said proudly and my eyes widened as i tried not to imagine what to a pixy would be akin to a sixfoot totem pole in the middle of matalinas living room i had no idea how pixies decorated but i couldnt imagine the woman would be pleased maam he called out his posture upright and eager how much is this i leaned heavily on the counter as the woman finished up at the register and hustled over tuning her and jenks out as they haggled over the price i looked at the necklace it was out of my easy price range but there was a statue of a wolf next to it it was expensive too but if it didnt work i could bring it back reaching a decision i straightened can i see that wolf statue i asked interrupting jenks trying to sweettalk the woman into giving him a senior citizen discount she wasnt buying that he had kids and a mortgage i couldnt blame her he looked like he should be in high school with that funky hat on her eyebrows high and her expression cagy the woman unlocked the case and set the statue in my hand its bone right i asked turning it over to see the made in china sticker not so authentic then but i wasnt going to complain ox bone the woman said warily no regulations on importing ox bone i nodded setting it on the counter it was pricey but i wanted to go home or at least back to my motel room would you give us a price break if we bought two pieces i asked and a satisfied smile spread over the womans face delighted jenks took over overseeing her wrap both pieces up and boxing them individually my pulse slow and lethargic i dug in my bag for my wallet my treat jenks said his young features looking innocent and flustered go stand by the door or something his treat it was all coming out of the same pot eyebrows high i tried to look past him but he got in my way pulling off his hat and using it to hide something he had slipped onto the counter i caught a glimpse of a bottle of sunfun colorchanging nail polish then smiled and turned away next years solstice gift maybe ill be outside i said seeing an empty bench in the middle of the openair mall jenks mumbled something and i leaned into the glass door glad it moved easily the air smelled like fudge and water and with slow steps i made a beeline for the bench before the young family with ice cream cones could reach it i exhaled as i settled myself on the wooden bench the wind was light in the protected area and the sun was warm i breathed deeply pulling in the scent of the marigolds behind me it was right on the cusp of being able to plant annuals up there but they would be sheltered from frost being surrounded by so much stone though the tourist season hadnt officially started it was busy people with colorful sacks drifted aimlessly in a contented pattern of idle amusement that was comforting to see humans mostly with the odd witch making a statement with his or her dress it was hard to tell who was who otherwiseunless you got close enough to smell them the sound of unseen pixy wings was a soft almost subliminal hum my hands drifted up to my scent amulet making sure it was touching my skin i knew i shouldnt have been out there alone but i was under two disguises what were the chances the weres would even be looking for me here and if they were they would never recognize me i glanced up when the shop door opened and jenks came out squinting in the brighter light until he put his shades on the top of that hat poked out from the bag he carried and i smiled his head turned to the end of the mall where we had parked kistens corvette it was obvious he wanted to hustle me over there and get me home but upon seeing me slumped in fatigue he came to a silent standstill above me slowly i drew my head up are you jenks started im fine i lied wanting to pluck my turtleneck off my stitches jax had used dental floss but they still pulled on the fabric the couch left me tight is all he grinned sitting down crosslegged on the bench as if it was a toadstool jenks had slept in the van last night so neither ivy nor i had to hell i didnt even want to ride in it againwhich was probably why ivy had taken a cab across the straits to get nicks truck i was going to ask you if you were hungry and wanted a hamburger he said squinting but i like your idea better i could go for a little scuffle loosen up get the blood flowing i hated feeling weak taking a weary breath i straightened jenks sit like a man that was cute when you were four inches tall but now you look prissy immediately he put his feet on the ground knees together and a worried look on him puffing the hair from my eyes i gave up and rolled my turtleneck down so i had been bitten by a vamp lots of people were that doesnt look much better i said well how the hell am i supposed to sit he exclaimed lacing my fingers over my head i stretched carefully feeling the stitches pull kistens bracelet shifted to my elbow to make a cold spot of metal against my skin have you seen kisten slouch in the kitchen with a hesitant slowness that could have been provocative jenks extended his legs lean in his tight jeans he slumped until his neck rested atop the back of the bench his arms went out to run along the length of the worn wood and his feet spread suggestively ohmygod flushing i sat up straight yeah i said faintly thats better fiftyfour kids fiftyfour kids and where was that camera he was going to buy for me give me a minute to catch my breath i said sneaking glances at him then we can head to the car i need a few more things to make the demon spell but im too tired to do it now it grated on me to admit it but it was kinda obvious jenks sat up with a little grunt rummaging in a pocket of his coat to bring out a folded napkin here he said handing it to me ivy said you might be stupid enough to leave the motel and if you did to give you this irritation filled me and i unfolded it to find one of her brimstone cookies damn it jenks i hissed folding it up and glancing at the passing people you want to see me in jail he smirked then eat it and get rid of the evidence tinks a disney whore rache youre worse than my kids you need it its medicinal just eat the damned cookie i felt it light in my hand thinking it wasnt as simple as he made it out to be the only reason i was out here was because the dose id taken before bed had woken me with the jitters least i was blaming it on that i felt like crap though so i opened it up and nibbled a corner immediately jenkss posture relaxed i followed his gaze across the busy plaza to the hanging planters finally spotting the pixies they were chasing a hummingbird off their ferocity surprising me it was too early for fairies to be back from mexico and with a little practice the pixies might be able to hold the plaza when they migrated up the silence grew as i broke off a second corner off ivys cookie and guiltily ate it i hated being on brimstone but i hated being flat on my back more there had to be another way i thought but it would shorten my fatigued state from three weeks to three days it wasnt magic but it was close i could actually feel the drug taking hold making my pulse quicken and the slight trembling of my fingers disappear no wonder this stuff was illegal jenks was quiet watching the passing people with interest while he waited for my strength to return i didnt have a dad to talk stuff over with and my mom was too far away jenks was a heavy third of our firm what he thought mattered i took a breath worried about what he might say after i told him what really had me out there running from my thoughts id done some thinking that morning hunched over the sink and squinting into the showerfogged mirror to inspect my new stitches and scraped face the tears were small and harmless looking nothing like the savage rips al had given mebut they forced me to question how long i had been pushing ivy into biting mecause this hadnt come out of nowhere so while the shower ran from hot to cold i sat on the edge of the tub with a towel wrapped around myself shaking and almost physically ill with the thought that ivy had been right about at least part of it all it had taken was a brush with death for me to admit it so maybe i had wanted her to bite me even before i moved in with her that did mean i needed a subliminal feeling of danger to become passionate nobody was that screwed up thanks for helping me i said trying to work up to what i wanted to say with ivy jenks shrugged shifting position he pulled himself together and watched the pixies with a professional interest what was i supposed to do walk away i looked at my halfeaten cookie nick might have nick almost did the first time i had goaded ivy into trying to bite me until i said no to her and she insisted then he stepped in to help looking back on the incident it seemed obvious i had been jonesing for a bite sorry i said thinking of how tenuous id made everything i wasnt thinking making a rude snort he crossed his legs do tell miss witch princess he said ivy was handling it and you go and get curious tipping her into all but killing you bloody hell when are you going to stop being afraid of yourself i ate a bite of cookie a big one this time im scared i said after i forced it down dry were fine jenks said loudly his eyes on the hanging flowers and clearly not knowing where my thoughts were were all fine ivy said she isnt going to bite you again well go out for pizza at piscarys when we get home and everything will return to normal youre safer now than your first night spent under the same roof i put the last of the cookie in my mouth nervously folding the crumbs up into the napkin jenks was probably right about ivy never again initiating a bite between us but she hadnt initiated the first one either the thing was i didnt want everything to return to normal jenks swiveled to face me ah you are too scared to let her bite you again right a slow breath slipped past my lips and adrenaline zinged through me pushed by fear it was a feeling i was beginning to understand i didnt need fear to feel passion i didnt crap on my daisies jenks breathed you arent rache frightened i shifted to put my elbows on my knees wadding the napkin up and squishing it as if it was my shame im in trouble i whispered she didnt bind me but she may as well have rache it was soft and pensive and it ticked me off just listen will you i snapped then slumped back squinting into the sun as i looked at nothing my throat was tight and i shoved the napkin in a pocket ii learned something about myself and im scared its going to kill me if i ignore it its justgod how could i be that blind about myself it might be the vamp pheromones jenks coaxed you arent necessarily attracted to women just because you want to sleep with ivy my eyes widened and i turned to him shocking myself that he was still wearing that disguise and only his eyes looked like him i dont want to sleep with ivy i said flustered im straight i i took a deep breath afraid to admit it aloud i want to try to find a blood balance with her you what jenks blurted and i sent my gaze to the people around us to remind him we werent alone she would have killed you he said hushed now but no less intense only because i asked her to ignore her feelings for me flustered i tucked a wayward strand of hair behind an ear only because i let her bite me without the buffer of emotion that she uses to control her hunger jenks leaned closer his curls flashing blond in the sun for an instant as his disguise charm bobbled but youre straight he said you just said you were blushing i pulled the bag that had the fudge in it closer hunger gnawed at my middlethanks to the brimstoneand i dug for the little white box yeah i said uncomfortable as i remembered her gentle touch on me growing intimate when she misunderstood but after yesterday its pretty obvious she can share blood without the sex i darted a look at him even as a shiver rose through me unstoppable at the reminder of how good it had felt and she almost killed you trying jenks protested rache she is still messed up and this is too much even for you she cant do it youre not physically or mentally strong enough to keep her under control if she loses it again i hunched in worry hiding my concern in trying to get the taped box open so we go slow i said wrenching the thin white cardboard to no avail work up to it maybe why jenks exclaimed softly his brow pinched in worry why risk it at that i closed my eyes in a slow rueful blink crap maybe ivy was right maybe this was just another way to fill my life with excitement and passion but then i remembered our auras mixing the desperation her soul was drowning in and how i had eased her painif only for an instant it felt good jenks i whispered shocked to find my vision blurring with unshed tears im not talking about the blood ecstasy im talking about my being able to fill that emotional void she has you know her as well as i do maybe better she aches with it she needs to be accepted for who she is so badly and i was able to do that do you know how good that felt to be able to show someone that yes you are someone worth sacrificing for that you like them for their faults and that you respect them for their ability to rise above them jenks was staring at me and i sniffed back the tears damn i whispered terrified all of a sudden maybe it is love reaching slowly jenks took the box of fudge from me twisting to a pocket he flipped open a knife and cut the tape still silent he handed me the open box and tucked the knife away are you sure about this he asked worriedly i nodded cutting a slab of fudge off with that stupid little plastic knife they put in with it god help me if im wrong but i trust her i trust her to find a way to make it work and not kill me in the process i want it to work he fidgeted have you considered this might be a kneejerk reaction to nick he said are you trusting ivy now because nick hurt you and you simply want to trust somebody i exhaled slowly id already mulled that around in my head trying it on and dismissing it i dont think so i said softly jenks reclined against the bench pensive thoughtful myself i put the bite of fudge in my mouth and let it dissolve it was butterscotch in salute to ivys new allergy but i hardly tasted it silent i handed him the box of candy well jenks said ignoring the knife and just breaking off a piece at least you arent doing this because of your ohsoendearing need to mix danger with passion at least it better not be or ill pix you from here to the day you die for using ivy like that endearing need my neck throbbed when i jerked upright choking as i swallowed i beg your pardon he looked at me eyebrows high and the sun glinting on his disguiseblack hair you do the damnedest things in order to rile yourself up most people settle for doing it in an elevator but not you no you have to make sure its a vampire youre playing kissyface with heat washed through me pulled by anger and embarrassment ivy had said the same thing i do not rache he cajoled sitting up to match my posture look at yourself youre an adrenaline junkie you not only need danger to make good in the bedroom you need it to get through your normal day shut up i shouted giving him a backhanded thwack on his shoulder i like adventure thats all but he laughed at me eyes dancing in delight as he broke off another chunk of fudge adventure he said around his full mouth you keep making stupid decisions that will get you into just enough trouble that there might be the chance you cant get yourself out of being your safety net has been more fun than all my years at the is i do not i protested again look at yourself he said head bowed over the fudge box again look at yourself right now youre half dead from blood loss and youre out shopping these disguises look great but thats all they are thin sheets of maybe standing between you and trouble its the brimstone i protested taking the box of fudge out of his hands and closing it up it makes you feel indestructible makes you do stupid things he glanced from the white box to me brimstone doesnt have you out here he said its your recurring lamedecision patterns that have you out here living in a church with a vampire rache dating a guy who summons demons bumping uglies with a vampire those caps kisten wears wont mean crap if he loses control and you know it youve been flirting with being bitten for the last year putting yourself in situation after situation where it might happen and the first time you get ivy out of piscarys influence what do you do manipulate her into it youre an adrenaline addict but at least youre making money off it hey i exclaimed then lowered my voice when two passing women glanced at us ivy had something to do with yesterday jenks shrugged extending his legs and clasping his hands behind his head yeah she did come up here after you course i think part of that was her knowing you might take the opportunity after you did jumping jacks in kistens sweats it didnt take much convincing on her part to bite you did it nah you were primed and ready to go and she knew it damn it he was laughing at me my brow furrowed and i shoved the fudge back in a bag and out of his reach i was not that stupid i did not live my life trying to get into trouble just so i could have a good time in bed i always have a good reason for the things i do i said peeved and my decisions dont hinge on what might put excitement in my life but since i quit the is ive never had the chance to make good decisionsim always scrambling just to stay alive do you think i dont want the little charm shop the husband and twopointtwo kids a normal house with the fence and the dog that digs up my neighbors yard and chases their cat into a tree jenkss gaze was even and calm wise and even a bit sad the wind ruffled his hair and the sound of the pixies grew obvious no he said i dont think you do i glared and he added i think it would kill you quicker than going to see piscary wearing gothic lace i think managing to find a blood balance with ivy is going to be the only way youre going to survive besides he grinned impishly no one but ivy will put up with the things you need or the crap you dish out thanks a hell of a lot i muttered slumping with my arms crossed over my chest depressed i stared at the pixies then did a double take when i realized theyd killed the hummingbird and were gathering the feathers crap pixies were wicked when threatened i am not that hard to live with jenks laughed loudly and i glanced at him drawn by the different sound what about your upcoming demand to be free to sleep with whoever you damn well please while sharing blood with her knowing shed rather have you sleep with her he asked shut up i said embarrassed because that was one of the things i had on my list to talk to ivy about she knows im never going to sleep with her the man passing us turned then whispered something to his girlfriend who promptly eyed me as well i grimaced at them glad i was wearing a disguise it takes an incredibly strong person to walk away from someone they love jenks said holding up two fingers as if making a list especially knowing they will do something asinine like shopping when their blood count is so low they ought to be in the hospital you should give her credit for respecting you like that hey i exclaimed annoyed you said she wouldnt mind grinning he slid down a few feet actually i said what she doesnt know wont hurt you he put up a third finger you leave windows open when the heat is on a family of three walked past the kids like stairsteps and noisy with life i watched them pass thinking they were the future i had been working for just walking away and leaving me behind was that a problem i like fresh air i protested gathering up my things it was time to leave youre a whiner too jenks said ive never seen anyone so pathetic when youre sick wheres my pain amulet wheres my coffee god almighty i thought i was bad i stood feeling renewed from the brimstone boost it was a false strength but it was there nevertheless put down your fingers jenks or im going to break them off and shove them somewhere jenks stood as well tugging his aviator jacket straight you bring home demon familiars oh isnt she sweet he said in a high falsetto can we keep her i hiked my shoulder bag up higher feeling the comfortable weight of my splat gun inside are you saying i should have let al kill ceri i said dryly laughing he gathered up his sundry bags consolidating them into two no im saying that it takes a very strong person to let you be you i cant think of anyone better than ivy my breath escaped me in a huff well im glad we have your blessing jenks snorted his gaze going over the heads of the tourists to the archway and the parking lot where the car was yeah you got my blessing and youve got my warning too i looked at him but he wasnt paying me any attention scanning the area now that we were ready to move again if you think living with ivy and trying to avoid getting bitten was difficult wait until you try living with her while trying to find a blood balance this isnt an easier road rache he said gaze distant and unaware of the worry he was starting in me its a harder one and youre going to be hurting all the way along it twentyfive the wind was whipping the decorative flags at the archway to the parking lot and i blinked at them fascinated i had the remains of a burger in one hand and a fizzy drink in the other jenks had insisted i get some ironrich protein in me to chase down the brimstone but i suspected it had only been an excuse to get the drink which he then spiked with even more brimstone why else would i be feeling this great when my life was in the crapper and i was feeling pretty damn good like a weight had lifted and the sun was starting to shine ivy would return soon and though i had been all toughgirl by coming out here it seemed prudent to get back before she found out i was gone if jenks and she were to be believed i structured my life to be as horrific as possible to have fun in bed but having ivy mad at me might be too much for even me right now what time is it i asked squinting in the stiffer breeze and looking for the car people bothered at our slow pace hustled past us but i was enjoying the wind and the view of the straits jenks snickered clearly guessing where my thoughts were he had slammed his twentyounce dew and shook for a good thirty seconds jittery and bright eyed making me wonder which one of us was the better bet to drive home juggling his bags he checked his wrist beaming four fortysix he said only a minute off that time by the time you get acclimated well be heading home i said then pushed into motion when did you get a watch yesterday with jax he said stretching to see the parking lot over the heads of the surrounding people i got you a camera too and my knife i dont like being this big i wasnt going to tell him it was illegal to carry a concealed knife besides he was a pixy the law didnt apply to him i smiled at the way the sunlight glittered on his hair even if it was black big bad wolfs i said then sucked down another swig of pop stumbling on the curb as we found the street were going to blow their damned house down his motions seamless jenks took my drink away and dropped it into the nearest trash container you okay oh yeah i said enthusiastically i handed him the last of my burger which he threw away for me too you ought to know youre the one who keeps spiking my food giving me a wry look jenks gallantly took my arm a giggle slipped from me at the show of support appalling me damn it this wasnt fair if they got me hooked on brimstone i was going to be majorly pissedif i could remember why i was mad at them that is still laughing i pulled my head up going cold with a pulse of fear leaning against kistens corvette were brett and walter vincent the first one scanning the faces of the people leaving the mall the second doing the same but with a murderous intensity immediately i realized what had happened and i thanked god we werent at the motel trapped in a little box of a room jenks and i were under a disguise and though they hadnt known about kistens car it probably smelled like the pixy seeing as he drove it yesterday they had found us oh fudge i whispered leaning heavily on jenkss arm just that fast i had gone from exuberant to panic the brimstone taking over my moods you got anything more lethal than that knife on you i asked no why his forward momentum barely hesitated as he looked up from watching my feet oh he said softly his fingers tightening on my arm for an instant okay i wasnt surprised when he did an abrupt turnabout and wheeled us back into the mall bending close jenks sent the aroma of dry meadow over me your disguises are working he whispered pretend we just forgot something and have to go pick it up i found myself nodding scanning the contented faces around me searching for anger in the vacationing people my pulse was fast and my skin tingling pam was dead they would be after me for that if nothing else weres were timid apart from the alpha and the first few down and since the round was broken they would stay in the background and keep our squabble private wed be okay unless we got ourselves in a blind alley and there werent many of those in mackinaw city im going to call ivy i said pulling my bag around and opening it body tense jenks drew me to a stop to put my back to a brick wall and stand partially in front of me it was a candy shopbig surprise thereand my stomach growled as i hit speed dial come on come on i crabbed waiting for it to go through the circuit clicked open and ivys voice filtered out rachel yeah its me i said shoulders easing in relief where are you on the bridge back why she hesitated and i could hear the distinctive sound of nicks truck why do i hear people she added suspiciously jenks winced and i squinted in the sun backing up until the overhang put me in the shade uh jenks and i went on a procurement run shopping she yelped rachel damn it cant you just sit still for a couple of hours i thought of the brimstone running rampant through me deciding that no i couldnt jenks tossed his head and i followed his grim gaze to a pair of elegantly dressed tourists they had shopping bags but they were a little too attentive turning his back to them jenks angled to block their view of me damn it this was getting dicey my pulse quickened and i hunched into the phone look i did some thinking and youre right i peeked around jenks then rocked back how long will it take for you to get to that openair mall you did some thinking ivy said softly sounding vulnerable jenks scanned the plaza ticktock rache anxious i turned to the phone yeah i need to start making smarter decisions but were at that mall and brett and walter are sitting on the car the good feeling the brimstone had instilled in me had sifted to fear and i clamped down on my rising panic at its heart brimstone was an intensifier if you were happy you were really happy if you were sad you were suicidal right now i was scared out of my mind until it wore off i was going to be a roller coaster of emotions damn it i didnt have time for this ivy snarled something at nick and i heard a horn blast how many she asked tightly i looked past jenks seeing sunlit flowers and cheerful storefronts four so far but they have phones were wearing disguises so they probably dont know its us calm down rachel i told myself trying to use the drug to my advantage think i knew this was going to happen i knew it ivy shouted well id rather meet them here than the motel i said doggedly trying to pull my emotions from fear back to invincibility it wasnt working i was still scared the bridge is still one lane either way ivy snarled i cant get around this guy give the phone to jenks i want to talk to him jenks paled and shook his head jenks she exclaimed i know you can hear me i cant believe you let her talk you into this i told you she needed at least another course of brimstone before she could work in the kitchen much less go out im not that weak i said indignantly but jenks was way ahead of me and he took the phone holding it so we could both hear she ate that last cookie ivy he said clearly offended and i just gave her another dose of the stuff shes running on full im not stupid i knew it i said glancing past jenks at the drifting people you slipped me some there was a short silence and ivy said softly you picked up more brimstone jenks met my eyes yeah and dont worry i paid cash its not on the card where did you get the money jenks ivy asked the threat clear in her voice it wasnt that expensive he said but i could tell he thought hed done something wrong by his suddenly worried look you ass ivy said get her the hell out of there you bought streetgrade you stupid pixy shes higher than a kite jenkss mouth worked but nothing was coming out uh ivy he squeaked we gotta go dont hang up ivy yelled give me to rachel jenks give the phone to rachel jenks went to end the call and i snatched the phone i was on streetgrade brimstone swell just swell i thought it was hitting me a little hard i could hear ivy telling nick what had happened catching the word invincible and get herself killed jenks turned to scan the area his posture tense and guilty looking hey ivy i said my mood having done a quick shift to anger the next time you and jenks want to play doctor just shove the brimstone up your ass okay both of you im not your freaking playdoll im on my way ivy said ignoring me rachel justsit somewhere can you do that ill get you out i leaned against the brick wall feeling every little projection dig into me through my shirt take your time i said flippantly ticked and nervedup all at the same time the adrenaline was flowing and brimstone had my skin tingling jenks and i are going to plan b plan b ivy said what is plan b jenks reddened grab the fish and run like hell he muttered and i almost giggled im going to walk out of here i said deciding id rather be invincible than scared and catch the trolley back to the motel and if anyone stops me im going to kicktheirass rachel ivy said slowly its the brimstone you arent thinking just sit tight my eyes narrowed i can take care of myself i said starting to feel really good it wasnt the brimstone no i lived for excitement i made decisions based on what would screw my life up the most i was a messedup screwedup stupid witch who had to mix danger with her sex life in order to get turned on and i was going to live a very short exciting life i went to end the call then hesitated hey you want me to keep the phone line open yes she said softly no yes i sobered at the worry in her voice okay my blood tingled through me and i tucked the phone into my waistband upside down so the mike was exposed and not muffled by my jeans ivy would be able to hear everything that happened i looked at jenks seeing his worry and tension well i said pushing myself off the wall what do you think i think ivys going to kill me he whispered rachel im sorry i didnt know i took a breath exhaling long and slow it was done if anything i ought to thank him i was up and walking able to run even if i was going to pay for it later dont worry about it i said touching his shoulder just stop making my decisions for me okay my roving eyes fell upon the bench he and i had been sitting on my mouth went dry and i tried to swallow brett was standing by it his arms crossed and his eyes fixed on me he was smiling at me shit i breathed jenks they know its us he nodded his youthful face going serious he showed up a few minutes ago we have six at the exit behind us and four at the bend the other way and you just let me keep talking to ivy i said not believing it a shrug lifted his shoulders theyre weres they arent going to make a scene normally i would have agreed with him heart pounding i snuck a look at the six weres at the exit they had scads of jewelry and were in bright colors making them from the street pack bringing up my second sight i felt the last of my bravado wash out of me their auras were rimmed in brown again how had walter managed to pull them back together like that ah jenks i said knowing ivy was listening theyre in a round they arent going to just sit there we have to leave before the rest arrive jenks looked at me looked at the weres then looked at me again his gaze went to the roof and he was probably wishing he could fly theres only one layer of shops he said suddenly lets go grabbing my arm he pulled me into the fudge store feet stumbling i followed him in breathing deeply of the rich scent of chocolate there was a small line at the counter but jenks plowed to the front of it amid a chorus of indignant protest pardon me scuse us he said flipping the barrier up between the front and the back hey a large woman called out her apron tied with the smartness of a uniform you cant come back here just passing through jenks called cheerfully the bags he held rattled and letting go of my arm for a moment he dipped a finger into the puddle of fudge cooling on a marble table needs more almond he said tasting it and youre cooking it half a degree too long the womans mouth opened in surprise and he pushed past her and into the kitchen there i said and jenkss eyes shot to the back door outlined by the boxes stacked around it the security door was open to let the hot air of the kitchen escape through a normallooking screen door beyond that were the employees cars in a nastylooking alley and beyond that the main road in the distance the straits sparkled looking as big as a lake ready jenks asked i jerked my splat ball gun out of my bag yup lets go what the hell are you doing back here a masculine voice called i turned and the mans eyes went wide at my cherryred gun then he got nasty this is my place of business he shouted not a paint ball stadium get out get out sorry i mumbled then bolted for the door when he shambled forward hands reaching jenks and i dove through it skittering into the alley in a surge of adrenaline the bang of the heavy door slamming shut shot through me oh look jenks i said as we slowed to get our bearings a deadend alley the wind was brisk blowing up and against the back of the store and with my blood humming and my steps quick i started for the street and the cracked sidewalk beside it it would take the weres some time to work their way out and around to the back of the store unless they trashed the fudge shop but i didnt think they would like their supposedly distant wild brethren weres werent aggressive unless defending their own but they were in a round so who knew what they would do ivy i said breathlessly as we jogged to the road knowing she could hear were outside between the mall and theshit i exploded skittering to a halt when in a sliding sound of gravel on pavement a trio of weres skidded around the corner they were wearing khaki pants and matching polo shirts to make them look like they were in uniform even worse one of them dropped a duffel bag and after unzipping it started tossing nasty looking weapons to his buddies i stood there frozen were they nuts this went way beyond a public show of strength hell even vamps never did this not in broad daylight and on the street where any passing human could see anyway someone cocked their weapon and jenks jerked me back my mouth was still hanging open when we landed against a saltrusted fourdoor the front full of crumpled fast food sacks brett came around the corner his pace fast and his eyes darting everywhere seeing me he smiled we have them sir he said into the phone at his ear slowing to a stop behind the three weres with aggressive stances behind the fudge shop its all over but the howling heart pounding i looked at the road and the sporadic traffic the memory of finding nick tied to the wall swam up from my subconscious a chill purged everything from me but a fierce determination i wasnt strong enough to survive that i couldnt let them take me you want me to make a circle and wait for ivy or you want to fight our way out jenks i said my grip on my splat gun going sweaty in a sliding sound of metal jenks pulled a dull metal bar from the nearby recycling bin swinging it a couple of times the three weres with guns took a more aggressive stance you think we need ivy he asked just checking i answered then turned to the weres my arms shaking right like youre going to shoot us i taunted if were dead you cant beat nicks location out of us bretts jaw clenched from the other side three more weres loped into view to make seven men i had fourteen sleepytime potions i had to act and act now subdue them brett said squinting from the sun annoyed he snatched the weapon from the nearest man use your fists you outnumber them and i dont want the is out here because of weapon discharges adrenaline surged making me feel weak not strong from beside me jenks shouted then leapt forward half the weres came to meet him their speed and ferocity shocking panic struck taking aim i downed one with a charm then another i wanted to help jenks but they were coming too fast one slipped past him and i gasped falling to one knee not today you son of a bitch i exclaimed plugging him he slid to within three feet of me i leveled my gun for the next one he got three steps closer than the first jenks fall back i shouted retreating with my gun going puffpuffpuff three more went down frantic i tossed the hair from my face there were a lot more then seven weres i had downed at least that many where in hell was ivy rache jenks shouted in warning behind you i spun a were in leather was running for me behind him the door to the kitchen was wideopen and full of roughlooking weres in street clothes i stumbled backward they had come through the shop damn it i had been afraid they would they were not acting normal rachel jenks shouted again as the were smiled to show his beautiful beautiful teeth and closed his greasestained fingers about my wrist big mistake grunting i twisted my arm to grip his own thick wrist my right foot came up and my sneaker smacked him in the kidneys wrenching around i used his own weight to yank him down falling to kneel so his elbow hit my upraised knee bending it backward and snapping he grunted as his elbow shattered puffing in satisfaction i let him go and got to my feet where in hell was my splat gun spotting it alone on the pavement i darted for it hey i shouted my foot pulled out from under me arms flailing to get between my face and the uprushing pavement i hit the cement shocked i twisted to find the were i had downed wasnt withering in pain and holding his broken arm but using it you bloody bastard i shouted kicking at his face let me go but he didnt grimily holding on panic slid through me as i realized they were using the full potential of the round and someone was muting his pain he utterly ignored the broken nose i gave him with my heel and i smacked him again blood gushed and he finally let go but not before he fastened one of those damned zipstrips on my foot you freaking bastard i shouted scrabbling for my gun and plugging him right in the face furious i turned to the two weres following him and shot them too the three collapsed and shuddering i got to my feet holding three more at bay my arms shaking as i shifted the aim from one to the other jenks i shouted and he was suddenly at my back stupid stupid witch until i got the thing off i wouldnt be able to make a circle all i had were the four charms in my gun and jenks his back now pressing lightly against mine i could smell the sweat on him reminding me of a meadow somehow he had lost his disguise amulet at some point and his blond curls were tousled the cut on his forehead was bleeding again and red streaked his hands my face went ashen when i realized it wasnt his but from the five weres he had beaten into unconsciousness with that pipe brett stood with walter behind two military weres their weapons cocked and ready to gun us down if they couldnt subdue us any other way past them traffic passed and curious onlookers were being soothed by professionallooking weres in suits and ties probably explaining this away as being a movie shoot or something behind us the street weres waited hanging back but ready to descend when someone gave the order i swallowed hard with the strength of four alphas at his fingertips walter had driven them into a higher pitch of aggression and with the lack of pain there was nothing to stop them just the thought of gaining the focus had been enough to get them back together incredible i mused grip shifting on my splat gun as i tried to figure out how four charms would be of much help what would happen if they actually got the focus was a nightmare in waiting every single were would want a piece of it the alphas would come flocking and soon the major cities would be fighting their own little turf wars as vampires started taking them out having decided they didnt like aggressive weres who felt no pain and could were as fast as witch magic and with the focus binding them the round wouldnt break apart no wonder the vampires had hidden the ugly thing jenks i panted knowing ivy could hear they tagged me with one of those zipstrips i cant make a circle to hold them off anymore we cant let them get the focus and im not strong enough to keep my mouth shut if they capture me jenks glanced at me and away his grip tightened on the bloody pipe any ideas nope i panted shifting my feet unless you can hold them off long enough for me to get this damned strip off my foot he jiggled out his knife handing it to me it was smeared with blood and i felt sick ill keep them off you he said his face going grim i handed it back knowing he was more effective with it than i was theyre designed to be tamper resistant its going to take a pair of bolt cutters jenks shifted his balance to his toes then we fight until ivy gets here yep i agreed fear settling firmly in me this was bad this was really bad my gaze darted to brett as he scuffed his feet walter had joined him the savage glint in his eyes born from his grief from behind me came the sound of the street weres pulling chains from around their waist and the snick of knives being opened damn it all and shit on it i did not want to die like this maam brett drawled drawing my attention to him it would save everyone a good deal of trouble if you would surrender your weapon and come with us trouble i shouted back releasing some pentup frustration for who my gaze traveled over the weres they kept filing in surrounding us there were five alphas now the street weres at our backs military weres at the front and the credit card weres at the outskirts keeping everything nice and quiet and the pedestrian traffic moving my stomach clenched when i realized three of the street weres behind the dumpster werent injured but shifting they were shifting in broad daylight in a public street with the intent to tear me to pieces and they were doing it really fast maam brett tried again playing the good cop or simply buying time for the turning weres put down your weapon and kick it to me go to hell brett i said darkly ive seen how you treat your guests i know what it is now and you arent getting it and this isnt a weapon its a gun angry and frightened i took aim and shot him a blur dove between us one of his men took it instead the were hit the ground and skidded to a stop out cold before his face ground into the pavement brett seemed shocked id actually shot at him and i shrugged at the outskirts stupid people clapped in appreciation i could not believe this i was going to be hacked to shreds to the accompaniment of applause brett glanced at them then frowned shoot her he said softly just shoot her in the leg good going rache jenks muttered safeties clicked off i spun i had three charms left and i wanted those fourlegged bastards asleep before they finished putting on their wolfs clothing ignoring the chaos i calmly plugged them both the street weres surrounding them exploded in anger i backpedaled as they rushed me no brett shouted redfaced as he gestured get out of the way jenks was a blur of motion the thuds of the bar meeting flesh sickening the occasional chime of metal on metal rang out as someone threw a chain into the mix my first thought that we were going to die turned into an ironic relief as long as the street weres were surrounding us the military faction couldnt shoot one of the weres broke through jenkss defenses and i sprang forward grabbing the hairy arm someone conveniently gave me i twisted and shoved the were stumbled away howling in pain as i dislocated his shoulder a nasty grin came over me he had felt that the bond was breaking they were acting independently and the round was falling apart a sharp crack shocked through me and i jumped they were shooting anyway a closer burst of gunfire brought me spinning around the weres fell back their aggression flaking to nothing as the packs divided heart in my throat i found jenks weapon aimed at the sky and a savage expression on his face the more disciplined military faction held their ground but the street weres panicked in an instant they were gone streaking past jenks and me and dragging their downed companions whether in fur leather or polyester hold together walter shouted from behind a row of men but it was too late damn you he swore hold together hes not going to shoot you faint on the cool spring air was the sound of sirens tinks diaphragm its about time jenks swore the weres who were left heard it too and they began to exchange looks as they panted the crowd watching started to break up their steps fast and their faces pale as they realized that was real blood on the pavement you know who i am jenks shouted bloody but unbowed im jenks he took a breath grinning boo several of the welldressed weres jumped and a few of the military weres touched their tattoos as if for luck or strength walter shoved himself to the front hold together he shouted as his control over the second pack slipped away you swore an oath to me you swore damn it the alpha male in a suit gave him an ugly look saying nothing more he turned and walked away his wife slipped an arm in his seamlessly snagging a store bag and heading for the top of the wide alley there were no more bystanders watching now and they melted seamlessly into the tourist traffic hunched and panting i watched unbelieving as the ring of business weres dispersed i smiled sweetly at walter hefting my splat gun it was empty but he didnt know that the sirens grew closer if they had held together for five minutes more they would have had us it hadnt been the sirens it had been their inability to stay together without the focus they couldnt hold together when things got sticky choleric walter gestured to brett rache jenks shouted at least a dozen weapons turned to us there was only one thing to do and i did it grunting i leapt at brett it surprised him and though he was by far the better military person i got him down attacking not like a professional but like a sissy girl with my arms around his knees we hit the pavement together and i scrambled for a better hold my arm went around his neck and i wrenched an arm painfully and while he would have felt no pain had they still been in a round he certainly felt it now tell them to back off i shouted brett started to laugh the sound choking off when i pulled ow he said as if i was simply bending back a finger not ready to dislocate his shoulder ms morgan what the hell do you think youre doing maam i could hear nicks truck getting the hell out of here i said stumbling as jenks helped me stand upright without losing my grip it was as awkward as all getout but we managed a ring of weapons pointed at us jenks took my place his face ugly as he bent his arm and pressed a knife to bretts throat you ever see a pixy battlefield he whispered in the weres ear and brett lost the vestiges of humor whitefaced he went passive which was really scary in itself the flash of a blue truck sped past too far ivy jenks shouted and there was the squeal of brakes quickly followed by the horns and the gunning of an engine i looked at my waistband and the phone an insane need to giggle rose through me i sure hoped we werent roaming another squeal of tires and nicks blue truck rocked to a stop at the end of the alley moms here to pick us up jenks i quipped limping to the curb ill get the bags i scooped up one of our bags seeing as it was on the way and it sort of added to the travesty my empty splat gun never shifted from walter though he was behind two rows of men coward hi ivy i said tiredly tossing the bag into the truck bed and lurching in after it yeah it was illegal to ride in the back but seeing that we had just somehow beaten up three were packs i wasnt going to worry about it thanks for the ride nick was in the front seat and pale he handed a pair of bolt cutters through the window hey thanks i said then started when brett came thumping in beside me like a sack of potatoes the were was unconscious and i looked at jenks in question when he followed him in admittedly a hell of a lot more gracefully i dont want a hostage i said then wondered when jenks had knocked him out he wasnt dead was he grimfaced jenks shouted what are you waiting for ivy god to say go the truck lurched and i steadied myself against the long silver locker nick had bolted to the truck bed my sweat went cold in the new breeze and thinking we had done it i pulled the hair from my eyes and smiled at jenks my smile faded as we jostled into traffic he was using a plastic cord to truss brett up with a painful savagery i thought back to seeing his kids tearing apart the fairy nest in his garden this was a side to him id never truly seen before since the difference of our sizes had insulated me from it from inside the truck came nicks petrified voice go faster ivy theyre behind us wedging myself into the corner i held my hair out of the way and blinked i had expected to see jeeps or hummers what i found were three weres in wolf skin tearing down the street after us and they were fast really fast and they didnt stop for red lights either son of a disney whore jenks swore rache you got any more charms in that gun i shook my head scrambling for a way out of this my eyes darted to my ankle jenks get this thing off me brett was coming around and when he tried to get upright jenks lashed out savagely connecting with his head right behind his ear bretts eyes rolled back and he passed out hold on nick shouted right turn tossing my splat gun into the front i gripped the side of the truck the wheels skittered and hopped but ivy kept it on the road nick yelled an obscenity and a motor home flashed by tires squealing i didnt want to know how close we had come to becoming a hood ornament my heart pounded and my gaze shot to my foot at the feel of cold steel against my skin jenkss shoulder muscles bunched and as we hit a pothole the charmed silver band snapped frantic i sent my gaze behind us holy crap they were right there ivy i shouted stomach clenching when i say hit the breaks are you crazy she shouted glancing back at me her short black hair framing her face and getting into her eyes just do it i demanded tapping a line line energy filled me warm and golden i didnt care that it was tainted black it was mine i took a breath this was going to hurt if i didnt do it right big circle big circle now i shouted the breaks screamed i lurched shocked to find jenkss arm between my head and the metal cabinet brett slid forward and groaned rhombus i shouted the word raging from me hard enough to hurt my throat heady and strong the line energy flashed through me expanding upward from the circle i had imagined painted on the pavement it wasnt strong enough to hold a demon but it would hold together long enough for what i wanted i hoped i tossed my hair from my eyes even before the truck stopped rocking elation filled me as the pursing weres slammed right into my circle yes i shouted then spun at the sound of crunching metal and screams it wasnt us we were stopped i sucked in my breath when i realized an oncoming car had smacked into the other side of my circle amber and black in the sun aw shit id forgotten about the other lane horns blew and the car that had hit my circle was rearended oh that was just beautiful jenks said in admiration his eyes were on the weres making painful splurges of motion on the pavement apparently running into a wall hurt if you didnt have a round of alphas taking away your pain people were starting to get out of their cars dazed and excited sorry i called out wincing breaking my connection with the line i took down the circle in the distance were sirens and i could see flashing lights jenks tapped the window and ivy slowly accelerated taking the first left she could and doubling back a street over trying to put as much distance between us and the sirens as she could i exhaled falling to slump against the tool locker i put a hand through the window finding ivys shoulder she jumped and i whispered thanks before i pulled my hand out we had made it we were alive and together and we had a hostage damn it all back to the turn jenks swore nick turned to look at us and i nudged jenkss foot he was messing about in his bag and he looked ticked what is it jenks i breathed as we jostled along tired so tired i lost my fudge he swore that woman took my fudge twentysix the hamburger place was busy with kids moms and teenagers cutting loose after school telling me more clearly than a page of demographics that the resident population was decidedly slanted to human i slumped deeper into the molded plastic my lips curling when i found the table sticky from someones pop brett snickered and i made a face at him the defiant were was sitting across from me handcuffed with his own steel to the table support bolted to the floor pride had him hiding the fact and no one was paying us any mind just two people having coffee least we would be when jenks got back with the drinks the brimstone had worn off somewhere between shaking the weres and ivy and nick dropping us off here and fatigue was seeping into me like water through mud ivy was sure that they knew how to track bretts location from an active phone and the two of them were leading the weres on a wild goose chase until we figured out what to do with him that we had a hostage had really put a crimp in my already stellar day jenks ivy and i had already gone round about it nick listened wideeyed as jenks adamantly protested that we should keep him to kill in cold blood as a warning if the weres so much as sniffed too close to us the scary thing was jenks was ready to carry it out this was the shocking ruthless side to jenks that was seldom seen and easy to miss behind his lighthearted mienthe part of him that kept his family fed and their heads underground when the snow flew taking brett hostage had been as natural as breathing to him and i truly believed hed kill the were with just as much thought though carefree and one of the best friends id ever had jenks was a cell phone computersavvy savage living without law and holding to his own morals alone i thanked god i fit in there as being important to him it was the first time jenks and i had disagreed on how to handle a run hell it was the first time hed had an opinion i think taking brett hostage had triggered something in his pixy makeup i was sure the argument wasnt over yet but i did not want a hostage but i hadnt wanted ivy to drop us off at a burger joint either i thought sourly hunching deeper into jenkss aviator jacket which he was letting me wear i had wanted to go to squirrels end where i could have a beer and quietly shake in the corner the patrons there would have only snickered and poked each other at seeing the handcuffs ivy nixed it though pulling nicks truck into burgerrama saying that squirrels end smelled like us and only the sanitation practices of a fast food place would hide that wed been there and stop the trail cold whatever i was bonetired aching from our street brawl and thirsty enough to down a twoliter bottle of coke by myself and why in hell hadnt i at least brought my pain amulet it had been stupid going out like this god help me but if the weres didnt kill me i could probably do it myself brett and i both jumped at the highpitched shriek from the kid at the top of the slide behind him and our eyes met briefly the primarycolored play equipment was literally crawling with screaming runnynosed kids in open winter coats throwing the tops that came with the minimeals this week at each other my pulse slowed and as jenks charmed the ladies behind the counter into flustered goo i tried to look cool and professional among the plastic toys and paper hats it wasnt going to happen so i tried for dangerous i think i managed cranky when several children went wideeyed and silent after passing my table my hand lifted to hide the scrape on my face i got hitting the pavement and i tried again to brush my jeans free of the dirt from the alley maybe i looked worse than i thought brett looked great having sat most of the scuffle out the clean smell of woodsy aftershave came from him and the light glinted on the silver of his short hair though small he looked like he could lope from there to the state line without stoppingapart from the cuffs i smelled the hot meadowy scent of jenks before i saw him and i straightened sliding down to make room jenks set the cardboard tray with two large coffees and a weeniesized cup of steaming water that was an odd shade of pink onto the table herbal tea i thought claiming a coffee since when did jenks like herbal tea i looked up from trying to pry the lid off my cup when jenks pulled it out from my fingers hey i said and he put the lame cup of pink water in front of me i dont want tea i said indignantly i want coffee diuretic jenks sat beside brett it will do more harm than good drink your decaf tea remembering our argument and thinking this was his way of getting back at me my eyes narrowed i almost died back there i said irately if i want a damn coffee im going to have a damn coffee daring him to protest i took my coffee with a huff brett watched the exchange with interest eyebrows high he reached for the second coffee and jenks intercepted his reach the were hesitated then settled into his plastic seat with nothing what are you going to do with me maam he said the light twang in his voice obvious among the midwestern accents around us how in hell should i know oh ive got big plans for you i lied surprised at the maam jenks wants to string you up as an object lesson im halfway to letting him have his wish i leaned back tired it works great when he murders garden fairies brett glanced warily at jenkswho was nodding zealouslyand i felt a weary lassitude slip over me crap why did the brimstone pick now to wear off a chill ran through me tight on the heels of the idle thought that taking it to get through this week might not be a bad idea the weres eyes traveled over me hesitating at my torn turtleneck before rising to my face from there they never moved but his focus kept shifting as he monitored the room by the sounds behind him it gave me the creeps i sent my eyebrows upwishing yet again that i could do the one eyebrow thingcasually tearing three packets of sugar open at once and dumping them in not because i liked it but because the coffee smelled that old i know where it is i said lightly just the fact that brett didnt move said volumes jenks scowled clearly not liking what i was doing but i didnt want a hostage i wanted to send brett back with a message that would buy me some time and space now that the island weres knew we were still in mackinaw they would keep looking until they found us that we had brett for a hostage wouldnt stop themhe had screwed up royally and unlike the fairies that jenks was used to dealing with i think the weres would just as soon see him deadbut maybe a show of goodwill and a big fat lie would buy us time enough to get my con in place i hoped sparagmos told you where it is brett said his disbelief obvious of course he did jenks said breaking his silence weve got it and you dont na na na naaaa na i can put my hands on it i amended nudging jenkss foot shut up jenks i liked him better quiet this was the last time we took a hostage brett looked relaxed even though his one hand was cuffed under the table behind him kids were fighting hurting my ears give it to me he said ill take it to mr vincent and convince him to leave you alone jenks jerked into motion reaching for brett the were blocked it someone hit a coffee and it spilled gasping i stood when it threatened to run into my lap damn it jenks i swore pulling every eye to us what in hell are you doing the restaurant was abruptly silent a unified ooooh rose from the ball pit and i flushed clear in the silence the person coming over the loudspeaker wanted to know if he could substitute bottled water for the pop i winced apologetically to the offended mothers speaking in hushed voices to their soccermom friends sorry i muttered i sat down and the level of noise resumed crap that had been my coffee you are in no position to be making deals or demands jenks said nastily as people turned away and if you or your mangeridden curs touch her youll find everyone you care about dead one morning bretts face went red just stop it i griped thinking this wasnt the way to arrange a ceasefire but it told me i was right that brett had to placate walter with something to ease his return into the pack brett was in trouble it wasnt only jenks who wanted to kill him the small mans expression went sour and he settled back clearly a lot more cautious now that he knew how fast jenks could move heck it impressed me look i said wedging a wad of napkins out of the dispenser and mopping up my coffee i couldnt help but wonder if jenks had done it intentionally all i want is nick free from your reprisals you can take walter the stinking statue as far as im concerned bretts dark eyes went suspicious you still expect me to believe you arent working for someone and that you risked your life forfor him my lips curled into a sour smile dont call me stupid i warned him jenks pushed the tea at me and i ignored it i need a day to get the statue here i lied a day to get it here and tie a pretty ribbon around it for you the tiny clink of his cuffs made bretts eyes twitch youre going to give it to me he said flatly i wrapped my fingers around my foam cup to hide their trembling yup and it was your idea too jenks looked at me in bewilderment and i smiled i want you to back off all of you i added squeezing the tea bag to make a thin rivulet of red drain into the cup i was thirsty and if i made for that second coffee jenks would probably spill it too i dont need to leave town to get it i can have it here by sunset tomorrow watch us if you want but one sniff i think is too close and the exchange is off and we are gone i leaned over my tea jenks and i cleaned your clocks with a pipe and some stupid sleepytime charms you want to risk finding out what were really capable of when all you have to do is wait a lousy thirtysix hours an exchange brett mocked and jenks made an odd rumble leaving me wondering if pixies could growl seems to me like its more of a payment for getting us to leave you alone in a smooth unhurried motion jenks reached out and slapped him seems to me you should pull the brains out of your ass jenks i exclaimed glancing over the fishbowl of a restaurant to see if anyone saw him hes a dead wolf jenks protested gesturing sharply i could slice him open and leave him for the maggots and he thinks he has some leverage my eyes narrowed but we arent going to do that stop hitting him its what they did to nick he offered starting our argument anew why are you giving him any consideration beyond the chunk of meat that he turned himself into by letting us take him hostage under the table my knees were shaking because thats how we work when were five feet tall unless were ignorant animals playing in the woods jenks slumped back with his coffee to look sullen bretts teeth were clenched at my unflattering comparison to his pack remembering what they had done to nick it was hard not to let jenks have his way frustrated i tried to hide my shaking fingers by taking a sip of my tart tea while jenks continued to dump every last sugar packet into his coffee i could scent his anger over the odor of french fries and bad coffee like burnt acorns i am going to give walter the statue you couldnt retrieve through a week of torture i said in return you are going to convince walter to give me nicks life and not hold me responsible for pams death you will leave all of us alone and not seek any retaliation ever my eyebrows rose you do and ill come right back up here and take it back bretts faint wrinkles bunched why should i do that he asked because it was your idea i said lightly and its the only thing thats going to keep you alive as soon as my ride gets here im outta here i took a slow breath praying i wasnt making a mistake im going to call walter and tell him where you are and congratulate him on having such a wonderful second in command who convinced me to give you the statue there will be someone watching you if walter accepts my terms he takes you and walks away if not he can leave you cuffed to the table and you become jenkss responsibility jenks straightened and started to grin the way i figure it i said looking through the huge plateglass windows at nothing your alpha is one pissed puppy at you for having not only letting us slip through your fingers but then being careless enough to get taken and putting him in this awkward position i leaned close enough that my words were a palpable sensation of my will against his face if you cant convince him that were enough of a threat that he should accept my terms and back off for thirtysix hours and that because of your stellar negotiating skills that i will give it to you and you alone he will have no reason to keep your hide attached to your soul hes going to kill you unless you can redeem yourself not right away but hell do it a slow slide in the hierarchy giving everyone a shot at you on your way down so i think a thankyou to me is in order for giving you a surefire way back into his good graces bretts brown eyes were empty again telling me he was in big trouble i suggest i said seeing ivy and nick pull up in the van that you work really hard to get walter to see things my way unless you give him the focus youll be an ongoing reminder of his mistake of sending you against a superior foe without the proper understanding of what you were facing we might look like incompetent flakes but weve survived demons shaking inside i leaned away im giving you a chance to save your skin take it the weres eyes followed mine to the van maam he said slowly you are one hell of a negotiator i smiled and jenks and i both rose before ivy could come in thirtysix hours i said picking up my tea i tried to look confident and in control but i doubted i managed it brett cocked his head youre not going to give it to me youre stalling for time jenks took my elbow before i fell over and i forced myself not to show my angst maybe but hes going to kill you all the same i arched my eyebrows and tried to look tough what do you owe walter anyway the were dropped his eyes i turned aside shaking he had acknowledged me as his superior damn god help me jenks i whispered as i tottered to the door i hope he does it he will jenks glanced over his shoulder at brett walter will tear him apart slowly his green eyes met mine that was slick where did you learn so much about weres if youre beaten up by them twice in one week you start to pick things up i said leaning heavily on him jenks was quiet then you want me to have ivy call her vampire friend nodding i dropped my cup in the trash on the way out i felt as if a noose was closing even tighter but i didnt see any other options already my mind was making a list call ceri for the recipes i wanted that i didnt already have check the yellow pages for a spell shop that carried raw materials somewhere id have to sleep and come up with a plan maybe i thought as jenks opened the door for me and i stepped out into the late afternoon sun id get lucky and dream of one twentyseven it was one of the oddest charm outlets i had ever been in nothing like the richly scented earth magic shops i usually frequented being brightly lit against the dark and spacious and having a small spot up front to sit in cushy chairs and sip the marvelous coffee the owner made the shelves were glass and ley line paraphernalia was arranged like knickknacks jenks would have had an orgasm of delight there were only a small section of earth magic charms and the traditional redwood scent was largely overpowered by the aroma of ginger coming from the proprietors coffeemaker i felt strangely out of place thinking the banners with dragons and whitebearded wizards next to the crucibles made everything look silly an earth witch would have sneered at most of the ritual stuff in there but maybe thats what ley line magic used something was off with the merchandise though it didnt smell right literally ivy was halfway across the store with my basket of goodies after i snarled at her that i was fine and to stop hovering now i was sorry but she had been acting weird since picking jenks and me up at the malldepressed almost avoiding me but always nearand it was getting on my nerves it didnt help that i was feeling vulnerable my knees shaky from blood loss again now that jenkss streetgrade brimstone had worked itself out i had found the shop in the yellow pages and after i showered and stuffed myself on an entire box of macaroni and cheese ivy drove me over shed insisted saying the weres would know the moment i put my toe on the street they had and wed been followed by two street racers glowing blue and green neon from underneath it was worrisome but between the thirtysix hour truce my magic and ivys presence theyd probably leave us alone as i hoped walter had backed off jax had said the trio of weres in fatigues who picked brett up was rough but the lie that brett convinced me to release the statue to him alone had kept him alive i dont know why i cared i really didnt i think walter was using the time as i was fortifying defenses and getting everyone in place for a last attack if i reneged on our arrangement i was but if i did it right hed never guess it had been my intent from moment one the packs could not have the focus the thing was demon crafted and any power gained from it was artificial and would ultimately lead to their damnation dragging most of inderland along with them probably my phone was to my ear while i shopped with ceri five hundred miles away and standing in my kitchen with kisten ivy had asked him to watch the church and field the calls and i didnt want to know what my kitchen looked like with nothing between it and pixy chaos but a vampire ceri was off checking some point of charm and i could hear kisten talking to jenkss kids the muted familiar sounds of home were both comforting and depressing i picked up a large smoked bottle of generic fixative i could use for the demon transference curse blanching when i saw the price holy crap maybe i could get away with the smaller bottle i turned the smoked bottle over in my hand and squinted at the liquid it was supposed to have camphor in it but all i smelled was lavender i didnt like buying premade stuff but i was pressed for time seeing me holding the bottle ivy started my way to put it in the basket halting when i returned it to the shelf and frowned god help her but i wasnt that weak i could hold a stinking bottle of fixative without a brimstone boost i had fixed my own lunch today after the sandwich ivy gave me made my fingertips tingle i dont know how she managed to slip brimstone into it without me realizing but i was still mad from the two of them dosing me up without my knowledge even if the high from jenkss streetgrade brimstone had made the difference in where i was sleeping tonight picking up the smaller bottle of fixative i sighed feeling my knees shake maybe i should just accept the brimstone ivy kept pushing on me and let it go i was tired from simply walking around ivy wouldnt tell me how much blood shed taken and jenks was no help seeing as he thought a bleeding hangnail was reason for panic shades of gray i thought knowing i was slipping into places i had vowed id never go damn it i used to be able to see black and white but things got fuzzy right about the time i found my last is paycheck cursed my gaze drifted to the window black with night and acting like a mirror seeing my reflection i adjusted the collar of my little red jacket it went great with the black staff shirt from takatas last concert thanks to my last pain amulet nothing hurt but looking at my slumped stance i decided i didnt look tired i looked sick my gut clenched when i realized i looked like a vampires shadow welldressed thin sophisticatedand ill pulse hammering i turned away no more brimstone i thought ever there is black there is white gray is a cowardly excuse to mix our wants with our needs but i wasnt sure i could believe it anymore as i stood in a charm shop buying materials to twist a black curse just this once i thought just this once and never again phone still tucked to my ear i set the fixative down i would have hung up and called her back later but i was enjoying hearing the sounds of normalcy soft and distant five hundred miles away it seemed farther relaxing i reached for an elaborately inlaid wooden box it was beautiful and curiosity and a love for fine workmanship prompted me to open it to find it held magnetic chalk it was ungodly expensive and its presence solidified that there was a population of practicing ley line witches nearby i abruptly realized the proprietor was watching me over her coffee mug and i intentionally kept fiddling with the chalk inspecting the seals as if i was considering buying it i hated it when they watched me as though i might steal something like the illegal hex above the door that would give you zits wasnt enough of a deterrent technically a black spell i mused so why didnt i turn her in magnetic chalk ivy said from my elbow and i jumped almost dropping the phone between my ear and my shoulder i dont need it i said trying to cover my surprise especially in a box like that salt works just as well and you only have to vacuum when youre done reluctantly i let my fingers slip from the beautifully crafted container it was dovetailed the only metal on it the hinges latch and reinforced corners of black gold once the chalk was gone it would make an excellent place to store anything that needed extra precautions it was the nicest thing in the shop in my opinion my eyebrows rose at the package of herbs in the basket that i hadnt put there is that catnip i asked seeing the cellophane printed with little black footprints i thought rex might leave jax alone if she had something else to do brown eyes showing embarrassment she dropped a step away you okay do you want to sit down it was the third time shed asked since leaving the motel and i stiffened im fine i said liar i thought i was tired weary in heart and body the soft clatter of the phone being picked up rustled in my ear ceri i said before she could say anything just how much fixative do i need for the transference curse the sound of the pixies shrieking diminished and i guessed ceri had moved into the living room a thumb drop she said and i gratefully took up the smaller bottle my thumb i complained what is that about a teaspoon why cant they use normal measurements its a very old curse ceri snapped they didnt have teaspoons back then sorry i apologized my eyes meeting ivys as i placed the fixative into the basket ceri was one of the nicest most giving people i knew but she had a temper do you have a pencil the elf in hiding said politely but i could hear her annoyance at my impertinence i want you to write this down i know you have the inertia dampening curse in one of the books with you but i dont want you to translate the latin wrong i glanced at the proprietorwho was starting to eye ivy skulking aboutand turned my back on her maybe you could give me just the ingredients right now the clutter in my basket was odd enough already if the proprietor was worth her salt shed be able to tell i was making a disguise charm the only difference between my legal disguise charms and the illegal doppelganger spells was a point of law a few extra steps and a cellular sample of the person to copy i didnt think shed be able to tell i was also going to twist a demon curse to move the power from the statue to something else what she would make of the ingredients for the inertia damping demon curse was anyones guess ceri said it was a joke curse but it would work joke curse i thought sourly it was still black if i was caught id be labeled a black witch and magically castrated i wasnt fooling myself that this was anything other than wrong no saving the world crap it was wrong just this once echoed in my thoughts and i frowned thinking of nick telling al about me had probably started with just one harmless piece of information ceri sighed all you need for the joke curse is dust from inside a clock and black candles made from the fat of the unborn the rest is incantation and ritual the unborn i said in a horrified hushed whisper ceri you said it wasnt that bad the fat of an unborn pig she reiterated sounding angry honestly rachel my brow furrowed okay it was a fetal pig the same thing biology students dissect but it sounded close to the slaughteringgoatsinyourbasement kind of magic the transference curse looked harmless apart from the black it would put on my soul and the disguise charm was whiteillegal but white the inertiadampening curse was the worst of the lotand it was the one that would keep jenks alivea joke curse just this once i was so stupid stomach roiling my thoughts flicked to trent and his illegal labs which saved people so he could blackmail them into seeing things his way he at least didnt pretend to be anything other than what he was things had been a lot easier when i didnt have to think but what was i supposed to do walk away and let the world fall apart telling the is would make matters worse and giving the statue to the fib was a joke angry and sick inside i sidestepped ivy to get to the candles id already been there to pick out my colored candles for the transference curse behind the carved castles and colorful dragon eggs were the real goods arranged by color and size branded at the bottom with either what the fat had been rendered from or where they had first been lit the womans selection was surprisingly good but why they were hidden behind such crap was beyond me taper or barrel i asked ceri crouching to reach one with pig scratched on it you cant light a candle in a pig so it was a good bet thats where the fat had come from id never been in a ley line charm shop other than the universitys and that didnt count since they only carried what the classes needed maybe there was a spell that used dragon eggs but i thought they looked lame doesnt matter ceri answered and with the smallest taper in hand i turned and rose almost running into ivy she winced and backed up im fine i muttered setting the candle in the basket did you see any packaged dust ivy shook her head the tips of her black hair shifting about the bottom of her ears there was a rack of pixy dust by the register that was just glitter jenks would laugh his ass off maybe the real stuff was behind it like the candles you sound tired rachel ceri said question high in her voice as i moved to the rack im fine ceri said nothing and i added its stress just this once i want you to talk to kisten she said firmly as if she was doing me a favor oh god kisten what would he say if he knew ivy had bitten me i told you so or maybe my turn ceri i protested but it was too late and as ivy fingered a display of amber bottles that were good to store oilbased potions in kistens masculine voice came to me rachelhows my girl i blinked rapidly the threatened tears shocking me where had they come from ah im fine i said missing him terribly bad things had happened and id been carrying the pain since i needed to talk to him but not standing in a charm shop with ivy listening ivy had stiffened at the sudden emotion in my voice and i turned my back on her wondering if i should tell her that the glass container shaped like a full moon in her grip was generally used to store aphrodisiac potions good he said his voice going right through me can i talk to ivy surprised i turned to her but she had heard him and shook her head uh i stammered wondering if she was afraid of what hed say to her if he knew what had happened we were both chickenshit but we would be chickenshit together ivy i know you can hear me kisten said loudly you have a big problem waiting for you when you get back from your vacation everyone knows youre out of the city youre his scion not me i cant go up against even the youngest undead the only thing keeping a lid on this is that most of them are my patrons and they know if they act up ill ban them ivy walked off her boots loud against the hardwood floor her passive response surprised me something was really bothering her she walked away i said feeling guilty ivy had come up there to help me kistens sigh was heavy will you tell her that there was a riot in the mall downtown last night it was at four in the morning so it was mostly living vampires thank god and some weres the is handled it but its going to get worse i dont want a new master vampire in the city and neither does anyone else i stood before the rack of pixy dust and rifled through the hanging vials reading the tiny cards attached to each if piscary lost control of cincinnati trent would have free rein but i didnt think it was a power play by the undead vampires or trent it was more likely that the riot had been the mackinaw weres looking for me no wonder walter had agreed to a thirtysixhour truce he had to get his pack together tired i let the vials slip through my fingers im sorry kisten we have a couple of days before we can call this done it depends on how fast i can do the prep work he silently took that in and i could hear ceri singing with the pixies in the background can i help he asked and my throat tightened at the concern in his voice even as i heard his reluctance to leave cincinnati but there wasnt anything he could do it would be over one way or the other by tomorrow night no i said softly but if we dont call you by tomorrow midnight were in trouble and ill fly up there in two hours he assured me are you sure theres nothing i can do call someone anything shaking my head i fingered a book on how to knot love charms from hair these things were illegal small towns have very little in the way of policing witches but then i saw that it was a fake a novelty item we have it okay i said will you feed mr fish for me sure ivy told me he only needs four grains i rushed any more and youll kill him dont worry about it ive had fish before and stay out of my room i added he started making a fake radio hiss whistling and popping rachel the connection is going bad he said laughing i think im losing you a smile the first in days touched me i love you too i said and he stopped there was a suspicious hesitation are you okay he asked worry slid through me he was starting to pay attention why i said realizing my hand had gone up to cover my neck um yeah i reiterated thinking it had sounded guilty im just stressed nick i hesitated i couldnt tell him nick had been playing kissandtell it was embarrassing to have been that stupid i told nick to kiss off and it bothered me i said not really a lie not really he was silent then okay can i talk to ivy relieved i exhaled into the mike sure i handed the phone to ivywho had come up behind me to listen presumablybut she closed the top and handed it back he can handle it a few days more she said then turned to the counter do you have everything its getting late tension edged her voice she was trying to hide her mood but not doing very well concerned i took the basket from her everything but the dust maybe she has some behind the counter god im tired i finished without thinking ivy didnt say anything and i put the basket on the counter eyeing the aphrodisiac bottle ivy set by her catnip what ivy said seeing me look at it nothing why dont you put your stuff in with mine she shook her head im going to get something else too but thanks the woman behind the counter set her coffee on her stained hot plate her fingers reaching to take my things out of the basket will that be all then ladies she asked hiding her wariness of ivy behind her professionalism you dont happen to have clock dust i asked feeling it was a lost cause immediately she lost her tinge of her nervousness from stopped clocks sure enough i do how much do you need thank the turn i said leaning against the counter as my muscles started to feel the weight of standing too long i didnt want to have to go to art van and dust their floor samples i just need a uh pinch pinch dash smidgen yeah real exact measurements ley line magic sucked the woman glanced at the front door be but a sec she said then with the fixative in her hand she went into a back room i stared at ivy she took my stuff i said bewildered ivy shrugged maybe she thinks youre going to run out the door with it it seemed like forever but the woman came back her loud steps warning us here you go she said carefully setting a tiny black envelope down with the fixative the bottle now had a string tag around it with an expiration date i picked it up feeling a different weight to it this isnt the same bottle i said suspiciously and the woman smiled thats the real product she explained there arent enough witches up here to support a charm shop so i mix tourist trinkets with the real stuff why sell real fixative to a fudgie when theyre just going to put it on a shelf and pretend they know what to do with it i nodded now realizing what had been bothering me its all fake none of it is real most of its real she said her ringed fingers punching the register with a stiff firmness but not the rare items she looked at my pile let me see youre making an earth magic disguise charm a ley line inertia joke spell and she hesitated what on earth are you going to use the fixative for i dont sell much of that im fixing something i said guardedly crap what if the weres found out they might realize i was going to move the power of the artifact before we blew it up if i asked her to keep quiet about it she would likely blab it all over the place its for a joke i added her eyes flicked to ivy and she grinned mums the word she said is it for that gorgeous hunk of man with you saints preserve us hes beautiful id love to trick him she laughed and i managed a weak smile did the entire city know jenks ivy rocked back a step in irritation and the woman finished wrapping my black candle in matching tissue paper and bundled everything into a paper sack still smiling she totaled it up itll be with tax she said clearly satisfied i stifled my sigh and swung my shoulder bag forward to get my wallet this was why i had a witchs gardenand a clan of pixies to maintain it not only was ley line magic stupid but it was expensive if you didnt render your own fetal pigs for making candles just this once ivy pushed her two things forward and looking the proprietor in the eye said clearly just put it on my bill i need three ounces of special k medicinal grade please my lips parted and i flushed special k that was cincy slang for brimstone k of course said to stand for kalamack but the woman hesitated only briefly not from the is are you she asked warily not anymore ivy muttered and flustered i turned my back on them ivy saw nothing wrong with an illegal drug that had kept vampire society healthy and intact for untold years but buying in front of me made me feel all warm and fuzzy ivy i protested when the woman disappeared into the back room again trents ivy gave me a sidelong glance eyebrows high its the only brand ill buy and i need to restock my cache you used it all im not taking any more i hissed then straightened when the woman returned holding a palmsized package wrapped in masking tape medicinal she said glancing at the aphrodisiac bottle you store it in that lucky duck and youll be the one thats going to need medical attention ivys face blanked in surprise and i dragged my bag from the counter ready to flee its an aphrodisiac bottle i said dont pick things up unless you know what they arealexia ivy looked as guiltless as a puppy as she dropped the package into her open purse the woman smiled at us and ivy counted out thirteen hundreddollar bills and coolly handed them over i blinked holy shit kalamacks medicinal stuff was five times as expensive as the street variety keep the change ivy said taking my elbow and moving me to the door twelve hundred dollars i had sucked down twelve hundred dollars of drugs in less than twentyfour hours and that wasnt counting jenkss contribution i dont feel well i said putting a hand to my stomach you just need some air ivy guided me across the store and took my bag from me there was the jingle of the door and a flush of cool air it was dark and cold on the street matching my mood behind us came the sliding sound of an oiled lock and the closed sign flickered on the stores posted hours were from noon to midnight but after a sale like that you deserved to go home early fumbling i put a hand on the bench under a blue and white trolleystop sign and sat down i didnt want to chance spewing in kistens corvette it was the only thing we could drive around town in now that the truck had been seen fleeing a crash and neither ivy nor i wanted to get in the van shit my roommates were turning me into a brimstone addict ivy gracefully folded herself to sit beside me all the while scanning the street medicinal grade is processed six times she said to pull out the endorphin stimulants hallucinogenic compounds and most of the neuron stimulators to leave only the metabolism upper technically speaking the chemical structure is so different its not brimstone thats not helping i said putting my head between my knees there was gum stuck to the sidewalk and i nudged it with my toe finding it hardened to an immovable lump from the cold breathe one two three exhale one two three four then how about if you hadnt taken it youd be laying in bed needing jenkss help to use the bathroom i pulled my head up and took a breath that helps but im still not taking any more she gave me a shortlived closelipped smile and i watched her face go as empty as the dark street i didnt want to get up yet i was tired and it was the first time we had been together alone sincesince the bite returning to the motel room with jenks jax the kitten and nick to make my peachykeen illegal charms and black curses had all the appeal of eating cold lima beans a station wagon passed us the muffler spewing a blue smoke that would have earned the driver a ticket in cincinnati i was cold and i hunched into my coat it was only eleventhirty but it looked like four in the morning you okay ivy said obviously having seen me shiver cold i said feeling like a hypochondriac ivy crossed her legs at her knees sorry she whispered i lifted my gaze finding her expression lost in the shadow from the streetlight behind her its not your fault i didnt bring my winter coat for biting you she said her voice low her attention touched upon my stitches then dropped to the pavement surprised i scrambled to put my thoughts in order id thought i was going to be the one to bring this up our pattern had always been ivy does something to scare me ivy tells me what i did wrong i promise ivy not to do it we never bring it up again now she wanted to talk well im not i finally said ivys head came up shock shone from her dark eyes raw and unhidden you said on the phone that youd done some thinking she stammered that you were going to make smarter decisions youre leaving the firm arent you as soon as this run is over suddenly i saw her depression in an entirely new light and i almost laughed in relief for my misunderstanding im not leaving the firm i said i meant smarter decisions on who i trusted i dont want to leave i want to try to find a blood balance with you ivys lips parted turned as she was to me the streetlight glinted on her perfect teeth and then she snapped her mouth shut surprise i said weakly my pulse fast this was the scariest thing id done in a whileincluding standing down three were packs for six heartbeats ivy stared at me then she shook her head no she said firmly resettling herself to face forward and put herself in shadow you dont understand i lost control if jenks hadnt interfered i would have killed you jenks is right im a danger to everyone i care about you have no idea how hard it is to find and maintain a blood relationship especially if i leave you unbound her voice was calm but i could hear panic in it and im by god not going to bind you to me to make it easier if i do everything would be what i want not what we want i thought of jenkss warning and had a doubt then remembered kisten telling me of her past and felt a stab of fear but the memory of her heavy sobs as she lay crumpled on the pavement filled me the despair in her eyes when jenks said she ruined everything she cared about no he had said she ruined everything she loved and seeing that same despair hiding in her fierce words determination filled me i couldnt let her believe that you said i needed to trust the right people i said softly heart pounding i hesitated i trust you ivy threw her hands in the air in exasperation and turned to face me god rachel i could have killed you as in dead you know what that means dead i do my own ire flared and i sat up yeah welli can be a little more savvy i said belligerently i can take some responsibility for keeping things under control be a little more aware of whats going on and not let you lose yourselflike that well do better next time there isnt going to be a next time stoic and unmoving ivy sat deathly still the streetlight glinted on her short hair and she stared at the shadowy pavement intermittently lit from yellow bulbs abruptly she turned to look at me you say you want to find a blood balance but you just refused to take more brimstone you cant have your cake and eat it too witch you want the blood ecstasy you need the brimstone to stay alive she thought this was about the ecstasy insulted she thought me that shallow my lips pressed together this isnt about you being ms good feeling and filling me with thatthat euphoria i said angrily i can get that from any vamp on the riverfront this is about me being your friend emotion poured over her face you made it very clear you dont want to be that kind of a friend she said loudly and if you arent then theres no way i can do this i tried to fix myself but i cant the only way i can keep from killing people now is if i shackle the hunger with love damn it and you dont want me to touch you that way id never seen her show her feelings like this but i wasnt going to back downeven though she was starting to scare me oh get off it ivy i said sliding a few inches from her its obvious from yesterday that you can share blood without sleeping with someone she gaped at me and i flushed okay i admit itit didnt turn out all that well but god it kind of surprised both of us we just need to go slow you dont have to have sex to find a feeling of closeness and understanding lord knows i feel that way about you use that to shackle your hunger my face flushed hot in the cool night air isnt that what love is she continued to look at me hiding her emotions again behind her black eyes so you almost killed me i said i let you do it the point is i saw you for one instant you were the person you want to be strong and comfortable with who she is and what she needs with no guilt and at peace with herself ivy went pale in the streetlight terrified embarrassed i looked away to give her time to cover her raw emotions i liked being able to put you there i said softly its a hell of a good feeling better than the euphoria i want to put you there again iliked seeing you like that ivy stared at me her hope so fragile it hurt to see it there was a sheen of moisture to her eyes and she didnt say anything just sat with a stiff frightened posture i dont know if i can do this i admitted talking because she wasnt but i dont want to pretend it didnt happen can we just agree that it did and play it day by day taking a breath ivy broke out of her stance it happened she said voice shaking its not going to happen again i leaned forward to protest but she interrupted me with a quick why didnt you use your magic to stop me surprised i sat back ii didnt want to hurt you she blinked fast and i knew she was trying not to cry you trusted that i wouldnt kill you even by accident she asked her perfect face was again blank of emotion but i knew it was the only way she had to protect herself remembering what kisten had once said about living vampires craving trust nearly as much as they craved blood i nodded but the memory was followed by fear he also said piscary had warped her into something capable of mindlessly killing what she loved so he could lap up her despair when she came to him shamed and broken but she was not that same person not anymore i trusted you i whispered i still do a truck was approaching the headlights shining on her face to show a shiny track of moisture thats why we cant do this rachel she said and i was afraid that piscary might own her still the approaching panel truck drove past too slowly a sliver of warning brought me still and i watched it without appearing to taking the cold night air smelling of diesel fuel deep into me the truck braked too long and was hesitant when it made the turn yes i saw it ivy said when my shoes scraped the cement we should get back to the room peter will be here by sunup she was ending the conversation but i wasnt going to let her go that easy ivy i said as i rose gathering my bag from beside hers wanting to try again i she jerked to her feet shocking me to silence dont she said eyes black in the streetlight just dont i made a mistake i just want everything to be the way it was but i didnt twentyeight there was an unfamiliar car next to nicks dented pickup when we pulled into the motels lot ivy was driving and i watched her eyes go everywhere before she turned the wheel and stopped in an open spot it was a black bmw with a rental sticker at least it appeared black it was hard to tell in the streetlight engine still running ivy looked at it her gaze giving nothing away thinking walter had changed his mind i went to get out wait ivy said and i tensed from our room a shaft of light spilled from a curtain being pulled aside nicks long face peered out and upon seeing us he let the fabric fall ivy cut the engine the low rumble dying to leave only the memory of it echoing okay she said now you can get out i would have gotten out even if it had been water but relieved i yanked the door open and eased from the leather seats our cutshort conversation at the trolley stop had left me unsettled id let her think all she had to do was say no and everything was settled but she would be replaying the conversation in her head for days and when the time was right i was going to bring it up again maybe over a carton of red curry takeout i got our bags from the back their soft rattle mixing with the aggressive rumble of the streetracer escort we had to the motel i hate plastic ivy said taking the bags from me and rolling them so they quit rattling the door to our room opened and i squinted at the light so thats why ivy always used canvas bags it wasnt because she was especially ecominded they were quiet the light cut off as nick slipped out and eased the door shut behind him the street weres in the lot across the road revved their cars and i waved sarcastically to them they didnt wave back but i saw the flicker of a lighter when they lit up and settled in nick looked more than a little concerned as he came to meet us his eyes fixed on the weres his tall gaunt stature still leaned slightly and he favored his left foot your vampire friends are here he said pulling his attention from the weres to touch on the black bmw they flew in from chicago on a puddle jumper soon as the sun was down my attention jerked to the motel room door and i stopped moving great i looked like warmedup crap what are they doing here already i asked no one in particular they arent supposed to be here until almost dawn i dont have any of my spells made up yet ivy looked bothered too apparently they wanted some time to settle in before sunrise she said running her hands down her leather pants and tugging her coat straight rudely knocking nicks shoulder she pushed past him i fell into place behind her ignoring nick trying to get my attention jenks had been running interference for me telling nick i was tired from too much spelling and the scuffle with the weres he didnt know ivy and i had had a blood tryst and though i didnt give a fig leaf what the bastard thought i was guiltily glad that the collar of my jacket made it hard to see my tiny stitches ivy walked in without preamble dropping the bags just inside the door and moving to the three people at the table by the curtained window they looked terribly out of place in the lowceilinged room full of beds and our suitcases and it would have been obvious who was in charge even if ivy hadnt stopped before the oldest gracefully executing a soft bow that was reminiscent of a martial arts student to her instructor he smiled to show a slip of teeth and no warmth i took a slow breath this might be a little hairy delavine was one of chicagos higher master vampires and he looked it dressed in dark slacks and a linen shirt he had trimmed and styled sandcolored hair a youthful face and a sparse frame that gave him an ageless look it was probably a charm that kept him looking a late thirtysomething most likely he was wrinkled and twisted vampires usually spent every last penny of their first life using a yearly witch potion to look as young as they wanted his eyes were dark showing only the slightest widening of pupils a twinge came from my neck when his gaze traveled lightly over me in dismissal his attention returned to ivy making me both relieved and ticked he thought i was her shadow how nice was that delavine sat like a king surrounded by his court a glass of water on the scratched table beside him and his legs confidently crossed atop the back of an empty chair was a carefully folded long cashmere coat everyone else was still wearing theirs he had the air of someone who had taken time out of his busy schedule to personally take his child to the doctors office and was waiting to see how they were going to help his little boy get over the chicken pox though concerned he wasnt worried he reminded me of trent but where trent moved on logic delavine clearly moved out of hunger or a forgotten sense of responsibility rex sat in the middle of the floor before him head cocked as if trying to figure out what he was im right there with you cat standing behind delavine was a living vampire the woman was nervous an unusual emotion for a highblood vampire she was thin and graceful which was a trick since she was kind of big on top and hippy her straight unstyled long hair was graying though she looked no older than me if not for her worry she would have been beautiful hauntedlooking her eyes constantly moved landing on me more often than not clearly she wasnt comfortable with this her hands were on the shoulders of a second seated vampire peter he was obviously ailing sitting as if trying to pull himself straight but not quite able to manage it his vivid blue eyes were surprising against his black hair and dark complexion pain showed in the tension his pleasant expression carried and i could smell an herb that should have been prescription only but wasnt because humans didnt know it was a massive painkiller when mixed with baking powder his slacks and casual shirt were as expensive looking as his mentors but they and his coat hung on him as if he had lost a lot of weight he seemed in full control of his faculties despite the painkiller his gaze meeting mine with the look of someone seeing their savior i didnt like that if things went as planned i was going to kill him shades of gray just this once gotta save the world and all that nick edged in behind me moving furtively to the kitchen where he leaned against the sink with his arms crossed the bulb over the stove making him even more gaunt i imagined he was trying to stay unnoticed but no one wanted to acknowledge his existence anyway between nick and the vampires jenks sat crosslegged on the couch beside the artifact i had put the ugly thing in his keeping and he took the task seriously he looked odd sitting like that but the hard slant to his eyes balanced out his prissyboy image ivys sword across his knees helped too the vampires were ignoring him if i was lucky theyd ignore me delavine ivy said respectfully dropping her coat on the bed and inclining her head she had the air of a favored messenger that was to be treated well the undead vampire lifted a hand in acknowledgment and she turned to peter peter she said more casually gesturing for him to remain seated as she shook his hand ivy tamwood the ailing vampire said pleasantly his voice resonant for his narrow diseasethin body ive heard much about your good works thank you for seeing me good works i thought then remembered the missingperson runs that had populated her schedule during the first three months of our firms existence its a pleasure to meet you he continued releasing her hand you can imagine the uproar you put my house in when you called he smiled but i saw a tinge of fear shhhh the undead vampire admonished sensing it and patting his knee its a moment of pain nothing you havent lived your entire life with it was the first time he had spoken and his voice carried an accent so faint it showed only in a soft lengthening of vowels peter dropped his eyes head bobbing i thought i was going to be sick this was wrong i didnt want to do it i hadnt wanted to from the first we could find another way delavine peter ivy said motioning for me to come forward this is my partner rachel morgan it will be her spells that will make this work i couldnt help but notice that the woman behind them was being disregarded and didnt seem to have a problem with that feeling like a prize mule i took off my cap and shambled forward conscious of my hatflattened hair my faded jeans and my staff tshirt at least it was clean pleasure to meet you sir i said not offering my hand to delavine no freaking way peter i added shaking his he smiled to show me his teeth his hand cold as it slipped into mine there was a strength to his grip but i could see the fear in his eyes i couldnt do this rachel morgan the ailing vampire said his gaze touching upon my neck and politely rising back to my eyes id like to talk to you about why i rachel delavine interrupted softly and i started i want to see you come here my gaze jerked to ivy and my pulse leapt her face was blank of emotion and with that comfortable thought i turned to him when dealing with an unfamiliar vampire it was always better to acknowledge their existence then talk to their subordinates unless they showed an interest oh god i didnt want to be interesting so you will free my peter of his mortal pain he said his voice going right to the bottom of my lungs and making it hard for me to breathe yes sir i looked him in the eye and fought the familiar rising pull of tingles he gazed back more than a hint of testing seduction in his widening pupils behind me i felt ivy step forward and from the corner of my sight jenks slowly uncrossed his legs to put his feet on the floor tension pulled through me and though delavines focus never moved from me i knew he was becoming aware that i wasnt for casual use and discard despite what i looked like the refined man stood in a soft rustle and i retreated a step common sense overpowering my desire to appear cavalier rex too got to her feet stretching before going to twine about the vampires feet i forced myself to breathe and ivys presence behind me imparted a feeling of security i knew was false my legs felt questionable and his pupils widened when he sensed it im not afraid i thought lying to myself well not any more than would help keep me alive i know you delavine said and i steeled myself against the pheromones he was kicking out he reached forward and i stifled my jerk when he arranged a strand of wild hair your youth distracted me i almost didnt see since youre all but ignorant of yourself youre kalamacks witch im not his i dont work for him much i protested putting little weight behind it then stiffened when he distinctly pushed ivy out of the way and circled behind me i heard her fall back catching herself but not protesting in the kitchen nick paled jenks stood his sword gripped tightly peter looked distressed and the woman tensed delavine was aware of everyone but focused entirely on me you are a remarkable woman the undead vampire said from behind my shoulder there were no tingles no hint of passion but it was coming i could feel it simmering under his silky voice and your skinso perfect not a mark from the sun but bless my soul he said with a mocking slowness someonehas bitten you he exhaled and my eyes closed when a wash of bliss rose from my new wound melting my fear like spun sugar he was bespelling me i knew it i couldnt fight it and god help me i wanted to all i could manage was a small sound in protest when his fingers moved the collar of my leather jacket aside no ivy whispered fear in her voice my eyes opened only to be caught by delavines he was before me now a hand raised against ivy behind me rex twined about my feet purring this wasnt supposed to happen this is not what was supposed to happen jenkss face was drawn tight he had been told not to interfere knew it would make matters worse beyond him nick was stiff with horror i didnt think it stemmed from delavine i think it was from the new stitches on my neck and what they meant ivy had bitten me and my face warmed at his unvoiced accusation he thought i had failed that i had let my passions rule me and let ivy take advantage of it my jaw clenched and my chin rose it was none of nicks business what i did with whom and i hadnt given in because of passion i had tried to understand her or maybe myself but delavine took it as defiance and gently caressed the sore edges of my bite adrenaline jerked through me my weakened pulse tried to absorb it and failed i gasped when feeling raced from his soft brush against the healing wound streaming through me both familiar and alien since it came from an unfamiliar vampire the difference struck a chord in me i hadnt known was there and my vision darkened when my blood loss couldnt cope with the new demand jenks moved from the edge of my sight i saw ivy crash into him sorry she grunted making a mallet of her hands by covering her fist with another and slamming it into his head mouth open nick stood in the kitchen watching the pixys eyes roll up and him drop like a stone unconscious the human backed up until he could back up no more he thought ivy had given me to delavine what she had done was save jenkss life and probably everyone elses since a pitched fight would set delavine off this way only i would die let me delavine whispered for me alone and he circled with rex trailing happily behind him the vampire scenting everything weighing calculating my breath came in a heave and i held it my knees were locked to keep me upright ivy couldnt do a thing and i could hear her frustration in her breathing as she forced herself to not interfere she couldnt best delavine not without leaning on piscarys strength and she was out of his influence delavine knew it that we had invited him here to help peter meant little bitten and unbound the undead vampire said and a shudder rippled through me free for the taking i sense two demon marks on you i feel two bites but only one reached your soul and so carefullyso careful she was a kiss so soft but a whisper and someonesomeone has put their mark in your verycells claimed by many belonging to none who would look to me to get you back no one i rasped and his eyes fixed on mine stilling my next word i stood upright under his control and would have fallen if his will wasnt propping me up please ivy whispered standing beside jenks slumped on the floor i beg favor with a light interest delavine touched the unscared side of my neck what he said leave her as mine ivys pale face made her eyes look even blacker i ask this as a thankyou for helping peter she licked her lips and held her arms down please delavine lifted his eyes from me and i blinked finding a thread of will returned to me this the vampire said lifting my chin with a finger should belong to a master not you piscary has indulged you beyond reason youre a spoiled child ivy and you should be punished for stepping out of your masters influence taking her as mine will bother kalamack and put me in good with piscary ivys eyes flicked to me and away i could almost feel her thoughts realign themselves and my pulse hammered when her posture melted from tense to seductive god save us she was going to give him what he wanted so he would leave me alone i couldnt let her do this i couldnt let her turn herself into filth for me but as tingles raced through me to set my mind confused i could only watch such a sweet sip delavine said his back to ivy a new glint was in his eyes making me unsure if he was talking about ivy or me a wolf in sheeps clothing stinking of brimstone but still very weak he said i might kill you by mistake witch but youd enjoy it he inhaled taking my volition exhaling his breath under my ear sent a jolt of desire right to my core do you want this he breathed no i whispered it was easy ivy had given me the fear to find the strength to say it but delavine was delighted no he exclaimed his pupils wide and dilated his lustreddened lips curling upward curiouser and curiouser his fingers traced the line along my shoulder that i knew he wanted to send his nails digging to cause pain and a delicious path of blood to my neck that his mouth could follow eyes on mine he smiled to show his long canines the thought of them sinking into me pulled a shiver from the depths of my soul i knew how it would feel and the fear of my blood being raped from me mixed with the memory of how good it could be i closed my eyes starting to hyperventilate fighting him losing to him delavine eased closer almost touching i could sense his need to crush my will rise higher he didnt care about peter not anymore i was too damn interesting so strong a will he said i could flake your consciousness from your soul like stone he moved and behind him i saw ivy gather her resolve no i pleaded silently but her fear for me was stronger than her fear for herself guilt shame and relief kept me silent when shifting forward with a sigh to tell him where she was she touched delavines shoulder i watched in horror and fascination as ivys long leg slipped between his from behind she curved a sinuous arm around his chest so that her fingertips played with the base of his neck tilting her head she sent her lips to mouth his ear and while delavine looked at me with ivy bringing his hunger fully awake she whispered please my blood pounded as she put her teeth on his ear and tugged im fond of her she added i want to keep her the way she is delavine took his eyes from me and i felt the tears start even as the vampire pheromones and watching them play whipped my libido high this was so wrong ivy flowed around him to get between us standing with her legs wide she ran her hands over him between his suit coat and shirt she threw her head back and a laugh of delight came from her shocking me i can feel your scars she giggled turning it into a soft desirefilled sound of deviltry at the end she was ivy but she wasnt playful sensual and domineering this was a side of her she hadnt wanted to show me this was ivy doing what she did best both captivated and repulsed i couldnt look away as she bent her lips to his neck and his eyes closed he exhaled his hands trembling as he grasped her wrists and held them down tonight ivy whispered loud enough for me to hear and delavine opened his eyes smiling wickedly as he met my gaze bring her alone she countered pulling her hands from his grip to explore his inner thigh what i want to do would kill her she laughed ending with an eager moan the playful sound of desire turned my stomach this was probably what she had been in those years she wouldnt talk about and she was returning to it to keep me safe god how did i get to this place where my friends sell themselves to keep me alive ivy shifted doing something i couldnt see to make delavines eyes widen peter hissed and i wasnt surprised to find a jealous sullen expression on his face the woman behind him was running her fingers over him in distraction but it didnt appear to be helping innocence can be exhilarating ivy murmured but experience theres a reason piscary indulges me she said the syllables as certain and warm as summer rain to make my pulse quicken would you like to knowwhy not many do delavine smiled piscary will not be pleased piscary is in prison she said pouting and im lonely the pheromones they were kicking out had tingles of passion pulsing through me i was either going to climax where i stood or vomit ivy had left skimmer and followed me here to escape her past and now she was returning to it to save my life i was going to unwittingly kill her i made her bite me and now she was whoring herself to keep me safe she thought i was going to save her but i was going to kill her all but forgotten peter stirred please delavine he said sullenly and i despaired at the filth i was wallowing in the system that ivy had worked within her entire life she knows the spells peter continued i hurt so badly delavine let go of my will my pulse beat wildly and with his support ripped away my muscles gave a massive spasm and went limp barely conscious i crumpled for you peter i heard from above me as i worked my arms under me so i could push my face off the floor dizzy i wedged myself into a seated position the undead vampire was ignoring me his gaze tracking the perimeter of the room ivy had unwrapped herself from him and was standing at the curtained window her head bowed as she tried to bring herself down guilt hit me and i took a breath that was almost a cry there are a few things i want from this delavine was saying having apparently forgotten me lying on the floor peter wants his last sight to be of the setting sun that can be accommodated ivy said softly her voice was still husky and i ignored the memory of hearing it whisper in my ear head down i crawled to jenks checking his pulse and pulling back his eyelids to see if his eyes dilated he was okay and i slumped against the front of the couch content to stay on the floor ivy wouldnt look at me and quite frankly i didnt want her to how couldhow could i ever repay her for this accommodated delavine scooped up rex and looked into her green eyes the cat looked away first there is no accommodate do it yes delavine ivy turned and i stifled a shudder at the thinnest brown rim to her eyes they were almost fully dilated and just standing there breathing she looked like she wanted to pin someone to the floor and have at it peter looked ticked that ivy was taking something from his mentor that he wanted and peters future scion was frightened as she saw her future turned into nothing more than a source of blood and memory when peter died she would have a shell of the man she fell in love with she knew it but she wanted it all the same im concerned about possible damage to his facial structure delavine said gently setting rex down and going to peter not a hint of his blood lust showed but i could feel it shimmering under his voice auto crashes can be extremely disfiguring and peter has suffered so many indignities already from the floor i watched delavine run a finger down peters jawline the touch both possessive and distant it was nauseating peters temper eased his manner softening yes delavine ivy said the charms will minimize that oh yeah thats why they had come to the motel i uh i jerked when everyones eyes fell on me i need a swab of peters mouth so i can sensitize the disguise charm to him ivys hunger was chilling recognizing my fear she pushed herself into motion going into the kitchen and my spelling supplies strewn all over creation nick backpedaled out of her way head down she shuffled about striding back to peter with a cellophanewrapped cotton swab i would have at least watched to be sure peter gave a gloppy enough sample but delavine was moving again i pulled myself into a ball as he headed for me fingers grasping i fumbled for ivys sword pulling it awkwardly out from where jenks had let it fall this was wrong so wrong delavine gave me a raised eyebrow glance then dismissed me as he picked up the artifact sitting alone and vulnerable on the bedside table he had looked at me but it had been different he had seen me calculated the risk and dismissed me but this time hed looked at me as a possible threat and not just a walking sack of blood i wondered what had changed this is it he murmured casually moving out of the swords easy reach my fingers tightened on the hilt but i didnt think it was the blade that had him watching me while seeming not to ivy came closer the open cellophanewrapped swab in her grip she seemed to have regained control only a remnant of her runaway hunger perceptible in her subtlest movements it will be destroyed with peter she said but delavine wasnt listening focused entirely on the ugly statue perched on the tips of his fingers such a wonder he mused aloud so many lives ended forever because of it it should have been destroyed when it was unearthed but someone got greedyand now theyre dead i amwiser than that if i cant have it no one will delavine took the thumb of his free hand and pierced the tip of his index finger peter yes delavine i held my breath as a drop of blood welled with a careful attention the undead vampire smeared it onto the statue a shudder passed over me as it soaked in to leave a dark stain make sure delavine said softly that this gets destroyed he looked at me and smiled to show his long canines yes delavine with a confident satisfaction delavine set the marked statue down my lips curled as it seemed to me that the pain etched in the figures face was deeper turning with an exaggerated slowness the undead vampire sent his gaze across the room landing on nick scrunched in the corner of the kitchen this is repulsive he said and suddenly the room was a dirty little hole stinking of emotion well stay somewhere else peter we are leaving audrey will make the arrangements to get you where you need to be come sunset audrey i thought glancing at the woman so she had a name i shifted my feet so he wouldnt step on them and he made his casual way to the door snagging his coat on the way peter slowly rose audrey helping him with a professional grip that wouldnt hurt her back the ailing vampire met my eyes clearly wanting to talk to me but delavine took his other arm in a show of concern born from memory not love and escorted him to the door ivy opened it for them and delavine hesitated while peter and audrey continued out my grip tightened on the hilt but i could do nothing when the vampire bent to whisper in ivys ear his hand curving about her waist possessively my pulse pounded as she looked at the floor damn it this wasnt right she nodded and i felt as if i had sold her to him the door shut behind him and her shoulders slumped twentynine ivy shut up i dropped the sword and pulled my knees to my chin to make room when she knelt beside jenks with her vampire strength she yanked him upright to lean against the couch giving him a shake jenks she demanded open your eyes i didnt hit you that hard he didnt respond his head lolling and blond hair falling about his angular features ivy im sorry i said my pulse quickening in guilt youoh god tell him you changed your mind well figure something out close beside me ivy gave me an unreadable look her hands on jenkss shoulders her oval face empty of emotion i wouldnt have offered if i wasnt prepared to follow through ivy shut up she shouted startling me i want to do it okay i cant touch anything without killing it so im going to go back to things that are already dead im doing this for me not you im going to enjoy myself so just shut the hell up rachel face hot my mouth fell open it had never occurred to me she might want to ii thought you only shared blood with people you yeah i tried that didnt i it didnt work if i cant have you i may as well go back to the way i was shut up i shut up i didnt know what to think was she saying that to make me feel less guilty or was she serious she had damn well looked like she knew what she was doing wrapped around delavine like that i couldnt believe she really meant it not after her confession only an hour old apparently we were both going places we didnt want tome forward and her back ivy i said but she wouldnt look at me jenks she said spots of color showing on her cheeks wake up his breathing quickened and it was no surprise when his smooth features scrunched in hurt eyes still closed he reached for his head nick had come out of the kitchen standing to look like a fifth wheel beside the tv arms crossed over his faded tshirt rex was having a field day purring and rubbing on everyone clearly happy we were on her level ow jenks said when his fingertips found the bump and his eyes flew open you hit me he shouted and ivy let go he fell against the couch anger in his green eyes until he saw me beside him probably looking as bad as i felt his gaze shot to the empty table then searched until he found the statue holy crap what did i miss he said sorry ivy stood and offered him a hand up he would have killed you so she hit him and risked giving him a concussion yeah that made sense his gaze went to me and my breath caught at the fear in it are you all right did he touch you of course he touched me i said getting to my feet and wavering until i found my balance hes an undead vampire they cant look without touching they cant not touch im a freaking vampire candy cane and they all want a lick damn it all to hell jenks rose touching the back of his head when it probably protested at the quick motion stupid pixy stupid greenassed mosswipe thumb up my ass pixy you knocked me out cold ivy jenks i protested leave her alone but he wasnt mad at her he was mad at himself tagged by a whiny little vamp he said gesturing rache take this sword and stick it in me just go and stick it in me im a backdrafted crumpledwinged dustcaked dewassed excuse of a backup worthless as a pixy condom taken down by my own partner just tape my ass shut and let me fart out my mouth i blinked impressed rex was twining about my feet and needing some comfort i picked her up immediately she jumped to the couch and bounced to jenks stretching against his leg the pixy yelped when she flexed her claws into him and the kitten skittered under the bed look she drew blood rache your damn orange cat scratched me im bleeding rex jax shouted coming out from behind the top of the curtain dad you scared her rex are you okay he darted under the bed after her that is so unsafe i muttered tired i hobbled to the kitchen to get away from jenks who had collapsed onto the bed and was holding his leg as if rex had hit a femoral vein i jerked to a stop before i ran into nick hi nick i muttered hitting the k with an excess amount of force get out of my way i have a lot to do before i kill peter and ivy goes on her big date his long face worried he took a breath to say something i wasnt going to listen i owed him nothing feeling like i was eighty years old i shambled around him i can help he said and i dropped into one of those nasty kitchen chairs put my elbows on the table and slumped forward i was tired hungry and ticked i had completely lost control of my life it wasnt a simple snag and drag anymore no now i had to save the world from my former boyfriend and my roommate from herself what the hell why not ivy had gotten my bags from where she dropped them by the front door silent and clearly embarrassed she set them on the table making a show of putting peters swab before me jenks had apparently decided he wasnt bleeding to death and with his very lack of movement pulled my attention to him standing he first looked at the artifact then flicked his gaze at nick i nodded understanding with a casual slowness jenks picked up the artifact and limped forward my eyes were on nick from around the curtain my fallen curls made my stomach caved in when nick watched jenks without appearing to he wanted it he still wanted to snatch it from us and sell it to the highest bidder even if it would mean id have to go into hiding to keep the weres from tracking me down and killing me for it whether he would or not was still unanswered but he was considering it son of a bitch the vampbloodied artifact was set thumping down in front of me and jenks pulled the bags closer to indulge his pixy curiosity catnip he said pulling it out and opening it its for rex ivy volunteered suddenly sounding shy of all things a grin flashed over jenks and he made a soft trill of a whistle immediately jax buzzed out from under the bed catnip the small pixy shouted grabbing a handful and darting away oh hey fudge jenks exclaimed finding the halfpound box i had bought to replace what hed lost is this mine he asked green eyes alight i nodded trying to stifle my anger at nick jenks enthusiastically leaned against the counter and opened the box bypassing the plastic knife he broke off about a third of it and took a huge bite ivy watched appalled and i shrugged his mouth moving as he hummed jenks finished unpacking the sacks i was half dead ivy was whoring herself to keep me safe but jenks was okay as long as he had chocolate it was getting tight in the tiny kitchen but i didnt want either of them to leave i felt cold and vulnerable and the closeness was helping me distance myself from the play delavine had made for me inside i was shaking for what ivy was doing for mewhat she was falling back intoand if they left it would start to show in my fingers rachel nick said from the outskirts can i help ivy bristled but i stretched across the table and handed him a swab i need a sample i said its an illegal charm but i didnt think youd mind face tight with frustration he took it turning away when he ran the cotton around the inside of his mouth i remembered what delavine had said about so many people having marked me and squelched a feeling of shame i didnt belong to anyone but seeing nick unable to enter the comfort i had found among my friends i felt my inderlander roots hard and strong nick didnt understand he never would id been stupid thinking i could find anything lasting with him and he had proved it by having no problem selling slivers of me to al i wouldnt look at him when nick handed me the swab safely back in its cellophane wrapper he moved as if to speak and i blurted to ivy piscary wont mind you helping peter will he eyes down i wrote nicks name on the packet with a squeaky big black marker no the sound of water trickling into the coffeemaker blurred her voice piscary doesnt care one way or the other peter isnt important to him to anyone to anyone but his scion anyway its likely that hell simply fade from delavines awareness when hes distracted by more exciting things like you i thought but i didnt say it aloud ivy turned her black hair swinging to show her earrings im making coffee she said do you want some not if it was laced with brimstone crap on toast i was tired please i said feeling nicks gaze heavy on me jenks she offered getting a tiny hotel mug down from the bare cupboard jenks looked appraisingly into the box of fudge hesitating before he closed it and set it aside no thanks he said starting to mess with my spelling supplies rachel nick tried again can i sketch a pentagram for you or something ivys head came up and i moved my fingers to tell her i could handle it no i said shortly pulling my demon book closer and opening it up my eyes lifted to the artifact wondering if nick had had the opportunity to switch it out with a fake but i didnt think so and there couldnt be two such ugly things rayray nick tried again and ivy slammed the cupboard what the hell do you want she said virulently brown eyes fixed on him i want to help rachel he shot back stiff and a little afraid jenks snorted crumpling up the empty bag and throwing it away you can help rachel by dropping dead thats still an option said ivy i didnt have time or the energy to deal with this i need quiet i said feeling my blood pressure rise thats all i need thats it just quiet nick stepped back his arms crossing over his faded shirt to make him look alone okay ill he hesitated gaze flicking to ivy and jenks beside me taking up all the room so he couldnt come in his held breath slowly escaped him and not having finished his thought he walked away his movements full of frustration slumping into the chair peter had been sitting in he stretched his long legs out and ran his hand through his hair staring at nothing i would not feel bad for him he had sold me out the only reason i hadnt walked off from this was because the weres would hound me forever if they didnt see the thing destroyed and for that i needed nick and i needed him cooperative jenks pulled a chair from under the kitchen table and sat beside me i blinked in surprise when i realized he had correctly put everything into three piles do you need any help he asked and ivy snickered help from a pixy she scoffed and jenks bristled actually i said before he could start swearing at her could you get nick out of here i didnt want him to see the transference curse god knows who he would sell it to he couldnt invoke it without my or demon blood but he could probably get some from al in exchange for my underwear size a nasty smile curved over jenks but it was ivy who put her palm aggressively on the table and said im doing it i want to talk to him i looked up wondering but she had turned away come on crap for brains she said grabbing her purse in passing and heading for the door rachel forgot something and since i dont know anything about ley line magic youre coming with me to make sure i get the right thing anyone else want anything while im out nicks face went defiant and i simpered knowing it was petty but unable to stop myself watch out for the weres i said maybe that had been mean but i was mean just ask the kids i kept chasing out of my graveyard they could play hideandseek somewhere else im out of toothbrushes jenks said going to putter with the coffeemaker ivy waited for nick to shrug into the fabric coat that had been stashed in his truck you can use those more than once she said as id already told him and jenks shuddered clearly aware he was being gotten rid of nick yanked the door open and walked out ivy gave me a wicked closedlipped smile and followed him im not afraid of you nick said as the door shut and my stress level dropped about six points heres your coffee jenks said setting it down in front of me he poured me coffee i looked at it then up at him is there brimstone in it jenks plopped into the chair beside mine ivy told me to put some in but i thought you were well enough to decide my blood pressure went right back up and remembering my reflection in the store window i hesitated wondering if i was being wise or stupid brimstone would keep me alert for hours while i made whatever charms i needed simultaneously increasing my blood count to pretty near normal when i fell asleep id wake refreshed hungry and feeling almost as well as before i was bitten without it id be spelling while fatigued my legs would shake every time i stood and my sleep would end with me waking up feeling like crap but using black magic or illegal drugs to simply to make my life easier was a lie of convenienceone that would delude me into believing i had the right to flaunt the rules that i lived above them i will not turn into trent i exhaled in a long puff im not going to do it i said and he nodded his green eyes creased with worry though he clearly disagreed he accepted my decision which made me feel better immediately i was in charge of my life me riiiiight which spell first jenks asked extending a hand for jax when the pixy flitted to us his wing was bent and he was leaking dust from it but neither jenks nor i said anything it was nice seeing the little pixy taking an interest in what his dad thought was importanteven if he was out here only because rex had scored on him i tapped the pages nervous you didnt lose the bone statue with your fudge did you a smile curved over jenks nope jax rose to the overhanging light as his dad went to his growing pile of bags beside the tv id never seen a man who could outshop me but jenks was a master i tried not to watch when he bent to shuffle about striding quickly back to the kitchen with the twin boxes he set them on the table and pixy dust sifted over us while he opened them up the first one was that godawful carved totem and leaving it to stare at me he opened the second not a scratch he said green eyes giving away his satisfaction i picked up the wolf statue feeling the weight and coldness of bone it wasnt a bad choice for moving the were curse to focus going distant i remembered nicks greed and my eyes went to jenkss totem hey uh has nick seen this i said indicating the wolf statue jenks sniffed in disgust leaning to balance his chair on two legs i havent shown it to him but hes probably pawed through my stuff an idea was sifting through my mind but i refused to feel guilty for not trusting nick hey this is a really neat statue i said setting down the wolf and picking up the totem matalina is going to love it i should have gotten one itd look great in mr fishs bowl jenks let the chair fall to four legs mr fishs bowl he said quizzically and i darted a glance at the motel room door jenkss expression went knowing then angry he might be interiordecorating challenged but he was not a stupid man youre worried about i made a small noise not wanting him to say aloud i was worried about nick stealing the little wolf statue so clearly the better choice for a demon curse but they were both made out of bone so yeah jenks said suddenly taking the totem from me and setting it in the middle of the table ill pick one up for you the next time i go out there had only been the one in the case but seeing his understanding i took a slow breath and reached for my recipe pencil in hand i bowed my head over it and tucked a curl behind an ear fool me once shame on you fool me twice and you can kiss your ass goodbye thirty motions steady i massaged my stuck index finger for the blood needed to invoke the last inertiadampening spell my finger was starting to hurt after all the charms id invoked it wasnt as if i could draw a vial of my blood and dole it out by eyedropper if the blood didnt come right from the body the enzymes that quickened the spell would break down and the spell wouldnt invoke there were a lot of charms on the table this second pair of inertiadampening spells being a quick guilty addition the blood wasnt coming so i painfully squeezed until a beaded drop of red formed it plopped onto the first half of the charm then i squeezed again until the next plop hit the second amulet the blood soaked in with an eerie swiftness sending the scent of burnt amber to stain the stale motel room air what i would have given for a window that opened burnt amber not redwood proof it was demon magic god what was i doing i glanced over the quiet dusky room the light leaking in around the closed curtains telling me it was nearing noon apart from a nap around midnight id been up all morning someone had obviously slipped me some brimstone damn roommates anyway rubbing my thumb and finger together i smeared the remnants of blood into nothing then stretched to put the matched invoked charms with the rest beside jenks he was sitting across from me his head slumped onto the table while he slept doppelganger charm for peter doppelganger charm for nick regular disguise charm for jenks and two sets of inertiadampening amulets i thought gentling the newest in with the rest after meeting peter i was changing the plan no one knew it but me the clatter of the amulets didnt wake jenks and i sat back exhaling long and slow i was weary from fatigue but i wasnt done yet i still had a curse to twist pulling myself upright i reached for my bag moving carefully so i wouldnt disturb jenks hed sat watch over me while i slept forgoing his usual midnight nap and was exhausted rex was purring on his lap under the table and jenkss smooth outstretched hand nearly touched the cupsized minitank of saltwater containing the sea monkeys hed bought somewhere along the way theyre the perfect pets rache he had said eyes bright with anticipation with what his kids would say and i hoped we all lived long enough to worry about how we were going to get them home i smiled at his youthful face looking roguishly innocent while he slept he was such an odd mix young but a triedandtrue father provider protectorand almost at the end of his life my throat tightened and i blinked rapidly i was going to miss him jax could never take his place if there was a charm or spell to lengthen his life id use it and damn the cost my hand reached to push his hair back from his eyes then dropped before it touched him everyone dies the living find a way to assuage the loss and go on depressed i cleared a spot on the table with the extra sea salt jenks had gotten with his new pets i carefully traced three platesized circles interlacing them to make seven distinct spaces formed by three arcs from each circle i glanced over the dusky room before retrieving the focus from my bag which had been at my feet all night safe from nick jenks was sleeping at the table ivy was sleeping in the back room having returned from her date shortly after sunrise and nick and jax were outside making sure the air bag wouldnt engage when jenks ran the mack truck into it tonight and the nos mustnt forget the nos that nick had in his nasty truck which would be rigged to explode on impact id have no better time than now to do this id like to say that i had waited this long so it would be quiet and id be undisturbed the reality was i was scared the statues power came from a demon curse and it would take a demonic curse to move it a demon curse what would my dad say what the hell i whispered grimacing i was going to kill peter what was a little demoniccurse imbalance compared to that stomach knotting i placed the statue into the first circle stifling a shudder and wiping my fingers free of the slimy feel of the ancient bone jenks had watched me do this earlier so i knew what came next but unbeknownst to everyone but him it had been a dry run using the wolf statue id lit the candles but hadnt invoked the curse the little wolf with its fake curse had been sitting on the table all night nick carefully avoiding looking at it another glance at the light leaking around the curtains and i rose going to jenkss things piled carelessly by the tv i plucked the totem from his belongings feeling guilty though i had already asked to use it nervous i placed his carved totem with the stylized wolf on top in the second circle in the third i placed a lock of my hair twisted and knotted my stomach clenched how many times had my father told me never to knot my hair even in fun it was bad tying hair into knots made a very strong bond to a person especially when you knotted your own hair what happened to the bit of hair i placed in the third circle would happen to me conversely what i said or did would be reflected in the circle it wasnt a symbol of my will it was my will that it was sitting in a circle to twist a curse made me ill though that might be from the brimstone i thought not putting it past jenks even though hed agreed with my decision to stop taking it at least it had been medicinal grade this time and i wasnt dealing with the rollercoaster moods okay i whispered hiking my chair closer to the table i glanced at jenks then got my colored candles from my bag the soft crackle of the matching colored tissue paper they were wrapped in soothing i had used white candles the first time picked up by ivy out shopping with nick a bitter touch of honesty to the lie our lives had become i set them down and wiped my palms on my jeans nervous id lit candles from my will only once beforemere hours ago actuallybut since my hearththe pilot light on my kitchen stovewas five hundred miles south of there id have to use my will my thoughts drifted to big al standing in my kitchen lecturing me on how to set candles with their place names he had used a red taper lit from his hearth and it would probably please him that id learned how to light candles with ley line energy i had ceri to thank for that since it was mostly a modified ley line charm she used to heat water lighting them from my will wasnt nearly as powerretentive as using hearth fire but it was close ley line i whispered focus blurring as i reached for the line id found halfway across the town it felt different from the line in my backyard wilder and with the steady slow pulselike change and characteristic fluidity of water the influx of energy poured through me and i closed my eyes my trembling foot the only indication of the torrent of energy filling my chi it took all of a heartbeat feeling like forever and when the force balanced i felt overly full uncomfortable jaw clenched i tossed my red frizz out of my eyes and scraped a bit of wax off the bottom of the white candle holding it to the back of my teeth with my tongue in fidem recipere i said to fix the candle in the narrow space where the circle holding the totem and the circle holding the knot of my hair bisected my thumb and first finger pinched the wick and i slowly separated them willing a spot of heat to grow between them as i thought the words consimilis calefacio setting into motion a complex white ley line charm to heat water okay so it heated the moisture between my fingers until the wick burst into flame but it worked and the wax id scraped off on my teeth was the focal object so i didnt set the kitchen on fire my attention flicked to the small burn mark on the table yeah i was learning i gazed fascinated when the wick first glowed then caught as the wax melted from the virgin wick and the flame took one down two to go the black candle was next and after i scratched the white wax off my teeth i replaced it with a bit of the black candle before i set it in the space connecting the totem and the statue circles traiectio i breathed lighting this one as well the third candle was gold to match my aura and i placed it in the space between the statue and my knot of hair obsignare i said lighting the candle with a studied thought my pulse increased this was as far as id gone earlier that morning under jenkss eye i brought my head up seeing his breathing shifting the hair about his small nose god he had a small nose and his ears were cute stop it rachel i berated myself i wanted to finish this before i set the smoke alarm off i pulled a gray taper from my bag setting it in the very center of the three circles where they all bisected this was the one that scared me the first candle had been set with protection the second with the word for transference and the third with the word that would seal the curse so it couldnt unravel if the gray candle lit itself at the end then i had successfully twisted the curse and i was officially an intentional practitioner of the dark arts god please forgive me its for a good reason in the glow of my three candles i massaged my finger forcing out a welling of blood my bleeding finger scribed a symbol i didnt know the meaning of then i wiped the remainder on the candle i felt as if my will left me with that simple drop of blood smeared on the faded laminate before the gray pillar of wax given meaning from my intent shaking i pulled my hand out of the three circles i scooted my chair back and stood so that when the circles formed i wouldnt accidentally break them by having my legs in the lower halves i gave a final look at the three lit candles and the one marked with my blood the table glowed in candlelight and i wiped my hands on my jeans rhombus i whispered then touched the nearest circle with my finger to close all three i jerked when the everafter flowed out of me and a haze of black aura rose to envelop the candles totem statue and my knot of hair id never set bisecting circles before and where they existed together the gold of my aura was clearer making glittering arcs among the black smut though small the circles were impenetrable by everything but me since i was the one who had set them but sticking my finger into the circle to influence what was inside would break the circle and if i had made them large enough for me to fit in my soul would be in danger of being transferred along with the original curse it was my knot of hair that made this possible it was my bridge inside the black candle would go out when the power was moved from the statue to the totem the white candle would go out to protect and prevent any part of me from being sucked into the new artifact along with the old artifacts power that i would be channeling and the gold candle would go out when the transfer was complete sealing it so it couldnt unravel by itself my body resonated with the power of the unfamiliar line it wasnt unpleasant at all and i wished it was grimacing i reached out my will animum recipere i held my breath against the rising strength and the taste of ash flowing into me from the focus overwhelming my sense of self until i was everything it was my vision blurred and i wavered on my feet i couldnt see though my eyes were open it sang to me it lured me filling me as if twisting my bones and muscles it would make me everything i wanted everything that was promised but that i continually denied myself i felt the wind in my face and the earth under my paws the sound of the spinning earth filled my ears and the scintillating scent of time was in my nose it coursed in a torrent too fast to be realized it was what made a wereand it hurt it hurt my soul that i couldnt be this free hunched i struggled to keep my breathing even so i wouldnt wake jenks i could be everything if i accepted it fully took it entirely into me and it made promises making me long for it if id had any doubt that nick had done a switch they were set to rest now but i wasnt a were i could understand the lure since i had run with as wolf fought as a wolf and existed for a short time with the wind bringing me messages but i wasnt a wolf i was a witch and the lure wasnt enough for me to break my circle and take it as mine forever destroying me in the process negare i whispered shocked when the word came from me i had meant to say no i had meant to say no but it had come out of me in latin damn it what was happening to me pulse pounding and feeling out of control i saw the white candle go out i stiffened as i felt everything in me being poured into the cheap carved bit of bone i clutched at myself holding myself together as the demon curse left me taking with it the ache and lure the extinguished white candle of protection kept me intact holding me so that only the curse left and absolutely nothing more or less went with it the black candle went out and i jerked not breathing i watched the three circles knowing the transfer was complete and the curse almost set anew i could feel the energy in the totem swirling looking for a lessening of my will so it could pour out and be free i fixed my eyes on the gold candle praying it went out as the gray candle lit and i slumped in relief it was done eyes closing i reached for the back of the chair i had done it for better or worse i was the first demon magic practitioner this side of the ley lines well there was ceri but she couldnt invoke them fingers shaking i smeared the salt circle to break it my aura touched it and the line energy flowed out of the circle and into me i let go of the line and my head bowed i had all of three seconds before reality balanced itself reaching out to bitchslap me a good one i gritted my teeth so i wouldnt gasp stumbling backward i reached for the wall hitting the cupboards and sliding to the floor when i didnt find it fast enough panic jerked through me i knew this was going to happenhad been expecting it i would survive i couldnt breathe and i hung my head and pretended it was all right as the black soaked in coating me in another layer molding to my sense of self and changing it my demon marks throbbed and i scrunched my eyes shut and listened to my pulse thunder i accept this i thought and the band about my chest loosened i took a gasping breath that sounded like a sob tears were leaking out and i realized someone had a hold on my shoulder as i sat with my back against the cupboards jenks i burbled i felt a moment of despair as i decided it didnt hurt as much this time i was becoming used to it damn it i didnt want this to become easy it should hurt it should scare me so badly that i never wanted to do it again you okay he said and i nodded not looking up from his knees so he crunched before me he had nice knees are you sure he asked again and i shook my head no his breath came and went and i didnt move trying to realign my thinking i was a demon curse practitioner i was a dealer in the black arts i didnt want to be i didnt want this i brought my head up relief tricked through me as i saw only concern not disgust in his worried face i pulled my knees to my chest and held them breathing slowly his hand was still on my shoulder and i wiped my eyes thanks i said gathering myself to get up i think im all right now it hit me hard is all his green eyes were narrowed in concern the imbalance i stared at him then decided he must have been listening the night ceri explained it to me yeah he stood and extended a hand to help me rise i never felt anything when i got big my heart clenched and i pulled my hand from his warm one after i found my feet maybe youll get hit with it when i untwist the curse and you get small again i lied jenkss lips were tight with anger you hurt like that when you turned into a wolf too i told you id take the black for becoming big its mine i dont know how to give it to you i said depressed and even if i did i wouldnt rachel thats not fair he said his voice rising just shut up and say thank you i said remembering him saying the same thing to me when he agreed to become big so nastywasty vampires wouldnt bite me thank you he said knowing exactly what i was saying we helped each other out keeping track of who was saving whoms ass was a waste of time depressed i shuffled to the table thinking the circles and extinguished candlesall but the gray onelooked like something youd see on a teenage witchs dresser pulse slowing i plucked the extinguished candles from where they sat rolling them up in their white black and gold tissue paper before snapping a rubber band around them and dropping them in my bag that little box with the magnetic chalk would have been a nice place to keep them while jenks pretended interest in his sea monkeys i put my knotted hair on a saucer and set the burning gray candle to it the ring of hair flared up curled in on itself and died feeling safer i blew the candle out then maneuvered around jenks to wash the ash down the sink i wanted all evidence of this gone as fast as possible sorry for waking you up i said reaching for the salt i rubbed the blood symbol off the table with a paste of it jenks straightened from where hed been leaning over his pets his eyes were worried did you know you look really scary when you do ley line magic a sliver of fear took me how i asked conscious of my two demon marks weighing heavily on my wrist and the underside of my foot dropping his eyes jenks shrugged you look tired older like youve done it so many times that you dont care anymore its almost as if you have a second aura and when you do ley line magic it becomes dominant my lips curved down and i went to wash my fingers a second aura that sounded absolutely fabulous maybe it was because i was my own familiar he nodded pixies are sensitive to auras you really damaged yours with that last curse jenks took a breath i hate nick youre hurting yourself to help him and he doesnt even care he sold you out rache if he ever hurts you again jenks i i fumbled i put a hand on his shoulder and this time he didnt flinch if im going to be able to walk away from this i have to do it this is for me not him jenks pulled back looking over the empty room yeah i know i felt odd as he went to the table and looked at the remnants of the demon curse thats the real one he said not touching it pushing myself into motion i picked up the totem it felt heavier though i knew it was an illusion matalina is going to love it i said handing it to him thanks for letting me borrow it i dont need it anymore jenkss eyes widened as it settled into his grip you want me to hold the real one hes going to try to steal it i said thinking id been stupid to trust nick in the first place if you have it hell get the wrong one depressed i hefted the old statue it felt dead inside like a chunk of plastic ill keep this one with me along with the wolf statue i said dropping the statue into my bag the front door opened spilling light over the unmade beds jenks turned smoothly to the door but i jumped when nick came in dirty and smelling of grease jax was on his shoulders immediately abandoning him to see how his new pets were doing my hand slid across the table brushing the salt circle into my hand and dropping it into the sink i wondered how bad it smelled of extinguished candle burned hair and burnt amber there was a thump from the back bedroom and ivy came out in her bathrobe hair in disarray and hunched like a bridge troll snarling at nick about the noise and with a hand over her face she limped past jenks and me to vanish into the bathroom immediately the shower went on the clean scent of oranges slipped under the door with the steam i didnt want to know what shed done last night to be limping today i didnt guiltstrewn and weary i sat at the table jax found the ouncesized container of sea monkey food and jenks stopped him explaining he couldnt feed them since they hadnt hatched yet jax belligerently pointed out two bouncers naming them jin and jen the small pixy started to glow which attracted the brine shrimp and jax had a fit of delight when they bounced closer i couldnt help but smile it was still on me when i turned finding nick awkwardly waiting for me my smile faded and he clenched his jaw the truck is set rayray he said with a false cheerfulness it will look like a defect when the air bag doesnt work he winced i uh couldnt let a truck run into meeven if i knew i was going to wake up alive trust is the difference between you and us inderlanders jenks said loudly popping the lid to the sea monkey food jax grabbed a handful the size of a pinhead and dropped it in with encouraging words enticing jin and jen to the surface with a bright glow this was a hell of a lot safer pet for a pixy than the kitten and i wondered if that was why jenks had bought them i stifled a sigh turning it into a yawn i knew nick wasnt keen on his truck being the sacrificial vehicle but it wasnt as if he would be able to drive it again he was going to be playing dead for the rest of his life coward thanks nick i said leaning away with crossed arms and preparing for a fight now would you go out there and hook it back up im riding with peter if im going to kill him im not going to let that poor boy die alone thirtyone ivy stood just outside the bathroom wrapped in a white motel towel short black hair dripping from thin spikes you arent going to be riding with peter rachel no fucking way i pressed my lips together and fought to not back up okay so she does swear but only when extremely pissed jenks had retreated to the living room looking like he wished he had never barged in on ivy in the shower terrified into playing the tattletale when i told him he was going to be running into me right along with peter nick stood beside him in his greasestained overalls and they gave the impression of two boys who had jumped in the creek wearing their good gotochurch clothes five minutes before pa hitched up the horse nick i said and he started we have four hours before we meet audrey and peter four hours maybe i could get some sleep can you have the air bag fixed by then id feel better if i had it to supplement the inertiadampening curse ivys right he said and i frowned theres no reason for you to risk your life ivy laughed bitterly she isnt rachel you are not getting in nicks truck i turned to my spells on the table pulse quickening her pupils were dilating but it was in anger not hunger i knew this game of arguing with a vampire everything is set i said i made a second pair of inertiadampening amulets for me so theres no problem ivy pointed unaware i could see the new long scratch on the soft part of her arm running from her wrist to her elbow its not going to happen rachel it will work i said its only a joke spell curse actually but why bring that up jenks sat on the edge of the bed whitefaced dont ask me to do this nick shuffled nervously looking like a garage repair guy in his blue overalls frustrated i rubbed my temples the weres wont believe i let nick run off with it and were trying to catch him i said especially if there happens to be an accident im not stupid enough to let nick swipe the artifact and they know it there had been a spike of pleasure saying that he would look back on the incident when it was over and know i had been thumbing my nose at him but nervousness returned when i caught sight of ivy scooping up rex i sat in a kitchen chair its no big deal i said fingers moving to lull her into staying the charms will keep me safe you can follow in the van and well say were on the way to the drop site in two vehicles telling them nick ran off with it will only get them going after him themselves they might catch him not that i really cared ivy shook her head this is asinine ive already got it worked out peter and crap for brains trade places we tell the weres nick ran off with it and that jenks went pixynative to try and catch him jax takes his place on your shoulder and while under a disguise jenks runs the mack truck over peter by accident while we try to catch him truck explodes fake statue is destroyed peter gets carted to the morgue or the hospital where we can pull his plug if we need to weres go awaywe go for a beer i spent hours coming up with this why are you screwing it up rachel rex jumped off my lap back nails gouging as she skittered to hide behind jenkss ankles i stood angry im not screwing it up and im going to ride with peter im not going to let him die alone i said coming out with what was really bothering me ivy huffed clutching the towel higher about her youre alone when you die even if youre surrounded by hundreds her arm was oozing to stain the white towel and only now realizing it she flushed angry i rounded on her have you ever been there when someone dies i asked shaking have you ever held their hand while their strength left them have you ever felt the gratitude in their touch that you were there when they stopped breathing have you ivys face went white im killing him ivy it is my decision and im going to be there so i understand what it means i caught my breath hating myself when my eyes filled i have to be there so i know if it was a good thing when its all done ivy went still as a pity born in understanding reached her eyes rachel im sorry clutching my arms around myself i bowed my head so i couldnt see anyone ivy stood in her towel and made a wet spot on the floor as she dripped the scent of the citrus shampoo she used became pronounced and the silence grew awkward from across the room nick shifted his weight and took a breath shut up ivy snarled hitching her towel higher this doesnt concern you her gaze went to my stitches and i lifted my chin i wasnt bound to her i could do anything i damn well pleased jenks was pale i cant do it he said from the bed i cant hit you with a truck see ivy said catching her towel when she gestured hes not going to do it i dont want you to do it you arent doing it she started for her room nick moving out of her way this is a better plan i exclaimed heading after her ill be fine fine she lurched to a stop spinning that mack truck is going to roll over nicks little blue ford like its a cupcake and youre not going to be in it the run is off its not off this is how were going to do it ivy turned her eyes were full black a shiver of fear took me rocking me to a halt but i wasnt going to let peter die alone i gathered my nerve and nick stepped forward ill do it he said his eyes flicking from ivy to me ill drive the mack truck ivys anger hesitated and i ran my eyes over him in surprise no she said flatly absolutely not youre going with audrey and staying out of it i dont trust you nick clasped his hands then let them go rachels right this is a better plan they wont be watching audreys motel room after peter switches places with me i can leave under a regular disguise charm cross the bridge get the truck hell its delavines truck audrey can give me the key no ivy shouted i wont let shit for brains run over you it isnt going to happen i rubbed my temples thinking that actually this was a lot easier than what wed originally planned ivy no nick made a frustrated noise gesturing at nothing im not going to kill rachel he exclaimed i love her but if the only way to make her safe is to run her over with a mack truck then i by god am going to be the one to do it ivy looked at him as if she had eaten a pile of crapor maybe she was looking at him as if he was a pile of crap you dont know the meaning of lovenick i was shaking inside having nick run into me instead of jenks wasnt what i had planned but it would work swallowing i turned to the kitchen he could use the regular disguise charm already made up oh god what was i doing ivy took a deep breath rachel i dont trust him when did you ever i sat at the table before everyone saw me shake ill be fine putting me with peter will ensure they believe the statue burned with the truck this is the best plan we have i dont want to have to do this again if they realize that the statue wasnt destroyed nick shifted from foot to foot and ran a hand over his stubble ill fix the air bag he said apparently deciding i was going to get my way and the nos he added suddenly i was a lot more nervous are they watching i asked meaning the weres across the street jenks made a soft chirp of a whistle and jax came out of hiding to land on his shoulder yeah nick said head down but from the conversation jax has been catching they think im modifying the nos tanks in case i need to leave in a hurry he swallowed to make his adams apple move i rigged it to explode on impact but ill disengage that too ill set up a button for you to push after you get out jenks looked at ivy then stood up heading for the door weve got four hours ill make sure its not going to explode until you want it to he said nicks expression clouded i know what im doing jax shoulders hunched jenks never slowed down on his way to the door come on you should know how to rig a radio signal i felt better knowing jenks was good with explosives too nick jiggled on his feet looking as if he wanted to give me a hug but knew better then followed jenks out the door opened and i saw three street weres across the way yawning as they leaned against their little trickedout car with wax paper cups of coffee in their grips it had been cold this morning but they looked warm enough now that the sun was high and sun glinted on their bare shoulders and multiple tattoos ivy scowled at them before looking at nicks retreating back if rachel gets hurt you wont have to worry about weres killing you because ill find you first little thief my gut clenched she would go along with it it was done i was going to be with peter when jenks plowed into us ill be fine i said feeling my pulse quicken between the air bag and the charm it will be like im riding in gods arms the door closed behind nick jenks and jax the slice of afternoon sun vanishing as if it had never existed ivy turned bare feet silent as she limped to her room what if god wants you home early thirtytwo a witch a vampire and a pixy walk into a bar i thought as i led the way into the squirrels end it was early and the sun had yet to set when the door swung shut behind jenks sealing us in the warm air smelling faintly of smoke immediately nick yanked it open to come in behind us and theres the punch line ivys lips were pressed tight as she took in the lowceilinged room scanning it for audrey and peter it was friday night and already busy from across the room becky our waitress from before recognized us and waved ivy responded with an empty look making the woman go uncertain there ivy said nodding to an empty table in the darkest corner i unzipped my coat and shook my new bracelet from kisten down youre an inderland ambassador i said make an effort ivy turned to me her sharply defined eyebrows high jenks snickered as she forced the edges of her lips to curl upward she had put on some makeup seeing as we were out here for a last supper kind a thing and she looked more predatorial than usual in her leather pants clingy shirt and boots she and jenks had ridden over in kistens corvette since she would not get in the van with me and she smoothed a hand over her short hair to make sure every strand was in place drops of gold glittered from her lobes and i wondered why she was wearing them it was obvious she wasnt happy about nick driving the truck into me but her logic told her my emotionally charged modifications wouldnt only make it more believable but logistically easier relying on nick had us both worried but sometimes intuition had to take a backseat that was when i usually got in trouble they arent here yet she said showing how worried she was by stating the obvious jenks adjusted the collar of his jacket to hide his tension with a smooth casualness were early he said unlike ivy he was handling the stress well he smiled at the women turning to look at him and there were quite a few jostling their tablemates elbows and pointing him out running my eyes over jenks i could see why he was still an eyeful at sixfootfour especially now that he was acting his size he had on his aviator jacket and with his sunglasses and one of the weres caps turned inside out he looked gooddamn good in an individualistic innocent sort of way ah why dont we go sit i suggested becoming uncomfortable at the giggles whoohoo the inderland nymphos are here who brought the pistachio pudding we pushed into motion and ivy snagged nicks elbow get some water for rachel and an orange juice for me she said her white fingers gripping him tighter than was polite or necessary just orange juice i dont want anything in it understand nick jerked out of her hold he never would have managed it if she hadnt let him frowning he shook his cloth coat out and went to the bar he knew he was being gotten rid of nick fit in well here and it wasnt just the humaninderland thing the bar was replete with skinny women in skimpy outfits chunky women in skimpy outfits women who never let their glass hit the table and looked old before they should in skimpy outfits and men in fleece shirts and jeans who looked desperate facial hair optional oh yeah this was a great place to eat before i bit the big one maybe i was a little depressed a woman in a red dress cut too low for her hips waved to jenks she was standing by the karaoke machine and i rolled my eyes when it started playing american woman jenks grinned heading off in that direction until ivy dragged him backward to the table the woman at the machine pouted ivy fixed a look on her whereupon the woman went ashen her girlfriend got scared and pulled her to the bar as if ivy was going to drain the both of them irritated at their ignorance i hiked my bag higher and plodded after ivy and jenks my fingers were starting to sweat but i couldnt let go of my shoulder bag inside it was the defunct focus and the wolf statue the real focus was sandwiched between jenkss silk boxers at the motel though only jenks and i knew it id have told ivy but leaving it unattended didnt fit in with her plan and i wasnt up to arguing with her nick wanted the focus i had to believe hed steal anything i was protecting god please prove me wrong in my bag with the two fakes was half of my inertiadampening curse nick had the other half and would be putting it on the grille of the mack truck when they got close they would take effect and muffle my motions nick had his own inertiadampening curse along with a normal disguise charm and the two illegal charms to make him into peters doppelganger and vice versa i wouldnt dare use them in cincinnati where bouncers wore spellcheck amulets as a matter of course but i could get away with it here smalltown life clearly had advantages but having to educate the locals would get tedious ivy was the first to the table predictably taking the chair with her back to the wall jenks took the one next to her and i reluctantly sat with my back to the room scooting my chair in with a thump that was unheard over the music depressed i gazed at the wall behind ivy swell i was going to have to look at a stuffed mink nailed to the wall all night the hair on the back of my neck prickled and i turned when ivys eyes jerked to the door our were escort had arrived looking more out of place than we did i wondered how long walter would be able to hold all three packs together once the focus was destroyed seconds maybe brett was with them bruised and moving slow walter must have farmed him out to the street pack as punishment clearly he was at the bottom of their social ladder and taking a lot of abuse not my fault i thought at least he was alive they settled at the bar and i gave brett a sarcastic kisskiss bunny ear gesture before i turned to sit properly watching the humans around them stiffen and mutter i was glad my little party of freethinking sexual gamers had already been accepted jenkss casual tracking of someone behind me gave me warning and i leaned away when becky bustled forward she stood a step farther back than usual but after ivys stellar welcome i didnt blame her it was noisy and i wished theyd turn the music down i couldnt hear a thing over the electronic pop music must have been retros night at the old squirrels end welcome back she said looking sincere though nervous what can i get you twentyfive bucks gets you a wristband and all the beer on tap you can drink damn either it was really good beer or the locals could slam it ivy wasnt listening and jenks was making eyes at one of the women playing pool she looked like matalina with the cue in her hand and her little filmy skirt that barely covered her butt when she leaned over to take a shot disgusted i tapped his shin what was it with men jenks jumped and i smiled sweetly at him could we have a plate of fries i asked thinking that to ask them to put chili on it would get us thrown out you betcha anything else eyeing her over his sunglasses jenks became sex incarnate whats on the desert menu becky i need somethingsweet ivy raised one eyebrow and slowly turned her attention to him we exchanged looks as the matronly woman grew flustered not at what he said but at how hed said it peach cobbler becky encouraged made it yesterday so the top is still crunchy jenks carefully slid an arm behind ivy without a show of emotion she grabbed his wrist and set it on the table put some ice cream and caramel on that and youve got a deal he offered and ivy gave him an irritated look what he said with a shiteating grin im going to need all the sugar i can get to keep up with you two ladies tonight beckys plucked eyebrows rose higher anything else how about one of those drinks with the cherries on little swords jenks asked i like those swords can you put a cherry on a sword for each of us his smile grew seductive and he bent toward becky hiding his wrist i think ivy had bruised it i like to share he said and if these two arent happy when the sun comes up im going to be a dead man the womans eyes darted between ivy and me ivys lip quirked once then steeled her features to a severe emptiness playing up to them i cracked my knuckles in warning ooooh hit me baby jenks said moving suggestively where he sat thats my job sweetie ivy purred pulling him close and tucking her head into the hollow between his shoulder and ear her hand was a stiff claw upon his pristine neck and i saw a flicker of concern in jenks before he realized she was playing and was nowhere close to losing it im the bad vamp this time she purred shes the good witch ivy drew her hand back to give him a tart slap on the face but jenks was faster catching her wrist eyes sultry he kissed her fingertips mmmm ivy said her dark eyelashes fluttering against her pale cheeks and her lips parting you know what i like pixy dust beckys face reddened just the cobbler she stammered and the drink ivy nodded her free hand wrapping around jenkss and her tongue coming out to lick his fingertips jenks froze truly surprised the woman took a breath and walked away her steps unheard over the noise great now i probably wouldnt get my fries jenks reclaimed his hand a faint flush on his face four spoons he shouted after her my breath escaped me in a hiss you two are awful i said frowning at ivy as she shifted away from jenks a satisfiedcat smile on her face maybe ivy agreed but the weres were watching us not audrey and peter i stiffened seeing ivy mentally tick item number two off her list we had moved that much closer to the end of this and the first of the butterflies rose in me jenks tastes like oak leaves smell ivy said ignoring his fluster as he tapped the table in rhythm with the karaoke machine jenks squirmed looking all of eighteen dont tell matalina about that okay ivy said nothing and i forced myself to the back of my chair what was keeping nick maybe hed seen the nice display of lowclass inderlander at our table and decided to stay at the bar or perhaps he didnt want to cross the room and draw the weres attention to himself regardless i could use that water slowly ivys tension started to filter back unusual for her for all my nervousness jenks and i were handling this better than she was and i could understand why every run was personal to me ivy though wasnt used to having the outcome of a run mean this much to her she didnt have the patterns of behavior to cope and it showed around her eyes itll be okay i said stifling the urge to reach across the table and pat her hand the memory of her fingers gripping my waist the rush of her teeth in me lifted through my thoughts and i stifled a shiver of adrenaline what ivy said belligerently her eyes flashing black itll work i said putting my hand under the table so i wouldnt touch my stitches she frowned the rim of brown growing about her eyes a mack truck driven by your exboyfriend is going to run over you and you say everything is going to be okay well when she put it like that jenks snorted shifting his chair a little farther from ivy crap for brains is back i turned in my seat almost glad to see nick he had a glass of water with a slice of lemon and two drinks of differing shades of orange one had a carrot stick in it and he put the other before ivy as he eased into the chair beside me i resettled my bag on my lap and tried to make it look like i wasnt concerned about it ivy curved her fingers about her drink that had better not have alcohol in it she said looking at nicks drink jenks reached to take it and nick jerked it away all but spilling it you arent drinking anything if youre aiming a truck at rachel the large pixy said bothered i grabbed the glass and brought it to my nose before nick could protest i took a sip almost spitting it out what in hell is that i exclaimed running my tongue around the inside of my mouth it was mealy but sweet its a virgin bloody rabbit sullen nick pulled it closer theres no alcohol in it bloody rabbit it was a virgin bloody mary made with carrot juice these are better made from tomato juice i said and nick blanched jenks tapped his fingers on the table smiling when becky stopped at our table and set down a plate of ice cream and pastry along with his fourcherry drink and the requested number of spoons no fries big surprise thanks becky jenks called after her over the music and her neck went red ivy took one of the spoons and delicately scooped a dollop of ice cream placing it succinctly into her mouth she pushed it away as if done saying peter is in the bathroom my heart gave a thump check nick took a shaky breath i wouldnt look at him pretending interest in plucking the cherry with the longest stem out of jenkss drink nick stood and ivy reached across the table to grab his wrist he froze and my eyes went from his still swollen masculine fingers to ivys face her eyes were black a severe anger shining from behind them if you dont show up on that bridge she said lips hardly moving i swear ill find you and if you hurt her ill make you a shadow begging me to bleed you every night for the rest of your pathetic life looking like a wraith she inhaled taking away the warmth of the room believe it i sent my eyes up the faded flannel of his shirt to find him ashen and afraid for the first time he was afraid i was too hell even jenks had drawn away from her he jerked from her clearly shaken he stepped out of her easy reach rachel goodbye nick i said flatly feeling my blood pressure rise i still didnt understand how he could think that selling al information about me even harmless information wasnt a betrayal of everything we had shared i didnt watch him leave eyes lowered i took a swordpierced cherry the sweet mush was bland in my mouth swallowing i set the red plastic sword beside jenks for him to take home to his kids im tired of this i whispered but i dont think anyone heard me jenks took a scoop of the cobbler watching me with his intent green eyes you going to be okay he asked around his full mouth picking up a spoon i held the plate so i could wrangle an even bigger bite of ice cream just dandy why was i eating i wasnt hungry the music finally died and in the renewed sound of chatter ivy held a napkin to her mouth and muttered i dont like this i dont like it at all i dont like nick i dont trust nick and if he doesnt show up with that truck to do his part im going to kill him ill help jenks offered carefully cutting the remaining ice cream in two and claiming the largest half okay i made a mistake in trusting him can we move on to something else i said scraping the lions share of caramel to my side of the plate god help me but i had been stupid stay with your own kind rachel not that your track record there is much better but i do trust his greed i added and jenkss eyebrows rose shifting my shoulder i touched my bag on my lap he wants the statue hes going to show if only to try and steal it back after all is said and done ivy crossed her arms in front of her and seethed jenks cocked his head in thought and ate another bite of cobbler you want me to have jax shadow him he asked and i shook my head it might be too cold i said he can sit this one out hes doing well with lowtemp excursions jenks said around his full mouth then swallowed im proud of him a satisfied smile hovered in his eyes he can read now he added softly hes been working hard at it hes serious about taking after his old man my smile faltered at the reasons for the lessons jenks didnt have many more battles left to fight ivy steadied herself visibly forcing herself to be cheerful thats great she said but i could hear her stress what grade level is he at jenks pushed his plate away tinks titties i dont know enough to get by i sent my attention to the bathroom door when nick came out his head down clearly worried i exhaled in a slow puff leaning back into my chair oh thats just swell i said sourly somethings wrong with the charms triangular face worried jenks followed my gaze saying nothing ivy didnt look at all and waited for it as nick sat down before his virgin bloody rabbit and took a gulp my shoes are too tight he whispered fingers shaking mouth open i stared it hadnt been nicks voice peter i breathed shocked my eyes jerked from him to ivy and jenks my god can i cook or can i cook ivys breath slipped from her in a slow sound check i thought seeing her mentally cross off the next item on her list grinning jenks started to eat again this time working on my half of the ice cream i tried not to look at peter but it was hard not to the vampire sat beside me his arms resting on the table as if tired the barest tremble in his fingers which were a shade shorter than nicks and thin not swollen the two men had exchanged clothes along with identities and it was eerie how complete the change was only in the eyes could i see a clear difference peter had a haze from the painkiller he had taken so he could walk upright just as well id be driving no wonder those things are illegal ivy said hiding her words behind her glass of juice my worry deepened when jenks added his aura is the same shit i whispered my stomach knotting i forgot about that jenks finished the ice cream and pushed the plate away with a little sigh i wouldnt worry about it he said weres cant use the everafter they cant see auras embarrassed i hunched over my drink you can and you cant use the everafter he grinned thats because pixies are everafter were magic baby just ask matalina ivy snickered she took a cherry and jenks put her sword with mine when she casually handed it to him you know i said you can buy a box of those for a buck fifty in any grocery store jenks shrugged wheres the fun in that watching the banter peter smiled making my heart ache when i remembered nick looking at me like that i wish i had the chance to know you before all this he said softly you fit well together like a vampire camarilla but without the jealousy and politics a real family my good mood died jenks played with his fork to get it to balance on its tines and ivy became very interested in the weres at the bar peter blinked rapidly a nervous reaction id never seen in nick im sorry he said did i say something ivy interrupted him peter weve got about an hour until nick gets into place with that bridge traffic do you want something to eat i gathered myself to look for becky yelping when jenks kicked me under the table i glared at him until he said you dont like nick nick can get his own food feeling stupid i slumped in my chair right so i tried not to fidget as peter took the next five minutes to get beckys attention from the corner of my sight i watched nick leave the bathroom looking like the ailing vampire who was sitting beside me trying to attract anyone in an apron hell nick even walked like peter slow and pained it was creepy he was good at this professional thief i reminded myself as i gripped my bag to assure myself it was still in my possession how i could have been so blind but i knew my ignorance had been born out of my need for that damned acceptance i hungered after almost as badly as ivy lusted after blood we werent as unalike as it seemed when you got right down to it the jitters started when nick passed out of my sight i turned my attention to ivy reading his progress across the bar by where her eyes went hes good ivy said sipping her juice audrey didnt recognize him until he opened his mouth and said hi did the weres smell him i asked and she shook her head beside me peter gritted his teeth and i was glad hed had the opportunity to say goodbye to audrey properly he was a good person it wasnt fair maybe he could bring the memory of suffering and compassion into his undead existence but i doubted it they never did ivy tapped her fingers on the table and jenks heaved a sigh theyre gone ivy said i put the flat of my arm on the table forcing my foot to not jiggle all that was left was waiting for nicks phone call that he was in place check thirtythree so this is what it feels like to be a murderer i thought taking a tighter grip of the wheel of nicks truck squinting from the low sun i was nervous sweaty shaky and i wanted to throw up oh yeah i can see why people get off on this beside me in nicks jeans and cloth coat peter watched the passing view as we drove to the bridge half of nicks inertiadampening curse fixed to the bumper peters left hand cradled the defunct statue with delavines blood smear on it his right hand looking slightly smaller than nicks was holding the handle of the door i was pretty sure it was nerves since he didnt know the door had a tendency to fly open when you went over a bump nicks truck was old it rattled when it shook the shocks were bad but the brakes were excellent and with the nos it could be startlingly fast just what every successful thief needs silent we endured the stopandgo traffic to get onto the bridge my attention on ivy and jenks behind us as much as on the cars ahead of me jockeying to get on the bridge it had been ivys idea to do this on the bridge the stiff wind would hamper the weres sense of smell and the bridge itself would prevent a helicopter ambulance and slow things down but most of all we needed a stretch of several miles without a shoulder to minimize were interference after the crash the fivemile bridge gave us that along with a nice margin to actually run into each other the goal was the bridge apex but a mile either way would work my eyes flicked to the rearview mirror but i didnt feel any better seeing ivy and jenks in kistens corvette running as a buffer between us and the weres from the bar put your seat belt on i said i thought it was stupid like dragging the saddle behind you when you went looking for your horse fleeing the burning barn but i didnt want to get pulled over for failure to wear a belt and have it all come crashing down when the cop realized nicks newly flashpainted truck was the same one that had fled the scene of a crash yesterday the click was loud when peter fastened his belt we were going to be run over by a mack truck i didnt think it would make a difference if he had on his seat belt or not oh god what was i doing the traffic light finally turned green and i pulled onto the bridge headed for st ignace on the other side of the straits i gripped the wheel tighter stomach knotting the bridge was a mess the two northbound lanes were closed off making traffic twoway on the southbound midway down the span there were big machines and powerful lights to turn the coming night to day as the workers tried to meet their pretouristseason deadline they had missed it red cones separated the two lanes allowing traffic to easily switch to the other side when needed the bridge was an incredible five miles long and every foot of it had needed repair peter exhaled as we accelerated to a steady forty miles an hour the opposing traffic doing the same an unnerving three feet away past the vacant northbound lane and thick girders i could see the islands gray and smudged from the distance we were really high up and i felt a moment of quickly stifled fear despite the stories witches couldnt fly least not without a staff of charmed redwood that cost more than the concord peter i said not liking the silence im fine he said his grip tensing on the statue his voice was cross sounding nothing like nick i couldnt help my awkward smile of understanding remembering ivy bothering me with the same question my stomach gave a lurch i wasnt going to ask how you were doing i said fiddling with the two charms about my neck one was for pain that wouldnt cover the hurt caused by being hit the other was to keep my head from meeting the dash peter had refused both my eyes lifted to the rearview mirror to see that ivy and jenks were still behind us do you want me to turn the lights on i asked it was our agreed upon signal to abort the plan i wanted him to say yes i didnt want to do this the statue didnt matter right now peter did we could find another way no the sun was setting past him and i squinted at him peter ive heard it all he said his voice rough as he kept his stiff position please dont it comes down to one thing im dying ive been doing it for a long time and it hurts i stopped living three years ago when the medicine and charms quit working and the pain took everything away theres nothing left of me but hurting i fought for two years with the thought that i was a coward for wanting to end the pain but there is nothing left i snuck a glance at him shocking myself when i saw nick sitting there his jaw clenched and his brown eyes hard it sounded like it was a story he had told too many times as i watched his shoulders slumped and he let go of the door this lingering isnt fair to audrey he said she deserves someone strong able to stand beside her and meet her bite for bite in the passion shes aching to show me i couldnt let that go without saying something and becoming an undead is fair to her i said making his jaw clench again peter ive seen the undead that wont be you i know he exclaimed then softer i know but its all ive got left to give her the whirl of air under the tires rose above the sound of the engine as we went over the first of the grates designed to lighten the bridges load she knows it wont be me peter said his voice calm he seemed to want to talk and i would listen i owed him that he met my gaze and smiled a scared littleboy smile she promised me shell be happy i used to be able to dance with such passion that it could drive her wild i want to dance again with her i will remember her i will remember the love but you wont feel it i whispered shell feel love for the both of us peter said firmly his eyes on the passing bridgework and in time ill be able to fake it for her this was not happening peter i reached forward to turn on the lights and he stopped me with a shaking hand on my wrist dont he said im already dead youre only helping me move forward i could not believe this i didnt want to believe it peter theres so much you havent done that you might do there are new medicines every day i know someone who can help you trent could help him i thought then cursed myself what in hell was i thinking ive had all the medicines peter said softly legal and otherwise ive heard the lies ive believed the promises but theres nothing left to believe in but death im moved around like a table lamp rachel his voice faltered you dont understand because you arent done living yet but im done and when youre doneyou just know the car ahead of me flashed its brake lights and i took my foot off the accelerator but a lamp can light a room i protested my will weakening not when the bulb is broken his elbow was on the windowsill and his head was in his cupped hand the setting sun became flashes on him as the girders holding the bridge arched up maybe by dying i can be fixed he said over the rumble of a passing truck maybe i can do some good when im dead im not good for anything alive i swallowed hard he wouldnt do anything after he died unless it met his needs its going to be okay peter said im not scared of death im scared of dying not dying but how im going to die he laughed but it was tinged with bitterness delavine told me that being born and dying are the only two things we do perfectly theres a hundred percent success rate i cant do it wrong that sounds funny coming from a dead man i said my breath catching when a big truck went past shaking the grate we were on this was wrong this was so wrong peter pulled his elbow from the window and looked at me he said how i feel when i die is the one thing i have control over i can be afraid or i can go boldly i want to do it bravelyeven if it hurts im tired of hurting but i can take a little more i was starting to shake though the air from the setting sun coming in was warm and my window was down his soul would be gone forever the spark of creativity and compassiongone cancan i ask you something i ventured the oncoming traffic had grown thin and i prayed that they hadnt shut down the southbound lane for some reason it was probably just nick driving slow so we would meet somewhere in the middle as planned what his voice was tired and weary and the sound of lost hope in it knotted my stomach tighter when ivy bit me i said darting a glance at him some of my aura went to her she was taking my aura along with my blood not my soul just my aura the virus needs blood to stay active but is it more than that his expression was unreadable and i rushed forward with the rest of it while i still had time maybe the mind needs an aura to protect it i said maybe the stillliving mind needs the illusion of a soul about it or it will try to get the body to kill itself so that the soul the mind and the body will be back in balance peter looked at me from nicks face and i saw him for what he was a frightened man who was stepping into a new world with no safety net both extremely powerful and tragically fragile reliant upon someone else to keep his mind and body together after his soul was gone he didnt say anything telling me i was right my breath quickened and i licked my lips vampires take auras as their own to fool their mind that a soul still bathed it it would explain why ivys father risked his own death to provide her mother with his blood and his alone he bathed her mind in his aura his soul in the hopes that she would remember what love was and perhaps in the instant of the act she did i finally understood exhilarated i stared at the road ahead not seeing it my heart was pounding and i felt lightheaded thats why audrey insists on being my scion he said softly even though its going to be very hard on her i wanted to stop i wanted to stop right there in the middle of the freaking bridge and figure this out peter looked miserable and i wondered how long he had agonized over remaining as he was and causing her pain or becoming an undead and causing her a pain of another kind does ivy know i asked about the auras he nodded his eyes lighting briefly upon my stitches of course peter this isis i said bewildered why are you hiding this from everyone he ran a hand over his face the angry gesture so reminiscent of nick that it shocked me would you have let ivy take your blood if you knew she was taking your aura the light from your soul he asked suddenly his eyes fixing on mine vehemently i glanced from the road blurting yes yes i would have peter its beautiful it brings something right to it his expression went from anger to surprise and he said ivy is a very lucky woman feeling my chest clench i blinked rapidly i wouldnt cry i was frustrated and confused i was going to kill peter in less than three miles i was on a train i couldnt stop i didnt need to cry i needed to understand not everyone sees it like that he said the shadows of the passing girders falling on him youre truly odd rachel morgan i dont understand you at all i wish i had time to maybe after im dead ill take you dancing and we can talk i promise i wont bite you i cant do this im turning the lights on jaw clenched i leaned to reach the knob he wasnt done yet there was more for him to learn more he could tell me before he dropped his thread of consciousness forever peter didnt move as i pulled the knob i leaned into the seat my face going cold when the dash remained dark i pushed the knob in and pulled it back out they arent working i said as a car passed us i pushed it in and tried again why arent they working damn it i asked jenks to disengage them son of a bitch i shouted hitting the dash and hurting my hand through the pain amulet that damn son of a bitch tears started leaking out and i twisted in the seat desperate to stop this peter took my shoulder pinching me rachel he exclaimed his guiltridden expression looking at me from nicks face tearing at me please he begged i wanted to end it this way because it would help someone im hoping that because im helping you god will take me even without my soul pleasedont stop i was crying now i couldnt help it i kept my foot on the accelerator maintaining that same fifteen feet between me and the next car he wanted to die and i was going to help him whether i agreed with it or not it doesnt work that way peter i said my voice high they did a study on it without the mind to chaperone it the soul has nothing to hold it together and it falls apart peter there will be nothing left it will be as if you never existed he looked down the road his face paled in the amber glow oh god there he is i took a breath holding it peter i said desperate i couldnt turn back i couldnt slow down i had to do this the shadows from the girders seemed to flash faster peter im scared i looked over the cars to the white truck heading for us i could see nick peters doppelganger disguise gone and the legal one in place hand fumbling i found peters it was damp with sweat and he clutched it with the strength of a frightened child ill be here i said breathless and unable to look from the looming truck what was i doing please dont let me burn when the tanks explode please rachel my head hurt i couldnt breathe i wont let you burn i said tears making my face cold ill stay with you peter i promise ill hold your hand ill stay until you go ill be there when you leave so you wont be forgotten i was babbling i didnt care i wont forget you peter ill remember you tell audrey that i love her even if i dont remember why the last car between us was gone i took a breath and held it my eyes were fixed on the trucks tires they shifted peter it happened fast the truck veered across the temporary line my feet slammed into the breaks selfpreservation taking control i stiffened my arm clenching the wheel and peters hand both nicks truck swerved it loomed before us the flat panel of the side taking up the entire world he was trying to get entirely across the lane and miss me i spun the wheel teeth gritted and terrified he was trying to miss me he was trying to hit the passenger side only the truck smashed into us like a wrecking ball my head jerked forward and i gasped before the inertiadampening curse took hold i couldnt breathe as the air bag hit my face like a wet pillow hurting relief filled me then guilt that i was safe while peter oh god peter heart pounding i felt as if i was wrapped in muzzy cotton i couldnt move i couldnt see but i could hear the sound of squealing tires was swallowed by the terrifying shriek of twisting metal i managed a breath a ragged gasp in my throat my stomach lurched and the world spun as the momentum swung us around pushing at the oilscented plastic i forced it away we were still spinning and terror shocked through me as the mack truck plowed into the temporary guardrail and into the empty northbound lanes our vehicle shook as we hit something and came to a spinewrenching halt i pushed the bag down fighting it shaking blinking in the sound of nothing it was smeared with red and i looked at my hands they were red i was bleeding blood slicked them where my nails had cut through my palms yes i thought numbly seeing the gray sky and dark water thats what the hands of a murderer should look like heat from the engine washed over me pulled from the breeze on the bridge safety glass covered the seat and me blinking i peered out the shattered front window peters side of the truck was smashed into a pylon there would be no getting him out that way we had been knocked clean into the empty northbound lane i could see the islands past peter and the guardrail they were repairing somethingsomething had ripped the hood off nicks blue truck i could see the engine steaming and twisted shit it was almost in the front seat with me along with the front window a man was shouting i could hear people and car doors shutting i turned to peter oh hell i tried to move shocked when my foot caught panicking until i decided it wasnt moving because it was stuck not because it was broken it was wedged between the console and the front of the seat my jeans were turning a wet black from the calf down i think i had a cut somewhere my eyes traveled numbly down my leg it was my calf i think id cut my calf lady a man said as he rushed up to my window gripping the empty frame with a thick hand a wedding ring on his finger lady are you okay peachy i thought blinking at him i tried to say something but my mouth wasnt working an ugly sound came out of me chilling dont move i called the ambulance i dont think youre supposed to move his eyes went to peter beside me and he turned away i heard the sound of retching peter i whispered my chest hurting i couldnt breathe deeply so keeping my breaths shallow i struggled with my seat belt it came undone and while people shouted and gathered like ants on a caterpillar i pulled my foot free nothing hurt yet i was sure that would change peter i said again touching his face his eyes were closed but he was breathing blood seeped from a ragged cut over his eye i undid his seat belt and his eyelids fluttered rachel he said his face scrunching up in hurt am i dead yet no sweetheart i said touching his face sometimes the transition from living to dead goes in a heartbeat but not with this much damage and not with the sun still up he was going to take a long nap to wake hungry and whole i managed a smile for him taking my pain amulet off and draping it over him my chest hurt but i didnt feel anything numb inside and out peter looked so white his blood pooling in his lap listen i said adjusting his coat with my red fingers so i couldnt see the wreckage of his chest your legs look okay and your arms you have a cut above your eye i think your chest is crushed in about a week you can take me dancing out he whispered get out and blow up the truck damn it i cant even die right i didnt want to burn he started crying the tears making a clear track down his bloodied face i didnt want to have to burn i didnt think he was going to survive this even if the ambulance got to him in time im not going to burn you i promise im going to be sick thats all there is to it im scared he whimpered his breath gurgling from his lungs filling with blood i prayed he wouldnt start coughing broken chips of safety glass sliding i pulled myself closer gently holding his shattered body to me the sun is shining i said eyes clenching shut as memories of my dad flooded back just like you wanted can you feel it it wont be long ill be here thank you he said the words terrifyingly liquid thank you for trying to turn the lights on that makes me feel as if i was worth saving my throat closed you are worth saving i said tears spilling over as i rocked him gently he tried to breathe the sound ugly it was pain given a voice and it struck through me his body shuddered and i held him closer though i was sure it hurt him tears fell hot as they landed on my arm there was noise all around us but no one could touch us we were forever set apart his body suddenly realized it was dying and with an adrenalineinduced strength it struggled to remain alive clutching his head to my chest i held him firmly against the massive tremor i knew was coming i sobbed when it shook him as if he were trying to dislodge his body from his soul i hated this i hated it i had lived it before why did i have to live it again peter stopped moving and went still rocking him now for me not him i shook with sobs that hurt my ribs please please let this have been the right thing to do but it didnt feel right thirtyfour rachel jenks cried and i realized he was with me his hands were warm and clean not sticky like mineand after struggling with the door to the truck he reached inside the window to unlatch it i let my grip on peter loosen as it opened my leg twisted behind me felt kind of cold and i looked at going woozy there was a dark wet stain on my jeans and my brandnew running shoe now had a red stripe maybe my leg was hurt more than i thought get peter out i whispered ow ow hey i exclaimed when jenks dragged me across the seat and away from peter his arms went around me in a cradle and with me getting peters blood all over him he carried me to a clear space on the cold pavement up i whispered cold and lightheaded dont lay me down dont hit the button before you get him out you hear me jenks get him out he nodded and i asked wheres the truck driver remembering not to call him nick some lady in a lab coat is looking at him fumbling i pulled my half of the inertiadampening charm from around my neck i slipped it to jenks and he replaced it with the remote to ignite the nos palming it i watched him nudge the amulet through the nearby road grate destroying half the evidence that we were committing insurance fraud david would have kittens wait until i get back before hitting that will you he muttered his eyes darting to my closed grip not waiting for an answer he loped to the truck shouting for two men in the crowd to help him and a woman descended upon me get off i exclaimed pushing and the narrowfaced woman in a purple lab coat fell away how had she gotten there so fast the coming ambulance wasnt even a noise yet im dr lynch she said tightly frowning at the blood id left on her lab coat just what i need you look like youre a worse pita patient than me pita i asked slapping at her when she took my shoulders and tried to lay me down she pulled back frowning pain in the ass she explained i need to take your blood pressure and pulse supine but after that you can sit up until you pass out for all i care i tried to see around her to jenks but he was inside the truck with peter deal i said her eyes went to my leg wet from the calf down think you can put pressure on that i nodded starting to feel sick this was going to hurt holding my breath against the wash of pain i let her take my shoulders and ease me down knee bent i clamped my hand to the part of my leg that hurt the most making it hurt more while she took her godgiven sweet time i listened to the sounds of panic and stared at the darkening sky framed by the bridges cables holding my ribs and trying not to look like they hurt lest she wanted to poke them too i thought of my pain amulet praying it had eased peter when nothing else had i deserved to hurt she muttered at me to hold still when i turned my head to look at the passing traffic a black convertible was parked just inside the closed northbound lane hers i jerked at the ugly ripping sound and the sudden draft on my leg hey i shouted putting my hurt palms against the pavement and levering myself up i held my breath as my sight grayed at the pain then got mad when i realized she had cut my jeans up the seam to my knee damn it those were fifty bucks i exclaimed and she gave me a cold look i thought that would get you up she said moving my bloody hand back to my leg and taking my blood pressure and pulse a second time i could tell she was a highblood living vampire despite her trying to hide it in the old way and i felt safe with her her blood lust would be carefully in check while she worked on me thats the way living vamps were children and the injured were sacred still mad about my jeans i took a shallow breath staring at the chaos lit by the orangey yellow glare of the setting sun lets see it she said and i released my hold on my leg worried i peered down it didnt look bad from a bleedingtodeath standpointjust a slight oozing and what looked like a huge bruise in the makingbut it hurt like hell saying nothing dr lynch opened her tackle box and broke the seal on a small bottle relax its water she said when i stiffened as she went to pour it on me she had to hold my leg still with an iron grip as she poked and prodded cleaning it while muttering about torn arterioles and them being a bitch to stop bleeding but that id survive my threeyearold tetanus shot seemed to satisfy her but my stomach was in knots when she finally decided i had been tortured enough and slipped a stretchy white pressure bandage over it someone was directing traffic to keep the rubberneckers moving and the bridge open two cars of weres had stopped to help worrying me i wanted them to see the statue rolling around on the floor of the front seat but having them this close was a doubleedged sword slowly i tucked the remote to blow the nos under my good leg and out of sight the wind through the straits pushed my hair out of my eyes and as i looked at the faces pressed against the windows as they passed i started to laugh hurting my ribs im okay i said when the woman gave me a sharp look im not going into shock im alive and it looks like youre going to stay that way she said taking both my hands and setting them so they hung past the shelf of my lap arent you the lucky one she poured more water on my hands to get the grit off then set them palm up on my lap to make a wet spot disgusted i watched her pluck a second packet from her tackle box and rip it open the scent of antiseptic rose whipped away from the wind again i jumped and owed as she brushed the grit and glass from my hands earning another wimp look from her more people had stopped and nicks trucks paint job was showing where the metal had crumpled jenks was inside with peter they were trying to get him out weres had gathered at the outskirts some in jeeps some in highend cars and some in little street racers i felt the remote under my leg wanting to use it and finish this run i wanted to go home nick wheres the guy who hit us i said scanning the faces and not seeing him hes fine apart from a damaged knee she said as she finished and i pulled my hands close to inspect the little crescent moons from my nails cutting my palms it might need surgery at some point but hell live her deeply brown eyes flicked to my dentalfloss stitches your gnomon is with him she finished and i blinked gnomon what in hell was that shes keeping him occupied until the is gets here to take his statement she added and my eyes widened the woman meant ivy she thought i was ivys scion and gnomon was the flipside of the relationship it made sensea gnomon was the thingy on a sundial that casts a shadow i was about to tell her ivy wasnt my gnomon then didnt i didnt care what she thought the is i said with a sigh starting to worry now that it looked like i was going to survive motions quick she fixed a big bandage over each palm i hadnt forgotten about the is but if nicks truck wasnt burning before they arrived it was going to be a lot harder to get rid of that defunct statue her attention followed mine to the truck her shoulders stiffening when jenks and two men pulled peters broken body out i expected her to get angry they were moving him surprised that she was messing with the living and not him obviously the worse offuntil she leaned close with her little penlight and flashed it in my eyes saying you cried for peter no one ever cries for us i pulled out of her grip shocked you know she moved and i panicked with vampire quickness she was atop me knees to either side of my thighs pinning me against the barrier her one hand was behind my neck holding me unmoving the other held that light as if it was a dagger pointed at my eye she was inches away her closeness going unnoticed or considered okay by way of her officiallooking lab coat im here because delavine told me to come he wanted to make sure you survived i took a breath then another she was so close i could see the soft imperfections in her cheek and neck where she had been professionally stitched i didnt move wishing i wasnt so damn interesting to the undead what in hell was their problem id tell him to leave you alone she said her breath lost in the wind because i think youd kill him if he tried to hunt you but it would make him interested not simplyconcerned thanks i said heart pounding god help me i would never understand vampires slowly she lowered the penlight and got off good reflexes no head trauma your lungs sound clear dont let them cart you off to emergency you dont need it and it will only jack up your insurance she said switching from scaryass vampire to professional health provider in seconds im done here you want a pain amulet i shook my head guilt for being alive cascading through me when jenks and two men set peter gently on the ground apart from everyone jenks crouched to close his eyes and the other two men backed away frightened and respectful the womans face blanked i wasnt here okay she said you bandaged your own damn leg i dont want to be subpoenaed i wasnt here you got it and she was gone the purple lab coat flapping about her calves as she lost herself in the crush of growing turmoil surrounding the single spot of stillness that was peter alone on the pavement broken and bloody feeling the adrenaline crash i met jenkss gaze he sank to the pavement beside me so he could see peter from the corner of his eye respect for the dead he handed me my shoulder bag and i put it on my lap hiding the remote to blow the nos push it he said there were sirens in the distance they werent approaching quickly but that would change when they reached the bridge and the closed northbound lanes behind jenks was nicks truck a twisted chunk of metal with wheels and no hood it was hard to believe i had survived it the weres were starting to edge in clearly wanting to swipe the statue no one was within that golden circle of twenty feet or between the truck and the questionable safety of the temporary railing and a possible fall jenks leaned closer and with him protecting my face with his body i clenched my eyes shut and pushed the button nothing happened i opened one eye and looked at jenks his expression was horrified and i pushed the button again let me try he said snatching it away and pushing it himself the little bit of plastic made a happy clickityclick sound but there was no big badaboom after it jenks i exclaimed barely above a whisper did you fix this too its not my fault he said green eyes wide i rigged it myself the nos should have blown damn friggen mosswipe remote i should have had jax do it i cant solder with that stupidass iron nick had i must have fused the fairy fucking thing jenks i admonished thinking that was the worst thing id ever heard him say starting to get one of those oh crap feelings i looked at the weres as soon as official people started poking around in there that statue would be gone and my life with it when they realized it was a fake can you fix it i asked my stomach knotting five minutes with an iron i dont have in a private space that doesnt exist on a bridge six hundred feet above the water surrounded by two hundred good samaritans who dont know crap sure you bet hell maybe its just the battery this wasnt good i sat and stewed while jenks took out the battery and shocked himself on his tongue while he swore and danced from the mild zing i pulled my knees to my chest to get up wincing at the dull throb in my leg ivy and nick were still beside the flat panel of the mack truck nick looking nothing like himself under his legal disguise charm the wind coming up through the grating they stood on sent her hair flying she gestured with a small movement and i gave her a lost look her lips pressed together and she rounded on nick nicks head was down and it stayed that way as she put her hands on her hips and shot unheard questions at him blood soaked one of his pant legs and he looked pale that he was hurt would make it easier to get him to the hospital where the vampire doctor waited ready to pronounce him dead of a complication mix up the paperwork and shuffle him both out the back door and out of my life forever peter would be moved to the vamp wing underground until his body repaired itself everything was perfect but the damn truck wasnt exploding what are our options i asked jenks taking the remote and dropping it into my bag it might be the switch on the tanks he said if jax was here hes not jenks took my elbow when i swayed can you blow it with your ley line magic you mean like with me lighting candles hiking up my shoulder bag i shook my head cant tap a line over water and i dont have a familiar to connect through to a land line my mind jumped to rex maybe i ought to remedy that this is getting old nick might a shiver went through me remembering when i channeled trents ability to tap a line last year to make a protection circle i had hurt him i didnt care if i hurt nick right nowi just wanted to finish this runbut the question might be academic i didnt know if nick had a familiar lets go ask i said lurching into motion my chest hurt and as i gripped it with my arms i forced a slow breath into me and tried to pull myself upright it wasnt worth the effort to look unhurt so i gave up hunching over and breathing shallowly the wind sluicing through the straits had a chill in it and the setting sun was lost behind the clouds it was going to get cold very quickly relegating jax to catsitting duties at the motel had been a good idea ivy heard my footsteps on the grating and turned with a frown she reserved only for me a mix of anger and worry she was ticked big surprise there rachel nick breathed holding out his hands as if i would take them i stopped and his hands fell i wouldnt touch a strange man like that i said reminding him that he was still under a disguise especially one that just hit me his eyes flicked to my dentalfloss stitches and my face warmed he saw me stiffen then forced his face smooth though he looked nothing like himself i could tell it was him not only was there his voice but i could see nick in little mannerisms that only an exlover might notice the twitch of a muscle the curve of a fingerthe glint of annoyance in his eye my god he said again softer that was the hardest thing ive ever done are you okay are you sure youre not hurt hardest thing hed ever done i thought bitterly the entire right side of my body sticky with peters blood all he had done was hit me with a truck i had held peter while he died knowing it was wrong but the only thing that would be right the remote doesnt work nick i said shortly watching for his tells you know anything about that eyes wide in an emotion i couldnt read he looked at my bag telling me hed seen me put the remote in it what do you mean it doesnt work its got to work he reached for it and i grunted when jenks yanked me back my sneakers fumbled for purchase on the metal mesh in a blink ivy was between us the nearby people were getting nervousthinking we were going to take justice into our own handsand the weres watched evaluating whether this was a scam or a real accident peters body was lying on the pavement looking like nick someone had covered him with a coat and a part of me hunched into itself and cried dont touch me i all but hissed hurting but ready to slug nick you did this didnt you you think youre going to get that empty artifact and sell it to them youll be in hiding so theyll come after me when they find out its not real its not going to happen i wont let you this is my life youre screwing over not just yours nick shook his head thats not it youve got to believe me rayray shaking from adrenaline i turned sideways i didnt like having my back to the truck with the empty focus in it ivy had been watching italong with nickbut there were too many weres lurking as accident witnesses for my liking have a good life nick i said dont include me in it ivy and jenks flanked me and we walked away what was i going to do i hope youre happy as ivys shadow he said loudly his voice full of a vitriolic hatred that hed probably been denying since ivy first asked me to be her scion i turned my bandaged hand atop my neck hiding my stitches we arentim not he had just blown our cover son of a bitch three officiallooking cars pulled up using the unopened northbound lane their rearwindow lights flashing amber and blue two fib one is the truck wasnt burning yet shit on crap could it get any worse looking like himself even with the disguise nick slumped against the panel of the white mack truck and held his bleeding knee his mocking gaze flicked to the cars behind us their doors slamming shut and loud orders being given to secure the vehicle and get the rubberneckers moving three officers headed for us youre rat piss jenks said suddenly to nick no youre the guy who puts rat piss on his breakfast cereal we save your worthless human ass and this is how you thank her if you come back ill kill you myself youre a foul pile of fairy crap that wont grow stones nicks face went ugly i stole a statue he said she killed someone and twisted a demon curse to hide that she still has it id say im better than a foul demonmarked witch i sputtered pulse pounding as i felt myself go lightheaded damn him ivy leapt at nick jenks yanked her back using her shifting momentum to swing himself into nick hands made into fists jenks punched him solidly on his jaw i took a gasping breath and the is guys turned their walk into a run angry but with a modicum of restraint compared to jenks i got in nicks face you sorryassed bastard i shouted spitting hair out of my mouth you ran into us i wanted to say more but nick pushed himself at me jenks was still holding him and all three of us went down instinct kept my hands before my face and the bandages on my palms were the only thing that saved my skin pain shot through my ribs and hands as i hit the grating the cold metal pressed into my leg where my jeans were torn get off her ivy snarled she yanked nick up and away and suddenly i could breathe again i looked up in time to see him spin into jenks like a choreographed dance jenks cocked his fist and this time connected right under his jaw nicks eyes rolled up and he crumpled damn that felt good the pixy said shaking his hand as a thick is officer grabbed his shoulders you know how long ive wanted to do that he said letting the men drag him off being big is good shaking so hard i felt i might fall apart i got up bobbing my head at the fib officers unheard questions and obediently going where he directed me but i lost it when a hand closed on my arm rachel no ivy shouted and i turned my spinandkick into a spinandhairtoss adrenaline cleared my thoughts and i took a painfully deep breath the man released me knowing i had almost landed one on him his mustache bunched and his eyebrows were high questioning as he looked at me with new eyes he killed him i shouted for the benefit of the watching weres and starting to cry like a distraught girlfriend he killed him hes dead the sad reality was the tears leaking from me werent that hard to dredge up how could nick say that to me even in anger a foul demonmarked witch he had called me a foul demonmarked witch my sense of betrayal rose higher cementing my anger jenks wiggled out of the grip of the two men holding him and as they shouted and tried to catch him he darted for my bag on the pavement grinning he tucked my phone and my wallet inside before shaking everything down i wasnt sure but i think the remote went through the grating and i breathed easier an is officer grabbed him cuffing him before shoving him back into our little group the man shuffled through my bag before returning it to me i thought it better to let the stonefaced guy have his way than bring up my rights thanks i muttered to jenks feeling my ribs ache as i looped the strap over my shoulder i looked at nicks wrecked truck as we passed the artifact was still there thanks to an excited fib guy in a brown suit keeping everyone back my pleasure he said limping i meant for hitting him so did i the is officer at my elbow frowned but when he saw the covered body he seemed to ease jenks had punched nick not done anything permanent like killing him maam the officer said id ask you to stay away from the other party until we get this sorted out party yeah this was one big joke yes sir i said then stiffened when he slipped one of those plasticcoated charmedsilver wraps on my wrist and tightened it with a slick motion damn it all to hell hey i protested feeling abused as jenks and ivy exchanged tired looks im fine im not going to hurt anyone i cant even do ley line magic not on this bridge anyway the officer shook his head and i felt trapped the weight of kistens bracelet caught between my skin and the restraint can i sit withwith my boyfriend i managed a warble in my voice and the beefy man put a comforting hand on my shoulder yes maam he said his voice softening theyre taking him to the hospital to pronounce him you can ride with him if you want im sorry he looked like a nice guy plan a for getting the wacko witch off the accident scene right out of the handbook thank you i said wiping my eyes you were the driver maam he asked as we walked and when i nodded he added may i see your license aw shit yes sir i said fumbling in my bag for it in five minutes the cincinnati branch of the is would be telling him all about me we halted at the back of a black is blazer the tailgate down to show an open kennel there was a dog out here behind me i heard ivy and jenks telling the officers with them that they were my roommates oh god ivys brimstone i probably smelled like an addict accident points what if they took my license the officer before me squinted to see my license in the fading light smiling when he looked up ill have this right back to you ms morgan then you can go with your boyfriend and get yourself looked at eyebrows high he glanced at my bandaged hands and ripped jeans before nodding to jenks and ivy and trotting away to leave us with two officers thank you i said to no one exhausted i leaned against the truck jenks had been cuffed to the truck and the two fib guys moved a short distance close enough to intervene if necessary but clearly waiting for more is personnel to handle our interrogation holding my elbows with my scraped hands i watched my life swirl down the crapper rubberneckers passed with an infuriating slowness faces pressed against the windows as they struggled to see in the deepening dusk my new jeans were ripped almost to the knee the truck refused to burn a fourth were pack wearing military dress uniforms had joined the three already here all of them edging the limits of the fib and is officers keeping them back had i forgotten anything oh yeah i had helped kill someone and it was going to turn around and bite me on the ass i didnt want to go to jail unlike takata i looked awful in orange damn it ivy said licking a thumb and trying to rub out the new scrape on her leather pants these were my favorite pair my gaze went to the truck the knot in my stomach grew tighter leaning i reclined against the blazers tailgate and silently fumed as i categorized the arriving inderlanders into their jobs pulled in from their scattered locations the willowy blond witch was probably their extraction specialist not only comforting information from distraught victims but from testosteroneladen bucks who wouldnt talk to anyone unless it might get her into bed with them then there was the guy too fat to do real street work but who had a mustache so he had to be important hed be good at keeping angry people apart and would tell me he could get me a deal if i was willing to spill the dog team was at the mack truck since he was the one who had crossed the yellow line but i was sure hed get to the pickup soon then probably make a little visit over here i looked for and finally found the officer who was slightly off and took his job too seriously to be safe this was the guy that no one trusted and even fewer liked usually a witch or were too young to be a fat man with a mustache but too gunhappy to be a data guy he was walking around the broken pickup hiking up his belt with his weapon and looking at the girders as if they might hold a sniper ready to take us all out and dont forget the is detective i thought i didnt see him or her but since someone had died one would show up soon fib officers were everywhere taking their measurements and pictures seeing them in control of the site kind of threw me but remembering the intensive data the cincinnati fib had shared with me during a murder investigation i probably shouldnt have been surprised ivy slumped against the side of the is vehicle arms crossed and thoroughly ticked she stared at the ambulance nick was in as if she could kill him by her gaze alone me i was more worried about how we were going to get that truck burning i was getting the feeling it wasnt going to happen a heavy wrecker was inching its way into place rollers moving with a sedate laziness apparently they wanted to get it off the bridge before the news crews showed up slipping out of his cuffs jenks levered himself to sit beside me on the tailgate a pained grunt coming from him you okay i asked though clearly he wasnt bruise he said eyes fixed to nicks blue truck with an obnoxious beeping the wrecker backed up to it here i said pulling my bag around and starting to rummage ive got an amulet ivy never takes any of my amulets and im not used to you being big enough to use them why arent you using it he said stretching his shoulder with a pained look i have no right to i said my throat closing when i glanced at peter i was glad he wasnt trying to convince me otherwise and i hardly felt the prick of the finger stick for the blood to invoke it ivy shifted telling me she had noticed the fresh blood despite the wind but she was the last vamp i had anything to be worried about usually thanks he said as he draped it over his head in obvious relief i wonder if theres any way you can make tiny amulets im going to miss these its worth a try i said thinking that unless that truck spontaneously combusted from ivys glare id have about a week to find out once the weres realized the artifact was fake theyd be knocking on my door assuming i didnt land in jail i felt as if we were three kids standing outside the principals office not that i had any experience in that area much nicks truck went atop the wrecker in a horrendous noise of whining winches and complaining hydraulic machinery the garage guy moved slowly his dirty blue overalls and cap pulled down low pressing levers and buttons seemingly at random the overzealous is guy was telling him to hustle and get his vehicle out of the way before the first news van arrived the driver walked with a limp almost unnoticed amid the fib and is uniforms and i thought it rude they made the old man move faster than he comfortably could someone had moved one of the massive construction lights to illuminate the area and as the distant generators rumbled to life a quarter mile away a soft glow swelled into a harsh glare washing out the gray of the fading sunset slowly the background rumble became unnoticed mind whirling for an idea i dropped the spent finger stick in my shoulder bag and sighed i froze fingers brushing the familiar objects in my bag something was missing besides the remote shocked i stared into the dark fabric bag tilting it so the growing light would illuminate what it could the sight of my things scattered on the grating when nick knocked me down passed through my mind its gone i said feeling unreal i looked up meeting first jenkss and then ivys wondering gaze as she pulled herself away from the vehicle the wolf statue is gone i said trying to decide if i should laugh or curse that i had been right in not trusting nick the bastard took it he knocked me down and took it i had been right to leave the totem shoved between jenkss silk underwear and his dozen toothbrushes damn it id have been happy to have been wrong this one time piss on my daises jenks said thats why he picked a fight ivys bewildered face cleared in understanding at least she thought she understood excuse me she said pushing herself away from the is vehicle ivy wait i said wishing id told her what i had done though it wasnt as if i could shout that nick had a fake i pushed from the tailgate pain shot through me reminding me i had just been hit by a truck ivy i shouted and an is guy headed after her wont take but a moment she called over her shoulder she stormed across the closed lanes uniforms coming from all over to head her off i moved to follow immediately finding my elbow in the grip of one of the mustache guys images of court dates and jail cells kept me still as the first man to touch ivy went down when she stiffarmed him in the jaw a call went up and i watched with a sinking sensation remembering when she and jenks had taken out an entire floor of fib officers but it was is runners this time maybe we should have told her i said and jenks smirked rubbing his wrist where his cuffs had been she needs to blow off some steam he said then whispered holy crap look his green eyes were brilliant in the mercury light hammering down on us and my jaw dropped when i followed his gaze to the wrecker the brighter light made obvious what the shadows had hid before the garage guys hands were spotlessly clean and the dark stain on the knee of his blue overalls was too wet to be oil nick i breathed not knowing how he got his hair that dirty white so fast he was still wearing my disguise amulet but with the overalls and cap he was unrecognizable jenks stood beside me whispering what in tinks garden of sin is he doing i shook my head seeing the weres watching him too double damn i think they knew it was him he thinks he has the focus i said hes trying to get the original too leaving us holding the bag jenks finished in disgust what a slugs ass if he doesnt go to the hospital and die on paper then we have a dead vamp to explain and will be brought up on insurance fraud rache im too pretty to go to jail face cold i turned to jenks my stomach in knots we have to stop him he nodded and i cupped my hands to my mouth ivy i shouted the wrecker it wasnt the smartest thing to do but it got results ivy took one look and realized it was nick crying out she slugged the last is agent and took off running only to be brought down by a lucky snag by a previously felled officer she sprawled cuffs on her in two seconds flat jenks flowed into motion distracting the surrounding fib officers thinking this was going to look great on my résumé i sidestepped them and ran for the wrecker people were shouting and someone had probably pulled a weapon as i heard stop or ill use force force my ass i thought if they shot me id sue their bright little badges from here to the turn i didnt have anything stronger than a pain amulet id been searched and they knew it it was right about then that nick realized i was coming for him clearly frightened he jerked the door open a cry went up when his engine revved loud over the generators there was a piercing whistle and the leader of the unknown military faction waved his hand above his head as if in direction horns started to blow when three street racers stopped in traffic and weres got out grimfaced they closed in they werent happy neither was i stop him came a bark of a demand and i picked up my pace i was going to get to nick first or whoever beat me to him was going to get my foot in their gut he had hurt and betrayed me leaving me to clean up his mess and take his fall twice not this time my gaze was fixed fervently on the truck as it lurched almost stalling but a flash of pixy dust jerked me to a stop jax i exclaimed shocked ms morgan the adolescent pixy said hovering before my nose with an amulet as big as he was his eyes bright and his wings red in excitement nick wanted me to tell you hes sorry and he loves you he really does jax i said blinking as even the sparkles from his dust faded my eyes went to the truck the wheels were smoking as nick tried to get the heavy vehicle moving with a lurch the wheels caught my face went cold as i realized it was headed right for me i watched him fight the huge wheel arms stiff and fear in his eyes struggling to turn it rachel get out of the way ivy screamed over the rumble of the engine i froze as the wheels turned missing me the tires taking the weight compressing dangerously jenks crashed into me knocking me farther out of the way stifling a gasp i hit the pavement for the third time in the last hour the truck roared past in a frightening noise and a breeze of diesel fumes a crack followed by a boom shook my insides the sound rolling over my back like a wave jenks held my head down and a second boom followed the first what in hell was that heart pounding i pushed jenks off me and lifted my head the wrecker was careening out of control the tires blown out someone had shot out his tires i scrambled up when the wrecker with nicks truck swerved wildly to avoid the scattering news crews tires squealing and gears grinding the brakes burned as he locked them momentum kept the vehicle movingcareening into the temporary railing nick i screamed when the wrecker crashed through it like toast with a shocking silence it was gone heart in my throat i hobbled to the edge too hurt to stand upright jenks was behind me and he yanked me back when i reached the crumbling edge the wind gusted up from the distant water blowing my hair out of my eyes i looked down dizzy hand to my stomach i started to hyperventilate my sight grew gray and i pushed jenkss hand off me im okay i mumbled but there wasnt anything to see six hundred feet makes even a wrecker small nick had been in it god help me easy rache jenks said easing me back and making me sit nick i mumbled forcing my eyes wide as the cold pavement met my rear i wasnt going to pass out damn it i wasnt i looked at the edge the roadway cracked to show the metal embedded in it threatening to give way where the trucks weight had hit it hard shiny shoes clustered around me belonging to the officers peering down at the edges of the excited crowd were the weres they were dressed in suits leather and military uniforms but the look on their faces was the same disbelief and shock it was gone the crackle of a radio intruded coming from the is officer swearing softly as he peered over the edge this is ralph he said thumbing the button we have two trucks off the bridge and a body in the water smile everyone were going to make the evening news i missed what was said back lost in the hiss of bad reception and the thundering of my heart as i tried to fit it into my head he had gone over the bridge nick had gone off the bridge yup the man said confirm a commercial vehicle towing a pickup truck off the bridge and a body in the water better get the boat out here anybody got marshals number he listened to the response then clipped it to his belt hands on his hips he stared down soft swear words dropped from him like the gray smoke from his cigarette mixing with the faint scent of incense ralph was a living vamp the first local id seen apart from the one who had bandaged my leg i wondered whose neck he didnt bite to get stuck with a job up here so far from the bustle of the city they thrived on i pulled my head up will he be all right i asked and ralph glanced at me surprised lady he said noticing me he died of a heart attack before he hit the water and if that didnt get him he died on impact at this height its like hitting a brick wall i blinked trying to take that in a brick wall it would be the second brick wall nick hit today my focus blurred the sight of jax and that amulet filling my memory what if the body i insisted and he turned impatient when can they retrieve the body theyll never find it he said the current will take it moving it out into lake huron faster than green corn through a tourist hes gone the only way he would have survived was if he was dead already damn im glad im not the one who has to talk to the next of kin i bet hes got three kids and a wife i hunched over the reality of what had happened sinking in god bless it i was twice the fool nick hadnt died going over the edge this had been a scam right from when i told him he couldnt have the statueand i had walked right into it his name was nick i whispered and the is officer spun from the drop surprise on his agelined face ivy and jenks stiffened i was blowing our cover but we were going to be questioned before too long and i wanted our stories to be the same nick sparagmos i added thinking fast he was helping us with a piece of art i was contracted to recover im an independent runner out of cincinnati and this was a run the truth is good he wasnt supposed to be here i continued as ivys tension pulled her shoulders tight but when that guy hit us and killed peter i took a breath the heartache real peter was only supposed to make sure it got to the right people okay he wasnt supposed to get hurt the people we recovered it fromi think the accident was their attempt to get it back before we handed it over nick came out with the wrecker to make sure they didnt get it the artifact was still on the truck he was going to get it out of here but someone shot the tires out oh god he went right over the edge and a little lie mixed in with the truth keeps me showering alone jenks put a hand on my shoulder and gave it a squeeze to tell me he understood peter had been killed in the pickup truck in an accident to satisfy the insurance company nick had died when he went over the edge to satisfy the weres that nick was the driver of the mack truck as well wouldnt even be considered the drivers absence explained as a hit and run if anyone got curious and found out the truck belonged to delavine hed be the one slapped with the illegal early termination lawsuit from the insurance company not me it sounded good to me i was going to stick with it i could almost feel the worry ease out of jenks but ivy was still a knot of tension not knowing that nick had gotten away with absolutely nothing the is officer who had taken my license ambled up to the man before me hi ralph you got out here quick he turned to me camaraderie in the witchs eyes as he handed me my license back ms morgan what are you doing this far out of the hollows cincinnati ralph looked at me in surprise you mean rachel morgan his gaze went to ivy youre piscarys girl what are you doing this far north getting my partners boyfriend killed she said and the man took her ugly look as dark humor officer ralph already had his cuff key out and was getting them off her frowning when he realized jenks wasnt in his i held up my wrist with my little black strap and he snipped it off with a special pair of clippers on his key chain i wanted one of those where are you staying ralph asked as ivy rubbed her freed wrists im going to want to talk to you before you go home ivy explained while i stared at the water nick wasnt dead and the shock of seeing him go over the edge was evolving into a nasty feeling of satisfaction i had beat him i had beat nick at his own game knees shaking i stumbled away ivy hurriedly finished up with ralph and with her on one side and jenks on the other i started to chuckle i didnt know how we were going to get to the room three of us wouldnt fit in kistens corvette very well tinks daisies jenks whispered to ivy behind my back shes lost it im fine i said cursing myself and laughing hes fine the crazy bastard is fine jenks exchanged a sorrowful glance at ivy rache he said softly you heard the man i read the place mat about how many people they lost building the bridge he wouldnt survive hitting the water and even if he did hed be unconscious and drown nick is gone we passed the news crews and i took a shallow breath finding comfort in that my ribs hurt i was alive and i was going to stay that way nick knew that too i admitted in the dimmer light and yeah hes gone but hes not dead jenks took a breath to protest and i interrupted jax was here i said and jenks pulled us all to a stop in the middle of the closed northbound lane people swirled around us but we were forgotten jax jenks exclaimed yanked into silence by ivy shut up she snarled he had an inertiadampening amulet i said and jenkss face went from hope to a heartbreaking look of understanding jax was here to fly it down to the water before the tow truck hit and the nos i continued as jenks paled it never exploded he used the charges to blow the tires knowing the truck was heavy enough to go through the temporary railing ivys face was empty but her eyes were starting to go black with anger shaking my head i looked away before she scared me ill give marshal a call but i bet hes missing some equipment i never looked to see what nick had in that truck locker hes got hes swimming out of here and i bet jax is with him a pained sound came from jenks and i wished i could have said it wasnt true feeling his pain i met his eyes they showed a deep betrayal he would never talk about jenks had taught jax all he could in the last few days with the idea that the pixy would take his place and jax had taken that and used it to burn us with nick im sorry jenks i said but he turned away shoulders hunched and looking old ivy tried to tuck a strand of tooshort hair behind her ear im sorry too jenks but we have a big problem as soon as nick gets himself safely settled as a nonentity hes going to sell that thing and all hell is going to break loose between the vamps and the weres something in me hardened and the last of my feelings for nick died i smiled at ivy without showing my teeth hiking my bag farther up my bruised shoulder he wont sell it and why not she asked snarky because he doesnt have the real one i looked for kistens corvette finding it standing by a pylon maybe we could splurge and move to the holiday inn tonight i could use a hot tub i didnt move the curse to the wolf statue i added remembering i was in the middle of a thought i moved it to the totem jenks was going to give matalina ivy stared at us reading in jenkss lack of response that she was the only one who hadnt known he was staring at nothing pain still etched in his posture that his son had just buried in the dirt everything he cared about when were you going to tell me she accused blush coloring her cheeks she looked good when she was mad and i smiled a real one this time what i said and risk spending the next two days trying to convince you to change your plan she huffed and i touched her arm i tried to tell you i said but you stormed off like you were an avenging angel ivy eyed my fingers on her arm and i pulled them away hesitating a bare instant nicks an ass i said but hes smart if i had told you you would have acted differently and he would have known but you told jenks she said its hiding in his jockey shorts i said in exasperation not wanting to talk about it anymore god ivy im not going to mess with jenkss underwear unless he knows about it ivy pouted the sixfoot sexy vampire in scraped black leather crossed her arms before her and pouted im probably going to have to do more community service for hitting all those is officers she grumbled thanks a hell of a lot i slumped hearing forgiveness in her words at least he didnt get it i offered and ivy threw a hand in the air and tried to look disgusted but i could tell she was relieved jenks found a thin smile his gaze going to kistens corvette can i drive he asked lips pressed ivy frowned were not going to all fit in that maybe we can bum a ride from ralph give me a moment okay we can fit jenks said ill move the seat back and rachel can sit on my lap ivy went one way and jenks went the other my protest froze when i found a point of stillness in the swirling mess of reporters officers and watchers my lips parted it was brett standing on a cement barrier so he could look over the crowd he was watching me and when our eyes met he touched the brim of his cap in salute there was a rip in it where the emblem had been removed and with a significant motion he took it off and let it fall turning away he started to walk for the mackinaw city end of the bridge and he was gone i realized he thought i had done it and went cold he thought id blown out the tires of the wrecker and killed nick for trying to do a double run on me damn i didnt know if that kind of reputation would save my life or get me killed rache jenks returned from pushing the passengers seat back as far as it would go what is it i put a hand to my cold face and met his worried eyes nothing determined to figure it out later i sent my thoughts instead to the bath i was going to take i had beaten nick at his own game the question was would i survive it thirtyfive my boot heel slipped on the uneven sidewalk and the sound of me catching my step was dull in the air heavy from the evenings rain the faint twinge in my leg reminded me that it wasnt quite right yet the sun was long gone and clouds made the night darker than it ought to be close and warm i splashed through a puddle in too good a mood to care if my ankles got wet pizza dough was rising in my kitchen and i had a grocery sack of toppings lunch was going to be early tonight ivy had a run and kisten was taking me to a movie and i didnt want to fill up on popcorn passing under a lamplit pollutionstunted maple i reached to touch its leaves in passing smiling at the green softness brushing my skin they were damp and i let my hand stay wet and cool in the night air the street was quiet the only human family living there was inside watching tv and everyone else was at work or school the hum of cincinnati was far away and distant the rumble of sleeping lions i adjusted the strap of my new canvas grocery bag thinking that in the time wed been gone spring had shifted into high gear it was almost a year since id quit the is and im alive i whispered to the world i was alive and doing well no i was doing great a soft clearing of a throat zinged through me but i managed not to jerk or alter my pace it had come from across the street and i searched the shadows until i found a wellmuscled were in jeans and a dress shirt he had been shadowing me all week it was brett i forced my jaw to unclench and gave him a respectful nod receiving a snappy salute in return free arm swinging i continued down the street hitting the puddles that were in my way brett wouldnt bother me that he was looking for the focus had occurred to meeither wanting to confirm that it was truly gone or use it to buy his way back into walters good graces if it wasntbut i didnt think so it looked like he was going loner when he dropped his cap on the mackinac bridge and walked away but he was just watching now david had done the same for months before he finally made his presence known when unsure of their rank weres were patient and wary hed come to me when he was ready and i was in far too good a mood to worry about it i was so glad to be home my stitches were out and the scars were thin lines easily hidden my limp was fading and thanks to that curse i used to were i had absolutely no freckles the soft air slipped easily in and out of my lungs as i walked and i felt sassy sassy and badass in my vampmade boots and jenkss aviator jacket i was wearing the cap jenks had stolen from the island weres and it added a nice bit of bad girl the guy behind the counter at the corner store had thought i was cute i passed my covered car in the open garage and my mood faltered the is had suspended my license it just wasnt fair i had saved them a dump truck of political hassle and did i get even a thankyou no they took my license not wanting to lose my good mood i forced my brow smooth the is had publicly announced on the back page of the community section of the paper that i was cleared of all suspicion of any wrongdoing in the accidental deaths that had taken place on the bridge but behind closed doors some undead vamp had given me a hard time for trying to handle such a powerful artifact instead of bringing it to them he didnt back off until jenks threatened to cut off his balls and give them to me to make a magic bola you gotta love friends like that the undead vampire didnt get me to confess that id meant to kill peter and that cheesed him off to no end he had been beautifully dangerous with snowwhite hair and sharp features and even though he whipped me up to the point where i would have had his baby he couldnt scare me into forgetting i had rights not after id survived piscarywho didnt care about them the entire nationwide is was pissed at me believing the focus had gone over the edge with nick instead of being turned over to them there was a continuous twentyfourhour search going on for the artifact on the bottom of the straits the locals thought they were stupid since the current had put it in lake huron shortly after the truck hit the water and i thought they were stupid because the real artifact was hidden in jenkss living room with their official stand being what it was the is couldnt lock me up but with the added points after the accident with peter they could suspend my license my choices were riding the bus for six months or gritting my teeth and taking drivers ed god no id be the oldest one in the class my mood tarnishing i took the churchs stairs two at a time and felt my leg protest i pulled the heavy wooden door open slipped inside and breathed deeply relishing the scent of tomato paste and bacon the pizza dough was probably ready and kistens sauce had been simmering for the better part of the day he had kept me company in the kitchen all afternoon while i finished restocking my charm cupboard even helped me clean my mess i shut the door with hardly a thump all the windows in the church were open to let in the moist night i couldnt wait to get into the garden tomorrow and even had a few seeds i wanted to try out ivy was laughing at me and the stack of seed catalogs that somehow found me despite my address change but id caught her looking at one tucking a stray curl behind my ear i wondered if i might splurge for the tendollaraseed packet of black orchids shed been eyeing they were wickedly hard to get and even more difficult to grow but with jenkss help who knew slipping off my wet boots and coat i left them by the door and padded in my socks through the peaceful sanctuary the hush of a passing car came in through the high transom windows above the stainedglass windows the pixies had worked for hours chiseling the old paint off and oiling the hinges so i could open them with the long pole id found in the belfry stairway there were no screens which was why the lights were off there were no pixies either my desk was again my desk thank all that was holy my wandering attention touched on the potted plants jenks had left behind on my desk and i jerked to a halt seeing a pair of green eyes under the chair catching the light slowly my breath slipped from me darn cat i whispered thinking rex was going to scare the life out of me if she didnt break my heart first i crouched to try to coax her to me but rex didnt move didnt blink didnt even twitch her beautiful tail rex didnt like me much she liked ivy just fine she loved the garden the graveyard and the pixies that lived in it but not me the little ball of orange fluff would sleep on ivys bed purr under her chair during breakfast for tidbits and sit on her lap but she only stared at me with large unblinking eyes i couldnt help but feel hurt i think she was still waiting for me to turn back into a wolf the sound of kisten and ivys voices intruded over the slow jazz hiking the canvas bag higher i awkwardly inched closer to rex hand held out ivy and i had been home a week and we were all still in emotional limbo three seconds after ivy and i walked in the door kisten looked at my dental floss stitches breathed deeply and knew what had happened in an instant ivy had gone from happytobehome to depressed her face full of an aching emptiness shed dropped her bags and took off on her bike to get it checked over just as well kisten and i had a long painful discussion where he both sorrowed after and admired my new scars it felt good to confess to someone that ivy had scared the crap out of me and even better when he agreed that in time she might forget her own fear and try to find a blood balance with me since then hed been his usual self almost there was a sly hesitancy in his touch now as if he was holding himself to a limit of action to see if i would change it the unhappy result was the mix of danger and security that i loved in him was gone not wanting to interfere in anything ivy and i might find he had put me in charge of moving our relationship forward i didnt like being in charge i liked the heart pounding rush of being lured into making decisions that might turn bad on me realizing as much was depressing it seemed that ivy and jenks were right that not only was i an adrenaline junkie but i needed a sensation of danger to get turned on thinking about it now my mood thoroughly soured i crouched beside my desk arm extended to try to get the stupid cat to like me her neck stretched out and she sniffed my fingers but wouldnt bump her head under my hand as she would ivys giving up i stood and headed for the back of the church following the sound of kistens masculine rumble i took a breath to call out and tell them i was there but my feet stilled when i realized they were talking about me well you did bite her kisten said his voice both lightly accusing and coaxing i bit her ivy admitted her voice a whisper and you didnt bind her he prompted no i heard the creak of her chair as she repositioned herself guilt making her shift she wants to know what comes next kisten said with a rude laugh hell i want to know myself nothing ivy said shortly its not going to happen again i licked my lips thinking i should back out of the hallway and come in making more noise but i couldnt move staring at the worn wood by the archway to the living room kisten sighed thats not fair you strung her along until she called your bluff and now you wont go forward and she cant go back look at her he said and i imagined him gesturing at nothing she wants to find a blood balance god ivy isnt that what you wanted ivys breath came harsh i could have killed her she exclaimed and i jumped i lost control just like always and almost killed her she let me do it because she trusted me her words were now muffled she understood everything and she didnt stop me youre scared kisten accused and my eyes widened at his gall but ivy took it in stride as she laughed sarcastically you think no he insisted i mean youre scared youre afraid to try to find a balance you can both live with because if you try and cant she leaves and youve got nothing thats not it she said flatly and i nodded that was part of it but not all kisten leaned forward i could hear the chair creak you think you dont deserve anything good he said and my face went cold wondering if there was more to this than i had thought afraid youre going to ruin every decent thing you get so youre going to stick with this shitty half relationship instead of seeing where it might go its not a half relationship ivy protested he touched the truth i thought but thats not what keeps her silent compared to what you might have it is he said and i heard someone get up and move shes straight and youre not kisten added and my pulse quickened his voice was now coming from where ivy sat she sees a deep platonic relationship and you know that even if you start one youll eventually delude yourself into believing its deeper shell be your friend when what you want is a lover and one night in a moment of blood passion youre going to make a mistake in a very concrete way and shell be gone shut up she shouted and i heard a slap perhaps of a hand meeting someones grip kisten laughed gently ending it with a sigh of understanding i got it right that time his liquid voice gray with truth sent a shiver through me back up i told myself back up and go play with the cat i could hear my heartbeat in the silence from the disc player the song ended are you going to share blood with her again it was a gentle hesitant inquiry and ivy took a noisy breath i cant mind if i do oh god this time i did move pulling the canvas bag tight to me kisten already had my body if we shared blood it would be too much for ivys pride something would break bastard ivy said pulling my retreat to a halt you know how i feel about her he said im not going to walk away because of your asinine hangups about blood my lips parted at his bitter accusation and ivys breath hissed hangups she said vehemently mixing sex with bloodletting is the only way i can keep from losing control with someone i love kisten i thought i was better but obviously im not it had been bitter and accusing but kistens voice was harsh with his own frustration i dont understand ivy he said and i heard him move away from her i never did blood is blood love is love you arent a whore if you take someones blood when you dont like them and you arent a whore for wanting someone you dont like to take your blood this is where i am kisten she said im not touching her and neither are you my pulse pounded and i heard in his heavy exhalation the sound of an old argument that had no answer rachels worth fighting for he said softly if she asks me i wont say no i closed my eyes seeing where this was heading and because youre a man ivy said bitterly she wont have a problem when the blood turns to sex will she probably not it was confident and my eyes opened damn you she whispered sounding broken i hate you kisten was silent and then i heard the soft sound of a kiss you love me mouth dry i stood in the hallway afraid to move in the silence the last sound track had left ivy kisten coaxed i wont lure her from you but i wont sit by and pretend im a stone either just talk to her she knows where your feelings are and she still has the room next to yours not an apartment across the city maybe my eyes closed in the swirl of conflicting feelings the image of me sharing a room with ivy flitted through my mind shocking me of me slipping between those silken sheets and sliding up to her back smelling her hair feeling her turn over and seeing her easy smile four inches from mine i knew how her eyes would be lidded and heavy with sleep the soft sound of welcome she would make what in hell was i doing shes rash kisten said impulsive and the most caring person i have ever met she told me what happened but she doesnt think anything less of you or herself even when it went wrong shut up ivy whispered pain and selfreproach in her voice you opened the door he accused making her come to grips with what we had done and if you dont walk her through it shell find someone who will i dont have to ask your permission and unless you tell me right now that someday youre going to try to find a blood balance with her i will if she asks me i shivered jerking when a soft brush on my leg made me jump it was rex but i was little more to her than something to brush up against as she headed to the living room following the sound of ivys distress i cant ivy exclaimed and i jumped piscary she took a gasping breath piscary will step in and hell make me hurt her maybe kill her thats an excuse he hammered on her the truth is that youre scared i stood in the hallway and trembled feeling the tension rise in the unseen room but kistens voice was gentle now that hed gotten her to admit her feelings you should tell her that he continued softly ivy sniffed half in sorrow half in bitter amusement i just did shes in the hall i sucked in my breath and jerked upright shit kisten said his voice panicked rachel pulling up my shoulders i raised my chin and went into the kitchen kisten scuffed to a halt in the hall and tension slammed into me his lanky build wide shoulders and my favorite red silk shirt took up the archway he had on boots and they looked good peeping from under his jeans his bracelet felt heavy on me and i twisted it wondering if i should take it off rachel i didnt know you were there he said his face creased im sorry you arent a toy that i have to ask ivys permission to play with i kept my back to him shoulders stiff while i opened the canvas sack and took things out leaving the cheese mushrooms and the pineapple where they were i strode to the pantry hanging my grocery bag up on the hook id nailed in yesterday images of ivys comfortable room of kistens face his body the way he felt under my fingers the way he made me feel all flashed through me pace stilted i went to the stove and took the lid off the sauce steam billowed up the rising scent of tomato making the wisps of my hair drift i stirred without seeing as he came up behind me rachel my breath came out and i held the next one i was so confused softlyalmost not therekisten put a hand on my shoulder tension slipped from me and sensing it he leaned until his body pressed against my back his arms went around me imprisoning me and my motions to stir the pot stilled she knew the moment i came in i said probably he whispered into my ear i wondered where ivy wasif she had stayed in the living room or fled the church entirely shamed that she had needs and fears like the rest of us kisten took the spoon from me setting it between the burners before turning me around i pulled my eyes to his not surprised to see them narrow with concern the glow from the overhead light shimmered on his dayold stubble and i touched it because i could his arms were about my waist and he gave a tug settling me closer into him what she cant say to your face shell say when she knows youre listening he said its a bad habit she picked up in therapy i had already figured that one out and bobbed my head this is a mess i said miserable as i looked over his shoulder to the dark hallway i never should have my words cut off when kisten pulled me closer arms about his waist and my head against his chest i breathed deeply the scent of leather and silk relaxing into him yes he whispered you should have he pushed me back until i could see his eyes i wont ask he said earnestly if it happens it happens i like things the way they are his expression grew sly id like it better if things changed but when change is too quick the strong break my eyes on the archway i stood and held him not wanting to let go i could hear ivy in the living room trying to find a way to make a graceful entrance the warmth of his body was soothing and i held my breath against the thought of his teeth sinking into me i knew exactly how good it would feel what was i going to do about that kistens head came up an instant before the peal of the front doorbell echoed through the church i got it ivy shouted and kisten and i pulled apart before her boots made a soft brush down the hall the light flicked on in the hallway and i heard the beginnings of a low conversation the mushrooms needed cutting and kisten joined me as i washed my hands we jostled for space at the sink bumping hips as he pushed me into a better mood cut them at an angle he admonished when i reached for the cutting board he had his hands in the flour bag then clapped them once over the sink before putting himself at the center island counter and the ball of dough he had set to rise under a piece of linen it makes a difference still melancholy i moved my stuff to the opposite side of the counter so i could watch him david i shouted eating the first mushroom slice it was probably him seeing as id asked him to come over a low noise escaped kisten and i smiled he looked good over there a brush of flour made a domestic smear on his shirt and he had rolled up his sleeves to show his lightly tanned arms seeing him gently handling the dough and watching me at the same time i realized the thrill was backthe delicious danger of whatif he had told ivy he wasnt going to walk away from me i was on dangerous ground again god save me i thought in disgust could i be any more stupid my life was so messed up how could i just stand here and cut mushrooms as if everything was normal but compared to last week maybe this was normal my attention came up when david walked in ahead of ivy his slight build looking blocky before her sleek grace hi david i said trying to clear my mind full moon tonight he nodded saying nothing as he took in kisten casually pulling the dough into a circle i cant stay he said realizing we were making lunch i have a few appointments but you said it was urgent he smiled at kisten hi kisten hows the boat still afloat he said eyebrows rising as he took in davids expensive suit he was working and he looked the part despite the heavy stubble the full moon made worse it wont take long i said slicing the last mushroom ive got something i want you to take a look at picked it up on vacation and i want your opinion his eyes went wondering but he unbuttoned his long leather duster now full moon i said cryptically sliding the sliced mushrooms into my smallest spell pot and quashing the faint worry that i was breaking rule number two by mixing food prep and spell prep but they were just the right size to hold toppings ivy quietly went to the fridge getting out the cheese cooked hamburger and the bacon left over from breakfast i tried to meet her eyes to tell her we were okay but she wouldnt look at me angry i slammed the knife down careful to keep my fingers out of the way silly little vamp afraid of her feelings kisten sighed his eyes on the disk of dough he had tossed professionally into the air someday im going to get you two ladies together i dont do threesomes i said snidely david jerked but kistens eyes went sultry and pensive even as he caught the dough thats not what i was talking about but okay ivys cheeks were red and david froze as he took in the sudden tension uh the were said half out of his coat maybe this isnt a good time i dredged up a smile no i said its just everyday normal crap were used to it david finished taking off his coat frowning im not he muttered i went to the sink and leaned toward the window thinking david was a bit of a prude jenks i shouted into the dusky garden alight with pixy children tormenting moths it was beautiful and i almost lost myself in the sifting bands of falling color a clatter of wings was my only warning and i jerked away when jenks vaulted through the pixy hole in the screen david he called out looking great in his casual gardening clothes of green and black hovering at eye level he brought the scent of damp earth into the kitchen thank tinks little red shoes youre here he said pulling up two feet when rex appeared in the doorway her eyes big and her ears pricked matalina is about ready to dewing me you gotta get this thing out of my living room my kids keep touching it making it move i felt myself blanch its moving now ivy and kisten exchanged worried looks and david sighed putting his hands into his pockets as if trying to divorce himself from what was coming he wasnt that much older than me but at that moment he looked like the only adult in a room full of adolescents what is it rachel he said sounding tired suddenly nervous i took a breath to tell him then changed my mind could youcould you just take a look at it i said wincing jenks landed on the windowsill and leaned casually against the frame he looked like brad pitt gone sexy farmer and i smiled two weeks ago he would have stood with his hands on his hips this was better and might explain matalinas blissful state lately ill have the boys bring it up jenks said tossing his hair out of his eyes weve got a sling for it wont take but a tick david he zipped back out the window and while david looked at his watch and moved from foot to foot i pushed the window all the way up struggling with the rainswollen frame the screen popped out and the air suddenly seemed a lot fresher this doesnt have anything to do with the were sentry at the end of the block does it david asked wryly whoops i turned my eyes going immediately to ivy sitting before her computer i hadnt told her brett was shadowing me knowing shed throw a hissy like i couldnt handle one were who was scared of me sure enough she was frowning you saw him huh i said putting my back to her and moving the sauce to kisten david shifted his weight and glanced at kisten as he nonchalantly spread it thinly on the dough i saw him david said smelled him and nearly dropped my cell phone down the sewer calling you to ask if you wanted me to ah ask him to go away until hemmmm i waited in the new silence broken by shrill pixy whistles coming from the garden davids face was red when he swung his head back up and rubbed a hand across his stubble what i said warily david looked discomfited he ah a quick glance at ivy and he blurted he gave me a bunny kiss from across the street ivys lips parted eyes wide her gaze touched on kisten then me excuse me you know he made a peace sign and bent his fingers twice in quick succession kiss kiss isnt that a vampirething kisten laughed the warm sound making me feel good rachel he said sifting the cheese over the red sauce what did you do to make him leave his pack and follow you all the way down here by the looks of it id say hes trying to insinuate himself into your pack brett didnt leave i think they kicked him out i said then hesitated you knew he was there too i asked and he shrugged eating a piece of bacon i ate one too considering for the first time that perhaps brett was looking for a new pack i had saved his life sort of jenks came in the open window making circles around rex until the cat chittered in distress laughing jenks led her into the hall as five of his kids wafted over the sill toting what looked like a pair of black lace panties cradling the statue those are mine ivy shrieked standing up and darting to the sink jenks the pixies scattered the statue wrapped in the black silk fell into her hand these are mine she said again red with anger and embarrassment as she pulled them off the statue and shoved them in her pocket damn it jenks stay out of my room jenks flew in just under the ceiling rex padded in under him her steps light and her eyes bright holy crap he exclaimed making circles around ivy wreathing her in a glittering band of gold how did your panties end up in my living room matalina zipped in her green silk dress furling and her eyes apologetic immediately jenks joined her i dont know if it was his joy of reuniting with matalina or his stint at being humansized but he was a lot faster with her was jhan a solemn seriousminded pixy who had recently been excused from sentry duties in order to learn how to read i didnt want to think about why ivy dropped the new focus onto the counter beside the pizza clearly in a huff as she backed away and sat sullenly in her chair her boots on the table and her ankles crossed david came closer and this time i couldnt stop my shudder jenks was right it had shifted again good god david said hunched to put it at eye level what is it i bent my knees crouching to come even with him the focus between us it didnt look like the same totem that i had put in jenkss suitcase the closer we had gotten to the full moon the more it looked like the original statue until now it was identical except for a quicksilver sheen hovering just above the surface like an aura ivy was wiping her fingers off on her pants and she quit when she saw my attention on them i couldnt blame her the thing gave me the willies kisten added the last of the meat pushing the pizza aside and putting his elbows on the counter an odd look on him as he saw it for the first time that has got to be the ugliest thing in creation he said touching his torn earlobe in an unconscious show of unease matalina nodded a pensive look on her beautiful features its not coming back in my house she said her clear voice determined its not jenks i love you but if it comes back in my house im moving into the desk and you can sleep with your dragonfly jenks hunched and made noises of placation and i met the small womans eyes with a smile if all went well david would be taking it off our hands david i said pulling myself straight uhhuh he murmured still staring at it have you ever heard of the focus at that a fearful expression flashed across his rugged features worrying me taking a step forward i slid the pizza stone off the counter i couldnt just give it to them i said opening the oven door and squinting in the heat that made my hair drift up the vampires would slaughter them what kind of a runner would i be if i let them get wiped out like that so you brought it here he stammered the focus to cincinnati i slid the stone into the oven and closed it leaning back to take advantage of the heat slipping past the shut door davids breath was shallow and the scent of musk rose rachel he said eyes riveted to it you know what this is right i meanoh my god its real tension pulling his small frame tight he straightened his attention went to kisten solemn behind the counter to jenks standing beside matalina to ivy snapping a fingernail on the rivet on her boot you hold it he said looking panicked its yours running my fingers through the hair at the back of my head i nodded i uh guess kisten jerked into motion whoops he said reaching hes going down david i exclaimed shocked when the small mans knees buckled i stretched for him but kisten had already slipped an arm under his shoulders while ivy fiddled with the rivet on her boot with a nail in feigned unconcern kisten lowered him into a chair i edged the vampire out of the way kneeling david i said patting his cheeks david immediately his eyes fluttered im okay he said pushing me away before he was fully conscious im all right taking a breath he opened his eyes his lips were pressed tightly together and he was clearly disgusted at himself wheredid you get it he said his head down the stories say its cursed if it wasnt a gift youre cursed i dont believe in curseslike that ivy said fear slid through me i believed in curses nick had stolen itnick had fallen off the mackinac bridge no he had jumped someone sent it to me i said everyone who knew i had it thinks it went over the bridge no one knows ive got it at that he pulled himself upright just that loner out there he said shifting his feet but staying seated he glanced at kisten who was at the sink washing the topping bowls as if this was all normal he doesnt know i said wincing when ivy went to set the timer on the stove crap id forgotten to again i think kistens right that he might be trying to get into our pack seeing as i trounced him i frowned not believing that he was digging for information and would go back to walter after the insult of being given to the street pack nodding davids gaze returned to the focus i got notification that you won another alpha contest he said clearly distracted are you okay jenks lifted off the table making glittering sparkles around me and bringing rex to my feet when he landed on my shoulder she did great he said ignoring the small cat you should have seen her rachel used the were charm she came out the size of a real wolf but had hair like a red setter he flitted up moving to ivy such a pretty puppy she was he crooned safely on ivys shoulder soft fuzzy earslittle black paws shut up jenks and the cutest little tail youve ever seen on a witch put a cork in it i said lunging for him fighting pam hadnt been a fair contest and i wondered who had credited me with the win at the were registery brett maybe laughing jenks zipped up and out of my reach ivy smiled softly never moving except for putting her feet on the floor where they belonged she looked proud of me i think red wolf david murmured as if it was curious but not important he had scooted his chair to the table and was reaching to the statue breath held he touched it and the carved bone gave way under his pressure like a balloon he pulled back an odd sound slipping from him nervous i sat down kittycorner to him the statue between us when i moved the curse to it it looked like a totem pole but every day it looked more like it did when we first got it until now it looks like this again david licked his lips dragging his attention from it for a brief second to meet my eyes then back to the statue something had shifted in him the fear was gone it wasnt avarice in his gaze but wonder his fingers curled under a mere inch from touching it and he shuddered that was enough for me i glanced at ivy and when she nodded i turned to jenks he stood beside mr fish and his tank of sea monkeys on the windowsill his ankles crossed and his arms over his chest but i still saw him as sixfootfour feeling my gaze on him he nodded will you hold it for me i asked david jerked his hand away and spun in his chair me why me jenks lifted smoothly into the air in a clatter of wings and landed next to it because if i dont get that freaky thing out of my living room matalina is going to leave me my eyebrows rose and ivy snickered matalina had almost pinned jenks to the flour canister when we had walked in crying and laughing to have him home again it had been hard on her so hard id never ask him to leave again youre the only were i trust to hold it i said for crying out loud david im your alpha who else am i going to give it to he looked at it then back to me rachel i cant this is too much flustered i moved my chair beside him its not a gift its a burden steeling myself i pulled the statue closer something this powerful cant go back into hiding once its in the open i said looking at its ugly curves i thought i saw a tear in its eyei wasnt sure even if accepting it might cause everything i care about to go down the crapper if we ignore it its going to bite us on our asses but if we meet it head on maybe we can come out better than when we went in kisten laughed and in front of her computer ivy froze by her suddenly closed expression i realized that what i had said could also be applied to her and myself i tried to catch her gaze but she wouldnt look up fiddling with the same rivet on her boot from the corner of my sight jenkss wings drooped as he watched us oblivious david stared at the statue okay he said not reaching for it illill take it but its yours his brown eyes were wide and his shoulders were tense its not mine deal pleased to have gotten rid of it i took a happy breath jenks too puffed out his air matalina hadnt been happy with it being in their living room it was sort of like bringing a marlin home from vacation or maybe a moose head the pizza had a bubble starting to rise and kisten opened the oven to stick a toothpick through the dough to release the hot air under it the odor of tomato sauce and pepperoni billowed out the scent of security and contentment my tension eased and david picked the focus up i ah i think ill take this home before i finish my appointments he said hefting it it feelsdamn i could do anything with it ivy put her feet on the floor and stood just dont go starting a war she grumbled heading out to the hall ive got a box you can put that in david set it back on the table thanks face creasing in worry he edged it closer in a show of possessionnot greed but of protection a smile came over kisten as he saw it too you ah sure the vampires wont be after it the small man said and kisten pulled out a chair and sat in it backward no one knows you have it and as long as you dont start rallying the weres to you they wont he said draping his arms over the top of his chair the only one that might know about it would be piscary he glanced at the empty hallway by way of ivy he said softly but shes very closed with her thoughts he would have to dig for it kistens look went worried he doesnt have any reason to think its surfaced but word gets around david put his hands into his pockets maybe i should hide it in my cat box you have a cat i asked id put you as a dog person his gaze darted over the kitchen when ivy came in and put a small cardboard box on the table jenks landed on it and started tugging at the tape holding it it belonged to an old girlfriend david said you want it ivy went to flick jenks away to open the box herself then changed her mind no she said as she sat and forced her hands into her lap do you want ours hey jenks shouted as the tape gave way and he flew back from the momentum rex is my cat stop trying to give her away yours david said surprised i thought she was rachels embarrassed i shrugged with one shoulder she doesnt like me i said pretending to check on the pizza jenks landed on my shoulder in a soft show of support i think shes waiting for you to turn back into a wolf rache he teased i went to brush him off then stopped a ribbon of memory pulled through meof how he had treated me when he was bigand i made a soft mmmm instead have you seen her stare at me i turned seeing her doing it now see i said pointing at her in the middle of the threshold her ears pricked and a curious unafraid look on her sweet kitten face david pulled the scarf from the collar of his duster and wrapped the focus up you should make her your familiar he said shed like you then no fairy crap way jenks shouted wings a blur as he went to hold the box open for david rachel isnt going to draw any everafter through rex shell fry her little kitty brain might be an improvement i thought sourly it doesnt work that way she has to choose me and hes right id probably fry her little kitty brain i fried nicks a shudder rippled over david the entire kitchen seemed to go still and i looked worriedly at ivy and kisten you okay i said when they met my blank stare with my own moon just rose david said wiping a hand across his dark stubble its full sorry sometimes it hits hard im cool i gave him a onceover thinking he looked different there was a smoother grace a new tension to himlike he could hear the clock before it ticked i yanked open the drawer for the pizza cutter shuffling around you sure you cant stay for some lunch i asked there was the skitter of cat claws on the linoleum then david gasped oh my god he breathed on the exhale look at it holy crap jenks exclaimed and ivy took an audible breath i turned pizza cutter in hand my eyebrows rose and i blinked whoa the cursed thing had turned completely silver malleable like liquid it looked entirely like a wolf now too lips pulled from her muzzle and silver saliva dripping down to melt into the fur at the base and it was her somehow i knew it a shudder went through me as i thought i might hear something but wasnt sure you know what i said my voice shaky as i looked at it in its box cushioned by davids scarf you can have it i dont want it back really david swallowed rachel were friends and everything but no there is no way in hell im taking that thing into my apartment its not going back into my house jenks said no freakin way listen to it its making my teeth hurt i already get misery once a month from twentythree females and im not putting up with it from some weirdass were statue on the full moon rachel cover it up or something tinks tampons cant you all hear that i picked the box up and the hair on my arms rose stifling a shudder i opened the freezer and shoved it between the coldburned waffles and the banana bread that tasted like asparagus that my mom had brought over the fridge was stainless steel it might help the phone rang and ivy jumped up heading for the living room as jenks hovered over the sink and shed golden sparkles better i said when i closed the freezer and he sneezed nodding as the last glitters fell ivy appeared in the archway with the phone her eyes black and clearly ticked to judge by her wiretight stance what do you want crap for brains nick jenks jerked three feet into the air i was sure my eyes were full of pity but jenks shook his head not wanting to talk to his son that nick had romanced his son from him for a life of crime was far worse than anything nick had ever done to me not knowing what i was feeling i held my hand out ivy hesitated and my eyes narrowed grimacing she slapped the phone into my palm if he comes here ill kill him she muttered i mean it ill drive him up to mackinaw and throw him over for real take a number i said when she sat in her spot before her computer clearing my throat i put the receiver to my ear hellooooo nick i said hitting the k hard youre the worlds biggest jerk for what you did to jax you ever show your scrawny face in cincinnati again and im going to shove a broomstick up your ass and set it on fire you got that rachel he said sounding frantic its not real i glanced at the fridge putting my hand over the receiver he says hes got the fake one i said simpering kisten snorted and suddenly smug i turned back to nick what i said my voice light and flowery didnt your statue go silvery nickie daaaaarling you know damn well it didnt he said voice harsh dont mess with me rachel i need it i earned it i promised nick i soothed but he was still talking nick i said louder listen to me finally there was silence but for the hiss and buzz of the line i looked over the kitchen warm with the scent of pizza and the companionship of my friends the new picture of jenks and me that id stuck to the fridge caught my eye his arm was over my shoulder and we were both squinting from the sun ivy wasnt in it but she had taken it and her presence was as strong as the bridge behind us the picture seemed to say it all so i lived in a church with pixies and a vampire who wanted to bite me but was afraid to so i dated her old boyfriend who was likely going to spend his free time convincing me he was a better choice when he wasnt angling for a threesome and yeah i was alpha of a pack and the only curse i could were with was black but that didnt mean i was going to no one knew i had a were artifact in my freezer that could set off a vampwere power struggle my soul was coated with darkness from saving the world but i had a hundred years to get rid of it and so what if nick might be smarter than me i had friends good ones tag darling i said into the receiver you lose i hit the off button midprotest tossing the phone to ivy i smiled acknowledgements id like to thank gwen hunter for helping me with the med stuff on the bridge and tb who read through my diving sequences if anything doesnt jive it wasnt from these two ladies but me pushing the envelope and of course a very large thank you to my agent richard curtis and to my editor diana gill without whom the hollows would have stayed in my imagination alone
