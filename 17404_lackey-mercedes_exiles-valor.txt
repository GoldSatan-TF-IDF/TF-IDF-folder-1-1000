exiles valor mercedes lackey copyright by mercedes r lackey muted light richly colored poured gold and sapphire into the sparselyfurnished sitting room in herald alberichs private quarters behind the training salle now that the colored window was installed and the protective blanket taken off it made that little room look entirely different alberich hardly recognized it the four journeymen glass workers who had helped their master install the piece were gone now leaving alberich alone with the artist himself both of them gazed on the finished product in silence while behind them a warm fire crackled on the hearth it was a staggeringly beautiful piece of stainedglass work in fact alberich thought it would not be exaggerating to say it was a masterpiece not that he had expected less than a fine piece from the master of the glassworkers guild but this was over and above those expectations the artisan responsible for its creation stepped forward and gave the top righthand corner a final polish with a soft cloth removing some smudge not visible to ordinary eyes he flicked off an equally invisible dust mote as well and stepped back to view the expanse of blues and golds with a critical eye a man gone gray in his profession he was tall but not powerful with wiry knotty muscles rather than bulging ones his expression was unreadable a squarejawed hooknosed fellow whose face might have been stone rather than flesh itll do he grunted finally his long face betraying nothing but a flicker of content a work of power and beauty it is alberich replied unusual warmth of feeling in his voice it is exceeding my expectations which were high already your skill is formidable master cuelin itll do the artisan repeated but with just a touch more satisfaction in his own voice ill not praise myself but itll do this was such understatement that alberich shook his head in so many ways this was a piece of artwork that went far far beyond even the monumental works that only the great and wealthy could afford be they individuals or organizations it was the care to every detail as much as the design that showed that expertise for instance to protect the fragile leaded glass made up of pieces no larger than a coin the panel had been installed against the existing window now the bars holding those old panes in place could have cast distracting lines across the new patternexcept that master cuelin had taken that into account in his design and the shadows had been integrated in such a way that unless you looked for them you did not notice them yet master cuelin seemed no more than mildly pleased that everything had worked out as he had planned alberich knew that tone not only from working with master cuelin on this window but from working with others who shared the same obsessive drive to excellence that marked the mans work no point in heaping him with effusive praise for it would only make him uncomfortable and he would begin to point out flaws in the work not visible to anyone but him very happy you have made me he said instead never shall i weary of this piece and although he had paid master cuelin already when he shook the mans hands in thanks a heavy little purse that had been in his hand slipped quietly into the masters that was the way of doing business in karse when one was pleased with special work some things alberich felt were probably universalan extra consideration for work that exceeded expectation being one of them evidently the custom held true in valdemar because master cuelin did not seem in the least surprised he said nothing only pocketed the purse with a nod of thanks he dusted off his hands on the side of his brown leather tunicall of his clothing tunic breeches even his shirt was leather because leather wasnt likely to catch fire well if youre that satisfied herald alberich ill be off the glassmaster said ive that lazy lot of prentices to beat back at my studio for no doubt theyll have ruined the cobalt plate i laid out for them to cut for the new pothecary guild window aye and muddled the designs i set them to copy and complain ive assigned them too much work alberich shook his head in mock sadness it is ever so he agreed and sighed the younger generation we were never like that eh master cuelin barked a laugh and slapped alberichs back the weaponsmaster allowed a hint of a smile to show and the glassmaster winked well tis heavy work we have before usyou know what the old saw is a boys ears are on his backside he heeds better when hes beaten since there was nearly the identical saying in karse alberich nodded and with another exchange of pleasantries he escorted the glassmaster out indeed some things were universal but since it was not yet time for the next class of heraldic trainees to arrive for their weapons training he returned to his sitting room in the back of the training salle to admire his newly installed possession once more this was more than mere ornament while there was a temple of vkandis sunlord down in haven properthough for obvious reasons it was referred to even by karsite exiles as the temple of the lord of lightalberich seldom was able to get there for the daylight ceremonies certainly he was never able to arrive for the allimportant sunrising rite contrary to what the current karsite priesthood wished their followers to think it was very clear in the writnow that alberich had seen copies of the old original versionsthat any follower of the sunlord could perform the rites with or without a sunpriest it was what was in the heart not the words that mattered and prayerful meditation at any time was appropriate and now alberich had an image here a proper image that would put him in the proper frame of mind there had been a plain glass window here but the presence of such an expanse of clear glass had made alberich on reflection rather uneasy it was fine for the former weaponsmaster herald dethor to have such a thing but dethor didnt have to think about potential karsite assassins peering through itor the far more common but equally annoying habits of the young idle and foolish offspring of valdemaran nobles daring each other to spy on the dreaded weaponsmaster from karse not that theyd see anything except alberich reading pacing or staring at the fire or occasionally entertaining a visitor but it made him irritated to think of them watching him it wasted their time annoyed the companions and made the back of his neck prickle for no good reason if he sensed someone watching him he wanted to know there was danger not adolescent curiosity behind it but he hadnt wanted to block off the window either very useful light came in there by day although the view was nothing spectacular just one of the groves of companions field it had been herald elcarth who had suggested the stainedglass panel when he had mentioned the annoyance of looking up to see lurkers in the bushes one night it had nearly been former lurkers in the bushes and it was a good thing for them that he had kantor out there to warn him it was only some unaffiliates and a bardic trainee because his hand had been on the onehanded crossbow he kept under the table and he had no problem with shooting out a window especially not his own window a bit of broken glass was a small price to pay for your life he hadnt mentioned that to elcarth however though he thought he saw some understanding in the others nod perhaps that was why the herald had suggested the stainedglass panel and at that moment alberich had realized how he could bring a kind of vkandis chapel into his own home make this place truly his home and solve that problem of the huge window in a single stroke elcarth hadnt known where to obtain such a thing but herald jadus had in fact jadus had pointed him to the particular glassworks involved in creating most of the stained and etchedglass windows for the various temples in and around haven whenever a generous patron was moved to donate such a thing until he went to the workshop and saw some of the designs alberich hadnt been entirely certain of the exact shape and image of the design only that it should have some link somehow to the temples that he had felt most comfortable in as soon as he realized what cuelin specialized in heraldic rather than heraldic designs he had realized what his window surely must show the suninglory of the god of karse of course vkandis sunlord in a form that few in valdemar would recognize as such and no one who mattered would likely take offense to particularly as this suninglory would be laid out not on the usual field of reds as in a similar window in karse but on a field of heraldic blue if master cuelin realized just what the pattern was he hadnt said anything alberich would not have wagered on his being ignorant though he had been doing religious glasswork for far too long not to have learned virtually every symbol of every deity worshiped in haven and every possible variation and nuance of each symbol vkandis was worshiped here and by karsite exilesjust not under that name the lord of light was what he was called here all things considered a title and a name less likely to evoke hostility from the good neighbors of those exiles alberich would not have taken it much amiss had master cuelin delegated the work to his apprentices eitherbut he hadnt hed attended to it all himself and the result was glorious well worth the cost of the one indulgence that alberich had permitted himself since hed been made weaponsmaster very nice for us too his companion kantor commented as alberich sat down and allowed himself to drink in the color and composition we get the best view of it at night when the light is coming from inside clever of you to station lanterns with reflectors shining outward at the bottom corners gives us a lovely piece to look at and prevents any shadows falling upon it and telling people what goes on in my sitting room he pointed out after paying no small fortune for such a piece ive no mind to have it shattered by an illconsidered crossbow bolt from outside because i was foolish enough to show a target since there was no graceful reply to that kantor wisely declined to make one the leaded glass was thicker and heavier than the window it had been mounted against and alberich realized after a moment of sitting there that the drafts hed become accustomed to were gone well an unforeseen advantage and a thirdas he bathed in the golden light from the suninglory despite the fact that on the other side of the glass there was a bleak winter landscape under overcast skies he understood why master cuelin had insisted that the sun dominate the panel no matter what the weather outside the light coming in would be warm and welcoming already alberich felt his spirits become a little lighter for which my gratitude to master cuelin knows no bounds kantor observed dryly anything that sweetens your temper makes me grateful indeed alberich countered alas that he cannot do me the return favor of creating such a thing for you since you spend your days out of doors perhaps i should query bardic collegium about the possibility of serenading you on a thriceweekly basis to sweeten your temper then who would chastise the greenlings properly kantor asked airily disciplining the youngsters requires a certain acidity of temper to deliver correction with the appropriate degree of sting alberich shook his head he should learn never to try and exchange barbs with his companion kantor would always win kantor was at least as old as his chosen probably a few years alberichs senior and twice as witty not that there wasnt some truth in what kantor said kantor was to the young companions what alberich was to the heraldic trainees in a way not so much the trainer in fighting technique for a great deal of that was in the hands of the riding instructors but as the disciplinarian of the companion herd normally that would be in the handsor rather authority backed by speech and occasionally hooves and teethof the companion to the queens own herald the groveborn rolan but rolans herald was queens own talamir who had very nearly died in the last battle with the tedrels on the border with karse talamirs original companion taver had died and one never spent much time in talamirs presence without realizing that in many ways it had been no great service to talamir that he had been brought back to life again though kantor had never said as much in so many words alberich got the distinct impression that most of rolans time was taken up in making sure that talamir remainedwellsane so a good portion of rolans duties to the herd had been delegated to those best suited to the task not all of those duties had gone to kantor either some were the provenance of some very wise old companion mares thus ironically echoing the hierarchy in a real horse herd where the leaders were the oldest mares not the stallion as alberich very well knew hmm and human herds though ye know it not your point being alberich replied though youd best not let queen selenay discover you think of her as an old mare wise or not he sensed kantors snort of derision selenay should be perfectly happy to be compared to a companion mare alberich let that one go there was no use trying to explain to kantor that no nubile young woman was going to appreciate being compared to a mare ever under any circumstances particularly not when her councilorssome of them anywaywere very diligently trying to make her into one of the broodstock variety which was one reason why he had welcomed master cuelins arrival this afternoon to install the window as the perfect excuse to avoid the afternoon council meeting that particular item was on the table for discussion and it was a subject that alberich was particularly anxious not to get embroiled in for one thing no matter how publicly hed been lauded and laden with honors after the tedrel wars no matter how trusted he was by mostby no means allvaldemarans of note he was still the outsider he was and always would be so it could not be otherwise and for another well well it was a subject where nothing he said or did was safe someone would take exception whether he urged that selenay remain single or weighed in on the side of those who wanted her to wed and at this point he didnt need to add any enemies to a list that was already long enough the atmosphere of the council chamber this afternoon was unwontedly subdued usually there had been at least three arguments by this time and the kinds of icy polite catcalling that made people who were not used to council debates blanch and wonder if a duel was about to break out today however was different the atmosphere hadnt been so edgily cordial since the first tentative sessions after selenays coronation around the horseshoeshaped heavy wooden table not a voice had been raised the representatives of the bardic heraldic and healer circles in their red white and green uniforms respectively had been extremely quiet as had the lord marshals herald and the seneschals herald and of course her own the queens own herald talamir as for the restwell they had been nervous they didnt really know her although she had been in their midst all of her life they were her fathers council really not hers they were his friends advisers and peers and none of them had expected to serve her at all much less so quickly so they often argued and battled among themselves as if she wasnt even there or was no more than a token place holder except on the rare occasions when what they wished to do was going to have to involve her then they generally acted as they did today becoming very quiet and rather nervous these elder statesmen and women were apparently unaware that they gave themselves away acting as they did queen selenay knew why they were nervous of course they didnt know she knew which might have been funny under other circumstances in the throne that had been her fathers with the chair at her right hand empty selenay watched her councilors behaving as if they were good little schoolchildren debating beneath the strict disciplinarian eye of their teacher this was of course because they were shortly going to unite in a totally uncharacteristic burst of singlemindedness and do their level best to force their queen to do something she had no intention of doing whatsoever marry worse than that to marry someone they not she had chosen the potential candidates were as sad a collection as nightmare could have conjured the youngest was ten the oldest ninety among them were a number of young men but even these were impossible some she had heartily detested from the moment shed met them others she didnt even know and from their reputations had no desire to know a very few might be reasonable fellows some were pleasant enough company on a casual basis but that was no reason to marry any of them some were even heralds or at least traineesbut the heralds all had lives of their own that she was not a part of and as for traineeswell they seemed like mere infants to her now her councilors however did not see it that way it hadnt been like this when her father had sat in this throne but sendar had ruled as well as reigned she reigned but only the backing of the heralds made it possible for her to command much of anything she knew that she had expected it from the moment she took the crown she was much too young to be a queen much too young to command the respect of men and women old enough to be her parents not even the white uniform proclaiming her a full herald managed to gain her that respect well there were ways around that but she was getting weary of the artful dodges of setting her words in the mouths of others and she had not even reigned a year and these marriage plans were more than a mere inconvenience they were an attack on her autonomy her good councilors would not be happy with a mere prince consort they wanted a king she tapped her index finger idly on the stack of papers just under her right hand and smiled a grim little smile her councilorsthe nonheraldic ones anywaywere not aware that she had come prepared for this afternoons meeting she knew what every man and woman around the table was about to put forward for not all of them had been closemouthed about it and talamir had gotten wind of it and let her know what was planned that had given her ample time to prepare for what they were about to unleash on her they had no idea that she had come forewarned and forearmed for that matter other than talamir and elcarth she wasnt sure the other heralds at the council table were aware that shed been engaged in laying the groundwork to defend her freedom it was nothing less that she had done for her councilors were determined that she should not reign aloneand each and every one of them had a particular candidate to place in the running sometimes more than one all of them of course with the best interests of the kingdom foremost in their minds or so at least they would tell themselves of course every candidate would have blood ties or ties of obligation to the councilor who put him forward but never mind that they would put such things out of their minds telling themselves that they were doing this for valdemar and not for any selfish reasons there was no heir selenay had been an only child and the crown now rested on her fragile head alone she must marry and produce children quickly of course if the chosen spouse happened to be helpful to friends and families well every one of them had given over whatever disputes they had to settle on that list of potential consorts arguing and trading without any consideration for what she wanted until they had mutually agreed on enough men that if they couldnt bully her into taking one they could wear her down until she agreed out of exhaustion when talamir told her what the plans were selenay had gone straight to heraldchroniclersecond myste who was surely the only person in haven who had the esoteric knowledge to help her out of the trap and although she had not really expected a great deal of sympathy from myste the herald had amazed her by reacting with indignation to the plans by keronos myste had exclaimed her eyes behind the thick lenses of her spectacles going narrow with speculation thats obscene you havent been queen a year girl shouldnt they at least wait until youve settled and gotten comfortable with your place apparently not selenay had replied seething with anger and apparently none of them want to see a foreigner brought in as consort eitheror at least they dont seem to have taken much thought about that particular possibility insane id call it not that i particularly want a foreign consort but father used to have serious talks with me about the possibility of needing to cement a foreign alliance with a marriage idiots myste had muttered under her breath pushing her lenses up on her nose the hand of a queens too damned valuable to waste what if as your father said we need an alliance what if we just need to keep five or six princes dangling on promises selenay had countered and besides she didnt add the besides which was that she wanted to be able to love her husband not merely tolerate being in the same room with him myste probably guessed it for shed given selenay a shrewd look but she hadnt said anything except well if they havent got the sense to see past their own interests its up to some of the rest of us to see to it that they cant meddle and myste had outdone herself on the queens behalf spending every spare moment locked away with dusty law and record books going back generations the result was the pile of neatlywritten papers under selenays hand aside from the two exceptions of talamir and elcarth there wasnt a single person around the council table that had the slightest inkling that they were about to see what selenay could do when she was not in a mood of sweet cooperation in point of fact no matter who was brought up the various candidates for potential spouse were going to be mown down like so many stands of ripened grain myste had not even told alberich she had sworn herself to secrecy before selenay had even asked there was no tighterlipped creature in valdemar than myste when she opted to take that particular path its too bad alberich isnt here selenay thought still tapping he might enjoy watching me dispose of this idiocy she missed his craggy scarred face at the table today although he did not have an official position on the council as talamirs righthand man and in no small part hers as well he could and did sit in on it whenever he chose when he did he usually took elcarths seat as the representative of the heraldic circle the weaponsmaster knew of the plans of course though not how she intended to counter them and she thought that he would take great pleasure in how she was going to discomfit them all or maybe not in selenays limited experience a confirmed bachelor like alberich had a tendency to panic when confronted by the question of potential matrimony regardless of whether it was his or someone elses besides hes probably concerned that if i flatten every other possible consort someone will suggest him as an alternative the mere thought made her stifle a smile while the heralds would welcome the idea and possibly even the bard and healer would as well the rest of her councilors would have apoplexy theyd suggest she take an illiterate fisherman from lake evendim before they suggested alberich not that shed mind an illiterate fisherman from lake evendim half so much as she disliked some of the socalled candidates for her hand her councilors were going to suggest the councilors had been well aware from the moment they started their plotting that this was a subject their queen was not going to entertain gladly which was why they were intending to surprise her with it in hopes of taking her off guard as they disposed of some final trivial business they kept glancing at her out of the corners of their eyes and there was a certain nervous tone to their voices that would have been amusing if she had not been so very angry with them her father had not been dead a year and already they were at her to marry as if she could not rule by herself or at the very least rule with the true counsel of those who were loyal to her and not merely devoted to their own interests and rule well and wisely you can rule with more wisdom than some of their choices her companion caryo said into her mind not that some of their choices would be allowed to rule at all they wouldnt be chosen by a companion if every living male in valdemar were to drop dead this moment a stinging indictment indeed coming from caryo and there was the real rub what some of her councilors seemed to keep forgetting was that any husband she took would be nothing more than prince consort unless he was also a herald only then could he be a coruler of course they probably assumed that a young woman would be easily led by her husband to give him whatever he wanted which would certainly make him the power behind the throne if not an actual monarch some of them probably assumed that she could make a companion choose him if she wanted it badly enough the more fools they said caryo well they have a poor opinion of how strong a womanswill can be selenay reflected as she gathered her nerve that it was a very good thing that caryo was of a mind with her it would be great deal easier to resist both bullying and blandishment with caryo behind her and dont forget you have myste too caryo reminded her yes indeed myste her secret weapon who not only had supplied her with this vast and intricate report but was currently mewed up in the library with every book of valdemaran genealogy in haven at her fingertips and a page to bring her whatever she needed for as long as this meeting lasted no her councilors surely could never have reckoned on myste the last of the minor business was disposed of the councilors put up their papers some of them poured themselves wine and there was a great deal of coughing and shuffling of feet then as she expected really it was lord gartheser more portly now than he had been before the tedrel wars and more florid of face who cleared his throat awkwardly and put the subject on the table about the matter of your majestys marriage he said and stopped selenay smiled sweetly a smile that went no farther than her lips as she looked down each side of the horseshoeshaped table before she allowed her eyes to rest on gartheser he makes a poor conspirator she thought it was from him that talamir had learned what was toward though gartheser himself was probably completely unaware that he had betrayed anything but he gave himself away according to talamir in a hundred ways by little nervous tics by being unable to meet a persons eyes by dropping far too many hints when he was satisfied with himself at that point both talamir and alberich had gone to work and no secret was secure when those two were ferreting it out though it occurred to her that talamir had probably not done nearly as much work as alberich talamirs sympathy was probably at least in part with the council well give credit where it was due he had told her in the first place my marriage she asked in feigned innocence i wasnt aware i had been betrothed much less that there was a marriage in view certainly king sendar never said anything of the sort to me ah well your majesty thats the whole point gartheser managed you havent one you see betrothed that is she took her time and looked carefully around the horseshoeshaped table again making sure to look each one of her councilors steadily in the eyes the silence was deafening no one moved indeed and youthat is we thoughtthat is gartheser couldnt look her in the eyes anymore he dropped his gaze and stared at his hands and stumbled to a halt we have some candidates in mind selenay lord orthallen took up the thread smoothly orthallen looked the part of the senior statesman he had retained a fine figure and the silver streaking in his dark blond hair in no way detracted from his handsome appearance women younger than selenay threw themselves at him on a regular basis though she had never heard so much as a whisper to indicate that he was unfaithful to his wife you really must marry as soon as may be of course a young woman cannot rule alone indeed she said levelly hiding her rage with immense care she wanted to scream at them then burst into tears and nothing could be more fatal at this moment but the others took that lack of objection on her part as the signal that she was going to be properly malleable and took heart from it only elcarth and talamir understood that selenay had her own plans elcarth winced a little at her tone talamirs lips quirked just a trifle the first and indeed the most eligible candidate is my nephew rannulf gartheser said brightly who is not eligible at all im afraid she interrupted smoothly with feigned regret hes related to me within the second degree on his mothers side through the lycaelis bloodline you know well that no king or queen of valdemar can wed a subject who is within the third degree of bloodrelationship that is the law my lord and nothing you nor i can do will change that she raised her eyebrows at them the reason is a very good one of course i shall be indelicate here for there is no delicate way to say this as my father told me often the monarchs of valdemar cannot afford the kinds ofdifficultiesthat can arise when a bloodline becomes too inbred and with you and yours marrying cousins and crosscousins with the gay abandon of people blind to consequences thats the reason half of your socalled candidates are doughfaced mouthbreathers who couldnt count to ten without taking their shoes off she thought viciously harsh with justification but harsh caryo observed sardonically gartheser blinked his mouth still open and stared at her finally he shut it ah he said at last ohare you quite sure of that she opened mystes report to the relevant page rannulfs mother is lady elena of penderkeep lady elenas mother was my fathers cousin through his mother that is within the second degree oh gartheser said weakly then there is my nephew kris said orthallen quickly related to me within the third degree on both sides of his family as his mother was a cousinbymarriage of my father and his father was a cousinbyblood to my father she said briskly already prepared for that one besides being so young that there is no question of consummation for at least eight years she smiled dulcetly at orthallen which does rather negate the entire reason for marrying with such remarkable speed in the first place before my year of mourning is over doesnt it to her great pleasure orthallen was left so stunned by her riposte that his handsome face wore an uncharacteristic blank look not that she wanted to humiliate himshe was really awfully fond of him after allbut it gave her no end of satisfaction to make him understand in no uncertain terms that just because she was fond of him she was not going to allow him to manipulate her into something she did not want to do and blessings upon myste she suspected that not even orthallen knew about the nearness of her blood relation to his nephew he proved it in the next moment by saying cautiously i assume you have the particulars of these degrees she went to the second page of mystes notes and gave him the genealogical details chapter and verse in a nononsense matteroffact tone of voice ah he said and wisely said nothing more so it went every single candidate that any of them brought up she cut off at the metaphorical knees including the ones that she had not given myste to research that was why myste was shut up in the library she would leaf through her thick sheaf of papers to give myste the chance to trace pedigrees then pretend to read what myste sent to her at last they ran out of namesor at least of names that they could all agree on now the daggers were out and the looks being traded across the tabletop were wary any new candidates would be men and boys that had already been rejected because one or another of the councilors objected to them for reasons of his or her own she could sit back and let them play against each other which was the better position to be in at least that was true among the highborn councilors the guildmasters were a different story entirely none of themand no candidate outside of the nobilitywould be related to her which eliminated that argument however she thought she could count on the highborn councilors to fight tooth and nail against any commonborn man being put up as a potential prince consort there was an advantage to snobbery mind if she did happen to fall in love with a commoner she wasnt going to let snobbery stop her that would open up a whole new set of problems which she wasnt going to think about right now the current set was more than enough to deal with its too bad alberich isnt here now she thought letting her anger begin to die this is the part hed really enjoywatching them cut the legs out from under each other ah well she hoped the installation of his window had gone well she was looking forward to seeing it it would be the only part of her day she was able to look forward to why would anyone want to be a queen oo wouldnt want tbe a queen demanded the rather drunken tart sitting at the table next to alberichs larking about doin whatever ye please gettin waited on and an foot not from haven thought alberich to himself though you have the accent it isnt quite good enough my girl and you arent nearly as drunk as you seem whats your game and who put you up to it i wonder now perhaps at any other time perhaps in another year or so she might have gotten away with such an illconsidered remark but not now not when barely six months had passed and selenay had been making herself very popular with little gestures like the queens bread people down here had a lot of trouble keeping their children fed and one guaranteed free meal a day at the trifling cost of lessons in rudimentary literacy and numeracy was a small price to pay a youngling down here couldnt earn the price of that breakfast himself in the course of a morning it was good economics to send your younglings to a temple until noon then put em to work ere now a man just near enough to have overheard the speech stood up glaring at her our selenay aint like that ye owd drab an if you was a man ida thrashed ye fer that the woman shrank back and well she should have he was big and broad and looked as if he knew very well how to handle that cudgel at his belt no offense meant im very sure she said hastily i didn mean queen selenay i just meant a queen in a genral sort of way the man glared at her he was as drunk as the whore pretended to be and he was at the very least going to say his peace our selenay aint no layabout he insisted why i seen er i even talked to er couplea nights afore the last battle come right to our fires she did avin a word with our officers seein we ad good treatment oh yeah an she talked t you did she ye old liar jeered someone else illadvisedly the drunk rounded on the skeptic with a roar and grabbed the mans shirt in one hamlike fist only the intervention of the peacekeeper that the proprietor of the broken arms had seen fit to hire prevented mayhem from breaking out but there was the start of a fight and under cover of it the woman slipped out alberich followed she wasnt at all difficult to follow the silly wench she paid absolutely no attention to what was behind her the man she accosted just outside the alleyway next to the tavern was a little more careful but not enough to spot alberich he was a darker shadow in the alleypeople always thought that wearing black would make them blend in with shadows but it didnt it made them into manshaped black blotches in an almost black place alberich was wearing several shades of very very dark brown and gray each leg was a slightly different color so was each arm and his tunic was blotched there was nothing about him that was manshaped when he stood in shadow im not doin that no more the woman shrilled at her contact just as alberich eased within listening range you go do your own dirty work from now on there was a murmur too low for alberich to make out the words i didn get but a word out she said sullenly an up jumps this drunk bear and nearly thrashes me more murmuring and the clink of coins the woman departed muttering alberich followed the man there had been a lot of money exchanged there for such simple servicesa lot for this part of town at any rate alberich hoped that his new quarry would try another quarter one where such a payment would be the norm rather than the exception and lo as if his wish had flown straight to the ear of vkandis that was precisely what his quarry did it wasnt a wealthy part of town working class was more like it but working class that got work regularly of the sort that came with weekly pay packets and a little something extra on the holidays a place in short where there were city guards and constables on patrol regularly a place where alberich could manage to do something to get them both arrested which as soon as a constable hove into view alberich did he nipped back around the corner so as to be able to intercept his quarry coming apparently from the opposite direction it wasnt hard he knew this part of haven better than the back of his hand there were few yards with high fences and even fewer with dangerous dogs tied up in them once he came back around he saw that the constable was strolling along at a leisurely pace that would take him past his quarry before alberich reached the man good he didnt want the constable to actually see what was going on between him and the stranger only hear it and make some inferences that as it happened would be entirely unwarranted youre enjoying this kantor accused hush im busy the fact was he was enjoying this it was the first hint of trouble real trouble his sort of trouble that hed had in moons as he approached the man he stared at himeasy enough to do since there were streetlamps here then he contorted his face into an expression of rage and roared you you bastard thought you could ruin my sister and run away did you and then he flung himself at the startled man as he had expected the man was not startled for long and he was armed so what the surprised constable saw when he turned was a man with a knife attacking an unarmed man since he couldnt know which of the two of them the accusation had come from he assumedas any good constable wouldthat the man with the knife was the attacker not the defender that alberich was in no danger from a mere knife was something he couldnt know so to his immense credit he waded in himself wielding his truncheon and blowing a whistle for dear life to summon help he was aiming most of his blows for the head of the knife wielder and alberich helpfully positioned the target so that by the time the help arrived his quarry was out cold and he was able to protest feebly that he didnt know what the madman was talking about hed just jumped for him with a knife screaming about a sister we have to stop meeting like this herald said captain lekar of the city guard with a feeble attempt at humor people are going to start talking i fervently hope not alberich replied rubbing his wrists where the conscientious constables had tied thembeing too wise ever to take one potential miscreants word over anothers he warmed his hands on his cup of tea but did not drink from it the herbal teas consumed by the night shift of the city guard were not drinkable even by the standards of a former karsite sunsguard if talk they do my personae will in danger be yes well i wish youd find some other way of catching your lads without getting the both of you thrown in jail the captain replied wearily since this was only the third time that alberich had used that particular desperation ploy he held his peace keep him safe was all he said speak with him under truth spell i wish to when he awakens the captain did not ask why the captain did not want to know why the captain was an old friend of herald dethor alberichs mentor in this business and he knew very well that he did not want to know why and alberich knew that he knew and both were content with the situation now if this had been karsehe reflected soberly as he left the city jail by an inconspicuous exit making certain that there was no one to see him leave if this was karse and you were an agent of the sunpriests that man would be in extreme pain for a very long time and at the end of it he would be dead kantor said he may still be dead when this is over alberich replied grimly making his way toward the stable of the companions bell but if he is at least it wont be by my hands if hes lucky well find out hes just a troublemaker kantor didnt sound as if he really believed that would be the case yes and if that happened to be true well there was no law against speaking outor having someone else speak outagainst the monarch laws like that only made for more trouble some people always had to have a grievance and making grumbling illegal was a guaranteed way of ensuring that grumbling turned into resentment and resentment into anger if that was the case hed be let go with the vague memory of having proved he didnt know anything about anyones sister to the satisfaction of the city guard if it was not the case well there was one herald in the circle who had no trouble with dirtying his hands with difficult jobs alberich would find out who had sent this fellow down into the dark parts of haven to foment discontent and he would follow that trail back as far as it would go and the man would still be let gobut this time with the very clear memory of having been questioned under truth spell by a herald chances were he would cut and run and hope his employers never found him that would be convenient because it would take the problem off of his hands and if he didnt runhis employers would probably take the problem off alberichs hands a little faster he collected kantor and the two of them made their way up to the collegiumalberich feeling the effects of the truncheon blows that had connected with him and kantor brooding alberich didnt press him as to the subject of his brooding whatever it was kantor would talk about it when the companion was good and ready and not one moment before and in fact as alberich hung up his saddle kantor finally spoke i hope this doesnt mean its all starting again alberich sighed my good friendi hope this doesnt mean it never finished why is it always me myste asked as alberich made his second trip of the night down into haven this time with her in tow the scholarly herald pushed her lenses up on her nose and shivered beneath her cloak because you have the strongest truthsensing ability in the collegium alberich said and because the two of us can speak in karsite if our naughty boy doesnt understand karsite he wont know what were talking about and it will make him nervous and if he does youll know it and well have him where we want him bloody hell she said with resignation and pulled the cloak tighter around herself she hated cold she hated winter and she hated being dragged out of her study and he knew all of that he also knew that unless someone dragged her out of her study periodically she would hibernate there for as long as the cold lasted which was so far as he was concerned just as valid a reason for making her his assistant in this case the city jail was not bad as such places went it was clean insofar as you could keep any place clean considering the standards of hygiene of the inhabitants it smelled of unwashed bodies with a ghost of urine and vomit for no matter how many times the cells were cleaned someone was always fouling them again it did not smell of blood if anyone was so badly injured as all that they went under guard to a separate set of cells that had a healer in attendance and it went without saying that no one hereat least among the jailersspilled the blood of the prisoners of course the conditions were spartan and crowded and no prison was a good place but compared with those jails that alberich had seen in karse not to mention the ones that were rumored to exist myste grimaced as they rode in at the stable and grimaced again as they walked in through the front door alberich was wearing his whitesno one looked at a heralds face they only saw his whites the prisoner would see the whites and not even think that the man inside the white uniform might be the madman that had attacked him they were taken to a little room windowless lit by a single lantern that held a single chair the chair was for the prisoner whose legs would be tethered to it myste and alberich would be free so that they could evade any attacks he might try the prisoner was brought in and his legs shackled to the legs of the chair he was as pale as a snowdrift when he saw who was there to speak with him slowly and carefully alberich outlined exactly what he had observed while the man listened jaw clenched eyes staring straight ahead so alberich finished what have you to say for yourself he half expected the man to flatly deny everything but after a long tense silence he spoke i cannot tell you what you want to know a candlemark later alberich and myste left the jail there was a frown of frustration on herald mystes round face alberich didnt blame her the man certainly had been paying people to try to foment discontent against the queenquite a few of them in fact but with by his own admission limited success and he had been doing so on the orders and with the money of someone else the only problem was he didnt know this someone else he had never even seen the mans face myste had not even needed to cast the truth spell to force the truth out of the man her own innate truthsensing gift had told her he was telling them everything he knew he himself had a grudge against the crown in general and selenay in particular for when she had served her internship in the city courts of law with herald mirilin she had made a ruling against him so there was his personal motive but who had sought out this man with a grievance against selenay who had supplied him with the money and the idea to foster rebellion and why only one thing was absolutely certain the trail came to a dead end now it was unlikely that the man would ever be contacted again for someone astute enough to find him in the first place would certainly be sharp enough to discover he had been arrested and know not to use him again now what will you do myste asked as they neared the collegium keep looking he said and shrugged there seemed nothing more he could say or do the closing in of winter always brought one definite disadvantage to the weaponry classes much of the time practices and lessons had to be held in the salle instead of out of doors this limited the kinds of lessons that could be given and the way that practices could be held every season brought its difficulties for a weaponsmaster in spring and summer there were torrential cold rains to deal with it was difficult to muster enthusiasm for heavy exercise in high summer and in the winter of course there was the cold and the snow well if the job had been easy anyone could have done it alberich still held some outdoor archery classes in the winter but when as today snow was falling thickly with a wicked wind to blow it around there wasnt much point in keeping the youngsters at the targets yes they would find themselves having to fight for their lives under adverse conditions but adverse conditions affected the enemy too and as for needing to hunt well no herald was going to starve because he or she could not hunt in a blizzard waystations were stocked with sufficient supplies and every herald on circuit carried emergency rations during their last year each trainee would get an intense course in survival hunting and disadvantaged combat and there was no point in making the youngsters utterly and completely miserable for the sake of showing them what it was like to be utterly and completely miserable not even the karsite officers academy did that to its students and having seen what life was like at the collegia alberich knew that the lessoning hed gotten at the academy was harsh and not at all conducive to training youngsters like these besides with the tedrels gone and karse itself essentially neutralized for a while the only enemies that heralds were likely to encounter in the field were bandits and brigands now as alberich well knew from long experience bandits and brigands are humans they are essentially lazy or they wouldnt be trying to steal rather than earn an honest living and they are just as attached to their own creature comforts as any other humans given a choice in the matter they wouldnt attack under adverse conditions either by nightcertainly in ambush definitely in a blizzard a flood a raging storm not likely in fact in all of the time that alberich himself had led his men of the sunsguard against the bandits on the karsite border never once had he encountered a band moving against a target when the weather was foul that didnt mean it was impossible just unlikely that made the circumstance something to guard against but not something that required extensive training so when the snows began to fall in earnest just after the noon meal alberich herded the next class to arrive into the salle itself which occasioned the inevitable delay in the cleaning of boots at the door and the taking off of cloaks and gloves and hanging them up to dry along the oven wall before anything could get started and then because this was a mixed class of trainees from all three collegia and some blues as well there was more delay as alberich sorted them out into the limited space inside the salle although there was no fire actually in the roomfar far too dangerous to have a fireplace in an area where someone could fall or be thrown into itthe salle was kept reasonably warm by a huge brick oven in one corner a relatively small fire deep inside it was set alight in the first really cold days of autumn and never allowed to go out night or day that fire heated the great mass of bricks that made up the oven and chimney and the wall and that mass in turn radiated heat into the room it also wasted heat along the outside of the same wall as well but unfortunately that couldnt be helped and anyway that outside wall was a nice place for the companions to come and warm themselves on a cold and sunless day the salle wasnt cozybut no one was going to freeze without his cloak you couldand alberich occasionally hadactually bake meals in that oven if said meals were the sorts of things that required slow baking you couldand alberich did quite often during the winterleave a pot of soup or stew in there as well to stay warm during the day it was off limits to the trainees however not by virtue of any orders but by common sense you couldnt open the castiron door without burning your hand unless you used a heavy leather blacksmiths gauntlet and alberich prudently never left any of those lying around outside you had to go into his quarters to get one or like the servant who tended the fire now and again you brought one with you of course on a day like today every youngster in the class was doing his or her best to get close to the oven and the warmest part of the room which meant that unless the weaponsmaster took a hand in itand remembered who had gotten that choice part of the room lastthere were going to be difficulties right from the start of the lessons especially today when devilment seemed to have infected all of them there was pushing and shoving teasing and a few insults and counterinsults and the general restlessness that showed he was going to have to be an autocratic brute today he gave a purely internal sigh what was it about adolescents that made them run wild at utterly unpredictable intervals maybe it was that all of the students in this class were boys girls were a steadying influence at least in these classes the boys in this age group didnt seem quite so willing to run about like idiots when there were girls around well runthat was a good idea he ought to have them run first it would warm their muscles up and might exhaust a little of that tooplentiful energy it would give him a chance to make a mental partnerlist and decide who to assign where run he ordered barking out the single word full speed around the salle ten times grumbling and in a straggling line they ran while he tried to remember who of this lot had gotten the prime spot during the last indoor lesson and who hadnt gotten it in a decent while by the time they finished their warmup run he thought he had it sorted and before they could get up to any immediate devilment he separated the most likely troublemakers and paired them up with the more tractable for this practice session short swords no shields he ordered single line for equipment by pairs no pushing those who had headed for the storage room eager to be at their practice got the best choice of equipment while the stragglers got what they deserved not that any of it was badalberich saw to thatbut those who got first choice got the padded armor and helms that fit them best and those who brought up the rear paid for being laggards by getting equipment that alberich would make them add extra padding to so there would be no slippage with his pairs of youngsters distributed across the salle and trading blows alberich began his slow walk up and down the lines giving the call every blow had a corresponding number starting from one for a straight thrust to the center of the enemys body and the two students in a pair were designated odd and even alberich called out sequences of blows beginning with odd or even for the students to follow rather like a dancing instructor calling out a sequence of dance steps beginning students of course were taught one blow at a time and specific parries for each at the level these students had reached the active student was given a pattern to follow and the defensive student could use any sequence of parries he or she chose alberich began slowly but as muscles warmed up further and reactions quickened he slowly sped up the pace of the call and as the students concentrated on what they were doing the clatter of wooden sword on sword which had started out rather ragged became a single beat just a fraction off the rhythm of the call meanwhile alberich circled the floor like a hunting cat watching the students alert for any weaknesses any bad habits he wasnt going to interrupt the call just yet to correct themthis was part of the business of making blowcounter sequences automatic and instinctivebut he watched for them and noted them for later now that they were up to speed he added the next variation to the call they had been fighting toetotoe now he ordered them to move odd fivesevenadvancefourtworetreatfivesevenstep rightoneeight even fourthreestep left now it really did look like a dance and with movement added some parries were not always working some blows were getting through still he was not going to make corrections just yet this was the point in the practice where experience was the teacher and there was nothing quite like the experience of a good bruise to drive the lesson home again he sped up the call forcing them to move a little faster than they were used to but now they were beginning to tire the response was getting ragged again and some of the students began dropping some of the sequence as weary muscles failed to keep up with the cadence time to stop and go on to individual lessons rest he barked and at that welcome command the points of a dozen wooden practice blades dropped to the wooden floor with a loud thwack kiorten and ledale center the rest circle that order called the first of his pairs into the middle of the floor with the rest around them to observe it was not as unfair as it might have seemed to order a pair straight into the next part of the lesson when the rest were getting a breather kiorten and ledale were the strongest and had the most endurance a blue and a heraldic trainee and as alike as brothers they were still relatively fresh after the call that endurance needed to be tested they needed to learn what it was like to fight real combat while they were tired now alberich took up a wooden long sword to separate them when he saw something that needed either correction or scoring the two combatants squared off standing warily balancing on the balls of their feet theyd fought often of course though alberich made a point of rotating partners in practice he tended to put these two against each other more often than not just to keep things even they enjoyed the practices too and he had more than a suspicion that they practiced against each other recreationally he held his sword out between the two they tensed waiting one he counted twothreeheyla he pulled back the sword and jumped back in the same instant and they both went on the offensive which was what he expected from them they were aggressive fighters and neither one had learned yet that immediate offense wasnt necessarily the wisest course to take he didnt separate them even though they immediately tangled up in the middle of the wooden floor with kiorten seizing his opponents sword in his free hand and ledale grabbing the front of kiortens padded jerkin with his neither could do anything against the other when they were bound up like that and a moment later they broke apart by themselves circled for a moment then began an exchange of blows kiorten got a hit and alberich stopped the combat for a moment na let me look he made a quick judgment of position and strength ledale you are losing the free hand struck it truly kiorten has tuck it behind you heyla let ledale judge for himself that he had left that hand out there as an easy target with the wooden blade the blow probably only stung a bit but had it been a real short sword even with an armored gauntlet the hand would have been seriously injured but ledale wasnt taking this lying down he launched himself at his opponent with a flurry of blows that drove kiorten back and scored a hit himself that made alberich stop the combat again naa flesh wound but you bleed if this goes on you weaken heyla it didnt go on for very much longer ledale was at a disadvantage with that hand tucked behind him it made him turn a little too far to the right leaving his body more open to attack kiorten saw that and saw also that ledale was going to go aggressive again so this time he wisely let it happen and by the way he avoided the blows led ledale in the direction he wanted until he got a good opening for a body shot he had to commit everything to that but he made the full commitment and the sword thwacked home against ledales torso with an impact that made him grunt in pain enough alberich called although he hadnt really needed to ledale backed up immediately saluted his opponent and pulled off his helm in surrender curse you he said amiably though his face was a little white im going to have a bruise the size of my head for a week even assuming you havent cracked my ribs see the healers alberich directed brusquely as kiorten pulled off his helm and extended his hand for his defeated opponent to shake after lessons he knew full well that no ribs were cracked if they had been the lad would not have been able to breathe and what was more the trainees companion would immediately have told kantor who would have told alberich ledale observe kiorten you drop your point too often go to practice lunges at the mirror aldo and triana center two more students came out of the circle to face off against each other in the center while ledale took a vacant spot in the circle and his erstwhile partner obediently moved to the side of the room to face one of the fulllength mirrors set into the back wall of the salle and began lunging with his sword fully extended watching his reflection the way he would watch an opponent those mirrors had utterly shocked alberich the first time he had seen them mirrors were expensive appallingly expensive and that much mirrored glass at that size represented a sum of money that had made his head swim but when hed gotten over the shock he had to admit that putting those mirrors there was a brilliant idea for nothing enabled a student learning anything involving body movement to correct himself like being able to see for himself as well as feel exactly what he was doing right or wrong right now however he kept his attention on the two students before him a pair of the children of the nobly born trainees that is not blues though a pair of blues would have worked just as hard as these two things had certainly changed thereperhaps not in the attitude of those highborn toward him but at least in the fact that they no longer expressed their contempt for him aloud and no longer permitted their children to act on that contempt the blues for the most part now worked just as hard in his classes as any heraldic trainee and there were no more sneers or other expressions of disrespect in his presence as for what happened outside his presence he cared not at all if they respected him well and good if they feared him perhaps that was just as good if neither as long as they behaved themselves in his class it mattered not what they thought nor their parents let them revile him behind his back if it pleased them so long as they maintained respect to his face discipline in the salle was what he demanded so long as he got that they might actually learn a thing or two from him these two grays both were going at it with the same concentration and willif not skillas the previous pair and with a touch less aggression not so bad a thing since he preferred to see caution over bravado when one finally defeated the other he sent them to observe rather than to the mirrors the third pair healer and heraldic trainees also bouted and retired one went to the mirrors the other to point practice on a ball suspended from the ceiling the fourth pair however well both of them were highspirited most times and today truly full of bedevilment one was a heraldic trainee the other a bardic trainee and between them the two were responsible for half the pranks that were pulled at the two collegia both were slender and agile both possessed of so much energy that their teachers sometimes despaired over trying to get them to hold still long enough to learn something and envied their inexhaustible verve at one and the same time so alberich knew he was going to have to be sharp to keep these two within bounds today if he could adain the young bard and mical were harder to keep control of than a bushel of ferrets today he saw that within moments of their bout the two went at each other with the same concentration and will as the first two and a great deal more energy and enthusiasm as a consequence they didnt stay inside the circle of observers and those who had been quietly practicing found themselves scrambling out of the way as their combat ran from one end of the salle to the other alberich had heard some rumors that these two were in the habit of experimenting with new moveswell here was the proof that the rumors were true it looked less like a practice bout and more like an acrobatic exhibition very few of their blows actually connected with anything they werent actually parrying each other they were tumbling and spinning and jumping about so much that they never even got near each other with their wooden blades stop alberich roared just as adain by more luck than anything else bound micals blade in a complicated corkscrewing parry and with a wild flip of his arm disarmed his opponent and sent the wooden sword flying straight at one of the precious panels of mirror alberich opened his mouth to shout and knew it was already too late it was one of those moments when time slows to a crawl and the coming disaster is observed in painful detail without anyone being able to actually do anything about it adams grin of triumph slowly turned to one of horror mical clawed the air in futility after his lost sword as it headed straight for the mirror its own reflection seeming to fly to meet it in midair as the heavy weighted stick flipped over and over in midair alberich just braced himself for the inevitable and with a terrible crash it came the weighted end hit with the sound of a hundred hand mirrors hitting a pavement the mirror spiderwebbedand shattered a profound and dreadful silence fell over the salle broken only by a belated series of musical chinks as a few of the shards that were left detached themselves and landed on the wreck of the rest of the mirror chink chinkerchink chink uhoh said adain in a very small voice chink alberich stood behind the two miscreants with his arms crossed over his chest as they faced the desk of the acting dean of heralds collegium elcarth was not alone the dean of bardic collegium bard arissa had joined him for this particular conference while elcarth slight and birdlike with an inquisitive face and mild manner was not normally the sort of person who might inspire trepidation in a student the look he wore today would have frozen the marrow of anyones bones the two boys huddled unhappily in their chairs it was the first time within his knowledge that alberich had seen these two subdued their shoulders under gray and rustcolored tunics respectively were hunched with misery their dark heads were both bowed and two sets of hazel eyes were bent upon the floor what precisely possessed you two to demonstrate yournew fighting techniques today that was bard arissa a slim autocratic woman dark as a gypsy and resplendent in her full formal scarlets and you could have used the edge in her voice to cleave diamonds it seemed like a good idea adain suggested in a whisper and why did you not ask herald alberich if you could show him these things in private asked elcarth his voice like a wintry blast from the snowstorm outside um hes very busy adain seemed to be doing all the talking mical was sitting like a stone alberich knew why mical was from a family prosperous enough to possess one or two real glass mirrors and he knew just how expensive they were although he probably had no idea that the price increased exponentially with the size adain was highborn until he came to the collegium he had never had to pay for anything himself in his life and he had no idea what even a hand mirror cost much less one of the huge panels in the salle mical thought he knew and he was scared just thinking it would cost about the same as a good horse alberich knew better knew that you could buy a nice house with a garden in a good part of haven for less than one of those mirrors never to my knowledge did you inquire of me these new moves to observe alberich said from behind them my duty it is to make time for such things you wanted an audience arissa said in that same hard sharp voicewhich given that she was a master bard was certainly deliberate and given that she was a bard and so was one of the miscreants her statement about their motive was probably correct you couldnt bear not to have an audience you wanted to show off what you thought you could do alberichs surmise that she had uncovered what had really driven the match today was borne out by the way that both the boys winced well she continued you got an audience i trust youre pleased youve made fools out of yourselves in front of that audience not to mention the damage you did in the salle now it was elcarths turn speaking of damages are either of you aware of just how difficultand expensiveit is to replace a mirror of that size identical head shakes elcarth named a figure both of them went white as the snow falling outside even alberich was impressed hearing the exact cost it made what he had paid for his stainedglass window look like pin money by comparison now elcarth continued naturally some of this is going to come from your stipends we shant take all of your stipends but youre going to be down to less than half of what everyone else gets mical finally said something butwe could never pay all that back not even if we stayed trainees for a hundred years he gulped audibly which is why you are both going to be spending all of your free time working for the master of the glassworkers guild until he finishes the new mirror arissa said flatly we intend for you to see why at firsthand such things cost so dearly we intend for you to have a very proprietary interest in the replacement when the mirror is finished i trust you will have an entirely new understanding of your folly and a new set of muscles elcarth added enigmatically now you may go and reflect on the fact that you will not have any time to get up to any more clever ideas for the duration this will be your last evening with any leisure in it because youll be spending your mornings your afternoons and half of your evenings down at the glassworks for a while enjoy it as if they could with a sentence like that one hanging over their heads the two rose heads hanging and shuffled out of the room the very image of dejection elcarth sighed once they were gone and ruffled a hand through his hair i wouldnt mind so much if theyd gone about their little project sensibly he said he motioned to alberich to sit alberich did so consulting with their instructors for instance not that all of that gymkhana nonsense would have worked mind you i wonder where they got such a notion out of their imaginations i suppose growled arissa sitting on the other chair which are entirely too active if you ask me or perhaps out of some idiot play or other the two of them are always running down into haven to see some fool drama whenever theres one to be seen i presume theyre going to be put to working the bellows at the glassworks for the next moon or so it could be worse this could be summer it will be summer before they see the end of their labor elcarth said i intend to leave them down there for more than a moon master cuelin tells me his apprentice is ready to go on to more complicated work and he doesnt have a junior apprentice to start on the bellows or do any of the other simple labor in and around the place so our lads can serve until he gets one it could have been worse at least it was only one mirror panel not two or more how often does this occur alberich asked curiously assume i must that accidents do happen stupidity probably rather more often than accident elcarth shrugged about once every hundred years or so i mean we designed the salle to minimize the possibility of an accident and you weaponsmasters rarely permit flying objects in the salle itself it does happen and it isnt always a trainees fault though i must say that this time is probably going into mystes chronicles for sheer wrongheadedness the panels are all a standard size and the glassworks has the dimensions in their records from the last time so master cuelin wont even have to come up here to take measurements i cant tell you how long its going to take to replace the mirror though the master will have a lot of failures before he gets a success i would interested be to watch alberich admitted or at least to hear from the master how such a thing is made then deliver the criminals yourself in the morning after breakfast elcarth told him someone will have to escort them the first time alberich took quick account of his schedule and smiled thinly so i shall he decided arissa laughed her voice full of ironic humor oh theyll enjoy seeing your face tomorrow morning the snow was still falling all that afternoon into the night and the next day and alberich had sent word up to the collegia that the trainees were to have a dayandahalf holiday from their weaponry classes while the salle was cleaned a small army of collegium servants were scouring the salle floor for the tiniest slivers of glass and would not leave until the floor had been swept several times over then washed down buffed and lightly sanded so that it wasnt slippery the one proviso to this holiday was that the trainees were to spend the class time out of doors but with this much snow he doubted that would be much of a trial for them the first lot was already building a snow fort when he and kantor left to escort the two troublemakers to their appointed labors while snow continued to fall from a sky that was the same color as a pigeons breast and looked just as soft when alberich got to the grounds of heralds collegium the two boys were waiting for him on the road that ran among the buildings mounted adain on his companion and mical on a sorrel gelding from the palace stables there was a conspicuous absence of trainees anywhere near them they waited alone in their disgrace as alberich and kantor approached he observed that adain and mical looked just as subdued as they had last night and even adains companion drooped a little they kept the hoods of their cloaks well up and aside from a soft good morrow weaponsmaster alberich he got nothing more out of them not that he intended to try to get them to talk it would do them good to contemplate their sins in silence snow drifted down now as fat slow flakes there wasnt even a breath of wind and the air smelled damp most of the trees bore burdens of snow along their black bare branches and large mounds bore testament to bushes hidden under heaps of the stuff nothing had spoiled the pure whiteness yet except for where the road had been cleared by the palace gardeners by midmorning people would be out playing in it and the two boys would be painfully aware of that a good thing better they should have to reflect on their sins in sorrow than congratulate themselves that today would have been a miserable one to be out in anyway alberich led them away from the palace and toward the wall that surrounded the entire complex they left from the heralds gate the guarded postern at the collegium side of the palace grounds outside the walls the road hadnt been cleared as yet heavy as the snow on the road was the companions made easy going through it and the horse was able to follow in kantors wake by the time they got down through the manors of the highborn and the very wealthy there were crews out starting to clear the road traffic was limited to a few riders and people on foot except for a few main thoroughfares the streets hadnt been shoveled out yet either fresh snow was nearly up to the knee and drifts blocked many smaller side streets and alleys but people were already out with shovels and teams of horses pulling scrapers and work was going apace after all it was in the interest of a shopkeeper to get the street in front of his place of business cleared quickly so as they passed farther down into the commercial parts of haven there was more clean pavement and more activity and by the smoke coming from the chimney of the glassworks as they arrived things were busy in there as well alberich dismounted and gave a hard rap on the door to the glassworks courtyard with his fist two of the apprentices met them at the door one took charge of their mounts and with an evil grin the other took charge of the miscreants alberich understood the reason for the grin perfectly the apprentice would now be put to doing something far more interesting and less labor intensive than mere manual work while adain and mical took his place at the bellows the furnaces were always going in a glassworks the fire needed to be quite hot indeed and at an even temperature the leastskilled job was that of keeping the bellows pumping air into those furnaces so that the molten glass was always ready to use cane for decoration could be melted and glass being blown into vessels could be reheated alberich knew from his previous visits where to find master cuelin in the master workshop that was where he headed the glassworks itself was a dangerous place and he was extremely careful as he made his way through it even now in the dead of winter it was very warm in here surrounding the furnaces were stations for molding glass for those who decorated finished vessels for beadmakers for glassblowers the floor was of pounded dirt the benches and tables made of metal and stone there was very little that could catch fire logically enough it was surprisingly dark here too alberich supposed there was a reason for that perhaps it made the hot glass easier to see while it was being shaped glass was both blown and molded here and all manner of things were made the most common pieces were molded disks and the thick bullseye glass for inferior windows made by dropping hot glass into molds and pressing it that was a job for an apprentice it was relatively easy relative being the proper word when you were talking about glass a substance that ran like melted wax and would burn you to the bone if it got on you beadmakers formed their amazing little works of art on mandrels at their own little benchesor spun out long thin tubes of colored glass to be chopped into bits and sandpolished in big drums when cool glassblowers formed the molten stuff into every shape imaginable and decorators took the finished vessels and shapes and embellished them with ribbons of colored glass alberich had been here once before when he had commissioned his window and then as now it had occurred to him how like a glassworker vkandis sunlord was the glass had no notion of what it was going to be it was melted in the heat of his regard then molded or shaped polished turned into something that bore little or no resemblance to the grains of sand it had been sometimes mistakes happened and when they did he gathered up the broken shards with infinite patience put them back in his furnace and began again the more conventional analogyand the one that the sunpriests favoredwas to compare him to a swordmaker but it had come to alberich that he was really nothing like a swordmaker for one thing the vast majority of the people he made were not creatures of war and for another few of them were tempered and honed most of them were simply made humble creatures of common use as perfectly suited to their lives as a thick pressedglass window some were merely ornamental like a bead some were honed and polished like the glass scalpels the healers used for the most careful surgery but they all came from the same hands and the same place better window glass was made in the same way as mirror glass and required a glassblower as well alberich had been rather surprised by that when master cuelin told him it had not occurred to him that one would use the same technique that created a goblet or a vase to make a flat pane of glass but in fact that was precisely how it was made glass was blown into a bubble of the right thickness the bubble was then rolled against a flat and highlypolished metal plate to form a cylinder the ends were swiftly cut off the cylinder and the cylinder slit up the middle while the glass was still soft enough to relax and the resulting pane unrolled itself onto the plate and cooled flat a master of the craft created a flat rectangular pane of even thickness with irregularities so few as to be trivial but of course the larger the paneor mirrorthe more difficult the task of blowing and cutting something the size of the mirror in the salle was going to be extremely difficult to do and in fact it was master cuelin himself who was taking the first tries at it a pile of rejected shards to one side testified that he had already tried and failed a time or two this morning ah i give over he said as alberich arrived i thought id give it a try but ive not the lungs anymore ill stick to my colored glasses and let young elkin here do what he does best but young elkinwho was older than alberichshook his head it wont come quick master cuelin he said honestly ive never done aught that big ill need to work up to it i wouldnt expect anything else my lad cuelin told him give it time youll manage kernos knows so long as you dont make the mess of it that i just did we can find buyers for the smaller panes and mirrors while you work your way up to the right size are you sure of that master the other craftsman asked surprised cuelin laughed and pulled off his leather gauntlets certain sure you just wait as soon as word gets out that were replacing a salle mirror up there on the hill therell be a stream of highborn servants at the door if youd happen to have a spare window glass sobyso master cuelin if youre like to have a mirror for miladys dressing table they know we have to work our way up to a pane that big and they know theyll get a bargain they wouldnt get if theyd commissioned those glass panes and mirrors special then itll be the polishing and then the silvering and thatll be a bit tricky as well master alberich i want to show you something thatll catch your interest aye and you too elkini had the collegium servants bring me down the old glass and when i got it this is what i found he held up a shard of silvered glass thisll be from the top of your mirror and a second and thisll be from the bottom now what dye think of that the top shard was clearly thinner than the bottom alberich scratched his head glass not so good as you can make it he hazarded cuelin laughed oh flattery no no it was fine glass and well be hard put to match it but ill reckon that mirror was over two hundred years old if it was a day master alberich maybe more and when it was made top to bottom was the same thickness he wanted alberich to look puzzled with some amusement alberich obliged him then how he asked glass never quite sets master alberich cuelin told him its like slow water my old master told me believe it or not it keeps flowingoh slow too slow to notice but over a century or two or three you look youll see that any glass has got thicker at the bottom than it is at the top mind most of it doesnt stay unbroken long enough to find that out specially with lads like your two troublemakers about but there you have it you can tell the age of a piece by how thick its got on the bottom compared to the top alberich examined the two shards then passed them on to elkin and blinked at that and tried to get his mind wrapped around the idea of something that flowed that slowly i amastonished he admitted after a moment astonished wonderful stuff is glass master cuelin said with pride and pleasure and ill see to it your lads get their heads stuffed full of more than they ever cared to learn about it no point in exercising their arms and leaving their heads to come up with more mischief ill send them back up the hill on time for their classes though no worry and he took a slip of paper out of a pocket in his tunic and consulted it i see im to expect them back down here at fourth bell and keep them until our suppertime we eat late mind correct alberich said be here they will be fed they will be when they arrive then they must study for the morrow then bed cuelin laughed if theyve strength enough to hold up their heads without falling into their books ill be main surprised alberich took his leave of the master with better humor than he had arrived in clearly cuelin understood boys and was quite prepared to handle them as they needed to be handled micals horse and adains companion were comfortably housed as the weaponsmaster saw when he went to fetch kantor so alberich left them in peace the horse was happy enough the companion still looked subdued an interesting place have you ever thought of glasswork as a hobby kantor asked as alberich mounted i think i would not be good enough to satisfy myself alberich replied truthfully they rode out into the street already the industrious craftsmen here had gotten it cleared and the snow had been piled up along the walls why was the boys companion so quiet because he is as much to blame as the children kantor told him apparently he was in league with them he is very young alberich snorted he must be i thought your kind had better sense kantor sighed gustily those of us who are older are some of us like eloranare young have you got any plans for delivering some sort of chastisement to eloran alberich asked after a moment while he tried to sort out the meaning behind his words and couldnt come up with anything oh yes came the reply rolan and i have devised something quiteappropriate and since nothing else was forthcoming alberichs curiosity had to remain unassuaged selenay looked out of a window in the long gallery on the way to her lesser audience chamber and sighed with regret the garden was alive with color and movement against the snowthe brilliantly colored cloaks coats and hoods of the younger members of her court as they chased one another flung snowballs and generally forgot any pretense of dignity young men who had lately fought the tedrels had cast aside their adulthood for a few hours as they fired snowballs at pages safely ensconced behind the sturdy walls of a snow fort young ladies giggled and joined the pages in flinging missiles back at their suitors others were on the way to frozen ponds with skates slung over their shoulders or moving toward the artificial hills in the wild garden with sleds selenay would have given a year of her life to be down there with them alas the queen had an audience with the ambassador from hardorn and there was no time for frolicking in the snow no time for skating no time for a fast run on a sled curse it she nodded to the guards on either side of the door of the lesser audience chamber and went inside shed had the room repainted in softer colors than her father had favored though she couldnt do much about the leather paneling which had been there for decades and would probably be there for decades more it was easy to keep clean and looked far more luxurious than anything she could install to replace it shed settled for painting the trim an ashen brown with silvergilt touches here and there the ambassador and his entourage were already waiting as was talamir bless him it was clear he had been keeping the ambassador properly entertained although such gentlemen were notable for being able to conceal any evidence of impatience the smile ambassador werenton turned on her was quite genuine and warm and his eyes were relaxed he wore the fine shirt tunic trews and floorlength open vest in the current valdemaran style which was a little disappointing shed wanted to see what the hardornan mode was for the talk was that the new queen was quite a fashion setter she gave him her hand he bowed over it and she was pleased to note that his hand was warm and dry not cold or clammy she took her place on the small velvetcovered throne on the sketchy dais and motioned to him to sit this was a room meant to welcome rather than awe the warm ocher of the leathercovered paneling and the aspect of it situated so that it looked out into a sheltered courtyard made it surprisingly comfortable for a formal room the furnishings were all upholstered in leather that matched the paneling and the floor carpeted there was a fine fire in the fireplace and servants with mulled spiced wine to serve everything that could have been done to relax the ambassador and his entourage had beenmore of talamirs work no doubt ambassador werenton it is good to see you again she said warmly and i am glad that you were able to reach our court before this snow closed us in as am i majesty he replied and my king wishes me first to tender his sympathies for your loss and second offer his apologies that he was not able to send me sooner she smiled at him and hoped that her weariness with all of the official expressions of condolence did not show she knew very well that the king of hardorn could have cared less about who was on the throne of valdemar he knew that valdemar would always favor allies and peace over conquest in fact so long as that attitude prevailed the king of hardorn would not have cared if the council had elected a horse to wear the crown please werentonthe message of condolence arrived with the usual promptness of our friends and allies and i can certainly understand how your king would be otherwise too occupied with his own defensive preparations against karse to think about sending you to our court if valdemar had fallenor even been pushed back werenton said apologetically and shrugged we share a border with karse as you know the king was prepared at need to unite our force with yours if it had come to that as it was the defeated tedrels spread into our land and we were forced to deal with them as one would any other plague the king would not have bestirred himself unless his border lords forced him to she translated to herself in fact it probably wouldnt have been the king of hardorn who united his forces with us at all it would have been the local hardornen borderlevies and your king was right to concern himself first with them and concern himself with other things second selenay agreed i am glad it never came to the point of asking our allies for help she knew and probably the ambassador did too that the reason her father hadnt asked hardorn for troops was precisely because there was no telling what the tedrels were going to do for certain yes karse had hired them to take valdemar but if hardorns border troops had been removed to bolster valdemaran forces leaving that border unguarded the tedrels would probably have taken southern hardorn and come at valdemar from the eastern flank the king of hardorn was a good man and served his people wellbut he was not a very good strategist nor were any of his military advisers sad to say all of them were old men and more accustomed to dealing with the odd bandit force than a real campaign karses longstanding and increasingly hostile feud with valdemar had ensured that hardorn had been very little troubled over the past two reigns her father had deemed it wise not to distract hardorns king withas he had put itconflicting needs she had better say something flattering before her mouth let something unflattering escape and am i to understand that congratulations will shortly be in order selenay continued with a slight smile we do expect the birth of an heir before spring yes werenton admitted he did not mention that the young queen was only a little older than selenay nor that the king was older than sendar had been nor did selenay make anything of it she was just grateful that the king of hardorn had married before the death of her own father now at least there was one old man who was out of the running as a potential suitor had he still been singlehis previous wife having died without producing a living heirthere soon would have been advisers on both sides of the border clamoring for a match between them i will have to rack my brain to find a unique birth gift then selenay replied im sure that by now his majesty has an entire room given over to silver rattles and ivory teething rings the ambassador smiled politely as if to suggest that a royal infant could not possibly have too many silver rattles and ivory teething rings selenay spent the better part of two candlemarks with the ambassador mostly taking her lead from talamir or the ambassador himself as to when subjects currently under negotiation needed to be mentioned there were some of course hardorn badly wanted to take back some land that karse had overrun half a century ago but if they did the king wanted to be sure that valdemar wouldnt take it amiss valdemar wanted warning if this was going to happen so that when karse reacted though given how unsettled things were there at the moment karse might not even notice for a year or two there would be extra guards on the border again hardorn wanted to know what valdemar was going to do with all those tedrel children valdemar politely told hardorn it was none of hardorns business but that in fact the children were more than halfway to being valdemaran by now hardorn suggested polite skepticism valdemar offered examples and pointed out the general ages of the children there were some matters of trade to discuss some concessions that both of them wanted no few of these would have to go before the council and presumably an equivalent body in hardorn but in a simple convivial discussion like this one it was possible to get a feel for how such overtures would be met when presented formally finallyand none too soon in selenays opinionthe ambassador gave signs that he had said all he needed to and she politely decreed the audience was at an end he withdrew she turned to talamir as soon as the doors had closed behind him and his entourage talamir shrugged wearilyhe did everything wearily these days he seemed to have aged twenty years since the end of the wars his hair had gone entirely to silvergray and that lean careworn face had lines of pain in it that had not been there a year ago the eyes had changed the most though now they were an indeterminate stormy color with the look in them of someone who has looked into places that mortal men are not supposed to see still most of the time he was the same talamir she remembered stubborn and difficult to move once he had decided on a thing no hidden agendas i think majesty he said judiciously other than the obvious that the king waited to see if id survive six months on the throne on my own before sending a formal envoy she said with a feeling of resignation all of the envoys had been like this it was disheartening to think that there were probably bets being placed on how long she would remain queen and sole ruler of valdemar well you could have wedded immediately talamir pointed out from his point of view there was no harm in waiting to see if you did before sending the ambassador or i could have been toppled by one of my own nobles or assassinated by a leftover tedrel she did not add after all im only a woman but the unspoken words hung in the air between them well you werent talamir replied unexpectedly and those of us who knew you also knew you wouldnt be and if some foreign monarch is foolish enough to think that your youth and sex means that you are weak or foolish well i pity him hell take a beating at the negotiation tables she flushed feeling suddenly warm with pleasure thank you for that talamir she replied so talamir really did think she was capable it was a welcome surprise she would not have been at all surprised if he had still been thinking of her as little selenay who needed a firm hand on the rein and a great deal of looking after he gave a little bow and smiled he still had a charming smile credit where credit is due he said simply and by this point im sure the throne room is filled with impatient petitioners so on to the next chore she thought longingly of the fresh snow outside and ruthlessly pushed away the longing queens did not desert their court to frolic carelessly when there were duties to be done queens had responsibilities time to get to it the sooner we clear the work out the less likely it is ill incur the wrath of the cooks by delaying luncheon she rose and shook out her skirts still startled even after all this time to note the trimming of black on her royal whites where the silver of the heir or the gold of the monarch should be speaking of wrath she continued as talamir went to hold the doors of the chamber open for her whats the outcome of that little disaster down at the salle talamir coughed to hide a smile she thought alberich escorted the two miscreants down to the glassworks just after breakfast he told her they will be spending from now untilwere thinkingvernal equinox pumping the glassworks bellows every free moment that they have were loath to keep them down there once the weather begins to get significantly warmer because work switches to the nighttime once it becomes hellish to keep the furnaces going at full heat in the hottest part of the day but we also want them to feel theyre really being punished when the weather turns and all their friends are enjoying themselves outdoors again poor things she said feeling rather sorry for them seeing as she was in a similar situation with no hope for a reprieve talamir coughed again this time it sounded a bit disapproving selenay do you have any notion how much the crowns treasury is going to have to pay the glassworkers for a new mirror you could replace every horse in the royal guard with ashkevron war stallions for less than the cost of that mirror personally i think theyre getting off lightly if those mirrors cost so much how on earth did the crown manage to pay for all of them when they were first installed she asked as the two of them flanked by a couple of guards made their way down the gallery that overlooked the snowcovered gardens if the legends are correct no one paid for them at all talamir replied the heraldmages made them supposedly just as whenever one was broken the heraldmages fixed them how very convenient she said dryly did the heraldmages fix plumbing too ive had an artificer in my bathing room twice now and that drip still isnt fixed when i was trying to sleep last night that was all i could hear sendar used to say he found it soothing talamir said quietly i am not my father selenay thought and felt a surge of resentment as well as sadness but she was not going to say it just have someone send a different artificer please she replied instead if i have to move into my old rooms for a few days until its fixed ive no objections if i have to listen to that drip for many more nights im going to go mad with classes canceled for the day alberich found himself with unexpected free time on his hands in light of the frustration of pursuing inquiries to dead ends recently he decided he had a good idea of how to fill some of it at this point all of his usual sources of information had run dry it was time to find some new ones but to do that he would have to create new identities what i am looking for is not going to be found around exiles gate he decided it was with a distinct feeling of pleasure that he noted that kantor had followed his thought and had altered his course heading not for the collegia but for the companions bell this was a prosperous tavern that played host to heralds quite regularlyand to alberich quite a bit more often than to most although if you had asked the staff they would have said truthfully that they didnt see him there very often there was a secret room in the back of the stables where herald alberich would retire and someone else would emerge by way of a door that no more than a handful of people knew existed in that room was a chest of disguises which were apparently tended to by someone in the bell for no matter what state they were in when alberich left them there the next time he returned they would be cleanor at any rate cleaner since the apparent dirt and real stains were an integral and important part of some of them furthermore any damage hed done to them would be repaired and the clothing neatly put away back in the chest hed inherited that room and that chest from herald dethor his predecessor as weaponsmaster and hed put quite a bit of wear on the disguises hed found there enough that it was time to do something about the situation before he found himself literally without anything to wear hed have to do it in disguise though even though he flatly refused to wear heralds whites his own gray leathers were distinctive enough to mark him as the collegium weaponsmaster if the weaponsmaster was noted visiting the usedclothing merchants it would be a short step for anyone keeping an eye on him to determine that he was purchasing disguises why else would he be making a great many purchases of used clothing so after leaving kantor tucked into an outoftheway stall in the section of the stables reserved for companions herald alberich retired into that room and a persona he had never used until now emerged into the alley behind the inn his clothing was wellmade of good materials but a little out of style as befitting a prosperous merchant or craftsman from one of the farther or more rustic reaches of the kingdom good thick boots with a significant amount of scuffing and wear to the tops suggested that he was used to doing a great deal of walking in rough country leather breeches with little wear on the seat but a great deal to the legs and knees added to that impression his heavy wool cape with an attached hood was significantly oldfashioned though the material was very good and it was lined with lambswool plush which was quite a luxurious fabric beneath the cape was a knit woolen tunic that went down to his calvesalso significantly out of fashion for it should have been but was not worn with a sleeveless leather or cordware jerkin if hed been living in haven for any length of time all of this gear looked homemade rather than tailormade and every bit of it made him look rustic if he spoke slowly and took care with his syntax despite the odd accent he still had hed be taken for a farmer or craftsmanor just possibly a country squirefrom some agrarian part of valdemar with its own regional accent it was a fine guise and very useful for what he was about to dowhich was to buy used clothing such was easy enough to acquire and it was easier to put mending and patching onto gentlyused clothing than it was to repair clothing that was getting far past its useful lifespan it was easier to put on stains than remove them that sohelpful completely invisible accomplice at the companions bell was quite literate as alberich had proved to himself by leaving some instructions with one of those disguises and returning to find that those instructions had been carried out to the letter so he would buy appropriate outfits and leave instructions on how the items were to be abused if they looked insufficiently used and finally he would have things that fit him rather than dethor his predecessor had been slightly shorter and significantly broader in the waist than alberich with much shorter legs it will be good not to have to wear my breeches down around my hips to keep them from looking too short he spent a very profitable morning going from shop to stall to barrow examining items with all the care that any thrifty fellow from the hinterland would use exhibiting all the suspicion that he was being cheated by a city sharper that any haven merchant would expect from a shrewd bumpkin eager to get his moneys worth he never bought more than one piece from any one place at the same timethough he did come back later if hed seen more than one item that he wanted in this persona alberich was not particularly notable there were several men like him engaged in similar errands up and down the quarter where used clothing was sold most were alone though a few had wives or older children with them whenever he had a collection of three or four items he went back to the bell and left them so that he was never observed carrying great piles of clothing by doing this he was able to acquire disguises for a good dozen personae including one or two that were just a touch above his current character good solid citizens who would be welcome in any decent house or tavern in the city anything else hed get from the palace he had a notion hed like to have a set of palace livery perhaps a guard uniform and clothing appropriate for the lower ranks of the highborn and under the guise of purchasing something for his wife he bought some womens clothing as well not that hed ever tried to impersonate a woman butwell he might need to youll never pull it off kantor said critically as he stowed these last purchases away hanging them up rather than putting them in the chest as even with all of the old guises taken out and left with a note to get rid of them there was no more room in that chest youd need a wig and how would you hide that face of yours ive seen plenty of ugly women in this city he objected im sure you have but none that looked as if theyd been through a fire then fought in a dozen bars and a war kantor argued and you dont act like a woman you dont know how to act like a woman if you need to find out something only a woman can then get a woman to do it myste would probably fit those skirts but he started to arguethen stopped myste would fit those skirts and she was a native of haven and shed come into the heraldic circle as an adult which meant that she was used to being a civilian acting like a civilian and she had all the knowledge that an ordinary citizen of haven had he wouldnt want to take her down into the area around exiles gate but but shed go if you asked her to think about it anyway theres herald keren too shed go and shed fit in anywhere that was rough including around exiles gate good gods some of the clientele of those fishers taverns in the ports of evendim would frighten the whey out of the loungers in the broken arms kantor sounded very sure of himself but alberich saw no reason to doubt that he was right keren was a tearaway of the first order and back in the day if the sunsguard had permitted women to take up arms hed have had no objection to her in his cavalry unit she made a fearless bodyguard for selenay id have to find a way to persuade ylsa to stay away though the two of them together would be a dead giveaway to anyone who knows anything about the heralds pointing that out ought to be enough to persuade ylsa kantor replied with a hint of humor wild they might be stupid they arent well two excellent ideas in one morning one from his own mind and one from kantor and didnt i tell you back when we first came here that you and i were a good match kantor asked smugly so you did and you were correct so very correct that i dont even mind hearing you say itold you so kantors only reply was a sort of mental snicker alberich finished writing notes on what he wanted doneor notto each of the new disguises left them piled atop the chest or hung up on pegs around the room went to the stableside door and blew out the lamp dont worry you wont be seen no one here but us companions kantor told him and he slipped the catch moved out into the stable and shut the door carefully behind himself it locked itself with a soft click there were indeed two other companions in stalls with kantor one was partnered with herald mirilin who was one of the two heralds assigned permanently to dispense justice within haven the other assigned to that duty was jadus who since losing his leg could not ride for very long or very farbut whose insight and understanding of human nature made him very suitable for this job jadus companion was not here though the third companion was not one he recognized not a herald you know either someone just in off circuit and an old friend of mirilins and something about the tone of kantors mindvoice told alberich that the old friend was female and that neither mirilin nor the newcomer would be found in the common room but that they would be found with each other heh so mirilin was human after all mirilin with a woman now that was a thought to hold onto from the way that mirilin usually acted alberich had the idea that hed be very embarrassed if he was caught playing truant with a womanand no matter if the woman was another herald i believe he said as kantor turned his head to wink one blue eye at him that i will have one of the bells delicious pigeon pies and i believe i will linger over it it would do him no end of good to see the expression on mirilins face when the herald finally did emerge kantor snickered there was no other word for it the sound wasnt even remotely horselike ill see to it that their companions forget to mention youre here mirilin and the stranger strolled into the smaller common roomthe one usually used by heraldswith a careless and casual air as of people who expect to find a room empty and since alberich had deliberately set himself in the most secluded corner of the roomwhich happened to be right beside the cheerful firemirilin and his friend would not be able to see him until they were already well into the room heyla mirilin he said calmly and was rewarded when mirilin actually jumped a little startled the other herald an attractive little redhead didnt jump but did look surprised the herald peered at his corner to alberichs further pleasure he flushed and looked extremely discomfited not that there was anything at all wrong with two heralds having a quiet mark or two alone together far from it but being discovered by the enigmatic alberich that same alberich that mirilin had openly and avowedly not trusted at all when he first became selenays bodyguard and who was now one of the great heroes of the wars and if mirilin was not acting as a justiciar in the heraldic court shouldnt he be up the hill at the collegium at the moment again there was no reason why mirilin should not take a mark or two out of the day to please himselfbut someone like mirilin would feel guilty that he had and moreover he probably wouldnt want anyone to know he had done so ah herald alberich what are you doing in haven delivering our miscreants to their place of punishment he replied heard of the incident in the salle i presume you have a broken mirror wasnt it mirilin said after a moment and a couple of trainees with more enthusiasm than sense mirilin was regaining his composure which made alberich smile a little after all he only wanted to discomfit the fellow a trifle not humiliate him alberich uttered a dry chuckle well put and no more free time in which to devise more such mischief will they have until well into spring pumping the bellows at the glassworks dean elcarth has decreed is to be their task mirilin smiled and winced at the same time wellat the least theyll have stout muscles when spring comes make the punishment fit the crimei like that said the womannot as young as alberich had first thought she wasnt as old as mirilin but she was older than alberich are you the new weaponsmaster then she left mirilin and approached alberich her hand extended somewhat to mirilins consternation sorry i havent met you before this ive been on one circuit or another for almost six years and when i come in i usually stay here rather than at the collegium when im off im a bit of a carouser and why disturb peoples sleep when i can have all the fun i like and not upset anyone down here im ravinia mindspeech and animal mindspeech alberich rose took her hand and bowed slightly over it and i am alberich he told her releasing it foresight for whatever good it does she smiled at him mirilin was very clearly discomfited again perhaps because the lady he had come here to meet was being so very friendly to someone heused tonot trust very much so you are indeed the very famous herald alberich its a pleasure to meet you at last since im staying at least a moon this time i expect youll see me at the salle i could use some sparring practice can you find me partners at short notice is she flirting with me he asked kantor incredulously no she really does need sparring practice find some of the midlevel guards from selenays bodyguard or keren or ylsa kantor chuckled shes not flirting shes being direct and she doesnt mistrust you she hadnt met you at a time when you were under suspicion you are not alberich of karse to her you are herald alberich you will welcome be and partners can be found he replied and decided to end mirilins discomfort by taking himself off rude i do not wish to seem but my task and meal both being over returning i must be certainly ravinia agreed i expect well meet again in the next day or two excellent he nodded at mirilin and fare you well in your afternoons tasks mirilin perhaps the heavy snow will thin the plaintiffs mirilin shrugged i wouldnt count on it but i wouldnt be upset if you were right but there was a change in mirilin a subtle one but there it was perhaps because for the first time he saw alberich through the eyes of someone he trusted and he saw the man before him as herald alberich alberich took that as a dismissal and took himself off keeping his chuckle strictly internal well well well of course neither of them could know that he knew the two of them hadnt just accidentally arrived at the bell at the same timebut mirilin suspected alberich knew and alberich was never going to let on one way or another they let the stablehands take their companions in kantor told him they had a great deal ofcatching up to do indeed alberich replied it was interesting that mirilin was clearly embarrassed but ravinia was not shelteny says that ravinia isnt embarrassed by much kantor observed dispassionately a very cool one she says i can believe that alberich paused at the door to swing his cloak over his shoulders and pushed out into the stable yard snow was still falling but at least it was not much more than token flakes and a single stable boy with a broom was doing a reasonable job of keeping up with it he crossed the yard and walked into the stables again and a bay horse in the stall nearest the door peered over the side of the partition and snorted at him i trust that the boys are already on their way back up to the collegia he added halfway there and just in time for their classes kantor confirmed as he picked up saddle and blanket from the side of the stall and heaved them onto kantors back just aboutin the state of soremuscled wornout wretchedness youd hoped for not utterly miserable certainly not feeling any desperation but definitely feelingchastised good he didnt want them to be desperate but he wanted them to feel well and truly that they were being punished for making not one but several bad decisions not the least of which was that they made the choice to act recklessly in a place where mistakes would be magnified elcarth had made an excellent decision as to their punishment and he and the dean of bardic had made it crystal clear that the boys were being punished by their respective collegia not by alberich alone he finished putting on the last of the tack and kantor backed out into the aisle so that alberich could mount what had you planned for this afternoon i believe ill have a talk with keren about that suggestion of yours he replied and perhaps with mystethough i had rather speak to keren first good mind you id feel better if you had more than one set of hands and eyes helping you but the more people there are in on a secret the harder it becomes to keep it he felt kantors sigh of resignation beneath his legs as they trotted out into the stable yard under the arched gate that led to the street and onto the thoroughfare itself kantor didnt argue with him though the companion knew just as well as anyone that if alberich was going to do the covert part of his job effectively it had to be kept secret heralds were humansas witness mirilinand humans talked gossiped let things slip by accident that was one of the reasons why alberich needed to do his job in the first place the ride up to the collegium was uneventful and now that substantial inroads had been made on clearing the snow it was a bit faster than the ride down had been and alberich noted as they rode that it wasnt only the trainees that had been infected by a spirit of playthere were snow fights and sliding the building of snow sculptures and castles and he saw no few people going by with skates over their shoulders as they came into the region of private houses larger and representing more wealth the closer they came to the palace there was even more sign of merrymaking in the snow well it isnt often that haven sees a snowfall as heavy as this one has been personally i have never seen anything of the sort alberich admitted there are snows in my hills but they are thin and dry this is winter weather typical for the north of valdemar not so much here said kantor i wonder there was a long pause as they wove their way among the houses of the highborn and laughter and shrieks of pleasure and excitement echoed behind the walls and fences you wonder alberich prompted his companion well its dreadfully soon and the court is technically still in mourning but a snowfall like this doesnt come very often and theres going to be a hard cold spell coming behind it kantor gave the impression to alberich that he was musing aloud though alberich wondered for a moment where he was getting his weather information the terilee is going to freeze solid when that cold spell comesthat hasnt happened in fifty years i just wonder if its occurred to selenay to decree a snow festival although alberich had never heard of a snow festival before the name pretty much told him everything he needed to know if the river freezes solid isnt something like that bound to happen spontaneously anyway the very novelty of the frozen river would bring skatersthe skaters would draw vendors of food and drink and those would attract musicians skate sharpeners skate vendors and probably more merchants than that on the wholewell it wouldnt be a bad thing for an official festival to take place official mourning be damned the wars had dragged on for years sendars death had cast a pall over the entire country but there was only so much grieving that you could do before you just wearied of it selenays coronation had been a triumph but it had been a shadowed triumph well you can hear it beginning for yourself kantor agreed tossing his head in the direction of yet more laughter and once the river freezes people will come flocking down to the banks if it were me id go ahead and make the decree so that what is going to break out anyway gets some time limits to it and while were at it something like this would create a number of excellent opportunities for you to nose about and listen kantor paused perhaps to gather his thoughts if anyone is going to try and foment discontent oddly enough a festival is a good place to do so you can say things then that people will dismiss as the drink talkingbut the words will still stick in the memory and should selenay or her council do something that people dont agree withthose words will be remembered we really do think too much alike alberich agreed as they turned in at the gate with a friendly nod to the guardsman on duty so to whom should we drop hints and when leave that to us companions said kantor its what were good at the area around the salle was extremely quiet without streams of trainees coming and going when dethor had moved out alberich had gotten the carpenters to put in a good stout onecompanion stable up against that oven wall for kantor to stay in when he chose it was immensely more convenient not to have to go all the way up to the companions stable in order to tack him upand this way he and kantor could come and go without any fuss or anyone noticing kantor himself always went up to the main stable to eat and drink and companions being companions and not horses the interior of this secondary stable didnt need to be cleaned alberich being alberich he saw to kantors tack himself except for the fancy show or parade tack so it wasnt really any inconvenience to the stablehands either for kantor to have his everyday kit down here alberich dismounted at the door of the little leanto addition and kantor followed him inside it was pleasantly warm thanks to that brick wall im going up to the stable the companion said as alberich took off his halter and he shook his head and neck vigorously im going to have some consultations alberich bent to unbuckle the girth ill probably be here for the next mark or two i want to think a few things over myself kantor tossed his head and when alberich had a good grip on the saddle and blanket walked out from underneath them ill let you know if anything gets started and with that the companion trotted back out into the snow leaving alberich to wipe down the tack and hang it up to dry it was less quiet in the salle than alberich had thought it would be hed forgotten that there was going to be a crew of cleaners making sure that there was not the tiniest bit of glass left behind then setting the floor to rights again the soft murmur of voices was rather pleasant he slipped in without disturbing them and went back into his own quarters the glory of his window took him by surprisea blaze of gold and blue color in a room that had been pale and faded in winter light before the window had been put in it was going to be a while before he got used to the change but the shock was one of pleasure and he found that he liked it he sat down where he got the best possible view of the glass and was bathed in the golden light coming from the suninglory ah it felt good it felt right to have the light of vkandis about him it felt like a blessing and perhaps it was if that was so well this was a good place for him to be when he was thinking about important decisions now the question about keren and myste was should he take one or both women into his confidence concerning his covert work myste had the better knowledge of haven keren would fit into rougher places as he weighed the abilities of one against the other it became clear that if he was going to do this it would eventually have to be both neither had the ability or the skills to move in all the places that he could but he thought that he would approach keren about this first it was after all the rougher places of haven where most of his prowling was done that made him feel easier later perhaps he could ask myste if he thought hed need her she wasnt much good at anything physical and he wasnt sure just how well she could conceal her feelings he really didnt want to involve her if he didnt have to no matter how good a notion kantor thought it was companions werent always right bloody hell herald keren said in sheer admiration she shook her head all this time youve been running around in hells own neighborhood all this time by yourself bloody hell keren had held alberich in high esteem for his skill but he sensed that this had not been anything she would have pictured him doing so wheres your wheelbarrow then pardon he said puzzled as ylsa choked but neither of them explained so he decided it was one of those colloquialisms he wouldnt understand even if he knew what shed meant and dismissed it from his mind keren was probably alberichs age though with someone from lake evendim it was hard to tell they were all lean tall and had the sort of face that appears not to change a great deal between the ages of twenty and sixty she had been a herald for several years by the time alberich came to haven and people swore shed looked pretty much the same as she did now on the day she arrived she was an oddity among the female heralds as she wore her brown hair cropped close to her head but then the only hairstyle she was interested in was how to braid up a companions mane and tail for parade since dethor his second made me prowling the streets i have been alberich confirmed keren grinned at him with a glint in her eye that made her partner ylsa sigh and cast a glance up toward heaven ylsa was cut of similar cloth to keren though her hair was an ashblonde and her jaw square rather than evendimnarrow apparently they had been together from the time they were yearmates as trainees ylsa tended to be the one who exercised more caution than keren did hardly surprising really since myste claimed the lake evendim fishers were all descended from pirates and just how often have you been doing this she asked of late perhaps every two or three nights but during the worst of it nightly could i manage it bloody hell when did you sleep keren demanded infrequently apparently ylsa muttered he had known he would have to let ylsa in on the secret of his double life the moment hed decided to recruit keren he had learned as a commander that the only way to ensure perfect cooperation from his menor now his womenwas to make certain their partners knew what was toward and although by the strictest karsite creed what was between ylsa and keren wasnot to be thought ofalberich had been a leader of men for far too long not to know that things that were not to be thought of were commoner than the sunpriests admitted back when hed been a captain of the sunsguard two of his men had had just such an understanding between them though the rest of the troop had not known and alberich doubted that even the two in question ever realized he had discovered their association they had been very good at keeping it all to themselves but alberich had been better at reading subtle body language than they were at concealing it from him never once had it affected their performance never once had they allowed it to affect their behavior in the troops after careful soul searching on alberichs part he had finally decided that what did not affect the troops did not matter and ignored it several more of the men had clandestine marriages with women in one or another of the villagesordinary fighters were not permitted to marry at all under any circumstances only officers needless to say those understandings too had been kept very quiet strange that whoring was tolerated if preached against but an honest marriage was absolutely forbidden on the grounds that it was a distraction to the soldier this had all conflicted with what the sunpriests decreed and as their leader his responsibility was to report every irregularity to the sunpriests except that if he did that hed earn the hatred of half of them and see the other half cashiered before six months was over eventually he had come to a decision on his own about what the men did or did not do if some behavioral trait of one of his people did not affect performance and honor adversely it mattered not at all if it affected performance and honor positively it mattered a very great deal so when confronted by similar irregularities as a herald he followed the same course and that seemed to be the right way to go it certainly fell right into line with the credo that there is no one right way so far as he could judge keren and ylsa were good partners keren gave ylsa a boost to thinking imaginatively ylsa steadied keren down something that hellion badly needed if they had lovers quarrels they kept it to themselves or at least never involved anyone but a counselor and although keren was permanently stationed at the collegiumthere hadnt been a better riding instructor in the past fifty years so it was saidand ylsa was a special messenger which took her out of haven all the time neither of them complained about being separated far too often if theyd been sunsguard hed have called them fine soldiers and written them up for commendations as it was since there was no such thing as officers in the heraldic circle and thus absolutely nothing he could say or do that would get them any advance in rank he merely considered it a pity that there werent more heralds like them and you want me to help you out keren continued still with that glint in her eyes from time to time not often but there are some things women tell not to men and some places men are welcome not he shrugged that there is the greatness of threat to valdemar that there was once i think not that there is the threat still existing however i do think i know not why there was that man paying for grumblings against the queen for instance and this troubles me valdemar was not impoverished in the wars as it could have been thanks to you ylsa pointed out if you hadnt gone after those children and got the lions share of the tedrel loot in the process we would have been he waved that aside still seasoned fighters were lost valdemar hires not from the mercenary guild so weakened will valdemar be for some time a weakened land is a land that others may seekto exploit hmm ylsa sat back in her chair and stroked her chin speculatively that could be though weve friends on the east and south there is the north keren pointed out northern barbarians are always a danger and the gods only know what iftel might dojust because its been quiet for centuries doesnt mean it wont suddenly roar up and turn into a menace and theres always the west pirates on evendim bandit bands large enough to qualify as armies weird stuff out of the pelagirs gods only know what comes farther into the west than the pelagirs even so alberich nodded the northern border and the western are fluid ylsa supplied him and whats more selenay inherited a kingdom where war has allowed other problems to be ignored and i suspect you know that at first hand she raised an eyebrow at him special messengers saw a lot and were chosen as much for their ability to keep their mouths shut as their riding prowess he shrugged indeed the enemy i fear most lies within our borders in haven the city guard shorthanded still remains opportunists come in all stripes and all ranks perhaps this is why someone seeks to agitate against selenay while we look to that as trouble we miss some other evil he may do where there are fortunes to be made men will seek to make them be the source never so vile and once you start selling one vile thing further vileness comes easier especially when the price is good enough keren shook her head well how would you like me to start by learning to act a part alberich told her immediately the hellion will not always welcome be where i would ask you to go sometimes the serving wench sometimes the whore keren snickered at that me id never pass as a whore nobodyd look twice at me you are not old not raddled with drink have all your teeth most of your mind and no disease alberich said pragmatically before ylsa could jump in in the quarters where i go that is enough keren snorted most of my mind i like that ylsa laughed youre a herald you are volunteering to spy in the worst parts of haven dear thats not exactly anything i see sane people queuing up to do keren made a face but she didnt argue so there it is can you act a part alberich asked can you act those parts keren scratched one eyebrow thoughtfully im pretty sure i can at least as long as you dont expect me to bed anybody not for days and weeks at a time but then you arent going to want that i suppose no he agreed if it must come to days and weeks another solution sought must be not you nor i can be spared our assigned duties a few hours at most is what we will need and noif the whore you play it is my whore you will be for a few hours i can manage anything keren decreed i suppose i could even manage pretending to be a lady id pay money to see that ylsa chortled if it is a lady i need to talamir i should take myself alberich told them both better to find one within the court who is a friendand i assume that he has more than one such already probably ylsa agreed and keren nodded there are highborn heralds tooprobably no one would tell them anything directly and since everyone would know they were heralds theyd be useless as spies but people do gossip and gossip alone might be worth something so there it was he had agreement not only from keren but from her partnerwhich basically meant that ylsa agreed not to interfere he felt a little of the weight lift from his shoulders well then i thank you both he stood up and motioned them both to remain seated i shall myself let out not soon will this benothing have i that needs a female at the moment better to have the gaff in your hand before you try to land the sturgeon keren observed take me with you a time or two when youve not got something on the boil and i can get used to playing your doxy i shall he promised and let himself out of their somewhat cramped quarters they shared a room meant for onewell it probably wasnt as crowded as it could have been since both of them tended to keep personal possessions at a minimum and ylsa was often away but it felt very claustrophobic to him all things considered he wasnt unhappy about being down in the salle if he wanted or needed more room he could just add on as apparently generations of weaponsmasters had done before him quarters in the heralds wing were best described as tight by his current standards and he wasnt at all certain he would care to have neighbors on either side of his walls either that went very well he decided and knew that it could have turned out a flat failure keren might not have been interestedylsa might well have objected and kerens suggestion of going about in persona when there was nothing particularly that he needed to do was an excellent one it would establish her personae and allow him to correct her if need be at a time and place where breaks in the particular persona would not be dangerous better to clear all that up before it could be fatal prowling the slums when there was nothing in particular he was watching for could be tedious at times at least with keren along it might be less tedious and having her with him when he changed into one of his varied costumes would also be useful she could doublecheck the face paint he wore to cover his scars the stuff was a damned nuisance it had to be peeled off when he was done with it and in hot weather it itched but it was the only way he could keep from being recognized hed better warn her about the food and drink in the broken arms though before they entered what passed for its door there were some things even kerens famously iron stomach could not digest safely perhaps i should lure those whom i suspect there and buy them meals after a single bite i would have the truth out of them in no time selenay chased the last of her servants out and closed the door to her bedchamber even though she hadnt the least intention of going to sleep it had been a long day and unfortunately it had also been a very dull one it had not helped that every moment of it she had been poignantly aware that just outside the palace walls virtually every creature of court and collegiawith the possible exceptions of the two scamps whod broken the salle mirrorwas taking the time to have some winter fun in the heavy snow even the oldest of codgers was out there standing by one of the braziers watching the younger folk skate or stage snowball fights it made her feel very forlorn it had also made her miss her father very much sendar had loved the winter had he still been alive hed not only have chased her out to play hed have contrived a way to join her at night during a full moon hed have huge bonfires in the gardens and serve ice wine to the skaters he was always the first one to inaugurate a sled run and as he said so often royal dignity be damned she bundled up in a furlined robe over her nightdress and took a book to the window seat in her bedroom though she had no intention of reading it instead she rubbed a clear patch through the frost on a windowpane with her sleeve and looked out over the gardens the moon was just up shining through the branches of the trees as if it had been trapped there it was just a halfmoon with a little haze around it and a faint golden cast to its face light from other windows in the palace made golden rectangles on the surface of the snow beneath with the occasional shadow passing across them as she watched she had retired early tonight but life in the rest of the palace went on as usual even as she watched she heard a giggle from outside and a vaguely feminine form bundled up in a cloak and hood ran across the snow followed by a second then a third scudding across the white snow like clouds across the moon three of the young ladies of the court out for a moonlight frolic were they meeting young men or just having some girlfun slipping out to skate on the frozen ponds by moonlight or were they servants or even trainees they couldnt be heraldic trainees for the cloaks had been too dark to be grays but they could be bardic or healer trainees perhaps not healers who tended to be very serious indeed and not likely to be out for a moonlit frolic in the snow but bardic perhaps or evenwell no probably not three of the commonborn female blues either the ones who got into the collegia on merit those young ladies fewer than the males by far tended to be even more serious than the healer trainees spending their evenings in study except for taking the rare night off to go to the compass rose their positions were hardwon many of them had come here over parental opposition and they were not going to hazard what theyd gained by frittering it away selenay sighed feeling a wistful kinship to that handful of young women she was in a very similar position or at least it seemed that way to her she and they were prisoners to their duty and their responsibilities except that they were selfimprisoned she was bound by blood and rank as well as duty surely selfimposed bonds were less galling than ones imposed from the outside she sighed again more deeply and rested her chin in her hand and wondered what it would be like to be ordinary that rather depends on what it is that you mean by ordinary caryo replied an ordinary herald for instance i suppose she replied unable to even think of what her life would be like without caryo youve had some taste of it when you accompanied herald mirilin down to the city courts in haven caryo reminded her the real difference between you and the other heralds is thatyou can never escape being queen and they can sometimes escape being heralds for a candlemark or two exactly selenay was relieved that caryo hadnt started in on a lecture about how she should be grateful that there were hundreds of young women in her kingdom who had gone to bed hungry and would wake up with no better prospect of breakfast than theyd had of supper that there were young women who had done extremely unpleasant things in order to get a supper or a bed and would do the same tomorrow she knew that knew that very well no matter how much talamir and alberich tried to shelter her from it she also knew that there wasnt anything much she could do about it with the limited resources at her behest she knew that children went to bed hungry and cold or even curled up in a doorway without a bed at all she was doing what she could about that with what she hadthe mandatory schooling was a help as were the queens bread meals shed managed to get instituted so that at least every child had one meal in a day that it could count on but never mind that now she was just grateful that caryo understood of course i understand the wild songbird thats had its wings clipped and been clapped in a cage doesnt feel much like trilling no matter how comfortable the cage is nor how good the food in its cup she felt her throat close a little and blinked back the urge to cryshe was tired of weeping tired of feeling sad and beaten and alone that was a pretty accurate summing up and no matter where she looked it seemed that someone around her was trying to install yet another set of bars she wanted some fun again she wanted to be irresponsible for just a little while she wanted to tell the council the courtiers the petitioners to just wait for a candlemark or two while she went skating and sledding it felt almost as if she was being punished and not only had she done nothing to deserve being punished shed done everything she was supposed to be doing she didnt remember her father being so hedged about wait a moment she blinked and ran through that thought again i dont remember father being so hedged about that he couldnt take a candlemark or two but the councilors would be furious there were so many things they wanted her to attend to it often seemed that they even begrudged her the time she took to eat and sleep just who is the monarch here anyway me or them are people going to die because i take a little time to relax and have some fun exactly so caryo agreed calmly it would be one thing entirely if you neglected your duties to spend all of your time in pleasure and games but since the moment the crown was put on your head the most youve stolen was a candlemark or two at bedtime to read but how do i she began then stopped thinking back to her father all right sendard had the authority to simply stop everything and say im going out for suchandsuch she didnt so ill have to schedule it wont i better still decree it in such a way that it becomes a dutyin their eyesto take some pleasure and as she tried to work out how she could decree a few candlemarks off to go skating caryo added helpfully there is a cold spella very cold spellon the way its already frozen the verges of evendim out to almost a furlong from the shore itll freeze the terilee solid and it should last for a fortnight at the least she blinked she could barely remember the last time the terilee had frozen solid and when it had i declare an ice festival she hazarded announce there will be one if the terilee freezes and make the announcement public caryo agreed your councilors willbe so certain it wont that theyll just smile and ignore the decree then when it does itll be all over the city and they wont be able to cancel it butwhat does one do leave that to the merchants for the most part caryo said wisely once you make the decree theyll do exactly what they do for a midwinter fair except that theyll prepare to set the booths and tents up on the ice and you know merchants being merchants if you dont decree a festival theyll do this anyway at least by making a royal occasion out of it you can set a time limit on it all you need to do is send someone to rummage through the attics for some prizes for skating contests and other competitions and arrange for a royal pavilion out there with some provisions and cooks for the highborn and talk to the deans perhaps the young bardic trainees could perform gratis certainly there should be at least one day off from classes the more she thought about it the more excited she became but what if the ice starts to break just find some people that know ice to be ice wardens if it starts to break up therell be plenty of warning competitions there ought to be skating races of course short and long perhaps something for trick skating a prize for the best ballad on a winter theme one for the best spiced cider and mulled wine and hot meat pie caryo said with a mental shudder there are so many wretched hot pies any encouragement to make them better would be a boon to your people ice fishing there should be a prize for the biggest fish caught ice fishing one and twohorse sledding races that was just about all she could fit in a single day she thought with regret and she wouldnt dare to take more than one day off herself so have all of the elimination contests before the royalday caryo advised that way there will be some real anticipation building up and you wont have to taste more than five or six final entries in the food and drink contests or listen to more than five or six ballads on the subject of winter and end with a feast and entertainments by moonlight on the ice with the feasting supplied by the crown caryo said have a royal ball at the pavilion to coincide with the common feast it will be very romantic some of your young ladies have been trying to get their young men to come to the question since you were crowned and if this doesnt do it nothing will she thought of those giggling girls out in the snow and sighed wistfully the last year of the tedrel wars had put paid to a great many romances and placed obstacles in the paths of many more young men who had survived that last battle had sometimes not had the heart for much after what they had been through she could certainly understand their frustration not that she had anyone she wished would come to the question with her far from it no she wished mostly that for once a courtship didnt consist of her council shoving names and portraits at her it would be so nice to listen to poetry even bad poetry about the beauty of her eyes it would be wonderful to listen to stammered clumsy compliments in the moonlight and to pull away from an attempted kiss at the last possible and most coquettish moment was it so wrong of her to hanker after romance to long for a circle of adoring young men who didnt adore the crown rather than the girl oh she knew that most young women of her court went off to arranged marriages rather than romantic ones but still they usually werent bartered off to the highest bidder like prize cattle they usually had some choice in the matter well she had one choice she supposed she could always say no they could badger her and nag her but they couldnt force her to marry anyone think about your festival caryo advised youve taken all the steps you need to about the marriage plans think about something pleasant but would talamir and alberich approve they were in charge of her safety after all alberich has already supposed that you were going to do just this and has been making his own plans caryo said instantly or so kantor fells me what her head came up like a hound suddenly sniffing something it did not expect on the breeze but how partly knowing you partly knowing you need some pleasure in your life about now but mostly i suspect that foresight of his giving him a nudge in the right direction it doesnt always have to be a disaster that he foresees and when it isnthe probably doesnt realize that its foresight well that made perfect sense to her and it was comforting knowing that someone she trusted as much as she trusted alberich thought this was a good idea oh yes for the people as much as for you theres been too much sadness when you mourn for too long you start to forget how to feel joy she bent her head at those words feeling sadness overcome her again for a moment and felt caryo sighing with her that struck to the heart of the matter and had been something she had not felt comfortable voicing aloud it had felt somehow disloyal to her fathers memory to be weary of weeping for him and yet how many tears could she should she shed so alberich who had been as loyal to sendar as anyone could have asked felt she was ready and valdemar was ready to let go and move on perhaps she didnt need to feel guilty then but talamir rolan says that talamir will have no problem with this well she wouldnt expect talamir to participate it would be unkind she wouldnt really need the queens own for something like this just some good bodyguards alas she wished she could have done without those as well but probably the monarchs of valdemar hadnt been able to do without bodyguards sincewell for as long as she could think certainly as long as there had been difficulties with karse so there was one good thing if she had to have bodyguards they could at least be people she knew would be able to enjoy the festival with her heh kantor said just as alberich was choosing a book to read by his fire before going to bedi doubt that youre going to be surprised at this caryo has just told me that selenay has decided to hold that ice festival he settled down in his favorite chair and adjusted the lamp behind him so that the light fell properly on the page his window had an interesting look to it with the light falling on it rather than through it rather like colored stone set in a mosaic no doubt the glassmaster had considered this as well when hed chosen the glass and the colors he hoped no one would ever take a shot at him from the other side of it getting those colors matched would be impossible hed probably have to have the whole thing made again at least it would take less time to craft a new window than that blasted mirror good he said firmly it will be good for her and good for haven but well need to slip it past the councilors so tell caryo to suggest that selenay wait until shes holding public audience then make a decree tomorrow that if the terilee freezes solid there will be the festival what difference will that make kantor asked alberich sipped his hot wine first the decree will be in public which will make it more difficult for the councilors to object secondly theyll applaud this in public as being a grand gesture and think in private that its about as likely as pigs flying then since the decree will have been posted all over the city when the river does freeze solid it will be too late for them to do anything about forbidding any such festivities he was rather pleased with this he wanted selenay to have a victory without having to fight for it the more of those she got the more her councilors would become accustomed to the idea that she was the queen and was a ruler sooner or later she was either going to have to rule in truth or become the mouthpiece for her council a figurehead but not a leader the sad part was he could see even the heralds who were on her council gently maneuvering her into that role all the while telling themselves that it was for her own good that she was still too young to take the burden of the crown that they would just guide her it was always easier to hold power than to give it up that was how the son of the sun and his strongest priests had come to rule karse and look where that had gotten them kantor seemed to be following his thoughts good idea ill tell caryo and after a moment who do you want for selenays bodyguards i doubt shell be able to take more than a day away from her duties but shell need guards when she does bodyguards someone out there was trying to cause trouble over selenays rule and even if he was doing it as a distraction it was still possible that his words would find fertile ground in some poisoned mind and bear unexpected fruit maybe she wasnt in quite as much danger as she had been during the tedrel wars but maybe she was he was in charge of her safety he could not take the chance so that meant very good bodyguards all over again good question who he should assign assuming that the collegia would be taking a full set of holidays the various teachers and their assistants wouldnt be needed up here but the royal guard would in its full strength both at the palace and at the festival they would be busy keeping watch over all the highborn he needed someone watching over selenay and only selenay might as well make it keren and ylsa for the daylight hours he gave some more thought to what this festival should involve for lowborn and high as well i suppose shell have a feast and entertainment for the highborn in a pavilion on the ice the same evening that she attends the games or should i say there will be two feasts one for the common folk and one for the court and i mean all of the highborn as many as can come at short notice in winter it would be good for building loyalty kantor was taken by surprise by that question i dont think shed even considered a court feast for the entire roster of the highborn throughout the kingdom but its a good idea a very good idea ill pass it on alberich felt a certain amusement that he born poorest of the poor and bastard to boot should be the one to be making suggestions about what the great and grand would find appropriate still hed been raised on tales of it after all virtually every child had and hed been watching this court for years now a grand feast for the court will help lighten things considerably midwinter was shadowed the first one without sendar and selenay still in mourning i dont think anyone had the heart for it but this wont have any memories any connotations its the sort of thing that ought to make the councilors happy with the whole idea since theyll be able to haul in all their socalled eligible candidates for her hand and hope that one of them charms her he added that last with just a touch of sourness sourness because truth to tell it annoyed him to see these supposedly sensible men trying to force the poor young woman into a destiny of their choosing and because they were wasting so much time and effort on the project time and effort that could be going to some task more useful if they would put half the concentration they put into working together that they put into finding a mate for the queen three quarters of the current difficulties besetting the kingdom would vanish overnight and for just a little while it was a relief to think about something other than plots and intrigues he had never been very comfortable in dealing with plots and intrigues except for his singular talent of being quiet and unreadable he was better at it now but that didnt mean he enjoyed it well except for the occasions when he had an excuse to let off some of his tension by breaking a few heads hmm this festival just might give him a chance at that form of relief he quickly sealed that thought away from kantor she can be impartially charming right back to any wouldbe suitor without giving any of them hope kantor agreed i wish that more of them were worth being charming to so do i the fact that so many potential mates had been systematically disqualified by selenay in public meant that anyone who was dredged up and hauled in for the ice festival was bound to be marginal at best unsuitable in the extreme unless some distant cousin out of the back of beyond happened to get dragged out of his manor chosen on the spot and proved to be the man of selenays dreams if she even had any dreams on the subject it was hard for alberich to tell selenays mind was often opaque to him he didnt have a great deal of experience with young women come to that he didnt have a great deal of experience with women in general and whatever suitors are hauled in will probably be stonedeaf and ninety at worst kantor sighed poor selenay it will be a shabby lot of dancing partners shell be getting another aspect that hadnt occurred to him with things so subdued at midwinter she hadnt seemed to want any dancing the selenay he remembered had loved dancing well maybe he could do something about that i think at an occasion like an ice festival she ought to dance every other dance with a herald dont you he asked kantor in fact isnt there some sort of mandate about that somewhere so that no highborn can claim two dances with her in an evening if there is myste can find it kantor replied with a chuckle and if there isnt myste can still find it he replied thinking with real pleasure of how myste and selenay together had foiled the entire council plan to get her safely betrothed to someone of their choice it had been a thing of beauty according to myste he was just glad that he had kept himself out of it so that when hed been asked hed been able to truthfully disclaim any knowledge of it all not that hed wanted to be anywhere near the room at the time the entire thing unfolded whenever certain members of the council were thwarted they always looked at the karsite as the source of their troubles funny they suspected his hand behind even this without his being anywhere near the council chamber that day theyd entirely overlooked myste im not entirely certain about all those crosscousin links myste was finding surely the highborn of valdemar arent that closely inbred chosen you dont think herald myste would concoct information do you kantor asked pretending to be aghast at the thought youre forgetting she was a clerk before she was a herald he replied they spend a quarter of their lives writing things down a quarter finding what other people have written down a quarter in hiding what was written down and a quarter in making sure if it should have been written down and wasnt it is now kantor had no real reply for that but alberich didnt really expect one and no in the case of something important he really did not think that myste would stoop to forgery but in the case of something like this where nothing was hanging on a little judicious creativity but selenays alltoorare pleasure myste could and would unbend her rigid ethics in order to ensure that the tradition existed even if it hadnt been a tradition until a few moments ago when hed thought of it apparently kantor agreed consider it a tradition thats been in place for centuries you know myste is very good at aging documents well she had to be she had to know how to forge them in order to detect forgeries and it wasnt as if shed be doing anything really unethical like forging the great royal seal she could just insert it in a list of protocol from the last ice festival hand it to the seneschal as the guide to how he should conduct the feast at the end and no one would be the wiser and selenay would get dancing partners that she could relax with in fact hed handpick them or rather hed handpick them after consulting with someone who knew which heralds were adequate dancers which reminded him of something else dont the wretches generally sneak off to some private heraldsonly party as soon as they can when there is an enormous fete like this one he demanded recalling that they had done just such a thing at selenays coronation um kantor began with overtones of guilt well not this time and that is an order and have talamir enforce it he said firmly not until selenay is ready to leave by vkandis crown if she doesnt get to enjoy most of this affair itll be no fault of mine and it wont be for lack of good company friends among the rest as well as dancing partners yes sir kantor replied for once with no hint of mockery or irony whatsoever in his mindvoice hmph he settled into his book with a feeling of satisfaction as kantor and the other companionsand whatever heralds would be involved in the plotcoordinated themselves myste talamir the seneschals herald presumably those here at the collegium who were young enough to make decent conversation with her good dancers or both and he wouldnt have to worry about a herald as a risk to her safety either not that it was likely that anyone would try anything in so great a throng but grand something else to worry about what about kantor interrupted his pretense at reading if we concoct another point of protocol that any finalyear trainee of appropriate age and gender can serve as the queens dance partner he thought about that for a moment it would effectively double the number of young faces at the occasion and what was more they would be people selenay already knew and would feel comfortable around it wasnt that long ago that shed been a trainee herself perfectly reasonable while were at it throw the doors open for the bards and healers as well no reason why they cant be included every reason why they should be and bards and healers were just as trustworthy as heralds with any luck there would be so many of them that no one else would even get a chance at taking a dance with selenay he felt kantors approval good bards make better dancers anyway and once again he sensed kantors withdrawal he felt himself smiling there was something to be said for this particular kind and purpose of conspiracy it made everyone who was involved in it feel good and it got their minds moving in directions that had been sadly unfamiliar for far too long poor selenay had been spending the last six moons and more thinking only of the welfare of those around her and dependent on her it was about time that they all returned the favor if keren and ylsa are going to be her bodyguardsshouldnt she have an official escort kantor said coming back from wherever hed been good god another sticking point another point of vulnerability not one of the suitorsoh no that would be opening the door to all sorts of potential trouble and danger but who since this is a festival what about a bard he asked thinking about all the really handsomelooking bards hed seen in and around the collegia besides with a bard around you never lack for conversation its their job to be witty good idea then she cant be accused of favoritism for the heralds but she wont be stuck with one of the suitors kantor vanished again and alberich was left alone with his book he might even manage to get a page or two read in between thinking of yet more security holes and coming up with schemes to block them while she was up here behind her walls she was secure but down there for the gods sake out on a solid sheet of ice but her people love her even down there in the worst part of haven there was anger when that whore tried to make trouble he had to take comfort in that had to remember that this was not karse and selenay could move among her people without fear most of them anyway he sighed and put down the book no point in trying to read now it was time to start making some lists or his mind would be buzzing and hed get no sleep at all this night when do you sleep infrequently he sighed and fetched a pen and paper clear sky of a brilliant cloudless blue and it was cold enough to freeze thewell it was colder than alberich had ever been without also being wet clear through it got cold in karse but never quite like this a dry biting cold that didnt penetrate so much as stab he was grateful for the extra pairs of socks he was wearing as well as for the peculiar contraptions that keren had cobbled up for everyone at the collegium leather straps with five or six tacks in them that you could strap on over your boots to give you traction on the ice she said that people used them for icefishing on lake evendim well he would take her word for it because if it was cold enough to freeze that lake this thick every winter he never wanted to go there hed never learned to ice skate and at this point in his life he was a bit dubious about the odds of his success if he started so it was a good thing he had these socalled ice cleats on his feet they kept him from measuring his length on the slippery river ice more than once he just wished there was something for sun glare off of ice and snow that made him wear a squint that was beginning to feel permanent he had his hood up and a hat on top of it to shade his eyes but that did nothing for the reflected glare it was also beginning to give him a headache still this ice festival was something to be seen and worth the cold and the rest of it he didnt often get out during the day down in haven in one of his disguises and for once he wasnt even down here on business whoever the jolly lad had been whod been paying for people to foment dissension over the queen evidently getting his hireling arrested had frightened him off not a rumor not a sign not a breath of trouble had there been since then talamir reckoned that the whole scheme had been hatched up to create a distraction at some pointand that the hatcher of said plot had gotten cold feet when his agent had been unmasked maybe maybe notbut thanks to the festival selenays star was very high with the common folk and grumbling was going to get someones head broken and that would quickly bring the city guard and constables which meant that alberichs job was being done for him at least in part soif this excursion intended so that alberich could listen to people talking spend some time in and around the places where liquor flowed freest and tongues were loosest wasnt entirely pleasure it wasnt entirely business either as he traveled with the flow of the crowd down the improvised street of booths that had been built on the solid ice of the terilee he was covertly watching the reactions of those around him to his current guise this costume represented more of a middling class of working man someone who was unlike many of his personae not a particularly dangerous fellow and he wanted to make sure he had the nuances down the last thing he needed to do was to alert people when what he wanted was for them to be careless and at their ease around him normally he would have worn a clever cosmetic paste that covered his scars but that wouldnt pass muster in the daylight fortunately it didnt have to not when he and almost all of the other people down here had their faces wrapped in scarves against the cold he was experimenting with false beards and other facial hair but those didnt stick too well in the cold that meant a lot of work on his part moving easily schooling his eyes and eyebrows into a vacantly pleasant expression people reacted to the language of body and expression without even realizing that they were doing so he knew very well how to read those things now hed been good as an officer but now thanks to no end of schooling he was very very good that instruction had been not only at the hands of his mentor dethor but with the help of jadus who before becoming a herald had been a trainee of bardic collegium where the trainees were taught drama and acting as part of the curriculum it had taken him years to get to this point where he was willing to try going about among the middle classes attempting to be unnoticed he thought judging by the way that he was jostled shoved and occasionally grumbled at that he was succeeding none of his bullyboy personae would have been blundered into like this the folks of the daylight hours would have taken one look at him and given him a wide berth assuming they didnt report him to the city guard as a suspicious person it was too bad he couldnt find a thief especially a pickpocket to teach him how to blend in if there was one person whose very life depended on blending in it was a petty thief hed been on the lookout for those just to keep his hand in at spotting them but oddly enough he hadnt seen any possibly that was because they were keeping to the nighttime hours in order to work the crowd in more safety but possibly the issue was that they were no better on the ice than he was if you had to run for itwell you couldnt run for it if i was a petty thief kantor observed i would work thebooths on the bank and stick to the nighttime a couple of hours past sunset and its not only dark enough to make a good getaway people are a lot drunker than they are now glad you arent out here alberich asked profoundly i shudder to think of me on the ice keren hasnt yet come up with cleats for us and neither has the blacksmith managed shoes that will work out there kantor did not mention how much he disliked the cold that was a given alberich had taken pity on him and hadnt even ridden him down to the bell today hed borrowed an ordinary horse from the palace stables alberich snugged the hood down around his ears adjusted the scarf and pulled the floppy felt hat down tighter there was another thing to feel grateful for and that was the quality of his costume the good thick homespun wool with the oldfashioned hood was better than anything that the young bucks were sporting out here and his clumsylooking boots had room for three pairs of socks in there as he had predicted the councilors had thought the idea of the river freezing solid enough to hold the ice festival extremely amusing when selenay brought up the idea before them they ignored it in council and chuckled as she issued the proclamation in front of the court well the ones that werent heralds did anyway the heralds already knew it was going to happen but nothing would have convinced the councilors of that the news got down into haven and with a feeling of anticipation people began making quiet preparations then the cold wave rolled in silently at night and everyone woke to find ice in the water jugs on their bedside tables ice so thick on the glass of windows that you couldnt see out and down along the river reports that it was frozen over and all of the townspeople who had of course been certain that anything the queen made a proclamation about would come to pass had sent watermen out to test the thickness of the ice daily it had taken three days until everyone was certain that it was strong enough for the festivities no one wanted accidents however much they wanted a holiday then overnight an entire fair sprang up with the more timid arraying their tents on the banks and the bolder setting up right on the ice predictably the merchants on the ice were heavily weighted in favor of hot food and drink stalls while the ones on the banks featured fairings and other goods the midwinter fairs not only in haven but all around the countryside had been something of a failure for the weather had been bleak and no one had had much heart for frivolity this was going to more than make up for it if the merchants had any say in the matter there were stalls doing a brisk business in crude skates basic wooden blades with simple straps to hold them to the soles of the shoes they could be made for you right there on the spot and fitted to your shoes or boots there were several more booths set up to wax or smooth the blades then there was a knife grinder whod set up to sharpen the blades of good steel skates those were blacksmithmade of course no one in the crowd that alberich was moving in now could afford such things those with the money for steel skates who hadnt already gotten a pair were queuing up to get theirs though and the blacksmith whod had blades going abegging at midwinter was getting double the price for them now there were two kinds you could get the ones that strapped on as the wooden skates did or if you really had money to spare you could bring the blacksmith a pair of your boots or shoes and hed fasten the blades permanently to the soles anyone with those though was someone dedicated to the sport a kind of protocol had sprung up in the first day of the festival about who got what part of the ice since there were both skaters and walkers among the booths skaters got the middle of the lane and those who were slipping and staggering about on their own shoes kept to the sides the lane had been laid out wide enough that there was room for both though occasionally a skater would go careening into the crowd and the walkers would curse and try to cuff the skater most of the time people took it in good part and if they saw someone skidding toward them they often did their part to rescue him before he cracked his skull the contests had begun as soon as the booths were set up informal races at first which soon weeded out those whose bravado exceeded their skill by the time that the palace had sent down real judges the wouldbe competitors had been winnowed down to a manageable number there had been those whose skill exceeded the limits of their equipment but selenay had a good plan to take care of that shed ordered preliminary races and games among those with the cheap wooden blades only and the winners of those got steel skatesstill of the strapon sort but made stoutly and of good steelas prizes that put the competition on something like a level field when the real contests started the booths began at the largest bridge across the river where there were steps built into the banks the racecourse began and ended where the booths did going upriver for a set distance carefully marked on both riverbanks then returning anyone who cared to come to the bank along the race route could see the races some enterprising souls along the bank were renting their rooms for the final day of racing so that people could watch in comparative comfort alberich couldnt quite see the point of thatbeing crowded up to a window that gave you less of a view than the worst spot on the bank itselfbut then from what he was hearing there would be so much in the way of drinking and carousing going on in those rooms that no one would be paying much attention to the races anyway then there were the competitions in trick skating being held in a particularly smooth section real seats had been set up there and there were contests in jumping over barrels fancy skating in singles and pairs and sprint racing when the trick skaters werent performing or competing someone had come up with a strange game involving two teams of eight men each armed with brooms a ball and two goals there didnt seem to be many rules except that the participants evidently needed to be drunk enough not to care when they fell down or crashed together but not so drunk they couldnt manage to play fights frequently broke out but no one got seriously hurt as far as alberich had been able to tell there were black eyes a few lost teeth and broken brooms but no broken bones perhaps that was due at least in part to all the padding that the players wore in the way of extra clothing the games tended to have no set duration lasting either until everyone was too tired to go on or the fancy skaters wanted to use the ice again and got the guard to chase the gamers off whereupon the gamers would pick up their goalsmade of eel trapsand move to rougher ice until the good patch was free again to alberichs inexperienced eyes the game looked something like a game played on ponyback by some of the hill shepherds who had allegedly got it from the shinain there werent any prizes for the broomball game so the people playing it were doing so purely for the sheer enjoyment of the mayhem they were engaging in and perhaps for the hot wine and mulled ale that their supporters brought out for them whenever they took a break it never failed to amaze alberich how much effort some people would go to for a free drink skating competitions werent the only ones that had been announced ice and snow sculptors had been hard at work too with their creations ranged wherever the artists fancy had chosen to put them with the traffic left to deal with them alberich had never considered ice as a sculptural material before and hed never seen anything made of snow other than a childs snowman but these pieces were quite astonishing and he thought that it would be a pity when they finally melted there was one entire snow castle with blocks of ice for windows and furniture made of ice and snow and a clever tavernkeeper inside selling ice wine in glasses made of ice some people were said to be paying him for the privilege of sleeping on the ice beds but to alberichs mind that was going more than a bit too far for novelty still the place was pretty at night with light from colored lanterns making the walls glow from within probably the most popular places of all were the warming tents prudently set on the riverbank where braziers of coals kept the worst of the cold at bay and allowed frozen feet and hands to thaw out sellers of hot wine and hot pies provided the tents and the benches inside the crown supplied the fuel a gesture of good will that was much appreciated for otherwise it would have cost something to be admitted so even someone without the penny for a pie could get warmed up and if you were clever you brought your own drink in a metal can and your own pies from home to warm at the brazier the pies themselves were something new to alberichnot that hed never seen them before but in this cold they served a new and dual purpose the pie itself served as a handwarmer in fact most people made or bought sturdy offerings with a hard crust that could stand a great deal of abuse wrapped them in a scrap of cloth as soon as they came right out of the oven and tucked them into pockets and muffs to act as a heat source until the owner got hungry by that time the pie would probably have suffered enough that the owner could gnaw through the tough crust without losing a toothand if it had gotten too cold you could always rewarm the thing without worrying too much about it or as one old fellow said to alberich wi my wifes cookin a little char improves the flavor and the pies were as universal as the snow and ice even for the denizens of the collegia if they presented themselves to the collegia cooks before coming down the trainees were given pies as well for the same dual purpose but nothing like the common sort which could have stood duty as paving stones alberich had one in each pocket right now as a matter of fact providing a comforting source of heat for both hands you know that might be another reason why there are so few pickpockets kantor said your purse is somewhere inside your coat or your cloak and hard to get at your pockets are full of pies of a dubious nature besides testing his disguise a matter of curiosity had brought alberich down here today the dean of bardic collegium had intercepted him yesterday to tell him that she thought she knew where the two mirror breakers had gotten their mad ideas for gymnastic fighting her information had brought him down to the booths at the bridge end where as part of the festival a troupe of players had set up a tent to display their talent there werent many of thoseit was to be honest too cold for anything but unaccompanied singers to be performing outofdoors and as for the sort of acrobats and dancers that plied their trade at fairs theyd be risking their skins to bounce about in their usual skimpy attire this set of players however usually performed several times in a week at one of the bigger inns off the trade road theyd moved to this venue just for the festival and as alberich neared the canvas walls that held their makeshift theater he saw that the move must have been very profitable for them he joined the end of a longish line just forming up for the afternoon performance with some interest well tent was something of a misnomer he discovered as he got to the entrance paid his entry fee and filed inside with the rest only the area over the back half of the stage was roofed over and curtained the rest was simply canvas walls to prevent the show from being viewed by those who had not paid with an overhead scaffolding of rigging for stage effects and nighttime lighting reaching out into the area of the audience crude benches in rows fronting the stage were supplied to the public and the show must have been popular for the tent was half full when alberich arrived and by the time of the show the benches were packed and so was the standingroom area along the walls the drama was calledor so the banners outside proclaimedthe unknown heir the banners could have fit any one of a hundred standard stories and probably served for every play these actors ever put on they looked superficially new but alberich could tell that theyd been freshly touched up just for the festival the audience was ready to be entertained and when the back curtains finally parted and a single actor took the stage they erupted in cheers that must have gladdened his heart alberich sat back on his bench arms folded under his cloak and prepared to see just what it was that had corrupted two trainees first came the declamation of the prologue the plot what there was of it concerned a highborn child stolen from his cradle and sold to slavers subsequently bought or rescued the prologue was rather unclear on the subject by a troupe of poor but noble actors and raised by them to adulthood all of this was laid out in a spirited fashion by that single actor before any of the real action took place alberich had to admit that the fellow knew what he was doing he had the right mix of flamboyance and humor to keep the audiences attention he finished his piece gave an elaborate bow and retired to great applause then the curtains parted on a sylvan glade represented by two rather sad little trees in pots and a painted backdrop against which marched the troupe portraying the actors on their way from one town to the next the real action opened immediately with the unknown heir and his adoptive family being attacked by bandits and the heir proceeding to singlehandedly acrobatically drive the bandits off but not before the bandits had managed to mortally wound the heirs adoptive fatherthough how they got a knife blade through the four or five layers of costume he was wearing was beyond alberichs comprehension this worthy managed an amazingly long setpiece while dying in his sons arms he explained the young mans circumstances presumed highborn heritage and handed over the medallion the child had inexplicably still been wearing even though it was solid gold when taken from the hands of his kidnappers it was an astonishing monologue especially from the lips of someone stabbed through the heart quite some time ago none of this evidently stretched the credulity of most of the audience with tears and histrionics the heir proclaimed that he would regain his rightful place and wreak revenge for his fathers death riotous applause called up many bows from the actors before the action resumed the rest of the play consisted of one improbable fight scene after another taking advantage of the acrobatic abilities ofalberich guessedroughly four of the actors in question and there was no doubt in his mind before the first act was over that this was indeed where the two miscreants had gotten their misguided ideas and given the wild applause that these bizarre fights managed to garner he was a lot less surprised that the boys had become enamored of the idea of fighting like that as the heir and his best friendboth in love with the same girl of coursebattled their way through throngs of evil henchmen attempting to keep them from claiming the heirs rightful place as the duke of dorking alberich had to admire their stamina if not their style in the conclusion to the first act the heir plummeted off the top of a cliff to flatten half a dozen evildoers then engaged four at once swordtosword and after being disarmed defeated his enemies with a bucket in the second act the heir and the friend ambushed in a peasant hovel made the most creative use of a ladder a table and a stool that alberich had ever seen in fact what they most closely resembled was not a pair of fighters at all but a pair of ferrets trying not to be caught in the third act the best friend met the end that alberich had expected from the first after yet another acrobatic exhibition dying in the arms of the heir and bravely commending the heir and the girl to one another with the heir vowing revenge once again you know kantor commented id steer clear of that man people trying to kill him seem to keep missing and hitting his friends instead but it was in the fourth act that something entirely unexpected happened and it had nothing to do with the script now alberich had noticed something a bit odd just before the play began in the front benches just off to one side was a group of young men in clothing far finer than anyone else here was wearing when the action started he quite expected them to begin jeering and catcalling but to his surprise they did nothing of the sort in fact they were quiet and attentive to a degree all out of keeping with the quality of the drama unfolding and it wasnt as if they werent used to better fare either he recognized two of them from having seen them moving in the fringes of selenays court now that was odd so odd in fact that he felt a tingle of warning and kept his eye on them all during the play then came the fourth act and the grand climax and exhibition of swordplay with astonishing feats of strength and skill never before seen on any stage which was laid in the grand hall of the duke of dorkings castle the heirs enemies held both the heirs real parents and his true love captive and were engaging in a spot of gloating and the heir swung in over the heads of the front of the audience on a rope alberich had to give them credit it was a spectacular entrance not a very bright one for a real fighter since while the heir was swinging about on a rope he was an easy target for anyone with a knife crossbow spear or lance all of which were in evidence among his enemiesbut it was a spectacular entrance the heir let go the rope did a triple somersault in the air hit the stage and came up fighting no mistaking that move which was one the boys had tried in vain to copy the actor might be a phony fighter but he was a superb athlete and tumbler there was more of the same wildly unrealistic combat and alberich noted in passing that the actor who had been playing the best friend was now with the assistance of a beard playing the chief villain and then then came the break with everything alberich had expected if he hadnt been watching so closelyand watching the audience in particular his lot of young nobleshe might have thought it an accident but in the middle of the duel with the chief villain a propsword went clattering across the stage right under the lead actors feet he apparently stepped on it because the next thing that happened was that his right foot shot out from under him he staggered and tried to catch his balance and then he went blundering right over the edge of the stage and down onto the audience in the first rowlanding atop the same young highborn that alberich had noticedto the gasps and shrieks of the crowd but all was not as it seemed the thing was someone as good a tumbler as that actor was shouldnt have gone off the edge of the stage at all what was more he hadnt stepped on or tripped over the sword no as alberich saw just before he surged to his feet along with the rest of the audience the actor had actually kicked it off to the side before making that spectacular fall furthermore the young men hed landed among had been tensed and ready to catch him if hed really fallen by accident theyd have scattered instinctively away from his path not gathered under him broken his fall and set him down he was up in a trice as the audience applauded bowing to them apologizing to his victims even brushing one of them off which was when alberich distinctly saw a folded set of papers pass from the actor to the young highborn man vanishing inside the latters cloak before he could blink great gods kantor exclaimed as alberich struggled to keep his expression precisely like that of everyone else around him what in the nine hells i dont know alberich said as the actor got back up on the stage and resumed the play but i am going to find out and i do not know who it was alberich told talamir feet stretched out toward the fire in talamirs somewhat austere chamber he had come here directly from the festival so directly that he hadnt even had a chance to properly thaw out though he had stopped long enough to change out of his disguise at the bell but kantor had warned rolan that alberich needed to speak to talamir who had in his turn informed talamir that alberich was coming and was in serious need of defrosting and talamir had arranged for hot drinks and a wellstoked fire as well as getting free long enough for this quick meeting a young man youve seen in the court no one you clearly recognized talamir frowned i wish the young people were a little more distinctive or at least wore the same badges they put on their retainers livery your description doesnt resonate with me either alberich shrugged that being the case until i discover i am going to have to spend more time around the court than it is usual most probably it is you who shall have to identify him for me once his face i see i can do that certainly but what do you suppose was the meaning of this talamir asked leaning over to refill alberichs tankard alberich shifted a little and shrugged what it probably wasnt much more easily can i say than what it was alberich replied absently taking another drink and halfemptying the tankard again not an assignation do i think better ways there are of passing love notes than the midst of a play not contraband of the usual sort papers these were nothing more unless the contraband is too large to hand off and the papers were directions telling where it was talamir observed it could be something else lessthanlegal stolen goods perhaps a valuable horseorperhaps money to pay for it only papers alberich countered and what would the purpose be of the poorer actor paying the highborn rather than the reverse he shook his head no and i think not the papers were directions to something stolen which leavesinformation paid for by the highborn gotten by the actor sowhy the exchange in the midst of the play because our highborn fellow does not want to be seen making clandestine visits to a mere player talamir seemed very certain of that point someone like that would never come up the hill or be allowed even in the gates of one of the manors let me tell you there is nothing more certain about the great houses than access to them surely as an actor easy would it be to feign to be the servant alberich hazarded again talamir shook his head every servant in a great house will either have worked for the family for generations have come from the familys country property or have been personally vouched for by other servants every delivery person will be from a particular set of shops and will be known to the servants even the folk who come to take off the trash are personally known to the servantswhat the highborn discard is picked over by dozens of lower servants before it gets to the bins outside and then the right to cart off what is left is jealously guarded hmm alberich blinked he hadnt known that well so much for ever trying to insinuate himself into a great house as a servant and the boy could not come to the actor in a more secret way hah talamir raised an eyebrow not where they are and people take note when they see someone richly dressed hanging about a common venue no matter how careful he was someone would see him unless of course he was as practiced in deception as you are which is highly unlikely and the resources have as well alberich reminded the older herald without the bell my movements could not possible be talamirs lips formed into a thin line the question is what information why and to whom is it going and does the crown have interest alberich added it could be we need do nothing about it it could be this is only to do with the rivalries among the titled talamir looked thoughtful as alberich put the empty tankard aside on a little table that stood between their chairs it could be i suppose he admitted but it seems a great deal of trouble to go to simply to acquire information about a rival and why the connection with a troupe of common players he shook his head no i dont like it i scent something else here alberich was willing to bow to his experience so you think it is something surely to do with a larger issue still it could signify only that someone has an interest and is not hostile or not the karsites are not our only enemies talamir looked pensive or it could be agents of a putative ally who wishes to learn more than weve told him in which casewe need to establish if there is any harm in letting him continue to operate alberich snorted at that allies can cause as much harm as enemies and are less suspected hmm there are times my suspicious friend when i am glad that you are who and what you are talamir replied after a long silence that had not occurred to me alberich shrugged i am what i am he replied in karse one keeps ones friends close and ones enemies closer and in karse suspicion is no bad thing talamir pinched the bridge of his nose and closed his eyes in a grimace let us start with the obvious you might as well add yourself to selenays bodyguards tomorrow the entire court will be down at the festival and ive no doubt that your mysterious young man will be in the midst of the throng youll have your best chance to spot him then and i can identify him for you that was a shortened version of youll show him to kantor wholl pass the image to rolan wholl show it to me and ill put a name to him alberich nodded but he wasnt happy hoped i had the crush to avoid he sighed he still wasnt comfortable rubbing elbows with the titled even when he was playing so invisible a part as that of a bodyguard well you cant talamir retorted with an unusual level of assertion i wont be around forever and it is well past the time when you began taking up the duty of spy within the court as well as down in haven if anything that made alberich even more uncomfortablebecause no matter what he did he couldnt take talamirs place within the circles of the court for one thing even if hed been valdemaran he wouldnt fit for another no one was ever likely to confide anything in him he just didnt have the face for it but he held his peace there were more ways of undoing a knot than splitting it with an ax there were heralds permanently assigned to the collegium who might serve as his eyes and ears among the highborn especially the women ylsa perhaps and there were trainees coming up who were highborn themselves who might be trusted to play clandestine agent my best i will ever do was all he said and he and the queens own got down to the business of trying to find other ways for alberich to set eyes on the young man in question againjust in case against all probability he did not show his face at the festival because in alberichs experience the thing that you planned for always turned out to be the one that was least likely to happenand the one that you had never thought of was the one that landed in your lap selenays day at her festival dawned cloudless bright and bonechillingly cold alberich and the others had planned on forgoing formal whites for the sake of warmth but the everresourceful seamstresses had provided the entire escort with heavy woolen capes lined and trimmed with white fur white fur mittens fur inside and out and heavy stockings trimmed at the top with fur which would make the boots look as if they had been lined and trimmed with fur as a result they all looked smartly turned out and entirely festive when they had all arrived to escort selenay down to the river one wag suggested that they ought to have their capes festooned with the same bridle bells as were on the companions parade tack a suggestion which had earned him a handful of snow down his back after that he kept his thoughts on costume to himself they made quite a little parade going through town fortunately no one had thought it necessary to make a real procession out of it though people were lining the streets waving and cheering the whole way i think your people love you your highness said one of lord orthallens hangerson patently hoping to curry favor for he still had his mouth open to continue with a compliment when selenay laughed i think they love the queens bread theyre getting today and the feast ive arranged for tonight she replied and alberich smothered a smile for this the final official day of the festival although people would probably stretch things out for as long as the ice held shed arranged for bread to be distributed in the morning until the supplies ran out and meat wine and bread for the same time as the court feast this evening if the fountains werent running with wine instead of water it was because it was too cold instead there would be hot wine available in huge cauldrons along the bank alongside fires where various beasts were roasting on spits and more of the bread that had been baked well in advance and stored cold although the notion of whole roasted oxen was a romantic one for practicalitys sake what was going to be offered was just about any beast that could be spitted and roasted and would provide enough meat to satisfy a portion of the crowd there were quite a few sheep for instance and a great many pigs domestic and wild selenay had been as generous as her purse would allow if anyone had seen these creatures alive he would have been well aware that they were all well not exactly prime most of them had come from the royal farms and were past breeding or working age still theyd been well tended all their lives and if they were going to provide somewhat tough eating well as one old man once told alberich forbye much chewin makes it last the longer and tough be tasty most of the people who would be swarming the fires didnt taste meat more than a few times in a year and it was almost never anything like beef or mutton and as for those who could afford better well they could take their purses and go buy it in fact the fires were already being set up for the cauldrons and the carcasses turning over their flames when they arrived at the river it occurred to alberich as the scent of roasting meat filled the air that the food merchants were not going to do badly out of this after all the meat wouldnt be ready for hours but people would be hungrier with the scent of it in their noses for all that he disliked the crush the sidelong glances the discomfort of his position as selenays shadow alberich could not begrudge the queen a single moment of her day of relative freedom all he had to do was to catch a glimpse of her face to know that she was enjoying herself for the first time inwell in far too long she was smiling a great deal even laughing and there was a glow on her that made her look more alive than she had in months it didnt take a mindhealer to know why either this day at her ice festival was perhaps the only time she had spent since her fathers death that wasnt shadowed with memories sendar had never presided over such an occasion guided only by old chronicles her friends and her own imagination this was something that selenay had created for herself it had taken alberich a little aback to see her smiling with special nailstudded shoes to give traction on the ice for the blacksmith had finally come up with something that worked as well as the ice cleats the queen her escort of heralds and their companions came down onto the rockhard river just about a candlemark after dawn to view the ice sculptures when a winner had been chosen and rewarded she went on to watch the childrens races and present medallions money and skates to the winners alberich enjoyed that the children were enthusiastic and excited without turning it into the cutthroat competition hed seen watching the preliminary races of the adults the losers were disappointed but consoled by the sweet cakes selenay passed out to all the competitors and the winners so bursting with joy that they could hardly contain themselves by midmorning she was ready to taste the three finalists in the meat pie the mulled ale the spiced cider and the hot and ice wine competitions then fortified she returned to the exhibition area for the fancy skating by this time alberich was both cold and frustrated for he hadnt yet seen the young highborn fellow hed been hoping to identify when selenay retired to the royal pavilion set up on the ice for a hot meal and a chance to catch her breath he left her in the guard of keren and ylsa and went prowling selenay never had her noon meal in the presence of her court by the time she had a chance for that respite she was generally sick to death of most of them and wanted nothing more than a little privacy to go along with her food she wasnt going to change that habit now so alberich had a good candlemark to roam about the royal enclosure to see what if anything could be seen there wasnt much just a few of the younger set who were already sportmad and some of the older ones who never missed a chance to hover in the presence of royalty and had done so even in sendars time alberich decided that he would have the best luck if he sidled in near the former and tried to eavesdrop on their conversation so he got a skewer of basted meat from one of the cooks serving up food alfresco and stood just behind a likely pair slowly eating and staring off at nothing in particular doing his best to be ignored jocastel may think hes clever taking the whole house for the day one of them sniffed but they shant see anything but the middle of the races well none of them will except for redric he took that warehouse the other nodded at a warehouse on the opposite bank whose docks were festooned with greenery and a few pouting girls wrapped up to the eyes in expensive furs oh yes well trust him that entire set is gamblingmad theyll be there all day and so will jocastels and i doubt that any of them will be watching even the middle of the races a knowing tone crept into the young mans voice redric may have snared most of the ladies but jocastel got the keys to his fathers wine cellar the first one snorted idiots the lot of them you can guzzle wine anytime but when is there likely to be another ice festival in our lifetimes the last one was over fifty years ago and every champion skater who could get here in time is going to be in the races today listen the big races will begin as soon as the queen comes back outim for hunting down one of those broomball tournaments ive heard of the terilee might thaw but the pond up at the old pile will hold for months yet and ive a mind to get a bunch of the lads together and try the game out ourselves oh now theres a plan enthused the second and both of them moved away gesturing at each other well that explained why there was no one here to speak of a gambling party in a warehouse a drinking party in a rented house and that pretty much accounted for most of the youngsters of the court alberich wandered over to the vicinity of a quintet of older men who were glaring at the young ladies on the dock with disapproval and muttering at each other what are their fathers thinking grumbled one just as alberich got within earshot the idea going off to some rented hovel unescorted oh it isnt the daylight hours that i would be concerned about said another sourly but whos to say whats going to happen when the feast is going on and some of them slip off unsupervised alberich eavesdropped shamelessly a little more learning only that most of the younger sets werent even planning to come down to the royal enclosure until the sun set the older courtiers would be trickling in during the late afternoon but they werent the ones alberich was concerned with he returned the skewer to the care of the cooks and drifted back to selenays royal pavilion feeling heartily annoyed at humankind in general and that feckless lot of highborn in particular hang it all why couldnt all those eager parents insist that the young men come down here to dance attendance on the youngand eligiblequeen why were they allowing their offspring to gamble and drink away the afternoon without even trying to steal moments of selenays time what were they thinking theyre probably thinking that if selenay hasnt indicated her interest in any of them by now theres no point in freezing their manhood off to try to impress her today kantor observed dispassionately hmph alberich nodded to the guards at the entrance and pulled back the door flap feeling entirely disgruntled then theres no damned point in my being here now the royal pavilion had been set up with a kind of antechamber to keep out the coldest air he parted a second set of door flaps just inside the first yes there is it will get everyone used to seeing you playing bodyguard so that no one will think twice about it tonight kantor retorted it wasnt much warmer inside but at least there were carpets laid over the ice and braziers of coals on sheets of slate atop them that provided little pockets of warmth the light in here was a lot more restful than out on the frozen river too the pitiless sunlight glowed through the painted canvas rather like the light coming in through his precious colored window and it was out of the wind alberich selenay called from amid a heap of furs and cushions piled on a highbacked settle that had been brought down from the palace her cheeks glowing her eyes sparkling whats to do between now and the feast more races he replied the really serious ones all the champion skaters that could get here in time are going to be competing out there will be some intense rivalry the prizes for the adult races are considerable and to claim one bragging rights will bestow for a decade really she looked entirely pleased how exciting have we referees along the course absolutely keren replied before alberich could answer not only is there the prospect that someone is likely to cheat theres the fact that if someone goes down there might be a fight over it hell probably claim he was fouled and he might take a part of the field with him we have this sort of thing every midwinter where im from and there is i hear much gambling over the outcome alberich added so more incentive there is to cheat and if someones accused of cheating selenay looked from keren to alberich and back again what do i do whoever is accused will deny it no doubt depends on how and where in the race and if a referee saw it keren said judiciously let the referee handle it unless enough people got taken down then if youre inclined you can have em run the race over again presumably everybodyd be equally tired so theyd all be on the same footing if i were a betting person id lay odds youll have to rerun at least one race this afternoon this is going to be the climax of the festival for a lot of peoplenot even the feast is going to eclipse it feelings will be running high which is why i have plenty of the guard stationed on the course and off it selenay replied nodding the seneschal warned me about that after he watched the semifinals you wont be able to jail everyone who starts a fight keren began dubiously selenay laughed and we wont try instead anybody who gets out of hand is going to find himself hauling wood and chopping wood for the spits and the cauldrons keren laughed too good enough work the energy out of a hothead and leave him too tired to fight that was the plan the queen agreed looking pleased with herself so besides the races is there anything else for me this afternoon only a skating pageant alberich replied having seen the preparations going on for the thing nearly every day since the festival began like a street pageant only instead of you riding along the street and stopping at every display youll be the one sitting and the groups doing the displays will pass in front of you stop and make their presentations keren said helpfully selenay made a face i suppose she sighed that everyone would be very disappointed if i didnt watch the whole thing alberich didnt blame her there were only so many badlyrhymed paeans to ones beauty and goodness sung by shrill and slightlyoutoftune childrens choirs that a sensible person could stand very said the seneschal who had just entered the pavilion himself in his firmest voice can i watch it on caryo instead of in the grandstand she asked hopefully its warmer on caryo but the purpose of the pageant is as much for you to be seen as for you to view the presentations the seneschal pointed out in a tone that made it very clear that selenay would not be watching the affair from her saddle she sighed i hope you have lots of these furs she said the races were just as exciting as keren had predicted and a great deal more dangerous for the participants than alberich had anticipated in fine the contestants were no longer holding back at all to save something for the climax this was the climax and every one of them was determined to go home bearing the champions medal the putative honor of entire villages depended on the results at least for the next year or so and the skaters were in competition not only for themselves but for all of their backers they wore a lot less for the actual racing than alberich would have thought wise but then moving at the speeds these folks did perhaps they burned up so much energy they simply didnt feel the cold once they got moving or maybe their exertions kept them warm whichever it was when it came time to form up along the starting line they all left off coats and cloaks keeping only thin knitted woolen trews bound closely to their calves and thin sleeved knitted woolen tunics with scarves wrapped close around face and mouth and knitted hats and gloves they all looked somber focused and purposeful by this point anyone left in competition had steel blades on their feet and they were wickedly sharp too it was when he was looking at those blades glinting as the skaters warmed up before the first race that alberich suddenly realized that the races could be dangerous as well as competitive these folk were wearing knives on their feet and if they went down in a heap well they must know that presumably they would take care if they did go down or at least as much care as could be taken the idea just made him shake his head though he couldnt imagine taking the chance of getting a leg or arm slashed to the bone for the sake of a race interestingly enough it was the longest of the races that started first because by the time this race of several leagues ended the shorter races would be long over they called it simply the long race and those who competed in it were specialized skaters indeed and would not take part in any other race today it was a lonely sort of racefar far down the river and back again a test of endurance as well as speed and the organizers had supplied each of the volunteer referees stationed along the route with a fire blankets and restoratives so that they could go to the rescue of any racer who failed that race began with a preliminary scramble but as the skaters passed out of sight beyond a bend in the river it was clear that the pack had quickly sorted itself out and the race had turned into an orderly skate in which each man would play out a strategy that he had predetermined for himself then the fast races began first the sprints which were very fast indeed and just as contentious as keren had promised there were falls and the predicted fights among both skaters and spectators and some sorting out by the guard selenay declared that two races would be rerun then came the longer races which was where alberich got a good look at the sort of pace that could rival that of a companion at full gallop the skaters bent low over their feet with their hands clasped behind their backs making strong sure gliding strokes that were most like the oarstrokes of men in sculls only at the beginning and the end did any real fight for position take place although there were some minor exchanges back in the pack it was fascinating to watch and the slightest mishap could change everything more than once a bit of bad ice caused a fumble that could drop a skater one or more places and once a fall took out the entire back half of the pack with the resultant scrambling that meant there was no chance that any of them could fight for one of the top positions the dock at that warehouse was full of people the entire time and highborn though they might have been they were shouting gesticulating and jumping up and down just as much as any of the commoners on the banks until all but one of the races was over and the crowd settled down to wait eyes straining to the bend in the river ears cocked for the first sounds of approaching blades then at long last the first of the exhausted endurance skaters hove into viewthat is alberich assumed they were exhausted though the ones in the lead showed no signs of it just gliding on with long sure strokes swinging their arms for added momentum looking neither to the left nor the right the crowd bellowed encouragement and in the last few furlongs the final bits of strategy played out and a skater who had been steadily in third place hanging so close to the man in front of him that it looked as if they were bound together with a rope suddenly pulled away as people screamed and shouted he put on a final burst of energy he passed the man in second place the man in first heard the shouts and made the mistake of looking behind him faltering for just a moment that was just enough the fellow behind him somehow found the strength to surge ahead and he crossed the finish line with scarcely the length of his forearm ahead of the man he had just passed the crowd went mad and flooded toward the skaters screaming wildly while the rest of the skaters staggered over the finish line only then did the exhaustion hit the skaters as friends swarmed the ice with blankets and cloaks and legs gave out sometimes with breathless cries of pain alberich found himself shouting and screaming along with the rest there was a brief period for the skaters to recover then wrapped warmly in their cloaks again there came the moment of their glory when selenay rewarded the first three finishers with medals purses and pairs of the finest skating blades made it was at that point that much to his shock alberich realized that he had screamed himself hoarse the skaters were all taken away to recover and selenay and her bodyguards settled into the reviewing stand her ladies around her and alberich under the stand to ensure nothing could get to her from that point then came the pageant and selenay sat in the reviewing stand patient as a statue with a footwarmer under her boots and a handwarmer tucked into a muff someone had brought for her smiling while her servants showered the participants with sweets and small coins by way of reward alberich felt sorry for her she was musical by nature and the kind of cold they were experiencing did not do good things to instruments nor did all the screaming that the singers had been doing during the races help the quality of their voices yet when the afternoon wound to a close and the sun sank over the river lending everything a tinge of red he thought that selenay looked as if she would have gladly sat through another three or four pageants rather than see the day come to an end but of course it hadnt not yet as the horns sounded to signal that the common folk could begin queuing up to the roasting beasts and simmering cauldrons selenay retired once again to the royal pavilion to exchange her clothing for a gown created for this particular event a floor of wood had been laid over the ice and a special tent pitched over it tapestries and hangings brought down from the palace to hang against the walls of the tent provided further insulation from the punishing cold while it would not be warm within the canvas walls it would not be nearly as cold as it was outside outside there was music and a peculiar and very attractive kind of ice dancing skaters carrying torches either in round dances or following one another in a close file through intricate figures that were made up on the spur of the moment by the skater in the lead inside there was also music and fires in firepits and candles and oil lamps wherever it was safe to put them outside the common folk feasted on meat and bread and wellwatered wine drunk hot inside inside it would be another court feast like so many others the only novelty being the cold alberich waited on guard just inside the main entrance to the royal pavilion until the queen appeared newlyattired and ready for her feast when she emerged he saw that selenays gownwhite of coursewas of heavy quilted velvet with a furlined surcoat and a heavy gold belt at her hips her hair was surmounted by a fur hat rather than her crown with one of the great cloak brooches of the royal regalia pinned to the front of it a great blazing diamond surrounded by lesser diamonds and instead of slippers she wore boots most of the garments would be like that tonight he thought and the wind would shake the canvas walls reminding all the courtiers present that although they might mock winter by holding their feast on the ice the winter could take them if it chose still when selenay emerged from the back of the pavilion she was still smiling and alberich thought that she looked both charmingly young and utterly regal he took her arm himself and led her out into the torchlit darkness he brought her over the treacherous ice as far as the door to the feasting tent where her official escort took over he found himself a little reluctant to let her go but that could have been because of the man she had chosen to partner her at the feast her official escort for the feast was lord orthallen who had had his tailor copy selenays garb in a lush and warming golden brown he looked extremely handsome and the surcoathis ending at his calves rather than trailing behind in a train as selenays didsuited him very well to alberichs mind he looked rather smug as well hmm kantor commented he does doesnt he one wonders why well it could only be because selenay was showing him such preference tonight alberich hoped so fortunately orthallen was safely wedded and there was no way that he could divorce his faithful fruitful and obedient wife without a major scandalso there was no way that he could imagine this sign of preference to be anything but selenays choice to honor her uncle orthallen in what was essentially a meaningless gesture meanwhile he had a job to perform and he set about doing it following immediately behind the pair as they walked up the aisle between the rows of lower tables the two heralds hed chosen to play bodyguard at the high table were already waiting there flanked by royal guardsmen in their blue formal uniforms he and the other two heralds hed picked as bodyguards for tonightalton and shanatehad taken the precaution of purloining some dinner from the cooks before the feast began just as the guardsmen had so they were able to keep their minds on the surroundings and not the food not that there was even the slightest hint of trouble just a great many excited animated people who were showing clearly with their high spirits that this entire festival had been a very good idea no one looked at this high table with that shadowed glance of regret the very different setting kept any memories of sendars high feasts from intruding so did the food though not as much as the setting there were some novelties which was only to be expected a soup served iced rather than hot many small ice sculptures on the tables and clever combinations of chilled food seasoned with hot spices there were sherbets and shaved ice with fruit and syrup spooned over the topsomething that would not have survived more than a moment in the heated great hall there were other concoctions that were actually doused in liquor and set afire that made a fine show as well though those made alberich more than a little wary until theyd been doused with orthallen on selenays right and talamir on her left unfortunately selenay could not have gotten much novelty in conversation well she couldnt have everything and she did appear to be enjoying herself on the whole alberich thought about halfway through he and his fellow bodyguards had gotten the better part of the mealby the time the stuff got to the table with the exception of dishes served flaming quite a bit of it was lukewarm at best he scanned the tables for his suspect but the full court wasnt hereit wouldnt have been possible to serve them all under these conditions for one thingso those at the table were the most important members of the most important families and his young highborn wasnt among them alberich stifled his disappointment the time to really look for the elusive fellow was coming finally the last subtlety was served and eaten selenay and her escort parted company with smiles and everyone cleared back to huddle around the firepits and braziers to let the servants swarm over the place and clear out all of the tables and most of the benches setting some against the tapestries so that those who were not dancing would have a place to sit now the evening could really begin and now people literally poured into the grand tent the royal pavilion was even now being laid out with refreshments to save room here for this was where the dancing was to be held the small dais where the high table had stood now held a single proper seatselenays portable throne which she took as soon as it had been set up the musicians teachers at bardic collegium all sat near her on stools where she could give them any instructions she might have on what sorts of dances to play the musicians carefully tuned their instruments and at a nod from selenay the first notes cut across the milling crowd those courtiers who did not care to dance cleared away to the side the rest including most of the younger ones taking the floor forming up into four rows of couples waiting expectantly for selenay to take the lead spot and selenays first dancing partner came forward a very tall very cleverlooking fellow in full bardic scarlet he bowed over her hand she stood up and they took their positions every dance had been arranged in advance of course the only deviation would be if selenay elected to sit any of them out at which time her partner would be expected to attend her and offer conversation alberich doubted that selenay would do any such thing though she loved dancing and shed been keyed up all day without having much of an outlet for her energy if ever his young nobleman was going to appear it would be here but not alberich thought among those nearest to the queen and in fact the evening was half over before he caught a glimpse of the young man it was only a glimpse tootoo quick to be certain much less pass the sight along to kantor but alberich was good at remembering details and the young man was wearing a hat that was reasonably identifiable alberich kept his eye on that hat watching as it swam through the crowd as it swayed and bent in a dance as it huddled with several more hats off to one side and for one horrible moment he thought it was going to duck out of the entrance but it hesitated then bowed to an elegant plume it joined with the plumeescorting itand the pair moved along the side of the dancingfloor until at last they moved out onto it as luck would have it it was a rounddance and eventually the figures brought the hat and its owner into alberichs lineofsight he felt kantor absorb the young mans image through his own eyes felt kantor absent himself for a moment then kantor returned devlin gereton third son of lord stevel gereton kantor reported talamir will tell you what he knows about the young man and his family later it isnt much its an old family but not particularly prosperous and they havent done much to draw attention to themselves or distinguish themselves theres only one thing theres no reason why this young man should be so interested in common plays or actors his eldest brothers a sound amateur poet and the only thing that devlin is known for is that he has a good ear for poetry and letters and is considered a budding expert in drama well wasnt that interesting wasnt that very interesting indeed selenay woke just before dawn if she had had any dreams she couldnt remember them yesterday everything had gone perfectly with one exception one glaring aching exception her father hadnt been there a weight of crushing depression settled over her she opened her eyes and lay quietly in her bed as thin gray light crept in through the cracks in her curtains she closed her eyes again and hot tears spilled from beneath her lids and down her temples to soak into her hair her throat closed and a cold hard lump formed in it selenay tried to fight back the sobs but one escaped anyway and she turned over quickly and muffled her sobbing in her pillows she didnt want to wake her attendants or alert the servants on the other side of the door she didnt want anyone to know she was crying they wouldnt understand they would think that she should be thrilled not choked with tears after all her festival had been a triumph and people would talk about it for years the court had loved it the common folk had adored it even the seneschal and keeper of the treasury had been happy for she had been very frugal extracting the maximum benefit from every coin shed spent either overseeing the preparations herself or sending people with stern demeanor and sharp eyes to do so for her the feast for the common folk had been a wild success going on long into the night as folk brought or bought food of their own to extend that supplied by the crown as for the entertainments for her court their feast and dancing had been as much of a success and for once shed had nothing but perfect dancing partners alberich had been right having heralds and bards and even a few healers alternate with her young nobles had made all the difference her gownthe first time shed been out of mourninghad made her look beautiful she hadnt needed dubious compliments to tell her so for her mirror and the frank gazes of the bards and heralds had made that clear enough but sendar hadnt been there and it might just as well have been a total failure because of that shed tried to lose herself in the preparations then to immerse herself in the happiness of other people and shed actually forgotten for a littlejust a little shed smiled and even laughed and when shed come back here to her rooms shed been so tired shed fallen straight asleep but shed known the moment that she awakened that one day one week hadnt changed anything hadnt filled the emptiness hadnt given her back the part of herself that was gone her father would have loved this hed have reveled in her triumph he would have had so many ideas for the festival so many more than she had the brief respite shed had was just thata moment of forgetfulness nothing more and now with nothing but day after day of gray sameness stretching ahead of her she missed him so much she thought she was going to break beneath the weight of grief so she sobbed into her pillow inconsolable how could anyone console her for this she and her father should have had years and years together she should have had him to cast stern eyes over wouldbe suitors to advise her how to deal with the council to scold her for working too hard and send her to read a book or ride and if she ever marriedhe should have been there to see it to see his grandchildren to spoil them as hed often threatened to do all of that was gone taken from her before it ever had a chance to happen she didnt want anyone to hear her crying they wouldnt understand theyd tell her stupid thingsthat it had been long enough that she needed to pull herself together that it was time to move on how could they know how many of them had a beloved father cut down in front of their eyes how many of them were facing what she faced the rest of her life without the man who had been father and mother to her and friend and counselor none of them understood none of them could none of them wanted to what they wanted was for her to be something else some biddable creature they called selenay that had no feelings but the shallowest and no thoughts of her own her feelings were an inconvenient obstacle to that or worse than telling her to get over this theyd spew some kind of platitude about how he was surely watching her from somewhere and was proud of her but would be unhappy that she was still mourning for him how could they know how could anyone know it wasnt fair it wasnt right sendar had been good hed given up so much hed always done so much for othersit wasnt fair shed always thought that when you did good good came to you what kind of a cruel god would do this to her and to him for that matter she wasnt entirely certain that there were any gods out there not after this and if there werent any gods then that meant that when you died you just died and her father wasnt out there looking after her he was just gone and all those platitudes were nothing but empty lies damn them damn them all and their needs and their platitudes and their plans they would never could never understand shed lost her best friend as well as her father she had been cheated out of years of things that they all took for granted how could she possibly ever get over that there would be a great gaping wound in her for the rest of her life that would never be properly filled except with tears the tears that never seemed to heal anything inside her she had tried these past moons at least to do things that would keep her moving keep her busy keep her too concentrated on things outside herself to think for a while the sheer desperation of having to learn how to rule of having to outwit her council when they tried discreetly to shunt her aside or maneuver her into something she didnt want to do had filled that need to keep moving she would work and plan and learn until she fell asleep exhausted and wake early to work againand that had helped at least to keep things at bay keep moving keep busy keep her mind full keep it all at a distance then just as the urgency of all that began to ease thered been the preparations for the festival to fill the silences to force her to work think and not remember but nownow she had awakened this morning knowing there was nothing nothing between her and that vast aching void that used to be filled with her fathers presence and anyone who found her crying like this would just never understand theyd wonder why after yesterday she could be unhappy even if she tried to explain theyd stare at her without understanding then tell her that it was time she moved on that it was time to leave her grief behind her as if she could of course you wont caryo said very very quietly and you shouldnt that would be wrong how can you leave it behind you when its a part of you the feeling that caryo had somehow put comforting arms around her only made her sob harder but caryo didnt seem to think there was anything wrong with that they keep telling me stupid things like time will heal it she said around the sobs that shook her entire body there was an ache in caryos mindvoice that matched the aching of her heart time doesnt all that time does is make it more distant put more space between you and what happened it doesnt heal anything i dont know how or what does the healing but it isnt time oh caryo i miss him so much she cried so do i somehow that was exactly the right thing for selenay to hear it let loose another torrent of weeping but this time it seemed as if she was weeping herself out until at last she lay there curled in her bed her nose stuffed and her eyes sore her pillow soggy turn your pillow over love she sniffed hard and obeyed without thinking and closed her aching eyes she was exhausted now limp with crying and if the ache in her heart didnt hurt any less at least she was too tired to cry any more i keep thinking if only id gone after him if only those must be the two saddest words in the world caryo sighed the best thing that i can tell you is that there is nothing that could have happened that would have allowed you to follow him and there was not one scrap one hint of knowledge or even foresight that any of us had that would have let us guess what he was going to do or enabled us toprevent it if there was ever a moment in history where a man took his own fate in his own two hands that was it then i wish i could go back but there was no use in pursuing that line of thought she couldnt no one not even in the tales of before the founding had ever said anything about being able to go back into the past and change things i dont want to get up caryo and she didnt she didnt want to move she didnt want to leave her bed ever the weight of depression pressed down on her and filled her with lethargy she wanted to close her eyes and fall into oblivion and never come out again she didnt exactly want to diebut if only there was a way to not live and caryo didnt say any of the stupid things that other people might about how she had to live for valdemar or how she was being hysterical or overreacting if you dont get up ill miss our morning ride she said instead wistfully as if she was deliberately misunderstanding the i dont want to get up as merely meaning this morning and not forever maybe she was butthe thought of the morning ride another of those times when she could forget for a little as caryo moved into a gallop and she could lean over that warm white neck and let the movement and the rush of air and the rhythm all lull her into a kind of trance that same state of not being that she was just longing forthat broke through the lethargy it was hard to tell why but it did it made her decide that she had to get up to keep moving to try for another candlemark another day and as she forced her legs out from under the covers it occurred to her that as long as she just kept moving even if she didnt find any peace or escape in movement she might at least find a little more distraction distraction she had to distract anyone from knowing shed been crying or theyd want to know why and then there would be all that stupid nonsense that she didnt want to hear she slipped out of bed and went to the table where a basin and pitcher waited she splashed some of the cold water into the basin and bathed her face until she thought that most of the signs of her tears were gone her eyes were probably still red but with luck no one would remark on it after all with all of the snow glare out there yesterday probably theyd think it was that if anyone said anything shed claim it was snow glare and maybe she could claim a headache too and cut the council session short she blew her nose and went back to her bed and crawled back into it feeling as exhausted as if she hadnt slept at all just close your eyes caryo advised theyll expect you to sleep late after last night you really did look lovely you know all of the young heralds at least were saying so i cant speak for the bards they dont have companions to gossip about them but the heralds were very taken with how you looked they were that wasif not comforting at least it was satisfying nice to know that she did look as good as she had thought believe it or not even alberich thought so in fact i think he might have had just a twinge of jealousy when he handed you off to orthallen well that penetrated the lethargic depression a bit alberich surely not and anyway it was probably only that he disliked orthallen well apparently the feeling was mutual and there wasnt anything she could do about that when two men decided to take a dislike to one another there really wasnt anything to be done about it it was like trying to get a pair of dominant dogs to be friends no matter what you did each of them was going to be certain that he should be head of the pack and all you could do was to try and keep them separate as much as possible orthallen was one of the few people who didnt say anything stupid about her father he didnt even say that she ought to be over her grief by now and that made him one of the few people she felt comfortable being around even if he did tend to treat her as little selenay instead of the queen besides it wasnt alberich that she wanted to make jealous though on second thought there really wasnt anyone in her entire court or the heraldic circle she wanted to make jealous honestly if the whole business of trying to get her to marry someone who was tied to a whole pack of special interests was put aside the real reason she didnt want to marry any of the councils choices was that they all bored her there wasnt one of them that was worth spending an entire afternoon with much less a lifetime there wasnt a single unattached male in the entire court that even gave her a flutter of interest she was just so tired of it all tired of the ache in her soul tired of the loneliness tired of trying to outmaneuver the people she should have been able to lean on it seemed as if her entire life was nothing more than dragging herself through an endless round of weariness and grief and she just wanted an end to it all she buried her face in her pillow not to muffle more sobs but to block outeverything if only for a moment it was when she woke again to the sounds of her servants and attendants bustling around the room that she realized she must have fallen asleep again and if she didnt feel better at least she felt a little less tired enough so that she felt she could probably face the day she didnt want to but she could i think she told caryo as they came to get her out of bed and dress her i think well have our morning ride before breakfast good caryo said simply id like that thank you keep moving that was the only answer just keep moving and if that wasnt an answer at least it was a way to keep her from juststopping stopping and never starting again for alberich the day after the festivals climax began just as any ordinary day didthe only differences being that now at least he didnt have to concern himself with making preparations for selenays appearance and now that he knew the identity of the young man hed been looking for he could concentrate on thinking of ways to find out what was going on but as far as the young trainees went apparently the end of the festival meant restlessness and discontent theyd had an unexpected break in their routine and as alberich was woefully aware any break in a youngsters routine generally meant trouble in getting him back into that routine as a consequence the first class of the morning was a disaster far too much time was wasted in trying to get his students back on track after the excitement of the ice festival and they fought him every step of the way performing their warmups lethargically running through the initial exercises in a state of distraction and wasting time in chattering about the pleasures of the day before and part of him was still puzzling over the question of devlin gereton why he would be receiving information from a playactor and what that information could be it took real effort on his own part to put that aside and concentrate on getting some results out of the class but it was a futile effort the trainees were utterly disinclined to settle down and work and finally in desperation he decided that if all they could do was chatter about ice sports well hed give them an ice sport they would never forget after all they were going to have to learn to work together in coordinated teams silence he barked weapons down startled they shut off the chatter dropped weapon points and stared at him weapons put away get the staves he ordered grimly now then on with cloaks and follow me now looking apprehensive and guilty they obeyed he snatched up his own cloak hid a little surprise inside it as he did so and stalked out followed by a suddenly subdued tail of trainees of all four colors out into the snow they went out past the practice grounds and into companions field following a path beaten by others into the thighdeep snow it was another cloudless bonechilling day and sunlight poured pitilessly down through the skeletal branches of the trees he led them to one of the frozen ponds in companions field one that had been cleared off so that it could be used for skating but was far enough from the palace and the collegia that it wasnt in use very much in a welcome release for his temper he kicked three basketsided holes in the snow at the edge of the ice one at each point of an imaginary equalsided triangle laid on the pond then divided the class into two teams he made sure that the trainees were fairly evenly distributed between both teams and he made a point of dividing up friends as much as he could if they were mad for sport well hed give them bloody sport indeed chosen i hope you arent releasing a wolf from a trap here kantor said full of amusement are you sure you know what youre doing no he said honestly but at least theyll get some stave practice out of this then he dropped what he had picked up onto the ice in front of them it was one of the little round cushions that they used over their knuckles when they were practicing barefist fighting they looked at it then at him then back down at it without any comprehension at all pah you are two teams of fighters now there are your goals first teamthere second team there he pointed he thought he saw comprehension beginning to dawn he hoped so theyd all seen the broomball competition he hoped they werent so dense that they couldnt figure this out the third goal neutral is either team may score there the cushion into the opposite goal or into the neutral goal you are to put he said icily and moved carefully off the slippery surface of the ice with as much dignity as he could muster heaving a sigh of relief when he reached the bank and could stand there with his arms folded over his chest under his cape but is this like broomball what are the rules someone asked and but we dont have skates protested another there are rules in war i think not he retorted skates you will be carrying in the field enough no rules the cushion in the goal you will put how it comes there your problem is hit it you may kick it carry it i care not you have staves use them fight with them no rules he hadnt been altogether certain what their response would be on the one hand they were trainees and had a modicum of training in organization on the other hand they were overstimulated adolescents with too much restlessness to settle down they could settle in and make some rules assigning tasks and responsibilities before they set to their new version of broomball they could but they didnt with a yell someone broke and swatted at the cushion with his stave and the melee began as someone else jumped for the cushion and half of the other team piled onto the one making the move it was in a sadistic sort of way rather entertaining for the onlooker staves went everywherethough not as successfully as if the fighting had been on solid unslippery ground bodies went everywhere most of them ended up sprawled on the ice the cushion tended not to get anywhere near a goal he had been counting on the ice to ensure that no one was able to get in any dangerously hard blows with the staves and the ploy worked even the ones that were good skaters found the going slippery and none of them were used to trying to stay balanced on the ice while simultaneously swatting with a stave and all of them were fairly good at stave work to begin with so if someone swung for an opponent instead of the cushion there was a good chance that hed find the blow blocked but none of them were doing much in the way of coordination or teamwork it was pretty much every man for himself and alberich had ensured that the little amount of teamwork that might have occurred naturally was sidelined by breaking up friends onto opposite teams it got pretty wild out there though before it was all over he didnt know if any of them were keeping track of the number of goals that were made he certainly wasnt all he was interested in was to make sure that no one was injured beyond falls and bruises and bumps on the head putting them on the ice had another effect even when someone connected with a stave most of the force of the blow went into sending the opponent flying like a giant version of the cushion oh they were going to be aching and stiff when it was over theres going to be competition for the bathtubs today kantor observed sounding highly amused and calls for liniment i suspect they wanted excitement he told his companion so they did if they were going to act like a lot of wild hill brats then by the sunlord they were going to learn why discipline and organization were necessary if you wanted to win a fight by the time that class was overmore to the point by the time he broke up the melee that the game had turned into and sent them all back to their other classesit didnt appear that the lesson had sunk in yet but he was relatively certain that eventually it would as they thought back over the chaos on the ice certainly they were one and all winded weary aching in every limb and there wasnt one of them that wasnt sporting some sort of injury there were a hefty number of black eyes and lots of bruises in places that didnt show and a strain or two and lumps on the skull and he would have laid money on the fact that not one of them was going to give the other instructors any trouble for the rest of the day but most of all for the sake of the lesson in teamwork it was painfully clear that no one had any idea who had won so when the next class showed the early symptoms of the same disease he administered the same cure it was only when he got the finalyear students that he got any signs of sense and steadiness out of them and managed to run a normal class he didnt have the option of thinking much past the fact that at least hed gotten some work out of them and a lesson of sorts into them after classes were over some of the guard appeared for a little training and he was able to work out some of his own frustration in a satisfying series of bouts when the last of the adults had gone and the last of the daylight faded leaving the salle in blue gloom he was more concerned with a hot shower than anything else he went back into his quarters and got himself cleaned up coming out of his bathing room to find that the servants had come and gone from the collegium leaving behind both his dinner and a visitor what in the bloody blue blazes did you infect your students with today myste demanded peering at him through her thick glass lenses pausing in the midst of laying out plates cups and cutlery they look like theyve been through the wars and theyre chattering like magpies about some ice exercise you invented he stared at her for a moment bemused both by her presence and by the question he hadnt thought much beyond exhausting the worst offenders it hadnt occurred to him that theyd actually take to the exercise well not really anyway maybe some of the blues the courtiers children who hadnt anything better to do with their time they would not settle he replied after a moment so to exhaust them i decided and to show them organization is needed a battle to win well your little experiment in ice warfare is being talked about over all three collegia she said in a rueful tone as if she could hardly believe it and the ones that hadnt tried it yet were mad to while the rest are trying to come up with rules socalled proper equipment scoring its all anyone could talk about over luncheon and dinner and they want to do it in their free time he interrupted her with a gust of incredulous laughter nothey mean to make a sport evidently she shook her head and dished out food for both of them then she sat down next to the fire with a bowl of stew in hand i suppose we should be grateful its new its a good alternative to tavern hopping and getting into pranks and its exercise and they will weary of it soon enough he said if they do not when the ice melts over it is he couldnt believe that anything as ridiculous as the foolish melee hed put them through had suddenly become an allconsuming interest hmm she ate a little chewing thoughtfully as the fire crackled beside her i think whats likeliest to happen is that theyll all try it but the only way to keep from getting bruised up and battered over it is to have a lot of rules and maybe purloin the padding and helms used for weapons practice into the bargain but having a lot of rules means that theyll have to agree over the rules no two sets of wouldbe players are going to have the same idea of what the rules should be and in the end they wont have agreed before the ice melts probably he agreed feeling relieved and irritated at the same time cadets would never have been allowed such foolishness but then again as he had noted before heraldic trainees were not karsite cadets i had noted that on the river the players of the broomball game required much drinking of wine and beer to continue the game past the first few goals and without that it isnt nearly as much fun she chuckled right thats what ill tell the others they were afraid it was going to take over the collegia he thought about that for a moment thought about the fact that a certain level of madness seemed to come out of the confinement of winter and thought about all the high spirits generated by the festival it will probably for a short time he decided but that gives a painless punishment as well for those of the collegia at least who will not settle and study forbid them from playing make playing contingent upon good marks blues we can do little about if they are highborn children but then againtime they have to waste at least melees on ice harm them only ohouch very good indeed myste laughed that should do the trick they finished dinner quickly so much time spent out in the cold used up a lot of energy and he was wolfhungry only after they had cleared the dishes away into the hampers did it occur to him to wonder why she had come there tonight it couldnt have been because she wanted his companycould it at that thought he got a very odd feeling in the pit of his stomach not unpleasant no butfluttery it disconcerted him it disconcerted him so much that he just blurted out what was in his head why are you here he heard himself saying and could have hit himself for how it sounded but she didnt seem to take offense at his words or his tone well she began and hesitated mixed motives actually i wanted to find out what youd done with the youngsters i must say that the ones who had gotten your lesson were nicely subdued for my classes it was only the ones that hadnt gotten to play that were wound up like tops and um another hesitation i um enjoy your company and one other thing she added hastily before he could decide if she was blushing or not keren slipped a little well she didnt really slip so much as i browbeat it out of her when she brought me a dress of all things to mend for her she laughed i mean keren in a dress please that was odd enough but a dress that looked like that like what he asked unthinking a dockside whore she replied with cheerful bluntness and it was his turn to flush she said she didnt want to take it to the collegium seamstresses because it was supposed to be a secret and then tried to backtrack well needless to say i got the whole story out of her so you know he asked feeling a little guilty that he hadnt told her before this seeing that hed been thinking about asking for her help anyway hmm i guessed before this too many evenings when you werent here in the complex too many times when you knew things you shouldnt have about parts of haven you werent supposed to have ever visited she said thoughtfully i mean i can put two and two togetherand unlike some of our colleagues with some rather lofty ideas about heraldic duties and honor i know a bit about the practicalities of life anyway i just wanted you to know that if i can help without getting in the way id like to keren might fit in some of the wilder parts of haven but i know the craftsmens districts inside and out that stopped him cold it hadnt occurred to him that myste might want to volunteer or that she would actually have some inside knowledge that he didnt hed thought he would have to persuade her then train her its not as if id have to act a part like keren she continued id just have to be what i was before i was chosen an accountant a clerk ordinary believe me people like me are just invisible as long as we keep our mouths shut no one thinks anything about having us around were a kind of servant and no one ever pays any attention to the servants he didnt know how true the latter statement was but the former was true enough there could be danger in this he warned she raised an eyebrow you might not think it but theres danger in being an independent clerk you dont always know just who is hiring you or for whator at least not until they ask you to run two sets of books or you get a look at papers you werent supposed to see that never happened to me personally but i know those it did happen to and theres stories about people turning up missing after taking certain jobs she chuckled weakly well thats probably what most of the people who knew me think is what happened to me i know for a fact that none of them realize i was chosen well she was on that last battlefield for the tedrel wars and shed volunteered for that too shed faced danger there certainly enough i might then ask you for help he said carefully ask and youll have it she said and then seemed at a loss for anything else to say but he didnt want her to leave they sat in awkward silence for a long time and when the silence was broken they both broke it at once can you tell me what of interest have you they both broke off flushing alberich was just a little angryat himself surely he was more than old enough to have a simple conversation with an interesting woman without blushing like a boy particularly this one that he had shouted at cursed at and forced to learn things she adamantly did not want to learn you first she said gesturing he paused what did he want to say it suddenly occurred to him that there was a lot he didnt know about her he might as well start with that so what was myste the clerk like he asked what was her life she laughed boring but her eyes grew thoughtful behind those thick lenses but you dont know much of anything about the ordinary person in valdemar of the middling classes do you i know a lot about all of that in haven in particular so even if id be bored by it please he said with a slow smile tell me and so she did and being myste she got as much about alberich of karse out of him as he did about myste of haven it was on the whole an equitable exchange and perhaps best of all it was one that would take some time in telling the ice festival had taken place a fortnight after midwinter now another fortnight later the deep cold finally broke with a gray day vastly warmer than the ones that had brought the ice festival and with a dampness to the air that warned of snow by a candlemark after sunrise the snow had begun and it fell thick and soft all day and into the night alberich for one was very happy to see it for it meant that all the frozen ponds were covered over and at least until the wouldbe athletes shoveled them clear again there would be no more ice melees or as the trainees had decided to call it hurlee yes they had given it a name they had agreed on that much and more it had taken on a life of its own he had unwittingly created a monster yet at the same time it was a very useful monster if at times it seemed that the vast majority of the free time of both trainees and young courtiers was taken up with creating rules and scoring for this combative game and arguing over both endlessly at least they were learning about teamwork cooperation in combat and negotiation if they seemed obsessed at least as several teachers said with a sigh there were worse things to get obsessed about and the slightest hint that falling marks would occasion being forbidden to play or even discuss the game often worked miracles still it seemed that there was nowhere in court or collegia that one could go to escape the wretched game even some of the younger guards had started to take it up for all alberich knew it was spreading down into haven by now and many older members of the court decidedly unamused by the racketing teams of youngsters surging here and there and practicing on every open bit of ice or even creating unauthorized bits of ice to practice on often gave alberich unfriendly glares when he saw them the cushion had been replaced by first a childs beanbag then a tough leather ball filled with heavy buckwheat in its husks of the sort that jugglers practiced with the staves now had small scoops on one end the holes in the snow were now nets and the teams had been stabilized at five members each one of which was supposed to guard his teams net combat with the staves was still very much allowed alberich had the feeling that no few little feuds were being worked out during the games halfhelms of padded leather and elbow kidney and kneepads had been agreed upon skates were not allowed on order of the healers who didnt want to deal with the results other additions were being argued about or rather forcefully argued for by healers collegium which did not want an influx of trainees and other youngsters with missing teeth or broken jawbones at this point alberich had washed his hands of the entire project and disclaimed any involvement with it like the other instructors he had declared that inattention and falling marks would be grounds for being forbidden to play he was rather desperately hoping that a thaw would put an end to it and depressingly afraid that given the new changes in it they would be able to play without ice at least by this point it was very clear that no more than half of the heraldic trainees and substantially very substantially less than a quarter of the healers and bardic trainees were going to actually be playing this game the rest lacked the coordination and after the initial excitement was over the inclination that did not however mean that the rest werent interested oh no they were still just as mad about watching it as the rest were about playing it but he could not spare much time to worry about a mere game he had decided to start taking keren out on some of his prowls through haven and he had yet to come up with a plan to let him discover just what devlin and that actor were up to the main stumbling block was that he could not think of a way to shadow the young courtier or the actor without alerting them to the fact that someone was watching them for one thing he was more than a little wary about trying to disguise himself around the actor at all he could fool ordinary folk but an actor the fellow might have a style that was ridiculously flamboyant and exaggerated but that alberich suspected was for the benefit of his audience which was not going to react to a subtle performance the man could not have come up with so clever a plan for passing information if he was not clever and subtle himself and if alberich tried to pass himself off as someone who had business being around either devlin or the actors it seemed impossible alberich was certain hed be caught he might be able to pass off his karsite accent as hardornan or rethwellan down in the slums but actors had an ear for accents and might even be able to correctly identify his and just how many karsites were there in haven not many not many that still had their accent the paste he used to disguise his scars passed muster after dark but actors knew about makeup and false hairhed never get by an actor without him noticing how many karsite heralds were there a sufficiently clever man could easily put two and two together as for getting in close that was impossible the manfinally alberich had learned who he was norris lettyn and where his troupe was operating from the three sheaves in the cattle market areaseldom went anywhere outside of the inn and never consorted with anyone except his fellow actors and exceedingly attractive buxom adoring women neither of which alberich wasnor were keren or myste they might be able to feign the adoration but the kind of ladies that norris kept company with were the sort that made men turn in the street and stare after them not surprisingly no few of them were ladies of negotiable virtue but the price they placed on their services was very very high they were nothing like the common whores of the exiles gate neighborhood and alberich could not make up his mind if norris was paying for their company or getting it on the basis of his reputation popularity stunningly handsome face and muscular body if he was paying for itwhere was a mere actor getting the money on the other hand someone who looked like norris did generally had women fawning on him and alberich saw no reason to suppose that expensive courtesans were any less likely to fawn than supposedly honest women thanks to norris face and flamboyant style the troupe was certainly prospering as was the inn to which they were attached they didnt even have to give plays every day for the public anymore once every two days the courtyard was packed with spectators for one of the repertoire of plays they put on and it certainly wasnt because of the high literary standards of the things moving to that tent on the riverbank during the festival had been a shrewd moveputting on their play there spread their reputation to the entire city and the city evidently followed them back to their home ground when the festival was over norris even was beginning to get something of a following among the highborn of the courtwhile the plays they put on for the public were hardly great literature evidently they had in their repertoire a number of classical works and the troupe had been hired to give private performances at least twice now there would without a doubt be more of those though how lucrative they were in contrast to the public performances alberich had no way of telling which created another problem it seemed to alberich that norris was living somewhat beyond his means but without getting close to the man there was no way to know that for certain he didnt know how norris was paid or if now that he had a bit of a following among the highborn he was getting gifts or patronage if so then young devlin would have the perfect excuse to add to that patronage and even visit the actor openly so alberich still did not know what was being exchanged whether or not it mattered to the crown nor how dangerous it was and at the moment he had no way of finding these things out and there was another thing that worried him that had nothing to do with the devlin problem it seemed to him that selenay was not looking entirely well it wasnt that she looked ill exactly but that she looked far more subdued than he liked it was the death of her father of course it couldnt be anything else the festival had been an alltoobrief diversion from her grief he suspected he wished he could do something for her but the honest truth was that he was completely unsuited to that sort of task all he could do was what he was good at and let otherstalamir who was after all queens owndo their job without any interference assuming that the hurlee players didnt drive him utterly mad before spring the problem is myste said over a good slice of beef in the bell you dont understand the sportsminded both of them were in disguise he as a middling craftsman she in some of her old garb from her previous life including the spectacles she had worn then lenses held in frames of wire this was the first time he had brought myste down into haven to try out her disguise but it was more for his benefit than for hers he wanted to look like an ordinary craftsman in the audience at the three sheaves and if he didnt have to talk he stood a better chance of passing as valdemaran the bloodyminded not the sportsminded he muttered under his breath then said louder and you do it seemed unlikely bespectacled myste held as much aloof from the hurlee madness as he did as far as he could tell as a matter of fact she retorted i do i was raised here in an ordinary family and not in a cadet school people with a bit of leisure time ordinary folk like sport even if they dont play a game or at least dont play it well thats why they like to cheer on those who do that i do not understand at all he admitted reluctantly she sniffed you ought to its part of what makes it easy for a sufficiently unscrupulous leader to get his people involved in a needless war look its like this as i reckon it people like to be in groups on one side so they can tell themselves that their side is better than the other they can get the excitement and the thrill of being worked up about just how much better they are than the other side is and when theyre in a group doing that then the excitement is doubled just because everyone else is doing the same that i understand he said darkly so you are saying that being sportsminded a little like being in a war is without the bloodshed she replied and sighed without the consequences people like competition but at the same time they like cooperation almost as much with something like hurlee you get to either be on a team or for a team and you get cooperation like being in a special tribe but then your team goes against someone elses team and theres your competition it satisfies a whole lot of cravings all at once its like a bloodless war and then you get to go out and buy each other beer afterward and you get cooperation all over again he shrugged it made sense he supposed he thought about how he had been shouting at the end of the last skatingrace along with everyone else if even he could get caught up in a sport to that extent then what myste said made sense and there wasnt any warfare going on people who had been used to living with a conflict and an enemy now found themselves with nothing of the sort maybe those who had actually fought were perfectly comfortable without having an enemy but those who hadntparticularly all those youngstersmight be looking for a focus for all that energy so maybe that was why hurlee had suddenly become an obsession and probably as myste expected within a couple of months it would turn into a sport like any other at least now that the rules had been agreed on and things had sorted out into a roundrobin of regular teams with exact rosters the situation wasnt quite so outofhand certainly the whole scheme of forbidding participation if marks fell off was workingmiraculously even with the highborn blues and heretofore if their parents werent concerned with marks there had been no way to effectively discipline them maybe hurlee wasnt so bad after all so where exactly is it that were going she asked the three sheaves inn he told her she nodded though she looked surprised he had explained his situation with regard to young devlin and his contact norris and the difficulty he found himself in trying to get close enough to make some sort of judgment about it i thought at the least into the playgoing crowd we can insert ourselves good for me for open my mouth i cannot without myself betraying so you can do the speaking for us both good for you it would be and it may be that an opportunity you will see that i cannot fair enough she agreed and glanced out the window into the thickening gloom of twilight and i might you never know besides i wouldnt mind seeing this actor fellow if hes setting young hearts afire alberich snorted not just young he corrected and finished the last of his meal all the better then she chuckled at the expression on his face and pushed off from the table without another word now something did occur to me she said as they moved out into the cold snowy streets passing a lamplighter who was climbing up to light one of his charges had you considered paying one of those lowlife pickpockets you hang about with to snatch young devlins purse when you think hes carrying what youre looking for tell him you want the papers he gets anything else since it had not occurred to him he almost stopped dead in the street to stare at her ah no he managed at last should be easy enough she pointed out i suppose youd have to make up some cockandbull tale about why you wanted it done and youd have to work the whole setup just for the other lad to do the snatchandrun so hell get away clean maybe even interfere with some of the constables to keep them from nobbling him but between what you paid the fellow and what hed get off devlin id have to think that itd more than pay him to keep his mouth shut about it his mind was already at work on the problem he could sacrifice one of the problematic personae if he needed to if one of them was never seen again after getting the papers it wouldnt matter if the thief in question couldnt keep his mouth shut because thered be no one to betray it was definitely an idea and a good one not perfect but but it opened up a whole new set of ideas it hadnt occurred to him to make use of the criminal element there were other possibilities here if for instance he could discover which room in the inn norris used perhaps he could send someone to search it you do know that someone might recognize me at this inn dont you she continued conversationally not as a herald of courseim certain nobody actually knows thats where i went when i quit my job my choosing was pretty quiet actually and since i was right in haven i persuaded aleirian to let me finish out my work for the day hand in my notice and slip out without a fuss modest of you he began she laughed hardly i didnt want anyone who wanted a favor showing up at the collegium looking for me anybody who knew me would recognize me as myste willenger the accountant and clerk not herald myste except for the wars i havent set foot outside the collegium complex since i was chosen really well that would not harm anything he pulled the hood closer around his neck this damp cold seemed to be more penetrating than the dry cold of festival week in fact it might be a good thing reestablish myself in my old haunts she glanced at him sideways well if you want me to do that i can ill think up something to tell anyone who asks where ive been he had to snort at that where else but for the army working he asked at least until the wars ended she stared at him a moment and stumbled over a rut then smiled youve got a good head for this she said youre right of course all those soldiers needed feeding supplying payingthat needs clerks and now half of them disbanded are and no more need for extra clerks that was certainly true enough just as it was true that an army the size of the one that sendar had assembled had required a vast force of people to support it which is why im back her smile spread but of course the reason im not back at my old job is because i was replaced which i was but when i was chosen so a job you must have he frowned over that thought not necessarily no waitan idea i have the bell that is safe enough a note i will leave it will be arranged should anyone ask not that anyone would no one was likely to ask about a minor clerk and accountant but it was best to cover every contingency for the master you do the records and the taproom clerk you are also you board there as well this was common enough just because people were supposed to be literate didnt mean they were good at reading and writing often enough they were willing to pay someone else to write a letter for themand of course any legal documents absolutely required a clerk to draw them up thatll do she sighed with satisfaction i like to have everything set out just in case as do i alike we think in that way and before he could say anything else although there were a couple of halfformed ideas in the back of his head it was too late to say anything because the three sheaves was looming before them and with it a goodsized crowd milling about at the door waiting to get into the courtyard for the performance they joined it and at that point kept their conversation to commonplaces the one excellent thing about having bardic collegium right on the grounds of the palace was that there were always musicians of the finest available at a moments notice the hardornan ambassador from king alessandar had expressed an interest that afternoon in hearing some of the purely instrumental music that valdemarans took for granted and selenay had been able to arrange for that wish to be gratified with an impromptu concert after dinner ambassador isadere was finally rested enough from his journey and formal reception to show some interest in the less formal pastimes of the courtwhich meant to selenay the ones where she wasnt required to pay exclusive attention to him or indeed to anyone bardic collegium responded to her request for an instrumental ensemble with what almost seemed to be gratitude shed been puzzled by that at first but then after a moment of thought she realized that she had not made such requests more than a handful of times since shed become queen whereas her father had called on bardic either for simple musicians or true bards at least every two or three days perhaps they took this as a sign that things were getting back to normal well even if she didnt feel that way was it right for her to impose her depressed spirits on everyone else no it wasnt no matter what she felt like wasnt it her duty to put on a sociable mask besides entertainments like this meant she wouldnt really have to put on more than the mask when she thought about it she realized that anyone who was really listening to the music wouldnt require anything from her except that she not be dissolved in tears so when she sent a note back to bardic thanking them she asked if it would be possible for them to supply musicians of the various levels of expertise to her as they had to her fatherand as often the immediate response was that they would be overjoyed to do so and would even save her the trouble of trying to decide on informal entertainments by setting them up with her household as they had done for sendar with great relief she let them know that this was perfect and she led her court into the great hall for the concert then settled into her seat enthroned among the courtiers with ambassador isadere at her left thinking that tonight was turning out to be something of a respite after all and the gods knew she needed one she wasnt feeling up to an evening of bright conversation with her foreign guests tonight shed been fighting melancholy all day knowing that it would take next to nothing to make her break out in tears now with not only the ambassador but his entire entourage listening with rapt attention to the musicians she could lean back in her chair and wait for the evening to be over or so she thought majesty are you well whispered lord orthallen he leaned over the arm of his chair toward her his voice pitched so that it would not disturb anyone else and to his credit he really did look concerned she smiled faintly at him and nodded he raised an eyebrow as if he didnt entirely believe her but turned his attention back to the music she glanced over at herald talamir who did not appear to have noticed the interchange but then it was difficult to tell these days what talamir did and did not see it was even more difficult to tell what he thought about what he saw in fact he was sitting back in his chair eyes halfclosed and he looked exactly like a statueexcept that there was nothing of the solidity of a statue about him how he managed this she could not tell but these days talamir didnt entirely seem to be in the here and now as it were his manner was often preoccupied as if listening to and watching something no one else could hear or see and to her mind there was a suggestion of translucency about him the spirit somehow shining through the flesh when there was something that really required his attention he was almost like his old self but when there wasnt he was almost like a ghostmadeflesh and not altogether contented with that state he made a great many people uneasy without any of them being able to articulate why he made selenay uneasy as a matter of fact she could never glance at himexcept in the times when he was very much in the hereandnowwithout an involuntary shiver and yet there were plenty of people who saw no difference in him at all people like orthallen for instance they acted in talamirs presence now exactly as they had acted in talamirs presence before the last battle before he died and was dragged back to life that was the crux of it of course heralds healers and bards almost all sensed it talamir was a man in two worlds now and most of his concentration seemed to be taken up with the unseen world that was why selenay just could not bring herself to confide in him even though that was what the function of the queens own was supposed to be how could i sit there and tell him things she wondered wearily even if he wasnt a man and as old as my father it would be like trying to share girlsecrets with a particularly unworldly priest and anyway talamir had been her fathers closest friendwhich was only as it should have been of course but how could she tell him how much she missed her father and cry on his shoulder when surely talamir missed him as much or more it would be too cruel too cruel for words talamir had already suffered so much pain losing his own companion to death as well as sendar and so many other friendsno it would be too cruel to inflict further pain on him that way as for sharing her scarcelyarticulate longing for well romance oh no he would never ever understand and shed get a grave wellconsidered perfectly reasonable lecture about her duties as queen and how great power required great responsibility as if she didnt know as if she didnt feel all that with every pulse of blood through her veins but that didnt stop her from wanting it even though most of the younger members of her court were probably going to make arranged marriages in the end that didnt stop them from flirtations and even outright courtship after all there was always the chance that both sets of parents would be pleased to find that an alliance had been made and even if they werent well as one young lady had tearfully put it unaware that selenay was eavesdropping from the other side of the hedge it will give me something to remember when im wedded to that awful old man but a queen couldnt have flirtations and of course she knew that only too well knowing she couldnt was bad enough but being reminded of that fact by someone like talamir would only make it worse her father would have understood hed been able to marry for love hed always said he didnt want to see her sacrificed to a marriage of state but with him gone and with no telling what needs might arise she had to count on sacrificing herself she felt a lump rising in her throat and closed her eyes against the sting of tears fighting them back this was neither the place nor the time to display weakness it was at that moment that she felt with a sense of shock someone press a folded bit of paper into her hand her eyes flew open in time for her to see lord orthallen removing his hand from hers their eyes met and he nodded gravely then sat back again for one brief moment an incredulous thought came into her head a love note from orthallen no surely not he was married he was older than her father and besides every other councilor would spontaneously combust with rage at the very idea she looked down at the scrap of paper and opened it selenay you used to call me your lorduncle and told me all your childish woes she read and if i have in recent days often forgotten that you are no longer my little niece but my queen and fully adult please forgive an old man for clinging to his illusions longer than he should have i have seen you fall into melancholy more than once these past few days i think you might be in need of a friend with whom youcan unburden yourself freely if that is the case will you honor your fathers friend by putting me in that place as he did so that this old man can begin to see the grown lady of reality instead of the child of the past perhaps we can help each other in our shared sorrow selenay blinked this was unexpected first of all lord orthallen was above all else a very proud man he seldom apologized secondly he had been one of those on her council that had seemed the most adamant about keeping her from taking the reins of power into her own hands but this was an apology and a tacit admission that he was ready and willing to see her as the queen in fact as well as in title and the part about shared sorrowthat made the lump in her throat swell all over again orthallen had been her fathers good and trusted friend she hadnt thought about how he must be feeling but that pride of his might well have prevented him from making any great show of his own grief and who better to talk to he was safe enough with a wife he honored he had never ever given rise to a single rumor about his fidelity unlike far too many men in her court she had known him all her life shed cried on his shoulder before this who else was there reallyand she was beginning to think that if she didnt find someone she could talk to someone besides caryo that is she was going to crack talking to caryo was a little too much like talking to herself and besides even caryo was getting tired of how depressed and burdened with grief she was she looked up and met his eyes he tilted his head to the side in grave inquiry she nodded he smiled it was a sad weary smile the same sort that she often found on her own lips of late she smiled back folded the piece of paper and put it into her sleeve pocket for safekeeping feeling a little better already better enough at least to give the musicians her full attention for the rest of the concert rather than joining the people in the courtyard on their benches alberich paid out enough for seats on the secondfloor balcony that ran along the inside walls facing the courtyard a balcony that made up a sort of makeshift gallery it was marginally warmer here and the folks in the cheap seats were notoriously rowdy when the troupe had been playing in that tent there had been no balcony and the expensive seats had been in the first several rows not so here the courtyard was entirely enclosed by inn buildings behind the stage and the curtains that closed off the back of it were the stables not the sort of place where anyone would care to sit so using that wall as the back of the stage wasted no valuable space that could have accommodated paying customers the other three wings were the three stories of what was a typical market inn with an arched passage in the middle of what was in this configuration the back of the courtyard leading out into the street outside the ground floor of that wing divided as it was by the passage held two separate dining rooms a taproom for the common sorts of folk the drovers the shepherds the farmers who came to the market and the second an actual set of dining rooms one large dining room for the betteroff sort and several private parlors for the gentry or at least those with enough money that the innkeepers servants called them mlord and mlady whether or not they had any right to the title above that in the second and third stories since that wing both had the noisy dining areas on the first floor and faced the street were the cheapest of the sleeping rooms these were the sort where strangers packed in several to a room together on pallets laid so closely together that the room might just as well have been one big bed the right and left wings held more expensive sleeping rooms on the second and third floors with the kitchens on the ground floor of the lefthand wing and the servants quarters on the ground floor of the righthand wing when there wasnt a play on the balconies gave access to those rooms now however there were benches there where those willing to spend a bit extra could sit along the balcony railing the view was good from here and you werent going to find yourself harassed by someone whod paid less than the cost of a pint for his seat normally at least with most acting troupes the truly expensive seats were on the stage itself to the left and the right not with this lottheir energetic acrobatics made that a dangerous place to be and the entire stage was free of any such obstructions myste laid her arms along the balcony rail and parked her chin on them peering down at the stage with interest the courtyard was lit almost as well as the great hall of the palace with torches in holders on every supporting beam and shielded lanterns around the stage the thing about holding a play at night meant that the players could actually do some things with the scenerylike a paper moon with a lantern behind it or using foxfire smeared all over someones face if he was a ghost or as had occurred in the scene theyd just watched the softer dimmer light had made the shabby costumes and tinsel and paste gems of the lords and ladies at a grand festival look positively genuine this isnt as bad as i thought it would be she remarked to alberich in mindspeech true he replied this is actually one of the plays they do privately it was a tale of unlucky lovers who came from feuding families who met by accident at some celebration and of course were lifebonded at first sight the troupe were playing on current events by making the place of their first meeting the ice festivalwhich worked out very well since it allowed them to bundle up in their warmest costumes and of course the feud allowed for several of the signature acrobatic fight scenes down there on the stage the feud had been acted out by means of a confrontation in the first scene then several of the youngsters of both clans had gotten caught up by accident in the party following a wedding the hero and heroine had met and fallen instantly in love and had retired down on the stage the stagehands were scuttling about in the pause for the scenery change between the first and second acts i suppose theyre both going to end up dead in the end myste sighed alberich had seen this play before well it is a tragedy and in fact that was exactly what was going to happen hero and heroine would be wedded in secret in the second act in the third the feud would escalate into open warfare isolating them from one another as the city turned into a battlefield in the fourth act the lovers would arrange a desperate meeting intending to flee the city and seek the help of the king the heroines brother would discover the hero waiting with horses and challenge him the hero would attempt to placate him but to no avail he would find himself forced into the duel the brother would disarm him and just as the heroine arrived fatally wound him she would run screaming toward them both startled the brother would turn and she would be accidentally impaled on his sword and the lovers would die in each others arms not before forgiving the stricken brother however and extracting his vow to end the feud for all time not the worst of plays by any means and with enough action to please the male members of the audience i see at least a dozen people i know down in the audience myste remarked the most interesting thing is though thatlook see that baldheaded fellow down there stage left the one who seems to be in charge of the scene changing i know him very well the last time i saw him he was the butler foran officious little mercer i did regular work for i wonder how he got this job really well that could be interesting if he happened to recognize myste and even as that thought passed through alberichs mind the man looked up at their gallery blinked and peered upward at them through the torch smoke and lantern light he gave a tentative wave myste nodded and waved back he grabbed a passing boy said something to him pointed at myste and shoved him in the direction of the stairs a few moments later the boy clambered toward them scuze me mum but laric wants tknow if youre myste myste willenger the clerk the boy asked that i am myste replied without a moment of hesitation the boy grinned well mum then laric ud like ter talk with you arter the play if youve time an could use some work the boy continued cause hes got a job that needs doin myste grinned tell him thanks who cant use extra work the boy grinned back ill tell im mum with that he scrambled back down the stairs presumably to find the nowvanished laric myste settled down for the second act with a smile like a cat in cream well how about that for an opportunity dropping into our laps she asked alberich could only shake his head in amazement alberich and myste lingered after the end of the last act assuming that laric would seek them out as soon as the audience cleared out it was a reasonable assumption both of them assumed he would not have interrupted his urgent work to send up a boy if he hadnt intended to get to myste as soon as he could it wasnt comfortable sitting out there in the cold on the hard benches but both alberich and myste had the feeling that it just might be worth the wait and they were right as soon as the actors took their final bows the audience began to shove its way out once the actors were gone the audience lost interest in what to alberich was actually more interesting than the play itself in the torchlight there had been a certainsomethingthat had given an illusion of reality to the play now the illusion was coming apart bit by bit and it was fascinating to alberich to see how it had been put together in the first place first the lamps at the edge of the stage were blown out and gathered up and the stagehands began clearing away the properties on the stage carrying them back behind what had looked like a false front of several buildings made rather solidly of wood but it was now apparent that it wasnt wood at all nor solid but another canvas backdrop of the same sort that the troupe had used during the festival with no one being careful about how they moved around it the thing rippled and waved as people went behind it two other bits of business that stood on either side of the canvas hiding the edges looked a bit more solid they were only a single story tall though they had a pair of doors in them that the actors had used to come and go as two stagehands hauled off the horses that the hero and heroine were to have escaped on laric dashed out of one of the doors in the scenery onto the edge of the stage and peered up at the balcony heyla he shouted and waved at her she waved back myste stay right there for a bit while i tie things up myste nodded vigorously evidently that was enough for laric who dashed back through the false door again tie things up hmm she said cheerfully to alberich i hope that isnt literal that i could not tell you i know nothing ofall this alberich admitted waving vaguely at the stage and at precisely that moment the painted cloth at the back of the stage depicting the outer walls of several buildings dropped down to the stage with a bang along with the pole it was fastened to along the top behind it was another with a forest or garden scene it came down next and finally a third showing stalls of a market and skythat was the setting for the ice festival down it came revealing the bare front of the stables which was three stories tall like the rest of the inn though alberich could not for a moment imagine what they would need three stories for well this was a busy place with a lot of animals coming and going maybe they needed all that space for hay and straw storage a cheerfullooking little boy had been up at the top where there was a crane and a pulley with a rope still hanging from it apparently that was what the backdrops had been fastened to now he slid down from the upper loft of the stables on the rope there and he and another stagehand began rolling up the three backdrops on their poles with another bang one of the two pieces of scenery that screened each side of the backcloth fell over and two more men came up to haul it away the second one followed in short order in a remarkably short period of time not only had the sets and properties vanished into the stable so had the stage itself which apparently came apart although it seemed solid enough even with all of those actors leaping about on it that explained how the troupe had been able to get a stage into their tent that could take the amount of abuse they had been delivering with every performance alberich watched in fascination until there was nothing to be seen but a perfectly ordinarylooking inn courtyard with the stables at the rear and that was when laric emerged from the stable door again and wearily climbed the nearest staircase heading in their direction he mopped his red face with a handkerchief the size of a small sail as he came he was a very big man with an imposing belly redfaced with hair going thin at his temples and surprisingly honest eyes not that alberich was going to trust how someone looked to tell him anything about that persons real nature his clothing was ordinary enough a sheepskin vest over a heavy knitted tunic and moleskin breeches he wore shoes rather than boots but most city dwellers did if you had to go out in fresh snow that hadnt been shoveled or packed down yet and you didnt have boots you just wrapped your feet shoes and all in canvas and tied it around your calves with twine damme but if makin an honest livin aint the hardest work going he exclaimed as they both stood up myste where you been i got hauled in to stage manage for this idiot lot and just when i had some work for ye ye ups and vanishes she shrugged army needed clerks she said simply now it dont so they let me go back i came got some work at the companions bell but it aint fulltime well thats a break fer both of us he said genially whos yer friend bret she said without batting an eye carter from downcountry on the border army dont need carters now neither nothing more to haul down or up ah hard luck man the stage manager said with sympathy dont feel too sorry for him myste laughed the army may not need im but damnnear everyone else does he paid my way in tonight owed her one alberich said gruffly but with as much good humor as myste and doing his level best to minimize his accent bet er a meal an a rareeshow an she picked this warn ye mandont play cards with this one he hoped that someone who wasnt an actor wouldnt think twice about his accent and took the chance on actually saying something it was worth the risk the big man let out a bellylaugh without a single look askance myste you conned another country boy listen man youre lucky the stakes wasnt more than just a meal and a seat at a play laric responded wiping his eyes with that kerchief i learned that one a long time ago well a man looks at her face he dont think of card sharp alberich replied he thinks pen pusher which she is she is but shes got some system laric replied earnestly it aint cheatin but shes got the cards in her head somehow an she can figger the odds of whats coming up he shook his head i cant make it work but she can so we know bettern t play against her you get along bret myste said in a kindly tone of voice you got a load in the morning and we might be a while i can get back by myself im safe enough with laric she added just go wait at the bell and ill catch up with you righton he responded as if he was just a casual friend and leftthough with a lot more reluctance than he showed he didnt like leaving her alone even if she knew the man he didnt like the idea that she would be walking back to the bell alone even though this neighborhood and the ones between here and the bell were safe enough but he had no excuse to linger once myste had dismissed him and no place to wait for her to finish her business with the stage manager now he was sorry he hadnt scouted this area beforehand and found some place he could have holed up nearby if she was going to actually get involved with these people still she had her throwaway purse just like hed taught her if someone tried to rob her shed toss that purse away and run in the opposite direction and the three sheaves was very public even near the sleeping quarters there were people coming and going all night if something happened her companion would be out of the bells stable in a trice and on the way to help surely she couldnt get into trouble he hoped he returned to the bell alone going in through the hidden door in the back of the stable to the secret room there he changed his disguise for his gray leathers and waited impatiently in the heralds common room for her to return sitting right at the window so he could see her when she did or at least see her if she came anywhere near the front she wont kantor reminded him shell use the back just like you did alberich shes more used to moving around in a city than you are well that was true enough especially this city at least the reasonable parts of it it felt like half the night rather than just a candlemark or so before he heardrather than sawthe heraldchronicler at last im back everything went smoothly its a distinct advantage to go disguised as yourself dont get yourself in a knot alberich she said cheerfully ive got good news for you just let me change into my uniform he signaled a girl and ordered hot wine for both of them knowing that by now she must be frozen she was thankfully faster at changing her clothing than most women he had encountered the hot wine he ordered was barely on the table when she came in lenses glittering in the lamplightand fogging up in the transition from cold outside to warm and humid inside so she said without preamble sliding onto the bench across from him she took off her lenses to polish them on a napkin before replacing them on her nose heres what weve got you want to know how norris started up this whole show in the first place all information is useful he admitted so ive learned she took a sip of wine there were a lot of people displaced by the tedrels as you know and quite a few of them ended up here in haven your boy norris is supposed to be from near the rethwellan border and managed to get separated from the entertainment troupe hed been with laric didnt say how and i didnt ask supposedly he hitched up with a caravan doing acrobatics to amuse everyone around the fire at night and ended up at the three sheaves along with the caravan supposedly the rest of his group was going to come up to haven and find him and they never did he wasnt minded to sign up with the army but he was running up a big bill at the inn when he got the idea to put together his own new troupe from some of the other ragtags of entertainers that were drifting in so he could pay that bill without getting put to work in the kitchen thats the story anyway i suspect at least part of its true hes definitely an actor and hes better than anyone else of the bunch hes got em all charmed thats for sure and now that theyre doing just as well as he promised they would there isnt a one of them will hear a word against him i dont know if hes from rethwellen because hes damn good at putting on and taking off accents he did at least four in my presence alberich almost choked on his wine you saw him you talked to him myste shrugged it was after i made the bargain with laric we were looking over the office im going to use he swanned in with two women on his arms laric told him i was going to be checking the books he looked at me saw a dowdy lump wafted a little charm in my direction just to keep his hand in and promptly forgot me as soon as he turned around and headed out the door i told you that its useful being a clerk nobody ever pays any attention to us even that business with card counting larics the only one who ever caught on i was doing it everybody else just figured i was lucky evidently so alberich managed how close a call had it been he wished he had been there to see norris reaction with his own eyes anyway heres the thing the innkeeper is the one taking in the receipts at the door because he takes his room and board for the troupe right off the top and now that theyve gotten popular laric thinks hes skimming but nobody else can manage to cipher for the numbers that theyre bringing in of an evening now so from now on im going to go every night theyre putting on a playwhich is once every two nightsand go over the books the headcount and the innkeepers tally she grinned and im doing it all from the room next to norris which is larics office which means that ill be in a position to tell you when hes there where hes gone if he isnt when hes likely to be back and to leave my own window open for someone to come and go if you want to search his room for papers i can make it happen alberich stared at her and for how long will this go on that i dont know she admitted laric wants me to come regularly at first then taper off he thinks and i agree with him that if the innkeeper is skimming its going to be better not to confront him on it just bring me in they know what i was at the three sheaves and theyll know why im in larics office with the tally boards if the innkeeper knows were watching him hell be honest and by comparing the take over time well know if hes been honest in the past and knowing that laric has me on tap will probably keep him honest when i stop coming around so earliest on the best of our chances will be alberich didnt like that particularly but there was an old saying that beggars didnt get to pick what they were given and another that it didnt pay to inquire too closely about the age of a gift horse or in my case the color of his eyes kantor said wickedly and myste was right the best way to find out what norris was passing was to search his room for the papers before he got rid of them which meant that alberich was going to have to find a way to copy them because they might be in code and he certainly wasnt going to be able to memorize them even if they werent is there perhaps a way to copy such things he asked several she assured him rubbings if hes using graphite or a crayon damppaper transfer if hes using ink i can show you we do that all the time to make emergency copies of course she added judiciously when you do that you get a mirrorimage but thats no great problem alberich took in a deep breath and let it out in a sigh mystevery well have you done thank you she made a face well if youre doing the dangerous bitand i assume itll be you climbing in that window and not some lowlife from around exiles gate that you hiredim doing the tedious part here i was pleased id finally gotten out of doing accounts and here i am back into it then she sighed and looked out the window and on top of my real work too worse it could be alberich reminded her on the battlefield we could be she gave him a wry glance well she admitted there is that ill try to keep it in mind when im trying to hide you or throw you out a window because your lad norris came back early and there just wasnt much he could say to that so wisely he said nothing at all but as myste had pointed out just because they were involved in this afterhours clandestine work it did not make their normal duties go away he had his full set of classes to train and as the season edged toward spring the snow began to thaw and the blustery winds began to blow it became more and more of a challenge to hold classes out of doors at least that wretched game of hurlee was put on hold for the ice on the ponds was getting rotten and not to be trusted but the ground was alternately frozen mud or slushy snow so the game couldnt be transferred to some sort of playing field and oh yes he had already heard that there were plans afoot for that though the players would have to run rather than sliding the next thing hed probably hear was that the heraldic trainees were going to try it companionback meanwhile the replacement mirror finally arrived and was installed the two miscreants who began that particular adventure were as responsible for creating the new one as destroying the old one being the ones who had spent an interminable amount of time polishing it to rid it of as many defects as possible both deans decreed that their term of punishment at the glassworks was at an end although they would still be serving doublechores at the collegium for well into the summer they had missed the entire hurlee season and whenever an animated discussion of the game began their faces were a study in adolescent disappointment alberich wasnt at all surprised if ever there were two rascals who might have been born to play a game like hurlee it was those two and it occurred to him that this alone might be the worst punishment that could have been inflicted on them they had missed out on the creation of the game they had missed out on becoming some of the first experts from now on the best they could hope for was to play catchup to some other ascendant star and in a way he felt just a little guilty for if it hadnt been for his own curiosity about where they had picked up their wild ideas he would never have investigated the actors and never have known that there was something going on he still didnt know what it was of course but at least he knew there was something now he had a fighting chance to discover what it was and whether or not it was dangerous nevertheless he had an important duty to perform right there at the collegium and it was one that he could not give less than his total attention to during the hours when he was teaching and no few of the hours outside of that time he was training those who would one day become heralds how to stay alive when other people wanted them dead and that was a massive task it began with the youngest or the least experiencednot necessarily the same thing as his tutelage of myste had provenand the basic skills of hand and eye coordination and familiarity with weapons and while they were learning these things he was studying them to determine what their lifelong weaknesses would be for there had never been a person born who had so perfect a physique that he didnt have one and how to make them aware of the fact then he would move them into the next stage of their traininghow to compensate for those weaknesses by then they were roughly halfway through their years as trainees they had mastered basic skills and they were as strong and flexible and coordinated as they were ever likely to get there were exceptions to that last of course but those were the exceptions that proved the rule if they had found him a hard master before he was harder still at that point because no one no one ever likes having a weakness pointed out and human nature is such that when one is pointed out the natural reaction is to try to deny it exists which was why he would go from master to monster at that point until not even the most persistently selfdelusional could continue to believe anything other than that the problem was real and something had to be done about the problem sometimes the weaknesses were physicalrestricted peripheral vision for instance sometimes they were mental often they were emotional and the biggest lay in the very natures of those who were chosen as heralds these youngsters did not believe in the goodness and decency of their fellow man they knew it it was fundamental to their souls and he had to somehow prove to them that their fellow man was very likely to plant a knife in the middle of their backs without destroying that deep and primitive knowledge as heralds they had to go into every day expecting that the people around them would all act as ordinary fallible but decent human beings who given the chance would act decently and humanely they also had to be prepared for the eventuality that those around them would do nothing of the sortand be able to cope with such a contradiction without going a little mad not that all heralds werent already a little mad butnot that kind of mad then once the weaknesses had been identified and acknowledged he had to train them to compensate for the weaknesses it would have been infinitely easier to do this had his students been say karsite cadets only physical and mental weaknesses would have to be dealt with because emotional weaknesses literally did not matter to the sunsguard so long as they were locked down tightlyand he could have proven those weaknesses to them with sheer brute force by persistently attacking them at those weak points until even a blind man could see what was wrong persuasion always took a lot longer than hammering something home he was generally in that last stage only with those who were in the last year of their trainee statusit was far far easier to work with these trainees who were quite ready for whites if only they had a little more experience and skill for them he was a mentor not a monster it had occurred to him and more than once that here in the collegium the trainees were put through a kind of forcedmaturation process that sent them out into the greater world at eighteen nineteen or twenty with the mental and emotional skills of someone well in his thirties or older alas most of his time was spent in being the tyrant with the heart of stone this was never more true than when the energy level of those in his class was such that the students were near to bouncing off walls as they entered the door of the salle and he turned them right around and took them outside to run their drills in the mud the slush the halffrozen snow and no matter if it was too wretched out to be doing any such thing cold dampness and dirt werent going to harm them any if they got too cold he knew the signs and always sent them back into the salle to warm up at the oven not that there was any chance of getting cold enough to fall ill unless something odd happened to keep them standing about soaked to the skin the blues of course were exempt from this if they chose however if they declared their unwillingness in such a way as to be insubordinate rather than merely electing not to show up for lessons he had a weapon to either bring them to heel or get rid of them entirely such as todaywith one of the classes that was in their middle and most difficult period of development and they roared into his salle already in full antagonist mode the battle lines were already drawn blues versus trainees one ringleader facing off for each side the insults were flying blows would follow in a moment except that alberich waded right into the middle of it and sent both of them to the floor with a blow to the ear and the silence that descended was absolute well he said crisply before it begins i care not how it started nor who started it you brought it into my salle you will take it out again there will be no second mirror to be replaced a nervous titter came from behind him he didnt turn to look neither boy had moved and he gave them both looks that should have turned them to ice i said he enunciated carefully you will take it outside you wish to fight well enough outside it ends when i say it ends and i will be the judge of the winner the trainee on the floor had the sense to go pale he at least must have some inkling of what alberich meantwhich was to let the fight go on until they were both too exhausted bruised and battered to stand there would be no winner short of one of the two being knocked unconscious which with the bare hands of a pair of boys fundamentally unskilled in barehand fighting was unlikely this was actually why alberich did not teach barehand fighting to anyone who had not passed into that third and final stage of development but the blue was one of alberichs personal headaches arrogant assertive and unfortunately skilled enough to have earned the right to a part of that arrogance alberich would have gladly rid himself of the boykadhael corbieif he could have unfortunately that was out of his hands kadhael was in the class unless and until he took himself out of it the boy looked him up and down and sneered no he said someone gasped alberich did not move and did not change his expression by so much as a hair i do not believe i heard you correctly he said evenly trying to suppress the thrill of glee the boys insolent answer gave him what precisely did you say i said no no i am not going outside no i am not fighting by your rules who are you to give me orders old man alberich smiledand kadhael took one look at the smile and suddenly realized that he had made so fundamental a mistake that there was not going to be any evasion of the consequences i he said quietly and with the perfect and precise control of valdemaran grammar that came upon him in moments of stress am the collegium weaponsmaster as such when i choose to exercise my rank within the four walls of my salle and on its grounds i outrank by valdemaran law every man woman and child in valdemar save only the monarch and within these four walls the monarch is my equal not my superior and it was all perfectly true how else could he properly teach the sons and daughters of the highborn how else could he train highranking guards how could he drill the greatest warriors and nobles of the realm how could he ever train the heirs if he did not outrank them to properly train there would be injuries they might be serious and the weaponsmaster could not be held responsible for such injuries to be trained the weaponsmaster must know his orders would be obeyed and the only way to be sure of that was to see that his rank on these grounds was higher than anyone elses in the land which was whythough he had not learned this until after dethor had retiredhe had that special status within the salle and on the grounds kadhael looked as if the blow alberich had given him had knocked every particle of sense right out of his head he stared he gaped he looked as if he could not rightly understand a word of what had been said but and since you choose not to abide by the laws of this my kingdom alberich continued still smiling i banish you now and forever what kadhael stammered out go do not ever present yourself as my pupil you may tell your father why you are not here or not i care not i will report this matter to the queen the lord marshal and the provost marshalsince you are not a trainee i shall not trouble any of the deans with it you cant do this kadhael protested wildly paling alberich knew why kadhaels father had watched alberich fight and train the guards for months before the boy had been sent to the salle with a class kadhaels father knew that there was not enough money in valdemar to purchase the services of a trainer as good as alberich kadhaels father would be very very unhappy about this i can i have alberich eyed the boy consideringly should he oh go ahead do kantor answered he bent down and grabbed the boy by the back of his tunic and hauled him to his feet without much effort be it addedkadhael was just about alberichs size and weight but he was still an uncoordinated adolescent not a trained honed warrior alberich tightened his grip just enough that the fabric halfchoked the boy eliminating any more babble out of him i will because you do not seem to understand your own tongue properly repeat myself alberich said with no anger whatsoever you are banished from the salle and the grounds you are no longer a student here you are leaving now and you will never return if you do i will personally thrash you until you cannot stand and throw you off the grounds again training here is a privilege not a right you have just proved you do not deserve to enjoy that privilege and with that he frogmarched the boy out the door down the path to the very edge of the training grounds and with great care and utmost precision he pitched the insolent brat right into the biggest muddiest patch of slush that he thought he could reach he did not even wait to see if kadhael went headfirst into it or managed to somehow save himself he turned on his heel and marched back into his salle no one had moved this was good he wasnt going to have to discipline anyone elseyet he raked them all with his stony gaze more objections do i hear he asked raising one eyebrow silence then outside you will go all of you he turned a stern gaze on the trainee who was still sitting on the floorosberic that was the boys name osberic he continued and the trainee flinched since no opponent you have now yet equally of guilt you are to have brought a fight within my walls it will be me that you face fetch two staves and follow even practice swords i will not ruin in this muck he would not be too hard on him putting him on his face or back into the mud two or three times would be enough he started the fight kantor put in not that kadhael wasnt trying to goad him into starting it but he did start it all right four teach the boy to hold his temper good answer im going to watch alberich smiled as he walked out into the cold again and saw that there was no sign of kadhael other than a vaguely humanshaped depression in the slush please do the boys had formed up in a rough circle and osberic came up to alberich with two fighting staffs and a hangdog look alberich took one without looking at it consequences osberic he said as he squared off against the boy who began circling him warily say i will not that a herald loses not his temperbut aware a herald is that consequences there are for doing so his staff shot out at anklelevel tripping osberic down he went he picked himself back up and aimed a blow at alberichs head alberich blocked it riposted and let the boy block him so think youhad there a fight been what consequences there would be uh osberic tried again was blocked again lord corbie would get me in trouble wrong alberich flipped the staff at osberics ankles the boy dodged and alberich flipped the other end around to thwack him in the buttocks and send him into the slush again lord corbie would protest to the queen who would be forced to go to the dean who would have to answer to why discipline was so lax among the trainees that a highborn fought a trainee osberic picked himself up flushing my fight would get the heralds in trouble correct alberich let the boy try a few more blows not bad but he wasnt going to get through alberichs defenses any time soon and who else the queen osberic hazarded correct now why will there be no trouble for what i did with kadhael corbie osberic didnt answer being a little too busy fending off a flurry of blows from alberich only to trip over a hardened lump of snow and land on his backside in an icy puddle that should count kantor said from the sideline i agree because alberich continued as osberic picked himself back up for the third time a proper and correct order gave i insolence i was given my proper authority i exertedno temper no beatings no punishments and only when more insolence and refusal was i given did i remove kadhael with prejudice to his father he will go yes but his father will likely box his ears now know you why i am drilling you thus osberic came at alberich yet again alberich let the boy drive him back to punish me osberic shouted his cheeks burning with humiliation to make me look stupid in front of everyone no that would the act of a bully be alberich told him so that should lord corbie protest it was you who began the fight i can tell the queen that you were punished and all here will swear to that this is not for you it is for the heralds that all know that we tend to the misdeeds of our own in proper measure he then neatly sidestepped the last rush and tripped osberic as he went past once again osberic measured his length in the mud a herald cannot merely right be osberic a herald must guided by the law be he cannot dispense the law if he follows it not himself he cannot dispense the law if he thinks himself immune from it he cannot dispense the law if he will not deal it to his fellows in the same measure as he does to those whom he has in charge yessir herald alberich osberic groaned from the ground and that is why for fighting you have also been punished in this way alberich continued now back into the salle there is work to be done they were all quick to follow the order but none so quick as osberic kadhael corbie disappeared from the court and collegia entirely not that alberich would have noticed his absence having banned the boy from the salle but it wasnt long before there were murmurs and speculations among his students and the courtand being that it was his business to know things he heard every one of them rumor had it that the boys father was so enraged that he had gotten himself thrown out of alberichs class and forbidden to enter the salle that hed sent the boy straight down to the family manor there to languish in what the young lords and ladies called rustification since it was said to be a particularly dull and cheerless place lacking in anything that a young man might find amusing and since rumor also had it that lord corbie had sent orders for his son to be confined to the house and grounds until further notice alberich was perfectly satisfied that the punishment fit the crime on the other side of the table lord corbie went to selenay and also demanded the punishment of the trainee who started it and allegedly was nonplussed to learn that the trainee had already been punished and that the punishment fit his crime since all he had done was to bring a fight into the salle and after being reprimanded had behaved with the proper respect for the weaponsmaster the trouncingwith lectureat the hands of the weaponsmaster in front of his peers was deemed both painful and humiliating enough even for lord corbie and lord corbie had been quite taken aback to learn that it had all happened within moments of kadhaels expulsion without knowing much about the man but intuiting a great deal from the behavior of his son alberich doubted that humiliation of kadhael at the hands of that foreigner would ever be forgotten or forgiven but at least there was nothing overt that lord corbie could do about the incident alberich had exercised precisely the correct amount of authority hed been defied he banished the offender not from any other classes at any other part of the three collegia only from his own he had indeed ejected the boy by forcebecause the boy would have gone on defying him if alberich hadnt physically thrown him off the premises he had not exceeded his authority and in point of fact alberich could have given the boy a taste of what osberic had gotten and hadnt in fact kadhael had gotten off lightly at alberichs hands and not only was there no denying it but both the lord marshal and the provost marshal who was in charge of discipline on and off the collegia grounds said loudly and publicly that they would have boxed both his ears until he was deaf nevertheless lord corbie would not like the man who had rejected his son he would not like the collegium nor the organization that had given him the authority to do so one more enemy but alberich was used to those by now he would have to watch his back but when had he ever done anything else and sure enough within days there were rumors in the court about how the weaponsmaster was abusing his pupils abusing his authority treating heraldic trainees with indulgence and punishing blues arbitrarily a few blues were quietly absent from his class after that but there was not a great deal that he could do about thatnor truth to be told wished to do as for osbericaccording to kantor that very evening when the trainees bruises started aching and he started feeling particularly sorry for himself his companion had given him a good talkingto whether this was delivered in the form of a lecture or with sympathy kantor didnt saybut one thing was certain when companions took it upon themselves to correct their chosen the lesson tended to stick osberic was certainly properly contrite the next day and if there was still a great deal of moaning about alberichs hardheartedness at least no one among the heraldic trainees was claiming he was a bully or a sadist hardhearted he could live with in fact the more hardhearted they thought him the better off they would be in the long run though shortly after the kadhael incident there was one little lad who would not have agreed with that estimation he was one of the tedrel orphans brought in by the companion cheric the very same day as osberic and kadhaels chastisement it took a day or two to get him settled into the collegium so alberich didnt see him until his mentor trainee rotherven brought him by himself to the salle shortly after the last class of the day alberich was overseeing a set of guards working out with maces when the door to the salle opened and a finalyear trainee came in with a very small boy at his side alberich left the two to continue their bout and walked over to the door where they waited politely this is a new trainee weaponsmaster rotherven said leading the young boy by the handa very young boy indeed no more than seven if alberich was any judge he was rather angular with an unruly thatch of nocolored hair but very intelligent eyes and a look about him that was vaguely familiar and when he got a good look at the weaponsmaster the boy gaped at him with shockthen awethen spun to look up at his mentor with a look just short of accusation you did not tell me this was the great rider the child exclaimed and alberich knew immediately by the trace of a karsite accent that this must be one of the children brought out of the tedrel camp after the end of that final battle great rider rotherven said his brow furrowed with puzzlement but never mind i understand him alberich interrupted he looked down at the boy with some bemusement so that was why the boy looked vaguely familiar he was karsite or at least half karsite most of the hillfolk shepherds were mongrels by sunpriest standards anyway so he saidin karsite we have another of the suns children come to be a white rider eh this one must not have been too damaged by his experiences or he wouldnt have been chosen so very young there are others here not as white riders but as selenays pages you wont be alone oh relief suffused the boys features i did not know that great rider alberich looked up at rotherven selenay has perhaps five or six tedrel orphans in her service as pages they are see that this lad meeting them is please perhaps a playfellow he will find among them then he looked back down at the boy and continued the conversation in karsite also there is priest gerichen a true man of the sunlord you may go with the others to the temple of the sunlord if you wishthough they do not call it that here but rather the temple of the lord of light and if you do not wish to do so you need not you are free to serve who you wish here i still serve the sunlord great rider the boy said quietly the sunlord of the prophecy then you will find his house yonder in haven and gerichen at his altar alberich replied suppressing a smile at the childs solemn demeanor it was quaint and charming but a little sad also those children had been forced to grow up far too quickly i have it on the best authority that he approves of the white riders and all they stand for and that there is nothing in the pledges that a white rider must make that run counter to his will quite the opposite in fact in serving as a white rider you will also serve him you will be a hope and an example to our people and repay some of the debt to those who saved and succored us as i try to do the childs face took on a look of fierce pride and determination i will not fail you great rider he said in tones that made it a vow i will not fail the prophecy rothervens expression of bemusement as he looked from alberich to the boy and back again made alberich very glad that he had a great deal of practice in keeping his own face under control or he might have laughed aloud it is a great responsibility alberich replied as gravely as if the child was three times his actual age and a signal honor i do know that great rider the child said nodding cheric has told me so and it isall i could ever wish to be excuse me herald alberich but i was supposed to tell you that young theodren here is one of the orphans rotherven said then laughed selfconsciously but obviously you already know that i do but i thank you alberich replied and turned back to the boy so i am glad to see you theodren you will be learning weapons at my handsas any other trainee and you must call me herald alberich not great rider i am no greater than any of the other heraldsthe white riders we are all brothers and sisters yes herald alberich the boy gave an odd little salute that he must have learned from the tedrels i was afraid when my friend rotherven said i was to be given over to weapons lessons now i am not he smiled i was afraid the training would be likethe bad place it will be hard but not like that other place i promise you alberich said and turned back again to rotherven he will be in the beginners class of coursejust following luncheon that would be yes sir the trainees expression told alberich everything he needed to know evidently theodren had been properly terrified when hed been told he was to learn weapons work and rothervens solution had been to bring him directly to alberich so that he could see his teacher for himself or perhaps the suggestion had come from rothervens companion who had been no mere colt when rotherven was chosen thank you for talking to him i think hell settle now and i was a bit worried about him alberich nodded you have done exactly what was needed bringing him here my thanks and to theodren this young man is also my pupil and he will be as a brother to you as well as a brother rider you may give him your trust he will also see that you meet the others brought out of the camp that are now in selenays service and perhaps you may find a friend or two among them as well the childs eyes shone with gratitude thank you herald alberich then theodren looked up at rotherven and said in valdemaran that was much better than alberichs thank you for bringing me to the salle rotherven herald alberich is the chief of those who came to save us and i am honored to be taught by him it was so formal and so charming that rotherven couldnt help but smile it was a kind smile and alberich knew at that moment that the older boy had been a good choice to watch over theodren well good and now youve met all your teachers so lets get some dinner youll be back here after luncheon tomorrow alberich escorted them to the door of the salle then watched the two of them off up the path back to the collegium as they disappeared into the twilight shadows he felt kantor coming up beside him he put his hand on kantors shoulder and felt the companions silken hide beneath his palm warm and smooth cheric cant mindspeak him very clearly yet and the little lad was petrified kantor told him he thought he was about to be put into one of those vile boys bands that the tedrels used to toughen the boys nasty training if you could call it training kept them on short rations more or less forced them to steal if they were going to keep from going hungry but beat them within an inch of their lives if they got caught weapons training with real edged weaponsif you got hurt or died too bad every infraction was punished with a beating in fact small wonder he was terrified well im glad he recognized me i only hope he doesnt heroworship me alberich sighed though it might be pleasant for me it would do him no good i wouldnt necessarily agree with that kantor nudged him affectionately you could do with a little heroworship adoration is for the sunlord i am content with respect alberich replied but rubbed kantors ears with affection so long as i have the friendship of my companion and a few good comrades i am content piff i can think of one other thing you could do with kantors eyes sparkled with mischief and alberich had a very good idea what he was talking about but he pretended otherwise after all it was usually kantor who managed a jest on alberich rather than the other way around yes indeed he replied blandly i could do with my dinner and he laughed aloud at kantors exasperated snort the following day was very much business as usual although during the day he found himself looking forward much more than usual to dinner because myste had sent down a note asking if she could join him then he didnt know why and she didnt tell him probably it had something to do with the players since she clearly was comfortable with them and was not going to have to act in order to fit herself into a persona he had elected to leave her to get used to the situation and her employers to get used to her before he asked her to actually do anything hed told her to let him know when she thought she was ready and that was probably why she wanted to meet him over dinner and yetwell he wouldnt be disappointed if it wasnt the business of the actors that brought her when she arrived with the servant that brought his dinner as usual helping to carry the baskets he did note that her step was definitely light and that there was more than a mere suspicion of a smile on her face but she only spoke of commonplace thingsmore rumors about kadhael in fact and more slurs about alberich himselfuntil the servant had gone and when he bent to uncover the first of the supper dishes she held out a hand forestalling him dinner can wait for a moment she said as always when she was with him speaking in karsite it was an effective hedge against anyone who might somehow have gotten in close enough to be listening not that alberich expected anyone to manage for hed have to get past the companions to do so but sometimes trainees dared each other to particularly stupid pranks and it would be just his luck for one of them to sneak in to eavesdrop on the weaponsmaster and overhear something he shouldnt i assume you have a reason he replied she nodded first i want you to see these and she handed him a folded packet of paper the paper itself was odd thin very light very strong he unfolded it and knew immediately what it was because it was in cipher and there was only one place at the moment where myste would have gotten a packet of papers in cipher they were the same papersor more of the samethat hed seen passed from norris to devlin no theyre not myste said immediately as if she had read his mind not that she needed to she would know exactly what he was thinking at that moment in this case its a packet that was passed the other way from devlin to norris he looked from it to her and back again speechless for a moment buthow did you her grin widened and she sat down with an air of triumph he gave them to me alberich also sat down then he had to his knees wouldnt hold him if youre joking im not she replied with satisfaction i swear im not he gave them to me with his own lilywhite hands and do you know why she laughed a rich and satisfied chuckle because my friend he wanted me to copy them for him alberich had thought himself too surprised to react to anything by that point but he felt his mouth gaping open and shut it and swallowed i think he said at last that you must tell me this from the beginning but first he leaned over and poured both of them a full cup of wine he had a strong need for a drink just now myste laced the fingers of both hands together over her knee and looked as satisfied as a cat with a jug full of cream in front of her sometimes she said with a touch of pardonable smugness the person you need to keep an eye on someone isnt a spy or a tough bullyboy sometimes it is exactly the kind of middleaged dowdy forgettable little frump that no one looks twice at you arent dowdy or forgettable he said without thinking or a frump she looked inordinately pleased at that but didnt interrupt her story it didnt take me long to get their books straight and yes the innkeeper has been skimming and yes he stopped immediately when he knew i was there to check on him so since i was there anyway both the players and their other staff started coming to me for other little things you know the odd letter from home to be read or written arranging with a goldsmith to put something away for a rainy day that sort of thing and king norris would come sailing by now and again vaguely note that i was there and be off againand whenever he came by i always made sheeps eyes at him which is exactly what he expected women throw themselves at him all the time and if i hadnt acted infatuated he might have suspected something well that was how things stood right up until last night when we had aninteresting situation oh alberich prompted theyd done a reducedcast play for a private audience in the afternoon and all the leads had to hurry back to the inn to do the main play that evening she said her lenses gleaming he didnt have to see her eyes to know that there was great satisfaction in them so im sitting there in the office with folded hands nothing much to do and in comes norris himself and for once hes looking for me can you make a fair copy of something without knowing the language he asks i gave him a look she tilted her head slightly and showed alberich the expression of dazzled infatuation she must have given norris and i said of course i can im a clerk if we stopped to actually read what were copying wed never get half the work done that we do eye to hand to paper and no stopping at the brain thats us and before i can say anything else he dropped this in front of me she indicated the packet and some paperif you can believe itthats even lighter than this is im in a hurry says he and i havent time to do this myself i need that transcribed in the smallest hand you can manage onto that paper then burn the original and i need it by the time im off the stage tonight i looked at him like i didnt care so long as the job was for him and didnt ask why he didnt tell me he just rushed straight out and i heard the wardrobe mistress screeching for him so he must have been late for costuming the rest is easy enough i made his copy and tossed the original out the window to aleirian who carried it away good god he breathed i wouldnt have thought of that i didnt she admitted aleirian did anyway then i kept an ear out to gauge the progress of the play copied as many pages of the original again in the original size as i could fit in the time left made them the top sheets in a stack of blanks and when he got offstage and came for his papers he saw that packet merrily burning away and assumed id burned the original the way i was told he was damned careful too he stayed there until all the papers were burned then broke up the ash until there wasnt a fragment the size of the head of a nail then he went off i assume that he must have gotten the originals at that private performance and i guess that my copies must have gone out that night because he just flew out the door with them it wouldnt have been hard you could have rolled the lot up and hidden them practically anywhere i can probably find out who and where when we know what is in these he replied absently unable to believe his good luck what did he do when you gave him the copy besides watch the papers burn well he made an excuse for hanging about while he made sure the papers were gone by pouring charm all over me until i was practically gagging on it she replied a chuckle in her voice and i gazed at him adoringly like he expected me to and hung on his every word and vowed that if i could ever do something for him again he had only to ask he went away never thinking twice about having entrusted me with papers in cipher surely they couldnt be that lucky youre sure it wasnt some sort of trap he said warningly well of course anything is possible she replied but he wasnt expecting a herald or aleirian and wellalberich i know that kind of man i ran into them all the time when i was a girl and my best friend was the prettiest girl in our quarter she sighed and for a moment that good humor and sparkle faded the first time and even the second and third that a handsome boy came and poured that kind of charm and flattery all over me i fell for itbut after three times of being fooled and finding out that they were only being nice to me because they wanted to meet my friend i became immune to it his mouth formed a silent oh she shrugged its one of those things that plain girls learn alberich you just get used to it after a while well your lad norris might be one of the best in valdemar at charming people but someone like me she shook her head actually hes never encountered someone like me i suspect because we wont throw ourselves at him we know better hell never even see the plain ones who are on to his little gamethey might be at the performances and theyll certainly admire his acting ability but so far as lingering on the off chance theyll meet him it will never happen so he looked at me and saw a plain frumpy little mouse with a little mouses job who looked at him with eyes of adoration and figured he knew exactly what i was and how he could use me and best of all he wouldnt have to actually do more than give me a bit of attention because someone like me would never ever expect someone like him would want to romance me the cynical laugh she uttered at that moment made him wince and he wondered then about the young girl in lenses whod been tricked three times by manipulative boys oh no a crumb of attention to cherish in the darkness of my little closet of a room thats all he needed to give id be his slave forever and never demand anything out of him myste he swallowed i apologize she started and stared at him for what she asked for people like him he shook his head i am sorry she laughed again but this time the humor was back in her voice good gods alberich dont be trust me the injuries to my heart such as they were scabbed over a long time ago and the scar is a useful reminder if i hadnt been hurt and used by all those heartless boys back in the day id never have been able to see right through your lad norris would i so dont think im living with a tragic past good gods compared to at least half of the others that have gone through these walls its a teacup tragedy at worst and a farce at best she winked at him besides i saw my pretty best friend not long ago shes tripled in size shes had a baby a year and her handsome husband chases tavern girls have pity for her not me ah he felt a good deal better at least she wasnt likely to reject him out of hand if besides she chuckled again it gives me an appreciation for men who blurt out youre not a frump and not some carefully rehearsed speech who say it without even thinking about it and who then go on to apologize for the vagaries of their sex ah he felt his face burning er i think you might be sitting too near the fire was all she said then now about dinner we shouldnt let it get cold lord orthallen had asked had requested in writing an informal meeting with selenay she had invited him to dinner in her own suite not alone of course theyd be surrounded by servants but it would certainly be informal she was intensely curious the note had a certain apologetic tone to it that she couldnt quite put her finger on the first course arrived and was complimented without her curiosity being satisfied she sipped her wine as the second course was plated and served she felt she could afford to be patient my dear selenay said lord orthallen at last over the third course i have done you a grave disservice she motioned to a page to refill his wineglass yes my lord she said somberly i think you have she was not going to pretend that she did not know exactly what he was talking about he had been the prime instigator of that wretched plot to get her married off and she was not in the least happy about it and what was more she intended for him to know it he sighed and grimaced a little in my own defense i was trying to protect valdemar from being in the precarious position of having no heir but i am afraidtruly and sincerely selenay i was afraid i was dreadfully afraid and i still am i never dreamed we would be in this position sendar should have been king for decades yet you are a very young woman and we have just fought a hideous war and valdemar needs to look strong not vulnerable i know orthallen she replied with spirit and with some heat but didnt it occur to you that rushing me into a marriage is going to do the very opposite of making us look strong why would i suddenly wed the first candidate presented to me if i wasnt desperate i might as well send out letters to every likely ally we have saying that im up for sale to the highest bidder she frowned at him and he looked pained i know i know orthallen replied flushing and if i had possessed any sensitivity or common sense where you are concerned i would have come directly to you rather than laying it all out in front of the council so it was your idea selenay gave him a hint of the anger she felt in her gaze shed been certain it was all along as had some of the others but now at last he had admitted it to my shame he nodded not that the men we presented are not fine my lord she said interrupting him with exasperation as well as a feeling of real depression although i would give a very great deal to be like other young ladies and at least be able to dream of finding a great romantic love i am not and i know it she heard her own voice retaining its steady reasonable tone despite the lump in her throat and felt a moment of pride at her own selfcontrol i am queen and when i wedwhich i must for the people would not accept an heir born out of wedlockit is for valdemar not myself but my father did find a lady who suited him well enough that he never remarried and i at least hope to be able to find a friend if not a lover i will not find such a consort by being rushed into an imprudent marriage and i cannot find one if i have twelve dozen potential husbands shoved at me every time i turn about orthallen flushed again sendar might not have been in love with your mother when they agreed to marry he said quietly but he came to love her deeply and she him and they were great good friends before they wed she spread her hands wide ignoring the fork in one of them so you see that i am right indeed i do see he agreed and i was wrong very wrong i was just afraid that he laughed selfconsciously well there are a number of fine young foreign princes out there younger sons whose fathers would be very happy to cement an advantageous alliance with us perhaps too advantageous especially if one of them managed to make you infatuated with him my thought was thatwell at the least we could keep your interest here at home she sniffed he took the hint well you have given me every reason to agree with your point of view and i believe you have convinced me i will approach my fellow councilors and suggest that the subject should be tabled for the foreseeable futureand i will insist that our queen is wise enough to choose her own future husband without our help she exhaled a long sigh of genuine relief and i thank you for that orthallen you cannot know just how much easier that makes me feel oh perhaps i do i little he replied genially your father was none too pleased at the prospect himself and he was not even king when the idea of marriage was first broached to him as the meal progressed orthallen first told her about her fathers reluctant search for a prospective bride and how he had eventually settled on her mother when after a month went by without her throwing herself at his feet he asked her whyor rather why not after all every other young woman of rank and spirit had and she told him that she would on the whole prefer to be his sister than his wife orthallen laughed shaking his head and when he asked her why she told him that she had more desire for his library than for him all this was new to selenay she stared at him not quite believing it and what did he say that he would rather at least have someone he could talk to and that anyone who wanted his books that badly was someone who could hold an interesting conversation orthallen smiled she certainly intrigued him and i think most of what intrigued him at first was that she wasnt trying to intrigue him she really felt that way she was inordinately shy you know and then when she proposed to him she made him agree that she would participate as little as possible in court life before shed even entertain the merest idea of marriage with him but she was happy selenay felt she had to know oh very orthallen assured her and by the end of a year of marriage as much in love with sendar as any woman could be and he with her remarkable really usually the most one can expect from a marriage of state is an easy partnershipa business relationship of a kind her heart sank a little at that and selenay couldnt help wondering if that was what she was fated to have and she changed the subject nevertheless before the dinner was half over she found that she had confided a great deal in lord orthallen and not the least of those confidences involved her own barelyarticulate wishes forwellromance she was rather surprised at herself for spilling so much into his willing ears and even more surprised when he seemed sympathetic and not at all dismissive hes certainly easier to talk to than talamir she said to caryo after hed gone on that subject a doorpost would be easier to talk to than talamir caryo replied sadly at least orthallen is well rooted in the hereandnow enough to know that a young woman queen though she is deserves to at least be able to dream poor talamir poor talamir indeed but at least now and with caryos tacit approval selenay had someone she could confide in and to her mild surprise she found that it helped a little enough that she went to sleep that night for the first time since the end of the wars without first lying awake for a candlemark staring into the darkness something teased at the back of selenays mind for the next several days making her feel restless full of nervous energy perhaps it was the season spring was almost upon them the early crocuses were already pushing their way up through the flower beds the last of the snow was gone the really wretched endofwinter rains had begun and now the days were long enough to make you believe that winter might actually end after all the air still felt raw and other than the optimistic crocuses there was no sign of anything growing but there were moments when the sun felt warm as a hand on the cheek and when there was a hint of greenscent in the wind winter would end spring would come and after it summer and a year would have gone by without her father time they said was a great healer some of her depression eased a little more with the lengthening days certainly maybe it was due to the season maybe she was just getting used to sendar not being there anymore there was no longer the blow to the heart when she entered the throne room and did not see him there nor quite the feeling of emptiness when she took what had been his chair at the council meetings not all of itoh by no means but enough that she was sleeping the night through and not waking up to weep in the darkness sometimes she even slept until her maids woke her and it was a deep and thankfully dreamless sleep orthallen was as good as his word at the next meeting of the full council before it was called officially into session he asked for a moment to address the group personally this is not council business precisely he said but it is something that i would like the council to hear they all looked at selenay she nodded the seneschal called the meeting to order and gestured to orthallen and when he had the silent regard of everyone around the table he cleared his throat awkwardly which was not like him at all that alone got him the full and alert attention of everyone sitting there my lords my ladies i believe that we have been pressing the queen on an issue that really has no urgency at all he said looking embarrassed and by that i mean the issue of her choosing a spouse immediately after due consideration and more thought i believe we have been overly hasty selenay inclined her head accepting what he had said without saying a word herself this was not the time to add her own thoughts she wanted orthallen to explain it all to the rest of the council in his own words though there was one thing that struck her as odd and that was the phrasing orthallen had used spouse was a peculiar choice of word when it came to the queen of valdemar why not say consort which was the traditional title if the ruler was the queen and the husband was not a herald perhaps it was because she had shown no real interest in any of the heralds but orthallen did not want to make that too obvious now if shed had a candidate among the heralds shed have made her choice known immediately it was a given that unless her husband was also a herald he could never be king and coruler but stillgiven that none of the candidates were heralds why not just say consort maybe it was just that orthallen was keeping the options open in their minds eliminating neither the possibility of consort nor king its been a long time since valdemar had a queen maybe its just slipped their mind that no husband of mine can rule unless hes a herald it might be just as well not to remind those of the council who had forgotten that fact it should be obvious to all of us by this time that while the queen is a young woman she is not only capable she is wise enough to know when she needs advice and guidance she could lawfully have replaced all of us and has not because she trusts us as her father trusted us and believes that we who were her fathers advisers are capable in ourselves he coughed as a murmur went around the table we may be flailing about in the wake of our loss and casting for solutions to situations that are not actually problems selenay exchanged looks with the other heralds on the council kyril the seneschals herald elcarth and talamir although orthallen had included the rest of the councilors in this admission it was a signal departure for him to admit to making a mistake and they had been flailing about as if she herself was a problem before there had been any evidence of anything of the sort orthallen cleared his throat again and continued reluctantly she held her breath was he was he going to admit it furthermore by seeming to cast about frantically for a suitable candidate we may be giving an impression of weakness to those who do not wish us well as if we do not trust our queen and our own ability to carry on in the absence of her father we could be giving the same impression as a herd of sheep milling about anxiously without a shepherd and i do not need to tell you that there are wolves about another murmur and selenay stifled a smile hearing orthallen borrowing so heavily from her own argument he did he admitted im right i may only get apologies from him in private but at least hes admitting that im right in public it was a triumph but she was not going to gloat over it i know that i was the one pressing most eagerly for such a weddingor betrothal at leastbut i should like to urge that we drop the subject for now he shrugged and no few of the other councilors looked as embarrassed as he did if you recommend so orthallen lord gartheser said hesitantly you know more about foreign affairs than the rest of us do i think it would be the wisest course and in that moment orthallen all but said i was wrong but he went on quickly making an attempt to regain the face he had lost in all events having the queen so blatantly unattached can also work to our benefit there are a number of young men of rank of valuable connectionprinces evenin other lands who are also unattached no doubt their rulers will soon see that there is a way to bring valdemar into close alliance by the closest of ties so let us table this search for now and get on with the business of the realm nods all around the table a few reluctantwell not surprising that the oldest councilors were less than comfortable about a queen and a young one at that and the oldest men were the ones least inclined to trust her to rule alone only time will cure that she decided timeor perhaps a change of councilors it wouldnt hurt for the bardic and healer representatives to retire for instance it would be better if there were more women on the council a woman who has made her own way in the world will be more inclined to see me as a leader and less as someone needing to be led perhaps she should also add an entirely new seat or two someone from one of the newer guilds perhaps to have more people whose wealth was selfmade rather than inherited could be of real benefit orthallen moved on to some dispute between the guilds of the mercers and the weavers while selenays thoughts were elsewhere she quickly brought her own attention to bear on the situation it would not be a good idea to undo all of orthallens work by seeming to be lost in other thoughts she did notice that several of the councilors actually waited to hear her opinion before voicing theirs which was a pleasant change the rest of the meeting proceeded in the same atmosphere and if she felt a momentary resentment that shed had to get orthallens approval before being granted the respect she was due at least now she had that respect and though it might be temporary having gotten it once it would be easier to regain it but once the meeting was over as she and she and her escort of guards and ladies wound their way back to her quarters she allowed her thoughts to tend in other directions orthallens comment about foreign princesthat struck a chord and told her that that was what had been nagging at her all this time since the councilor had first voiced that idea over dinner what foreign princes certainly there had been no hints of such a possibility before now no envoys had presented themselves no inquiries had been voiced via ambassadors but perhaps they had all been waiting until her year of mourning was over that would only be appropriate really assuming there are such mythical creatures she told herself as she entered the door to her suite and the guards took up their stations outside but they might not be mythical surely though if there were such young men wandering about unpartnered she would be aware of them granted her knowledge of highborn families outside of valdemar was sketchy to say the least but the only royal that she knew of was the king of hardorn and he had married an allegedly lissome young creature out of his own court a little more than a year ago but would orthallen have mentioned the possibility twice if it didnt exist so just what foreign princes were there out there she dismissed her ladies and selected a gown to be worn at dinner while her maids drew a hot bath did the shinain have princes she couldnt remember anything of the sort caryo is there such a thing as a shinain prince ive never heard of one caryo sounded surprised i think they dont have things like kings and princes i think they are an alliance of clans that tallied with the little that selenay recalled but perhaps some of the clans were big enough that their chiefs would qualify as princes there were a great many shinain after all it was aninteresting possibility she stepped into the bath that had been prepared for her and chased the maids away while she soaked as she relaxed in the hot lavenderscented water she had a silly little vision of a strong wild warrior raven hair down to his waist riding into haven dressed in black furs and leathers astridebareback of coursea horse as black as his hair and wouldnt that make a pretty picture the two of them riding together she all in whites on caryo he on his midnight steed she gave herself a mental shake ridiculous of course what shinain nomad would ever leave the plains much less do so with the intention of marrying a foreign civilized queen besides even if he came here looking for her he wouldnt stay the shinain never stayed away from the plains for long and she could scarcely leave valdemar what would the shinain get out of such a marriage anyway valdemar was too far from the plains for there to be any advantage in an alliance at all no no notoo easy to burst that particular bubble of illusion but who else did that leave rethwellan were there unmarried princes in rethwellan if there were well they at least shared a border with valdemar and it would be an advantage to them to have such an alliance if only for trade advantages menmellith menmellith was a principality of rethwellan but she couldnt really recall anything at all about their ruling family not karse of course could there be interest as far away as jkatha or ceejay which were just names on a map to her surely not valdemar didnt even trade directly that far away so why would any stray princeling come wandering up here but there might be places she had never heard of to the northwell iftel was out of the question no one ever came past their borders except a few favored traders who were remarkably closemouthed about the place the bath was cooling time to finish and get out before someone came in here to scrub her stupid shed bathed herself for the last fourteen years and more so what was it about being a queen that rendered her incapable of bathing herself now but the splashing as she emerged from the bath seemed to be some sort of signal that caused maids to swarm around her with towels and robes and scents and lotions and for once involved in her own thoughts she let them fuss over her once she was properly clothed in a lounging robe they messed about with her hair while she continued her ruminations north other than iftel were the barbarians above the forest of sorrows surely not surely not the idea of a greasy violent furclad brute was even more repulsive than some of the octogenarians the council had suggested were there little secretive kingdoms out in the west in the pelagiris forest or past it it was possible there were certainly people out there and not just the halfmythical hawkbrothers there were entire villages that looked to the hawkbrothers for protection so maybe there were kingdoms in the west but stillwhat possible advantage could they have in an alliance with valdemar nothing that she could imagine or were there men in other kingdoms who were like the great dukes of valdemar who held enough power that they qualified as princes there might well be she hadnt had time to study such things in such a case for a younger son there would be a great deal of prestige and advantage in marrying a queen even if it left the young man as nothing more than a consort without ruling powers his children would rule if they were chosen and that might be enough separate trade agreements could be made with the family and that might be enough there was a great deal of difference between royal marrying royal and royal stooping to wed a rank below hers in that case the advantages to be gained were almost all on the side of the lower rank surely theres something in the archives of letters from ambassadors and trade envoys caryo said helpfully or seneschals herald kyril will know where to look i should think that someone would know if we might expect a spate of foreign suitors a foreign princeor more than onethe idea gave her a kind of fluttery feeling of excitement inside oh they might well all be as impossible or even repulsive as the candidates shed been presented with so far butat least they would be someone different and surely one would be older than an adolescent and younger than a graybeard maybe even handsomethough she wouldnt necessarily care as long as he wasnt a monster someone she didnt know that she couldnt predict someone with entirely new ways and mannerseven if she didnt want to marry him it would be interesting to have him in her court it would be more than interestingit would be fascinating she licked her lips and hardly noticed the maids tugging at her hair i mustnt get my hopes up she told herself there might not be any such thing if they exist they might all be old or feebleminded or already married she shuddered involuntarily as she realized that shed had a narrow escape without realizing it if king alessandar hadnt gotten wedded to his sweet young thingif hed still been alone well he would not have let the opportunity to propose slip past no matter how many sweet young things were in his court and the council would never have allowed her to reject his suit hardorn and valdemar had been allies for so very long that there had even been cases of heralds coming to the rescue of hardornans in the past even herald vanyel had done so that was how he earned his title of demonsbane there would have been no way to gracefully turn down such a proposal bright havens what a narrow escape she suddenly needed to know and know with certainty if there really was a possibility for a foreign suitor i have to know and i truly have to know if there are any unwedded alessandars just waiting for my year of mourning to be over well there was one person to ask and it wasnt herald kyril however knowledgeable kyril might be no orthallen would be the one to ask after all he was the one who had brought it all up in the first place if there had been such a position in her council as foreign minister he surely would have been the one to fill it his knowledge of the lands outside of valdemar was as exacting as hers was vague a foreign prince an easy thought to kick off daydreams and it was a good thing that she was safely away in her own suite where no one would notice if her attention wandered when the maids were finished with her she chased them out all but one whom she sent off with a note to orthallen they would discuss this tonight after her dinner with the court for certain alberich had a meeting of his own after dinner and he had with some regret decided against inviting myste to share it no there could only be one invitee to this gathering and it had to be the queens own talamir was for once very much alert and in the here and now as he examined the documents that myste had purloined alberich had been reluctant to let them out of the salle he was even more reluctant to let them out of his sight fortunately for all concerned talamir had no trouble in getting about though he was stillwellfragile it was hard on a man to have been through all that talamir haddying and being dragged back to life again must have been unthinkably grim at talamirs age it had been more that and alberich was still surprised that he was reasonably sane afterward in a way he was doing far better than anyone had any right to expect yes hes fragile rather than frail kantor agreed and a good half of that is mental id say except when something that required all of his attention was before him then he was the old talamir again it was the old talamir that had appeared unescorted at the door of alberichs rooms it was the old talamir alert and in possession of all of his wits and wiles who heard him out and examined the documents with great care alberich hopedwildly he knew but stranger things had happenedthat talamir would recognize the cipher even be able to read it a little the odds were very much against it butwell ciphers and secret messages were not part of the training of a karsite cadet and the denizens of the vile dens down near exiles gate that he usually trafficked with were barely literate asking them to manage a cipher would be like asking a pig to dance on a tightrope well the queens own said putting the pages down carefully i dont know enough about ciphers to make any sense of this in fact theres something we should consider and thats the possibility that this might not even be in valdemaran curses oh well actually alberich said with extreme reluctance it probably is not if consider we do that it was intended for someone in another land in that language it would be which could be anything so we have two puzzles to crack the cipher itself and which language its in still talamir rested his index finger along his upper lip his eyes opaque with thought still were very much further on than we were before if someone is going to this extreme to send messages in cipher i think we can be pretty certain it isnt just guild secrets or messages to a mistress i will need to take these to an expert i think i should the originals prefer to keep here alberich ventured wondering how talamir would take that evidence they may become oh certainly talamir waved his hand dismissively as if the idea of taking the originals was out of the question i would rather you did too myste can make copies for me to give to he hesitated a moment well forgive me if i just tell you it is a fellow whose hobby is ciphers one ive taken such problems to before this odd little chap but solid and true and youd be surprised if you knew who he was i wont tell you his name though if you dont mind safer for him if you do not alberich agreed secrets are secrets between two in danger between three and often lost between more than three talamir nodded but with an air of assurance that he had been certain that alberich would understand before hed asked the question and if you dont mind my saying it it would be safer for myste if she can get away from those actors talamir replied but i doubt either of us could persuade her of that you may be sure alberich sighed having spent several marks fruitlessly attempting to persuade her to do just that if i leave now theyll be suspicious and youll never get a chance to follow norris and find out who hes meeting shed said which alas was true enough and if he trusted me once hell likely trust me again think of what else i could get what if he really runs out of time some day and asks me to do the ciphering more of these she hopes to obtain he added well the more samples the better if they change the cipher key my man will spot that much right off talamir pushed the papers across the table to alberich put those somewhere safe and ill come and get the copy tomorrow myste says alberich began two copies talamir smiled good then instead of my coming alone lets have a little gettogether with jadus and crathach too with the originals hidden you should be all right bringing the copies up to the collegiumwe can meet in jadus rooms no one would see anything amiss in that and you can safely give me the copies then clandestinely if you like or just come along to my rooms to remind me of our gathering and pass me the copies then that is the best plan and i should like to see the others jadus isi have not seen much of him alberich said feeling guilty because it isnt easy learning to get about on one leg and once he got his strength back hes been working hard at it talamir replied he hasnt had much time to spare for any of us but crathach my friend but i think hes well on the road to feeling useful again he wont be doing any dancing but therell be a vacancy for a herald in the courts of justice in haven and hell do well there alberich was relieved jadus probably would do well there for his sound common sense if nothing else and his soft ways would put frightened people at their ease but when the time came for stern justice jadus was not a man to be put off by anything or anyone tomorrow night then alberich agreed and gathered up the papers talamir stood i dont want to see where you put them so ill take my leave now he glanced at the stainedglass window and raised an eyebrow now i see why you put that bit of artwork in or one reason anyway yes we cannot be watched through such a thing alberich replied hmm and when i think of all the people who said you were the last person to put in dethors shoes myself included alberich replied talamir gave him a penetrating look then shrugged i wouldnt have picked myste as a spy either he said good night weaponsmaster when he was gone alberich folded the papers into their original packet and felt carefully under the table until he found the catch that released a little drawer inside one of the thick legs dethor had shown it to him so he was reasonably sure that no one else knew about it there were hiding places like this all over the private quarters of the salle but this was the only one that he could use without getting up probably there was no one out there trying to make sense of the shadows on the other side of the colored glass but just in case there was there would be no way to tell that alberich had hidden something it only looked as if he was reaching for his drink and there was another set of papers on the tabletop just in case the shadows had betrayed that talamir had been looking at papers this was a report about bandit activity along the karsite border something that alberich could reasonably have an interest and expertise in if someone came to the salle in the next mark or so alberich would take great pains to mention that report it wasnt just that he was taking precautions about the papers myste had stolen he was protecting himself there were a great many people in court circles who distrusted the karsite besides those who had no reason to love him because he did not cosset their children sometimes he grew very tired of it all layers upon layers he envied jadus and elcarth and all the others who didnt have to live their lives weaving webs of subterfuge he wished well it didnt matter what he wished he would as a gambling friend of his had often said play out the cards he had been dealt complications complications my life is full of complications he said aloud there was no answer vkandis knew it was true enough another complication myste herself shed been on his mind all day there had been no doubt in his mind that myste had been discreetly flirting with him last night and hed liked it hed even tried a little clumsy flirting back not as clumsy as you think kantor put in i was pleasantly surprised youve got a light touch when you care to use it he felt himself blushing but it was at least partly with pleasure but what would the other heralds think of this if they realized that she and he were attracted to one another if they bothered to take any notice theyll wait to see if you mind teasing then give you both a bit of a word about it now and again kantor told him other than that theyd probably begin a betting pool as to when the two of you decided to stop flirting and get down to something serious serious he ventured bedding kantor said bluntly alberich bit his tongue quite by accidentkantor had startled him but sorry didnt mean to shock you but if this gets past flirting myste is going to expect it to go there heralds arewell by the standards of a karsite theyre flagrantly immoral and utterly hedonistic when it comes to the ways of man with maid not that she is myste i mean shes not a maid maybe he should have been shocked but he wasnt startled yes but not shocked well not that myste wasnt a maid anyway in fact he was relieved it had been a long time since hedwelland then it had been someone hed paid he didnt have any practice in the more polite forms of congress and he was probably going to step on his own feet more than once if thingsgot past flirting and the ache in certain parts of him let him know in no uncertain terms that his body certainly wanted it to get past flirting far past flirting as for how she came to be not a maid well that was her business unless she made it his and then it was even more her business good man slow and cautious shes in no hurry and neither should you be as long as she doesnt run in terror from my face he said dryly i doubt there is anything else about me that cows her underneath that woman is someone that would appal people if they only knew her there are things she will not compromise on and things that she would kill over if it came to that which was of course how she was getting away with purloining secrets out from under the very noses of the owners and with their cooperation at some point perhaps in that last battle myste had found or gotten her courage now he doubted that anything could effectively stand in her way if she believed in or wanted something badly enough like me he sat firmly on that thought and crammed it back into the little mental cupboard it had come out of back to business what do you companions know about ciphers he asked after all better to cover all possible avenues with this one nothing much kantor said with regret nobody here at the collegium for sure and i think not anybody alive just because were good at mindspeech doesnt mean were good at everything working ciphers takes a particular kind of mindthe kind that can see patterns where the rest of us would see only chaos well hed had to ask should i just leave all this to talamir then he knows more about who to trust in this than you do i think i know who hell be taking the papers to and no one is safer well that was a dismissal if he had ever heard one time to stop worrying about that end of the situation and think about the part he could do something about such as discovering just who besides young lord devlin his contact in the court norris was meeting it was spring at long last and the gardens were bursting with greenery and blossoms as if to make up for last years sorrowful season with every breeze the ornamental cherries carpeted the ground beneath their boughs with pink and white petals the air was full of a hundred different scents kingdom business be hanged selenay was going to walk in her gardens before the season ripened any further into summer so she told the seneschal at their morning meeting over breakfast that she wanted him to shorten the usual afternoon audiences by half if i stay within walls for much longer im going to shred something she said a little crossly expecting him to object im tired of never seeing the sun except through windows and i am exceedingly tired of hearing people whining i would like to hear birds for a change and if i must hear voices i would prefer it to be the voices of people who are not complaining to me at least for a candlemark or two but he only nodded his graying head and regarded her kindly if your majesty will recall he told her your father was exactly the same in the spring and now that he had reminded her she did remember it but not as a memory of him ordering shorter audiences but as seeing him in the gardens every fine afternoon and walking there with two or three friends in the evening too but she i was taking classes or practicing and hed always done that every spring so it never struck me as odd she decided i didnt know then that the business of government takes up so much time and that he must have been stealing time from it for a little while or perhaps it wasnt that he had been stealing time at all though she would certainly have to and the only place where she felt she could in good conscience take it was from the audiences now that she thought about it her father had definitely had more leisure time than she seemed to but then he had been king for all of her life obviously so hed had some practice at it maybe it would get easier as she went along perhaps the more practiced she became the less of her time it would take perhaps some day she would have some candlemarks of leisure for herself she felt guilty then decided that feeling guilty was stupid if she was ready to rip someones throat out now how would she be without taking some time at last for herself a pox on that bridges were not going to fall down nor buildings collapse because she walked in her garden and played at games a little while with her ladies well then schedule fewer petitioners for the foreseeable future she ordered adding if you please surely some of those people can manage to sort out their troubles by themselves certainly majesty the seneschal said with a little smile if your majesty will forgive my voicing my own opinion you are just a trifle too accessible restricting your availability will make people think before they request an audience for which they might have to wait several days she blinked then nodded and here she had thought he was going to disapprove but the prospect of a simple walk in her gardens was enough to elevate her spirits for the entire morning even though the exchequer occupied her for most of that time with budget and tax allotments just the simple knowledge that she was going to escape his stuffy little office was enough to set her to work with more energy than shed had in weeks for such things and the audiences did not seem as tedious either and when the seneschal announced that she would not be seeing any more petitioners that day it was all she could do to keep from leaping up out of the throne and flying out the privy door behind the dais to get to her chambers and out of her robes of state she changed into a simple splitskirt gown without calling for her maids collected a ball and racquets then gathered up her rather startled ladiesinwaiting and bustled them all down the hall like a goosegirl hurrying her geese to the pond and when they were out into the garden she acted like a child newlyfreed from lessons dropping every bit of her dignity to lead them all in a game of tag then taking each of them on in turn at racquets in fact she wore some of them out with her energy until they all begged laughing for a moment of rest which she graciously gave them and while they sprawled on the lawn or lounged on benches she walked alone among the flower beds she hadnt intended to actually pick any flowers but this spring there was a superabundance of blossoms and she found herself taking one here one there not deliberately selecting anything just picking them from places where the blooms seemed crowded or scents were especially intoxicating ill put them in my bedroom she decided feeling an unaccustomed glee just stick them all in a vase full ofwater no formal flower arranging no careful selection of harmonious colors the kind of bouquetno bunch of flowersi used to pick for myself as a child she didntthank goodnesshave to think twice about wandering about here alone either it was safe enough for her to be unguarded here in the queens garden there were royal guards all around the grounds and the grounds themselves were walled off of course no one could come here who wasnt a member of the court or collegia and it was a matter of etiquette not to invade the queens garden when the queen was in it unless you were specifically invited so she was a little surprised to look up from picking another bloom and see the rethwellan ambassador followed at a slight distance by a young man she did not recognize coming toward her on the path he dropped to one knee when he reached her and she automatically extended her hand for him to kiss then gave it a slight tug indicating that he should rise ambassador brenthalarian whatever is it that brings you here she asked i hope you arent going to trouble my afternoon with a problem nothing of the sort majesty the ambassador said smoothly indeed i only wished to inquire if your majesty would be willing to receive king megrarthons second son prince karathanelan he has come bringing his majestys belated personal condolences for you have already had his majestys official ones yes i recall she replied looking at him with a feeling of interest tinged with excitement sohere was her answer to the question what foreign princes were there before she had even asked anyone about it a foreign prince from rethwellan princes did not travel abroad unless they had very compelling reasons for doing so she cast a surreptitious glance at the young man who waited just out of earshot and felt another thrill this time of pleasure he was handsome very handsome his coloring was an intriguing mixturedark chestnut hair quite curly and almost shoulder length and blue eyes that were a lighter color than her own the color of a sky with a thin high haze of cloud over it he had a long nose high cheekbones and a narrow face with a cleft chin he looked like centuries of inbreeding caryo said sardonically oh hush silly she replied keeping a watch on him out of the corner of her eye what he looks like is not like a valdemaran which is a refreshing change i think hes lovely when could the prince come to court do you think she asked pretending that she had not already guessed that the prince was right here in her own garden the ambassador knew very well that she knew and so did the prince but greeting him straightaway would spoil the game and it was likely to be a very amusing little game surely this is one of the foreign princes that orthallen was talking about i would of course be delighted to receive him at any time then in that case gracious lady let the prince prevail upon your noble nature and present himself the young man said flinging himself at her feet in the most romantic posture possible my curiosity brought me here but my heart will not allow me to remain outside of your regard for a single moment more he seized her hand and kissed it and she flushed with pleasure he spoke very good valdemaran with scarcely a trace of accent then welcome prince karathanelan she said tugging his hand he took the hint and rose gracefully how could i be less than gracious enough to welcome you when confronted with such a gallant gentleman she was trying to be queenly and dignified but she felt her flush turning into a blush he gave her a sidelong glance and smiled you are as gracious as you are beautiful queen selenay the prince replied will you permit me to conduct you back to your ladies with pleasure she said and now it was the rethwellan ambassadors turn to smile the prince offered his arm she took it the first play of the game was over and it had been very pleasant selenay could hardly wait to see what the next move would be one of the most difficult things alberich had ever done was to put that cipher out of his mind and concentrate on the rest of his duties and yet there was nothing he could do about the message except to guard the original hed sealed the panel of its hiding place shut to make certain that it wouldnt be tampered with and short of locking it in a strongbox and burying the strongbox under the floor of his room he couldnt make it any safer so at this point there was nothing he could do about it no man could be an expert at all things and it was a bit late in his life to begin studying ciphers instead he went on with his own double life he taught his students and drilled those heralds and guards who came to him for extra tutoring and practice by day and when his work for the day was over and everyone assumed he was resting in his own quarters he went out into the city by night in one of his assumed personae there was one distinct improvement in his clandestine tasks however and that was that the city guard and constabulary were back up to full strength he no longer needed to ferret out ordinary criminals they had their own agents for that again in fact he knew one or two city guards who did such things by sight and they knew him if he spotted them in one of his haunts of a night he would move on to a different spot knowing that they were probably on the trail of something or someone and the very best thing he could do would be to get out of their way there was after all no point in spoiling someone elses hunt and too many hunters in one spot sometimes made the game shy of being around and he suspected that they did the same on seeing him at any rate with the tedrel wars over and karse busy with its own internal problems the market for information on valdemars strengths and weaknesses had dried up somewhat he also suspected that the market for information of interest to valdemar was not what it had been for now anyway there just was not as much trafficking in that sort of thing going on now the highest prices were being paid for more mundane informationusually having to do with who was in possession of what valuable goods and how strongly a treasure was guarded and so on the most interesting trafficking he saw now was the manufacture of new identities and he had the strong suspicion that the people who were buying these identities had once called themselves tedrels how they managed to get as far north as haven he could not imagine even he hadnt done it without having a companion the journeys must have been terrifying he was not however concerned selenay was in no danger from them there were no tedrel leaders for her to be taken to as hostage or as forcedbride and he doubted that any of the men purchasing new lives for themselves wasted a moment of thought on her well as long as they stayed on the right side of the law hed be hanged if he turned any of them in or the people who were helping them for a price either and if they broke the law well he might be the one to catch them but it was up to the guard and constabulary to deal with it information trafficking was mostly going the other way now and even those prices were deflated he could almost feel sorryalmostfor the fellows whose sole stock in trade was in intelligence on the other hand this made two of his personae very popular fellows with those selling information about valdemars neighbors since both those personae were still buying though for information about karse he was relying on geri and the informal network that the sunpriests who had escaped to or been born in valdemar had built over the years as a consequence he had known well in advance of today that one of the younger princes of rethwellan was arriving secretly with the intention of paying court to the queen he had told talamir and neither of them had seen any reason to spoil the surprise by informing selenay let her have a little romance talamir had opined and his opinion was seconded by herald kyril she is sensible enough to know that whatever courting or romantic attention he pays her is only an illusion and that he is here purely for the purpose of making an advantageous alliance she will bear in mind i am sure that he would pay her the same compliments if she was stooped and squinteyed this will amuse her and she has had little enough pure amusement since the ice festival illusion or not romance was not in alberichs area of expertise nor were the doings of princes he would leave that to talamir and had said as much his personal opinion was that the arrival of this princeling was a damned good thing for talamir between the discovery of the ciphered papers and the advent of the rethwellan prince talamir was looking more centered than he had since the coronation alberich had filed that observation away for further thought but there was one conclusion to be made from it that was obvioustalamir needed real things to do too things he could get his metaphorical teeth into things that focused him on what was going on around him alberich made up his mind to find more such tasks now following that actor fellowthat was something he could do though once the weather turned and spring was well and truly in bloom he began to wonder where the man got his energy and whether he could manage to follow him without dropping over it wasnt only that norris was performing every evening with the full company at the inn and rehearsing new productions every afternoon that is when he wasnt performing with a reduced company at special private performances of an afternoon no it was that once those evening performances were over he scarcely had time to wipe the paint from his face and change out of his costume before he was off somewhere most of the time it was with a female alberich couldnt call them ladies though some of them had that title even if they acted more like cats in heat when he wasnt with a female he went roistering off with a gang of male friends drinking and carousing through several tavernsand usually then ended up in a womans bed in some bawdy house anyway it was astonishing because then no matter how late hed been out there he was again looking alert and fresh and ready to go no later than noon to rehearse with the company i know not how he does it alberich said as he accompanied myste in his guise as her friend from the army the carter back to the companions bell where she was ostensibly staying they had just watched norris drink enough to make alberichs head reel then take three whores up to his room only one thing was certain he wouldnt be going anywhere tonight thank the sunlord alberich didnt think he could have made another late night of it himself nor does anyone else myste admitted especially not his head for drink that man can drink any three under the table and i am not exaggerating because ive seen it with my own eyes and the next day youd never know hed taken a drop alberich licked his lips thoughtfully a useful talent for an agent damn right it is she tucked her hair behind her ears and adjusted her lenses whats moreand this is a womans intuitive observation so take it with whatever grains of salt you choosei dont see that he has anything that you could exploit as a weakness not even for women alberich gave her a dubious glance pardon he uses them she elaborated but he has no use for them i think theyre like food for himhe satisfies his appetite and he does have a hearty appetite but once hes through he pays no more attention to them than he would to the shepherds pie he just finished eating he pushes away the leftovers and wants them cleared away ive watched him with his women remember quite a lot more than he thinks i have actually i have yet to see him show any emotional attachment to anyone woman or man he acts as if he does says all the right things and it is superb acting yesactually quite a bit better and far more subtle than anything he does on stage but so far as i can tell theres nothing genuine behind the words and the gestures well alberich said thoughtfully well well well i think it is good that i have never tried to come too near to him or i might have been swiftly found out but that makes me concerned for you she nodded it makes me concerned for me too believe me and the only things i have in my favor are that he thinks im besotted and under his thumb that im not ornamental to look at so he spends as little time as he can get away with doing so and that he does not think that women in general are particularly intelligent i expect she added thoughtfully that he regards me rather in the line of a trained dog quite clever at performing the tricks ive been taught and utterly devoted to my masters but not really capable of thinking for myself which would make i think other women his lap dogs alberich pointed out continuing the analogy good for ornament and sensually pleasant but otherwise utterly useless she laughed aloud at that oh i wish some of his lightoloves could hear you say that of them how he manages to keep them from tearing him to bits in jealousy is beyond me perhaps they are in truth as utterly besotted as he thinks you to be alberich observed or else he has the gift of golden speech both i think she shook her head you know as often as i see it im still amazed at how selfdeluded a lot of women are a man says one thing and does something else and they believe the words and not the actions that behavior is not restricted to women alberich pointed out are his fellow actors not equally deceived in thinking him a grand fellow hmm thats true enough they were nearly at the bell but neither of them made the turn that would take them into the alley and the back way alberich i dont believe were alone so you have noticed someone had been following them for some time alberich had been certain of it about a third of the way back im not usually good at this but i heard a footstep that i know just before i said something its norris well that put a different complexion on things so the three bawds a ruse maybe he isnt as sure of me as i thought sohmm now what do we do you go up to your room and i say good night then i see what your friend does next they had because alberich always liked to plan for every possible contingency planned for this one as well myste did have a room herein fact it was one of several that heralds could use if they needed one if for instance there was a major convocation of heralds and all the beds at the collegium were full they were very spartan in nature hardly more than closets with bunks in them identical to the servants rooms and exactly the sort of thing that a clerk would get in trade for his services to an inn so when they reached the door of the bell they parted company as old friends rather than anything more intimate and myste used her key to the side entrance where the longterm residents and inn servants had their rooms alberich clumped off made certain that their follower hadnt followed him then reversed his coat to the matteblack side and ghosted back sure enough there was norris hidden and hidden relatively well in a shadow across the street after a moment one of the little windows in the garret rooms glowed as a candle was brought inside alberich was about to suggest to myste with mindspeech that she go to the window when she did just that without his needing to prompt her she not only went to it she opened it and sat in it for several moments as if enjoying the warm spring night even though she was probably dying to peer down into the street to look for their follower she did nothing of the sort instead she took off her lenses rubbed her eyes as if she was tired and sat back with her head against the side of the window frame and her eyesas far as alberich could tellclosed is the kitty still stalking me yes he is alberich replied persistent beast i dont suppose you can think of anything that will make him go away i am working on just that he told her although in truth he was coming up rather dry as to ideas after all the times when his admirers have been a nuisance to get around this is one time when i wish some of them would appear he thought crossly how many would you like came kantors interested query he blinked why do you ask because there is an entire table full of young women from the audience this evening here they wanted to get a table there but you know how it is yes indeed alberich knew very well how it was norris company was by far the most popular in haven in a very long time on the nights when there were plays it was impossible to get a table in his inn either before or after the play the innkeeper had taken to doing the unheard ofmaking reservations for tables there were people who had waited as long as three weeks before being able to take their preplay dinner or afterplay supper in norris presumed presence at any rate all theyve done is talk about norris since they got here theyre very loud and i think a bit tipsy there were distinct overtones of snigger in kantors voice i cant imagine how theyd be useful to you though oh i can he slipped away from his hiding place went into the alley in through the secret room at the back of the stables and changed into not his clothing but his uniform this was not even his gray weaponsmasters garb but the heraldic whites that he seldom if ever wore he had kept a set down here for just this reason he wanted to be noticed this time but he wanted all the attention to be on his clothing not his face then he strolled openly into the bell and listened for the sound of female voices it didnt take him long to hear them for as kantor had said they were both loud and tipsy the latter probably being the cause of the former all right myste he mindspoke yawn stretch put out your candle and go to bed you shouldnt have to stay there much longer im alive with curiosity the bell had more than one public room there was the main tavern area and several supper rooms that were intended more for eating in than drinking he entered the room where the youngand not so youngwomen were as if looking about possibly for a place to sit they were so far as he could tell not highborn but they definitely were prosperous their gowns were all new of good quality and they wore a moderate amount of silver jewelry middling welloff merchant or craft families he guessed the younger ones had probably persuaded their families to let them see the players and the older ones had come along as chaperones and they all had fallen under the spell of the handsome leading man they were already planning their next outing to see him perform a herald always got noticed even in haven and when he entered the room they all looked up and at him he concentrated very hard on his words and his accent this was not the time to sound like a foreigner if norris went to the effort of trying to track back who betrayed himalberich just wanted to be a herald he gave a little bow and said your pardon my ladies i wouldnt want to interrupt your party one of the older ones giggled it was one of the young ones who called out oh thats quite all right herald you werent interrupting anything we were just talking about the play weve been to the play be hanged said one of the tipsier ones its that actor norris way of filling out tights that we were talking about some of them laughed hilariously some with embarrassment and alberich smiled hes a fine actor that one he said agreeably very impressive indeed i think all of us managed to get to one or more of his performances during the ice festival then he added as if the idea had suddenly struck him he wouldnt be waiting for any of you would he oddly enough it was one of the drunker ones who caught the implications of that last question which slipped right by most of them what dye mean waiting for one of us she asked not quite slurring her words ymean now right now why yes alberich replied feigning surprise i saw him just across the street lingering in the doorway as if he was waiting for someone to come out of the bell well that was all he needed to say and the only thing he needed to do was to press himself against the wall to get out of the way of the avalanche of gowns heading for the door they piled past him and rushed for the front exit a moment later and there was something like a little chorus of squeals as they tumbled out into the street is that it is its him you wicked wicked man myste chortled as the sounds became a bit inarticulate and much louder there was a single masculine voice saying desperately over the torrent of giggles and little shrieks ladies ladies and the owner was clearly getting nowhere alberich strolled out to the door and stood there with his face in shadow leaning against the doorpost with his arms crossed enjoying the havoc he had created norris was in the center of a tight knot of women all of them breathlessly telling him of their admiration at the tops of their lungs all of them trying to elbow each other aside to get closer to him he looked like a very desperate man at the moment oh this is choice myste said i cant resist from overhead and to the right came her familiar voice will you please be quiet if alberich hadnt known myste so well he would have been certain that she was angry not trying with might and main to hold back gales of laughter people are trying to sleep her window slammed shut then mystes plaint was joined by several other genuinely irritated voices calling down to the gaggle of women surrounding to shut up and go away and ill get the constables on you see if i dont and it wasnt long before a constable did appear and suggest to norris as the apparent center of the disturbance that it would be very nice sir if you and your friends were somewhere else right now and there was nothing else that norris could do at that point except to bow to the inevitable he was going to be stuck with these women for the next candlemark at least and the only way he was going to get rid of them was back at his own inn where he knew the ground and could slip away from them under the guise of attending to natures call or something of the sortor getting one of the cast to find one of his regular bawds to come down and drag him back to his room the one thing that would embarrass them enough to go away even in their present state of intoxication would be the presence of a real whore but it would have to be done there not here somehow perhaps by sheer force of personality he got the group moving and away they went still surrounding him on all sides chattering like a flock of noisy little birds and he with the look of a man being nibbled to death by ducks when they were all out of both sight and hearing he mindcalled up to myste i think you can come out now just a moment i was not exactly dressed i wanted to add some verisimilitude to the illusion that i had gone to bed now he wished hed looked up when she leaned out of her window then it struck him thered been a hint ofsomethingin her mindvoice was it what he thought it was should he did he dare if you didnt read that as an invitation youre denser than i thought said kantor he couldnt clear his throat in mindvoice but he managed a combination of eagerness and diffidence i dont suppose you would care for me to come up instead he heard the purr in her mindvoice and almost tangled his own feet together trying to whip himself around and head for the stairs ah yes indeed i would please do the journey back up to the palace was surreal dreamlike as the four of them made their way through peacefilled cool air scented with honeysuckle alberich held onto the moment fiercely no matter what had happened in the past or what would happen in the future hed had this night this time his heart was for the moment at peace and he could not have been more content with his lot he hopedhe thoughtmyste felt the same they parted with a touch of lips and hands at the branching of paths one leading up to the heralds wing at the palace the other to the salle he and kantor moved off into the velvet night i told you that you were worrying too much kantor said when he and alberich were finally settled back in their respective beds in and beside the salle hmm you were right stillno there was no still kantor was right the benefit of being gifted there was no question of how ones partner felt there had been a little initial fumbling but no buts he sighed and started to settle into sleep then something popped up into his mind and jolted him into wakefulness again now why did she tell you thank you you were right ah you werent supposed to hear that kantor sighed i gave her some advice some time back through her companion of course but she knew it was from me because she asked me directly yes he decided that no matter what it was he wasnt going to be annoyed after all look what it had gotten him i told her he wont make the first move youll have to and dont be subtle in this situation hes trying so hard to be a gentleman that he wont notice if youre subtle but if youre wondering i dont think this was planned i think she just seized the opportunity when it was too good to be passed up i know shes felt diffident about approaching you here in your own place and more than a bit shy about inviting you up to the collegium where where everyone would notice and gossip alberich finished for him and mulled it all over no he definitely was not going to be annoyed thank you you were right of course now that the first move had been made in the game he chuckled to himself in the darkness the next time she showed up here it wasnt all going to be business not that he was going to forget his duty far from it now he did let his doublytired body relax and his last thought was perhaps not oddly norris is a fool selenay sat at her open window and breathed in the honeysucklescented air dreamily karathhe had insisted almost immediately that she call him karathhad been officially presented at court two days ago he had gone out of his way to be charming and selenay was by no means the only one to have been affected by that charm but his attention had been directed like a focused beam of light on her this was not the first time that she had been the focus of someones attention but it was the first time the attention had been completely positive and universally directed to the sole object of pleasing her heady stuff and it didnt hurt at all that karath was so very good to look upon no not at all but there was more as impossible as it seemed karath understood her it was magical how well he understood her already they had shared commiserations on how heavy the burden of duty was for a royal child and how unfair it was that they had less freedom than the lowest of their subjects how very unfair and he had looked straight into her eyes and said it is a sad pity that you have no one to share your burden with oh she had laughed at that and demurred that she had an entire council to help her but his words had rung very true and she wondered if there was something behind them as ifcould it be no of course not hes a prince of rethwellan if he can charm me into giving rethwellan advantages he will he may even be courting me with an eye to a marriage of state right now though hes simply being friendly hes a prince and there cant be too many people that he can confide in it isnt as if he has a companion to talk to or even someone like lord orthallen he was she thought a very proud young man it would be hard for him to confide in anyone that he considered below him yes that is certainly it she rested her head against the window frame feeling suddenly melancholy for herself for him no there could be nothing more to it than that besides hecant possibly stay for very long hell have to return home soon the thought made her feel cheated somehow and even more melancholy but after a moment she shook it off resolutely the seneschal had decided that having a prince of the blood here was an occasion of great import and had arranged that his days should be enlivened by all manner of amusements and that it was selenays duty to take part in at least some of them the vernal equinox was in a few days and although it was the wrong season for hunting it was the best season for other sorts of outdoor excursions they were all going to watch a new version of the hurlee game played companionback by the oldest of the trainees others had been trying to come up with warmweather variations on hurlee but this was by far the most exciting and successful and there were those who were trying to get horses to do what the companions were doing but it would probably take a couple of years to train horses to put up with balls rolling under their hooves and sticks whizzing about their ears for now at least the only mounted version of the game would be played by heralds or trainees it made an excellent excuse to sit out on lawns with hampers of refreshments in the warm sunshine rather than in the stuffy audience chamber listening to even stuffier old men complain about each other there would be supper in a pavilion on the lawns after the game and then a concert of music under the stars in the gardens it will be the most fun ive had since the ice festival actually it will be much more fun than the ice festival i wont be on show to an entire city she smiled as she thought about it to think that she would have most of a day devoted to something other than kingdom business but her councilors all seemed very much in favor of the idea even those who were reserved in their assessment of karath maybe he will stay longer after all orthallen was convinced that he had come here with every intention of courting her it was a timehonored means of cementing alliances marriage he was the younger prince he wouldnt be in line for the throne at this point not even if his older brother died because faramentha already had a young son of his own so she shivered but with delight and anticipation not dread oh no definitely not dread not like shed felt with every other wouldbe suitor that had presented himself or been presented so far now wait and see she cautioned herself dont start chasing hares until the hounds have the scent orthallen could be misreading this he might just be very kind but if he was courting herit was just a bit difficult to be loverlike when he never saw her except in the company of ten or twenty other people the question was did she want him to court her actually more to the point did she want to marry him she thoughtperhapsbut she still wasnt entirely sure it probably wouldnt be too much of a battle to convince the council but the rest of her subjects might not care for the idea of a foreign consort and while he had beautiful manners and was extremely sympathetic it was all words so far she had no idea if he was truly attracted to her selenay or was just being properly diplomatic and sympathetic to the queen he was one of the handsomest men she had ever seen but how did she look to him really and how would he ever be able to say what he really felt with the constant audience that was around her if only there was a way to get rid of the audiencethe courtiers the ladies all of them if only there was a way that she could just slip away from them all long enough for the two of them to be alone for just a little and then she had an idea it was a terribly romantic idea and it just might work ill have a masquerade she thought with delight ill have it when the year of mourning is officially over out in the gardens spread out everywhere with everyone in costume and masked ill have the same costume made up for me and all of my ladies except ill let him know by some little token which one is me if he cant manage to get me alone for a little then he wont be trying yes that would do it that would do it indeed she chuckled at her own cleverness and meanwhile she had tomorrow to look forward to a half a day and all evening with nothing before her but to relax and enjoy herself and perhaps karath would show something more of his intentions she went to her bed and fell asleep still smiling there were three stands set up along the three sides of the triangular playing field the best one reserved for the queen and her court was on the side between the scarlet and green goals with a good view of both out on the field the two teams faced each other scarlet and green goalkeepers standing warily alert on their respective goals the two goalkeepers on the neutral third goal watching each other as much as the teams there was a tensionfilled silence as one of the referees placed the ball on the ground between the two teams then ran off well out of the way of what was coming a trumpet blast a single shout swelled a thousand throats and the game was on explain to me what i am seeing please karath asked watching as the tide of riders collided the ball somewhere under the churning hooves of the companions one half of the riders were wearing bardic scarlet the other healer greennot because they actually were bards and healers but because the two teams had been sponsored by the two other collegia it would after all have been impossible to tell which rider was on which team otherwise the players are all heraldic trainees and they usually wear gray selenay said as there was a loud crack and the ball suddenly seemed to fly out of the scrum on a pair of invisible wings this came out of a game the trainees made up over the winter called hurlee she interrupted to cheer as the bardic goalkeeper made a lastminute save her companion rearing and pivoting on hind hooves letting her catch the ball in her net the goalkeepers had nets rather than clubended sticks anyway we wouldnt be able to tell the teams apart so bardic collegium sponsored the team in red and healers the team in green she shouted again as the bardic goalkeeper threw the ball back into play and one of her own people caught it while it was still in flight and sent it whizzing toward the healer goal with a mighty blow of his stick the whole field went charging after it but how are the horses so welltrained karath asked they arent horses theyre companions she answered automatically umtheyre she searched for a way to explain it to an outsider they have mindmagic and so do the trainees and its like having a partner they can speak to one another ah magic karath said wisely of course like the hawkbrother mages who control their birds in the strange places in the pelagirs actually its not like that at all she thought but that was probably as close as he was going to get until hed been here a while and saw for himself or until a companion chose him thats close enough i suppose she said instead and turned her attention to the game it was absolutely vicious in its way alberich had insisted that the original version of hurlee be played with no holds barred and nothing short of murder against the rules and this version was no different with one single exception no one was allowed to deliberately thrust a stick among the legs of the scrumming companions the idea of a companion with a deliberately broken leg was just too horrifying but the companions were certainly allowed to ram each other and shoulder each other out of the way the riders could hit at each other with their sticks and try to pull each other out of the saddle companions and riders alike wore hard helmets of leather over steel the companions wore neck guards the riders wore padding and guards of their own it was war out there selenay who had seen war firsthand recognized it for what it was relatively bloodless perhaps but nonetheless war which was why both weaponsmaster alberich and the new equitation instructor herald keren approved of it you could study mounted combat all you liked you could even practice as much as you dared but you got no sense of what combat was really like well the fourth and fifthyear trainees certainly were now by the time the first third was over that was obvious there was plenty of danger one player was already out with a broken arm and a second sidelined while the healers made sure that the crack on the head hadnt resulted in a concussion a third was playing with a broken nose and there were two with black eyes and no one would know until it was over how many bruises and strains there were no companions were injured but that was always possible too the second third began after a brief pause for waterboth drunk and poured over headsand a quick change of players then they were off again with no less vigor than before it seems very dangerous karath shouted to her over the cheers and shrieks she glanced at him he seemed just as excited as everyone else his color was high and he had a wide smile of enjoyment it is she shouted back our weaponsmaster is using it for wartraining aha he nodded vigorously then cheered wildly with everyone else as the scarlet and green goalkeepers on the neutral goal got into a clinch and a scarlet rider nipped in right under their noses and slammed home a goal hurlee on ice had been exciting this was beyond excitingthis was intoxicating even selenay who had been in the thick of war was caught up in it drunk as any of them on it free to feel it knowing that this time there was no fear that anyone would die one rider was actually knocked unconscious by the ball before it was over and there was a broken wrist and a second broken arm both caused by being unseated and falling badly but selenay knew that the healers would soon put all of them to rights and when the healers were done with them the congratulations they would get at the hands of the rest of the traineesand everyone else with an interest in the gamewould soon make the pain just a memory the scarlets took the lead and held it for most of the game but at the very end in the final third the greens took the victory away from them by a single point when the winded and the exhausted winners and losers both had been mobbed and rushed off the field to their own celebratory feast selenay found herself hoarse with screaming and nearly as tired as if she had been out there on the field herself my word the prince said his eyes still wild with excitement thats altogether more thrilling than any tournament ive ever seen you say your weaponsmaster is using this for wartraining selenay nodded and sat down so that everyone else could protocol after allwhile the monarch was on her feet no one else could sit there was some little time before the alfresco dinner which would be served out in the gardens and she wanted to give her staff plenty of time to have it set up before she led the ravenous hordes toward the food meanwhile pages were going around with wine and fruit and she availed herself of both karath sat down in the place of honor beside her though he still looked as if he would like to go find a hurlee stick and try the game for himself not selenay she enjoyed watching the game but once it was over she couldnt help but think about why alberich was so in favor of it she didnt want any of those youngsters to have to see what she had seen there had been too many no older than they who had not returned from the wars indeed he is your highness the seneschal said as both the rethwellan ambassador and the ambassador from hardorn leaned closer in order to hear he and the equitation instructor have found it an invaluable substitute for melee and skirmish training they say they have found that both the mounted and foot versions are equally valuable and it is all the better for the fact that the trainees want to do it and several of them spend a great deal of their free time in practice at it we are restricting the mounted version to the finalyear students however given the level of expertise required and the danger involved better a broken bone or two now than something worse in combat selenay said sobered by her recollection of another spring daynearly this time last year then she shook off her melancholy this was supposed to be a day given over to relaxation and pleasure and she was not going to spoil it well gentlemen you can tell your friends and kin back in your homelands that we here in valdemar know how to provide both novelty and entertainment for our guests she said lightly i do believe that was the first ever public game of mounted hurlee and i hope you will convey my admiration to your weaponsmaster for finding so clever a solution for a training dilemma the prince said with a smile though i will confess if that is the level that he trains to he is fully as expert as our own weaponsmaster at homethough perhaps not quite to the exacting standard of swordmistress tarma shena talesedrin the famed shinain who trained my father and older brother but not you asked the hardornan ambassador and selenay had the oddest sensation that he knew something about karath that he would like very much for karath to reveal something unflattering though why he would wish for such a thing ambassadors are always jockeying for favor i suppose he thinks that if karath appears less than perfect i will lose interest in him absurd the prince frowned and for just a moment a shadow passed over his face but in the next moment he was all smiles again and selenay wondered if she had even seen it alas no he replied smoothly the swordmistress retired and closed her school before i was old enough in my mothers eyes to be sent away to it and at any rate from all i have heard the lady is extremely ascetic in her ways and strict in her discipline some might say she is overzealous in both regards and iwell he shrugged i am not much like my brothers while i feel that every man of breeding should be adept at the use of arms i fail to see why he should undergo the same rigorous training as someone who intends to live by them personally i am afraid that the swordmistress and i would be doomed to perpetually clash so perhaps it is just as well it would be a terrible scandal for a prince of the blood to be thrown out of a school for mercenaries as an abject failure or worse a discipline problem the rethwellan ambassador laughed politely but it sounded strained selenay was baffled if that was all the hardornan ambassador had been angling for she failed to see what was so unflattering about it not even a trainee who was unsuited to the martial arts was required to do more than learn how to defend him or herself why look at myste most of her training had been in the best ways of running away she decided to steer the subject away from the area that karath was finding uncomfortable the swordmistressis that a shinain name selenay asked curiously thinking wistfully of her earlier daydream of a wild shinain clan chief coming here to claim her hand ive never seen a shinain though i believe some of our people in the south have traded with them it is indeed majesty karath replied why do you ask oh only that i had never heard of shinain living outside the dhorisha plains and i often think i would like to meet one someday she confessed i believe one came as far as lord ashkevrons manor in my fathers day to help the lord with his horses but it was before i was born it is true that they do not often venture off their traditional grounds the rethwellan ambassador said after waiting for a few polite moments for all of them to nibble a little at their fruit and sip from their goblets of wine we see them from time to time selling horses but as soon as the beasts are sold they swiftly return to their homeland the city of katashinain is the only spot off the plains where you will see them regularly the swordmistress is somewhat of an anomaly she livesor lived since she was quite old when last i heardwith her bloodoath sister who had a school of sorcery alongside the school for swordsmen perhaps one day i will be able to entertain you with some tales of their adventures they are rather famous in rethwellan i would enjoy that selenay said wondering to see that faint shadow pass over the princes face again but today it is incumbent upon me to entertain you gentlemen and i believe that it is time that we all went to supper she rose and they all perforce rose with her and high time majesty the seneschal said lightly watching the hurlee game was nearly as exhausting as playing it and just as stimulating to the appetite these refreshments were welcome but i swear if you put butter on a brick i would eat it at this point pray dont say that she chided with a laugh our guests will be afraid to try the pastries she led the way down out of the viewing stands and into the gardens with the rest of the court trailing after she wondered if she should ask the prince about that shinain swordmistressperhaps there was some problem there that she should know about well perhaps not probably he was piqued that his older brother had the privilege of training under so famous a teacher and he had not she could understand that as difficult as alberich was there was absolutely no doubt that he was the best weaponsmaster that valdemar and the collegium had seen in a very long time if she had a sibling whod been able to train under alberich while she was not allowed to for whatever reason she would be horribly jealous too the meal was laid out along tables in the shade protected from insects by tents of flygauze nothing was intended to be served hot a guest had but to tell a page what he wanted and go to find a good seat on the lawn near the pavilion where the musicians were tuning up and the page would bring him a laden plate and a cup of wine it was all finger food of the sort that could be eaten with nothing but a little recourse to a napkin and most of it was light and cool meant to tease the palates of the diners with its subtlety it wasnt the sort of heavy feast theyd shared at the court feast of the ice festival selenay made her selections and went to take her seat she wished that she could sprawl on a carpet or cloth as she had on these occasions when she was only the heir but she was queen now and such an undignified pose would not be proper for her instead she followed her page to a rustic seating arrangement of a garden bench softened with cushions inside a bower facing the pavilion with a semicircle of chairs placed around it for her particular guests she was pleased to see that talamir was already there waiting for her he hadnt attended the hurlee game pleading a need to see to something or other but she had been a little concerned that the real reason was that he was feeling ill again as the anniversary of her fathers deathand that of his first companion taverapproached he had been looking distinctly frail but he seemed well enough now and very much in the moment he conducted her to her seat with all the gallantry of which he was capable which was a very great deal and to karaths evident annoyance took his traditional place at her left hand leaving karath to take the remaining chair at her right i trust your business is taken care of she asked as he made sure that she had all she needed before sending the page off for his own supper she tried something sweet and spicy wrapped in a lettuce leaf bits of spiced meat with crunchy little bits of vegetable in a light sauce and decided that she would have that often this spring and summer the cooks seemed to have outdone themselves she hadnt recognized most of the dishes on the tables more so than i expected majesty he replied with a definite twinkle in his eye i would hesitate to say anything except that you will hear about it from any one of a dozen gossips before the end of the day apparently our weaponsmaster is not as invulnerable to the darts of emotion as he thought but he is skilled enough in deception that even i thought that his meetings with the chronicler were all business until today selenay wrinkled her forehead in puzzlement trying to make out what talamir was getting at alberich andmyste and all at once it dawned on her alberich and myste oh my word she began to laugh delightedly as the prince and the two ambassadors looked puzzled oh but how lovely talamir you must pledge me on your word that you will not tease him about it above all things i do not want the poor man frightened off just when hes taken the first steps into this venture not i nor any other herald majesty talamir promised were too pleased to tell you the truth and we would rather that the trainees didnt find out about it eitheror at least not until the relationship is so long established that theyll be as terrified of saying anything about it as they are of offending him in any other way selenay turned to her guests still smiling at the thought that somber alberich who seemed as destined to remain chaste as any sworn priest should finally have found a lady who clearly found him fascinating she and myste were uncommonly wellacquainted despite the differences in their age and backgrounds and myste had dropped more than one little remark after they had all returned from the wars that had told selenay that the heraldchronicler had definite leanings in the weaponsmasters direction he treated her as she wanted to be treated with respect for her learning and as an equal in intelligence if they occasionally exasperated one another that was only to be expected with two such strong personalities but she had thought alberich impervious to anything but friendship apparently not you are puzzled gentlemen it is only a little romance among our heralds but a rather unlikely one or so i would have thought until now the season seems to have affected our weaponsmaster whom we all thought to be a man of iron and the great irony is that the lady in question is the only herald he was never successful in teaching the martial arts tothe chronicler herald myste the prince smiled vacantly clearly finding the subject of no particular interest but the hardornan ambassador chuckled right along with herald talamir well so the spring has managed to melt the heart of stone after all good for herald alberich and twice as many kudos to your herald myste my guess would be that she was the one to do the stalking these old warriors are as shy as partridge in hunting season when it comes to the matters of the heart talamir laughed that sir would be telling heraldic secrets i will leave it to your imagination and on that note i beg that we listen to the music and enjoy our repast selenay said firmly or else we will start to sound like a gaggle of village gossips the sun was just setting making the gardens a wondrous place indeed the dayblooming flowers wafted the last of their perfumes over the guests as they closed their blossoms for the night the night bloomers were just beginning to open as twilight closed over the garden a soft breeze sprang up the musicians kept to soft lyrical melodies and servants made their way about lighting the torches unobtrusively selenay set her empty plate and cup aside and suddenly felt a hand brushing hers as if by accident then it happened again she glanced aside at the prince who caught her gaze for just a moment touched the tips of her fingers with hers and gave her a quick conspiratorial wink she felt her heart give a leap and an answering smile crossed her lips before she turned her attention back to the musicians but she sighed and watched him covertly out of the corner of her eye his apparent attention was on the musicians too but she had the feeling that she was being watched behind the screen of his long lashes and halfclosed lids the breeze touched her cheeks cooling the heat that had suddenly suffused them she was glad for the shadows within the bower so that her blushes would not betray her surely that wasnt just the gesture of a gallant she reached for her wine cup and her fingers touched something else trying to appear as casual as she could she managed to get both objects and found that she was holding both her cup and a red rosebud from which all of the thorns had been carefully removed he turned his head slightly lowered his gaze to the flower meaningfully smiled and looked back to the musicians now her whole body seemed to vibrate with a thrill that she had never felt before to cover it and to moisten her mouth gone suddenly dry she sipped at the wine then she put the cup back downbut kept the rose the halfplanned masquerade took on a new importance and urgency in her mind she would give him the setting and she would see if he reacted to it and then then things would fall as they fell selenay stood very quietly in the exact middle of her dressingroom while three maids fussed and fluttered around her making sure that every detail of her costume was just so in a few moments she and her ladies would be going down into the gardens to perform the masque that would open the midsummer masquerade in fact there was music drifting through the open windows of her suite right now making her both impatient and nervous at the same time she stared fixedly at herself in the mirror on the wall opposite her her costume was identical to the ones her ladies would be wearing all of them would wear floating ethereal dresses composed of many layers of pale green silk gauze the topmost layer embroidered with tiny sprigs of leaves and flowers fitted to the waist and flaring outward like the petals of a trumpet flower it had a hint of a train with long trailing butterfly sleeves and a round neckline that showed just enough bosom to suggest rather than reveal with it she wore soft silk slippers dyed to match the gown none of them would wear jewels not even she only a loose trailing belt of ivy and bracelets and anklets of flowers all would be masked the strange featureless silver masks of the legendary moon maidens ovals without even eye holesa cunning layer of silver gauze where the eyes should be was perfectly easy for the dancers to see through but gave no hint of the eyes behind the masks their hair which otherwise would give their identities away was covered with more silk gauze in the form of a wrapped coif with floorsweeping veils crowned with chaplets of more flowers and the only difference between selenay and the rest of them was her secret she wore a single rosebud tucked into the ivy at the waistband of her gown she had not told the prince this he would have to discover it for himself in fact she had not told anyone this and since no one was to unmask before midnight she would be indistinguishable from any of her ladies except for that one detail which meant if she chose she should be able to slip away from the rest without being missed and throwing everyone into a panic she surveyed herself in the mirror and was satisfied with what she saw in designing this costume she and her seamstresses had taken every flattering aspect of every dress she had ever worn and combined it into a single gown in the past as often as not she had carefully selected her clothing to serve as armor this gown however was meant to be a weapon now the only thing that remained to be seen was if the weapon would be used she already knew just from what she saw in the mirror that it would be effective was it so silly of her to want to be wooed like an ordinary woman to know that the man who asked for her hand wanted her as well as what she represented she was sure now that karath was here for the purpose of courting her or else he would have gone home by this time there had been several opportunities for him to leave including when his own ambassador was recalled because of an emergency in his family he could have gone back to rethwellan then with the man who had brought him here in the first place he hadnt in fact he had stayed even though the rethwellan embassy was virtually empty but for a few servants even though half of his guards had gone back to protect the ambassador on his journey and she had loaned him some of her own guards until either the old ambassador returned or a new one with the rest of the entourage came to take his place she knew that most of her councilors were devoutly praying for such a match it would all but secure the southern border since rethwellan would be obliged to help defend it if the karsites somehow found the means to attack again it would bring many many trade advantages since valdemaran goods would probably be exempted from the onerous taxes on imported stuff it would mean easy access to several great trade markets of the south no one could or would object to a rethwellan prince on the grounds of either consanguinity or unequal rank but she didnt want a trade alliance or a military advantage she wanted a consort a partner a confidant someone she could talk to someone who well someone she could love someone who would love her who would treasure selenay as well as the queen as her father had treasured her mother she thought if things worked out as she hoped that she would be able to tell if that was true of karath she knew already that she was deliriously infatuated with him how could she not be nearly every woman of the court was half in love with his handsome face and charming manners every time he looked at her she felt a shiver of delight every time she thought about him she went hot and cold all over she had dreams of him at night that made her wake full of aching desire they had shared several conversations now which were if not completely private certainly mostly private he really did understand the terrible burden of the crown of being unable to ever have much real privacy of having to be everything to everyone they had talked about all the times when as children they had lost entire holidays being on show for the people theyd spoken of the difficulty of rinding real friends she thought that he understood these things as not even a herald could if he wanted her well he had her but only if he truly wanted her she was not going to go into this now unless she had him just as truly he would have to say so more than that he would have to convince her that he meant it otherwise well in the end she still might marry him but it would not be for a while maybe not for years if this was to be nothing more than an alliance marriage then she was not going to throw her heart after him thats the first sensible thing youve thought of caryo said she started caryo had been uncharacteristically silent lately and had notuntil nowsaid a single word about the prince what was the point i dont like him i dont know why but youyoure in love with him or with his face and manners and fine words anyway and youre not going to send him away just because i dont like him id have to give you a lot better reason than that and i dont have one selenay bit her lip and stared at her mirror but if you dont like him im also not going to try to stop you from doing something you really want to caryo said irritation clear in her mindvoice and if he can convince you that hes as much in love with you as you are with himwell theres nothing more to say it wont be the first time that someone in a brides family hasnt gotten along with the groom if human families can put up with such a thing so can i selenay found herself horribly torn between annoyance at caryo and gratitudeannoyance that caryo would have the infernal gall not to like karath and gratitude that she was not going to stand in the way of what her chosen wanted she settled finally on the gratitude there was no point in being annoyed anyway caryo would do what caryo did the two of them didnt always see eye to eye it hasnt happened she reminded caryo and what would be betterhim or someone that was beholden to one or more of my council someone we couldnt trust not to have a dozen people whispering in his ear whos to say your precious prince doesnt have that baggage already caryo countered then softened i suppose that youre right and besides if he doesnt take the bait tonight and he cant convince you then even if i eventually marry him anyway for alliance purposes it wont be until ive managed to control my own feelings selenay said firmly if i am doomed to an alliance marriage it will be with all my armor on she said that but underneath her words was the yearning the hope that shed never be required to live up to those words what was more she wasnt entirely certain that she could she thought that she covered it well however certainly caryo seemed mollified then in that casego and see whatever is to be seen with clear eyes caryo told her and slipped out of her mind she heaved a sigh of relief that could have gone very badly and the one thing that she could not bear would have been for caryo to be angry with her on the other hand if caryo never could grow to like karath well too bad there were even heralds who didnt particularly care for one another and not even all the companions got along in perfect accord on the other hand maybe she would mellow over time when alberich had first been chosen there had even been a group of young companions who had tried to attack him now there wasnt one of them that wouldnt defend him to the death and when he got into it with one of the traineesas he had over the broken mirroreven the companions of those trainees backed the weaponsmaster if karath truly loved her then with luck caryo would come around eventually it could be just a matter of time and patience she dismissed the whole situation from her mind tonight would be hersmore truly than that moment on the battlefield when she became queen more truly than the moment of her coronation because in both cases it had been the queen not selenay who had received the accolades whose life had been forever altered tonight it would be selenay and not the queen she glanced at the windows and was gratified to see that the last rays of sunset were gone and the light outside was deepening into twilight it was nearly time for the masque all the guests would have been assembled by now and would be waiting for the appearance of the moon maidens to begin the real festivities are my ladies ready she asked one of the maids in the antechamber majesty the girl said promptly she nodded good then thats enough fussing with the gown it is never going to be more perfect than it is now hand me my mask wordlessly one of the maids gave it to her she fitted it over her face and the maid tied it in place over the coif then settled the long trailing veil over her hair now so tightly braided and coiled under the coif that once the chaplet was pressed down over the veil and coif not a hair was to be seen the world as viewed through the eye holes of the mask was clear enough perhaps a little obscured as if by a thin mist but no worse than that the face presented to the mirror however was a featureless silver oval more than a bit uncanny the legend of the maidens of the moon was right out of rethwellan not valdemar and told of a young princesupposedly one of karaths ancestorswho met a maid dancing in his garden by the light of the full moon and fell in love with her only to discover that she was one of the twelve daughters of the king of the moon he went through many harrowing adventures to get to the moonkings kingdom to claim her only to be faced by a final testpick her out from among her twelve identical sisters as they danced before him she hoped that was enough of a hint to karath of what he was expected to do tonight lets go down she told the maids and went out to her antechamber to collect her eleven ladies but she was not the one in the lead she let lady jenice have that honor she was determined not to give karath any more hint than that rosebudand not to give anyone else any hint so that no one could prevent her from escaping from the throng with him if he chose right she had instructed all of her ladies to speak only in whispers and never to so much as hint as to their identities pointing out that the whole purpose of a masquerade was to keep everyone guessing insofar as that was possible until the unmasking and everyone taking part in the masque had agreed with alacrity one or two of her ladies she suspected had certain suspicions of their own lovers and were thinking to see if they could be caught out one or two she knew were hoping to use the opportunity for some clandestine flirtations of their own the rest were all simply intrigued by the idea which was more than enough to keep them in the spirit of the game she saw with more than a little amusement that she was not the only one of them to be wearing a flower tucked in the ivybelt but none of those flowers was a rosebud good one more point of confusion if karath was not serious enough to be paying attention the guests were all in the garden by now and she could hear the musicians playing incidental music she and the other ladies would perform their dance on the torchlit terrace above the gardens giving everyone a good view she felt a flutter in her stomach a nervousness greater than shed felt even at her own coronation her hands felt cold and clammy and her face flushed she was glad that she wasnt going to have to say anything or she was sure she would have stammered and stumbled over the words the ladies lined up at the terrace door in two lines forming six pairs selenay joined her left hand to her partners rightthat would be lady betrice though you wouldnt be able to tell that if you didnt know it a maid ran outside to let the bard in charge of the entertainment know that they were ready someone giggled nervously from outside muffled by the closed terrace doors she heard the bards staff pounding three times on the stone of the terrace and a single trumpet sound a brief silvery fournote call for attention the chattering stopped so did the music my lords and my ladies the bard called into the sudden silence in honor of his highness prince karathanelan of rethwellan her majesty and her ladies will now perform the masque of the moon maidens the doors were pulled open from outside by two pages the music began and the twelve ladies danced onto the stone terrace above the gardens to the strains of a solemn pavane selenay felt her heart pounding and concentrated fiercely on the steps of the dance watching the lady in front of her onetwothree diptwothree turntwothree pause to her immense relief selenay realized that she couldnt see a thing down below the terrace that the light from all of the lanterns and torches quite obscured all of the courtiers and guests below she could concentrate on the intricate patterns of the dance quite as if it was no more than just another rehearsal even though her heart was pounding as if she was running and her hands still felt as if shed been holding them in icerimmed water in a way it was just as well that this was not an easy dance nothing like any of the normal dances of the court it began as a round dance in slow giguetime then moved into a doubleround of two circles of six ladies with the pattern changed to a slow gavotte then it moved into a tripleround of three circles of four back in a gigue there were extra bows and flourishes of the veils and the long sleeves extra circlings and glidings between the figures of the dance in and out and around selenay wove her steps turning and bowing touching the fingers of her next partner then releasing them turning again to face a new partner then it became a line dance as a pavane then a sixcouple line dance in a chassone then a double line of three couples in minette then three square dances as a pavane and each time the dance changed they struck a new tableau for a hold of six bars of music until the music came around again to the first round dance at the end of which they struck a twelveperson tableau selenay wasnt even in the center of that final tableau she was over at the far right there was literally no way of telling which of the ladies she was she was quite certain of that as the music ended the applause from below was enthusiastic and very gratifying she felt herself flushing with pride and she was certain that she wasnt the only one they all broke their tableau and stepped to the edge of the terrace in a line holding hands and took their bows bending their knees and bowing their heads in a graceful acknowledgment of the applause it sounded quite genuine which was delightful actually since most masques in her experience were more endured than enjoyed and the accolades tended to be dutiful rather than enthusiastic then they came down the steps from the terrace to the lawn to mingle with the rest of the guests as dance music began and here was the hard partother than getting through the masque itself somehow she had to carry herself like one of the rest neither with too much authority nor too little neither with diffidence nor haughtiness she decided to avail herself first thing of one of the fans laid out on a table just where the terrace steps ended for the use of those who found themselves overly warm a fan was an excellent thing it served as a kind of shield as well as something to occupy the hands but before she could do more than pick one up someone grabbed her free hand startled she found that she had been seized by one of the more exuberant young courtiers and was being pulled into a rowdy countrystyle ring dance she couldnt tell who it was of course he was wearing an ornate and rather antique uniform or livery and a mask made in the shape of a roosters head it was clear he had taken her for one of her ladies and not the queen dont resist she reminded herself and allowed him to pull her into the circle everyone was laughing sometimes tripping over the little uneven parts of the ground and acting altogether like a lot of children and somewhat to her surprise she found herself havingfun and in a moment she understood why she was anonymous and she had been chosen by this young man for what he could see of her body not because she was selenay of course he assumed she was one of selenays ladies at least but behind the anonymity of his mask and hers they were able to act freely as she romped her way around the ring she realized that she hadnt felt this lighthearted since shed been a trainee and just selenay who happened to sleep over in the palace and not in a room on the girls side of the dormitory floor she was very glad however that all the parts of her costume had been fastened securely it wouldnt do to have the coif and veil or worse the mask fall off and reveal her for who she was she took the precaution in a moment between dances to knot her sleeves and tie up her veil all the same no point in getting them tangled and pulled off either a kind of madness infected her and she was not the only one that was the thing about a masquerade you could be as wild and silly as you liked under the anonymity of a mask especially if you had one of the more common masks as she whirled through the steps of another dance she saw at least two roosters three horned men and no less than five bears she of course was one of a dozen moon maidens and there were cats wild women goddesses and butterfly masks that were no less popular another dance struck up immediately this one a brasle where two lines of dancers ran at each other then seized new partners and whirled madly until it was time to run at each other again she went through four rounds of that when suddenly she was seized by someone in a costume she did not at all recognize he wore a halfmask of gold surmounted by a huge hat crowned with feathers the costume an elaborate doublet and trews of silk and velvet in reds and yellows and as the young man paused in their heady rush he bent over and whispered i am the moon prince have i chosen aright selenay my moon maiden she pulled back startled and he laughed in karaths voice and boldly plucked the rosebud from her belt i see by this token that i have he said the mouth beneath the halfmask grinning hererun with me he took her hand she hesitated only long enough to snatch a handful of her skirt so she could run more freely and the two of them sprinted handinhand off into the depth of the gardens laughing like a pair of children she didnt know where they were going she didnt care they ran through torchlight and shadow the sounds of music and merriment fading behind them she more than half expected him to run toward companions field or some other remote place but instead he ran toward the palace once again he had chosen correctly there was no one in this part of the garden at all and little light they were right beside the windows of the collegium kitchen which at this hour was dark there in the shadows of a thick clump of bushes he finally stopped and pulled her into his arms wont you unmask now selenay he murmured confronted with the featureless oval of her disguise and as if to set the example he pulled off his hat which proved to be fastened to his halfmask she put up her hands to the back of her head and loosened the chaplet but he was too impatient to wait for her fumbling fingers he carefully took off the chaplet then the veil and untied the mask himself discarding each on the ground beside his hat with every item he removed her heart pounded a little faster when he had laid her face bare he looked into her eyes for a long moment then suddenly his arms were around her again his lips crushed against hers and she felt a heat rise in her and overwhelm her she felt as if she was made of butter melting against him pressing her body into his wanting nothing so much as to have the kiss go on forever and ever buttoo soon for her desireshe felt his arms loosen and he lifted his face from hers to stare down into her eyes again there was just enough moonlight for him to see her upturned face his was all in shadow and she strained to hear his voice by the gods selenay i have wanted to do that from the moment i saw you he breathed she lifted her face wordlessly to his but he shook his head and with every evidence of regret loosened her from his grasp no he said i dare not or i will not stop with but a kiss no she asked feeling obscurely disappointed then but i can do this he said interrupting her he dropped to his knees clasping both her hands in his here it is only you and i not our countries not our councils only ourselves to satisfy we will please only ourselves we will answer only to our own will here selenay i ask this for myself and for myselfwould you will you grant your hand to me in marriage he had read her riddle more than that he had answered her invitation and her challenge and met it his prince to her moon maiden and nownow away from all witnesses all eyes he had asked her to wed him specifically for himself and not for his country if this wasnt the answer to her questions she could not imagine what could be yes she whispered with all my heart he leaped to his feet and took her in his arms again and her whole body thrilled to the caresses that he bestowed on it she would quite willingly have torn off her own gown and melded her body with his there and then it was his restraint that stopped anything more from happening and though a great deal of her was frustrated and disappointed the rest of her was grateful and full of admiration at his selfcontrol here he said as he actually stepped away from her then took her hand and bestowed a tender kiss on the palm you may be only one moon maiden among twelve but we should not take the risk that you are missed let me help you mask again and so she stood burning with desire for him as he clever as her best maid masked her hot cheeks with the silver ovoid again and placed the veil over her head and the chaplet atop it then he retrieved his own mask and resumed his guise as well shall we walk he asked my own lady a shiver went up her spine at the caress in his words to cool ourselves she murmured in reply and he laughed i think that cooling is what we both need my moon maiden he chuckled it is just as well that our masks will hide our faces or they would surely betray us to anyone with eyes in his head he took her hand and led her back toward the festivities at a far more decorous pace this time she was glad of the night air and the chance to get her pounding heart to quiet itself her hand trembled in his and he felt the trembling and tightened his fingers about hers for a moment they passed other couples on their way to the dancinglawn making use of the little bowers and grottoes of the gardens standing or sitting together they also passed places shrouded in darkness from which little sighs and murmurs came that made her cheeks flush again and a stab of envy lance through her but karath took no notice or at least did not appear to they sauntered on together like any couple on a leisurely stroll until they stepped onto the lawn below the terrace and into the full glare of the torchlight she did not know what she would have done then but the situation was taken out of their hands by a wild game of crackthewhip that crossed their path the moment they stepped onto the torchlit grass the trailing girl seized karaths hand in passing and since he still had selenays she was perforce now the running laughing end of the whip until she in her turn could grab another hand before long the scampering line was too unwieldy to be a whip and became a dancing running snake winding its way among the more sedate and older courtiers who either laughed indulgently or frowned and snorted behind their masks around and around they went in and out of the ornamental bushes until everyone that had any youth in his body had been caught up in it the musicians seemed to have been infected by the excitement for they did not stop or even pause in their playing until selenay was out of breath her side aching the corners of her mouth actually hurting from all of the laughing and smiling she was doing when they snaked around a potted rosemary tree she finally let go of karaths hand and that of the person behind her so that she could drop out of the line the person behind her ran up and grabbed karaths hand to keep the line going and he was soon out of her sight with her hand pressed to her side breathing hard she sought out a stone bench that was too exposed to be a choice of lovers and sat down on it she wished she had the fan that she had lost somewhere back when the dancing began but at least the breeze was cool and her gown was light she fanned herself with a piece of her veil and took deep breaths waiting for the stitch in her side to pass but she had not been there long before karath appeared again and wonder of wonders he brought a fan for her he handed it to her with a graceful bow and she thanked him and wafted herself with it wondering gratefully if there was any other man here who would have thought of such a thing he took a seat beside her on the bench and covered her free hand with his own one thing only my own lady he said quietly his voice barely audible over the music is it your pleasure that we make our choice known tonight or would you tonight she said quickly if we wait if i go first to the councilthere will be objections however trivial and the councilors will want to argue it over for days and days but if we simply tell them at the unmasking they will accept what they must you are as wise as you are beautiful he said warmly patting her hand i would not have thought of that andhow fitting for any who might recognize my costume if we are standing together at the unmasking or better still she said suddenly seeing it all in her minds eye on the terrace his eyes sparkled behind his mask oh well thought how soon before midnight strikes that she could answer for there was a timecandle visible from where they sat she pointed and they could both see that there would be just enough time for them to slip into the palace and get into place before the trumpeter marked the moment of unmasking giggling with a giddy exhilaration she now led him in through an unguarded door in the public part of the palace then back through the maze of corridors to the terrace door where she had so lately stood there was no one there now not even a page and the doors stood open together hand in hand they walked out onto the terrace at the exact moment that the trumpeter sounded the call of midnight with a cheer the masks came offall but theirs with an instinct for the drama of it they both waited until the rest of the guests noticed that there was a couple standing alone on the brightlylit terrace where the masque had taken place that one of the figures was a moon maiden began to grasp that the other must be prince karathanelan and at that moment he pulled off his mask and flung it behind himself as she pulled chaplet veil mask and coif all off shaking her hair loose so that it fell down around her shoulders and as the guests saw that it was her he again pulled her to him and bent down in their first public embrace and kiss she closed her eyes as her ears filled with the great cheer that went up as her arms went around him and she thought in that moment that there could be no happier person in all of valdemar than she from the moment it was announced alberich had deliberately planned to avoid the masquerade this was precisely the sort of gathering at which he felt most uncomfortable and after all it was primarily a court function and not one at which he expected anything significant would happen either those older members of the court upon whom he had his eye were unlikely to use such an occasion for any conspiratorial gathering both he and talamir were agreed on that of all the times and places in which one could talk with fellow conspirators an occasion such as this where there were dozens of people milling about all masked so that you could not know just who exactly was around you was not ideal and furthermore although many popular plays and romances would have attempted to persuade otherwise a gathering that was held out of doors where you could never be sure there was not someone hiding and listening to you was probably a very bad choice for passing on secret information alberich hated this sort of entertainment with a passion and since selenay was going to be costumed identically with eleven of her ladies at least until the moment of unmasking this was probably one of the few times when she would be safer without a bodyguard unless of course all twelve of them were to be granted bodyguards so he had said decidedly that he was not needed nor wanted talamir had agreed with him and had suggested that he might wish to actually relax that evening for a change he had in fact decided to keep an eye on norris that evening he already knew where to find him there was not a performance tonight and with all of the young nobles up at the masquerade there was little chance that norris would be meeting any of them down slumming with the actors tonight no if he met up with anyone above his own station it would be because there was something more than drinking going on this was one of the things that alberich was going to keep a watch out for someone who should be at the masquerade who was not if anybody had asked him what he was hoping to discover he would have told them that he was not in fact hoping for anything he knew better than to expect a result from any given evening results never came when you expected them you got ready for them in case they cropped up and you watched for them to make sure you didnt miss them when they came but you never expected them since myste would not be there tonight as it wasnt a performance night he decided to trot out a new persona one that was designed to blend in as well as myste didthe aging cranky scholar his station would be shabby middleclass genteel poverty but poor because he spent all his money on books travel to confer with other scholars and paying to print his own monographs on obscure subjects he wore clothing that was of good material but not new a longsleeved highcollared belted tunic and trews of heavy linen in a rusty black with a shirt of white linen and the flat scholars cap not shabby but also neither wellcaredfor nor wellfitted he had an old leather satchel stuffed full of papers and books he brought a reading book with him parked himself in an outoftheway corner of the common room and apparently kept his nose in it while he ate in an absentminded fashion he had engaged a room but it was a very small one and did not come with candle or lantern so it was perfectly reasonable for him to take his book here to read he had debated getting a set of lenses like mystes but decided against it if he were checking to see if someone was in disguise and snooping about the first thing he would do would be to arrange to knock their lenses off to see if they were real a pair of plain clear glass lenses would be a dead giveaway and for once his scars were an asset rather than a liability by enhancing them rather than trying to conceal them and at the same time enhancing those creases that would in time become frownlines he was able to age himself credibly by nearly thirty years he did not know for certain that norris would be here tonight but with no play on there was a good likelihood that he would at least spend the afternoon in rehearsals then have some dinner here where he was fed for free before going out anywhere and at any rate even if the man didnt start his evening here there was a good chance that by careful listening alberich would pick up some gossip about him or his whereabouts but his luck was truly in tonight not only did norris begin his night here but the rehearsal ran long so that norris came down from his room about two candlemarks after sunset dressed in quiet elegance all fawnskin breeches and fine linen shirt open at the throat thighhigh boots nearly as tight as the breeches he stepped up to the bar and ordered himself a drink and shortly after that so carefully timed that alberich did not for a moment think it was coincidence someone came looking for him except that the man didnt exactly come looking for him the way an admirer would he didnt begin by asking the doorkeeper if norris was about for instance and he didnt come up to him openly as a simple admirer would the stranger cast a glance around the common room his eye lit on norris standing beside the bar and chatting mug in hand since alberich was watching norris very carefully he saw the actor catch the strangers eye and hold it for just a moment then the newcomer took a seat of his own in the same outoftheway corner that alberich was already in it was an awkward little culdesac beneath the stairs big enough for only a couple of twoperson tables alberich already had the most exposed of the tables the stranger took the one that was the least exposed to the rest of the room alberich went on reading he did not even look up as the man brushed by him nor when the serving wench brought him his order norris didnt pay any great amount of attention overtly eitherbut after some time the actor left the bar and drifted over in his direction by this time the common room was at its most crowded and virtually the only seats left were at twoperson tables like the ones alberich and the stranger each had somehow alberich didnt think that norris was going to ask if he could join the scholar norris paused for a moment beside alberich alberichs neck prickled but he didnt look up from his book surely it wasnt possible that the actor was going to sit at his table surely it isnt possible that he recognized me the actor certainly gave alberich a good lookover alberich did just what his persona would have done he read outwardly oblivious to anything going on around him norris moved on and said to the stranger friend would you mind if i sat at this table be my guest the man said with every sign of indifference and that would have been perfectly ordinary if it hadnt been that both of them pitched their voices just a little louder than if theyd been talking merely to each other and not for the benefit of anyone who happened to be nearby alberich turned his page and furrowed his brow it was appropriate to furrow his brow at this point the author was taking a slightly controversial stance and one that someone like alberich was bound to disagree with alberich had chosen this book quite deliberately he was very familiar with it and if challenged could converse knowledgeably about the contents and tonight he just might have to despite the heat in the overcrowded room he felt a chill of apprehension he heard the scrape of a stool on the floor the sounds of someone sitting down behind him he didnt actually hear anything then but the serving wench materialized as they all did whenever norris summoned them however imperceptible the signal was to anyone else the actor ordered dinner and when it came there was a pause as the wench flirted a little with norris then was summarily shooed away is it all right said the stranger in a very very soft voice safe as houses norris replied casually safer than my room cant tell who might be on the other side of the wall there well thought alberich thats what you get for insisting on the big corner room norris had recently demandedand gottenone of the better chambers at the inn even with myste keeping a jaundiced eye on the take the innkeeper was doing a phenomenal amount of business thanks to the ongoing presence of the actors here and couldnt afford to offend norris at this point the problem with the new room however was that while norris had one of his fellow actors as a neighbor on one side the other was a room that anyone could rent and it was often taken by someone who wanted to be near the actor that would practically guarantee a snoop with her ear to the wall what about him persisted the stranger and alberich knew by the prickling feeling on the back of his neck that the man was pointing at him in some way probably with a little jerk of the chin less obtrusive unless you were watching for something of the sort hmm there was a scrape norris this time alberich could tell from the position of the chair hes going to do something alberich thought he could guess what and a moment later it came and now he had to do something that was against all of his instincts he had to relax not tighten his muscles in anticipation the scholar would be deep in the book and would not even be aware of the rest of the world you should be able to come up behind him and shout in his ear without his noticing there was the sound of a stumble and norris blundered into him spilling his drink knocking the book out of his hand nearly knocking him over alberich did not try to save himself he let the chair go over and himself with it as with a cry he lurched for his book norris was there before him picking it up all apology offering his hand and when alberich was on his feet dusting him off horribly clumsy of me i beg your pardon while norris babbled on he was managing to get a look at the book in fact at the place where alberich had been reading and thank the sunlord for that since it meant he was not looking closely at alberichs disguise instead he handed it back to alberich so quickly though that it was unlikely anyone like the scholar would have realized that the actor had examined the book before relinquishing it but an actor had to be a quick study the man probably had both pages memorized by now alberich snatched it away glared angrily at him and fussed over the book making certain that none of the pages were bent nothing stained you clumsy oaf he shrilled pitching his voice to a whiny falsetto curse you fellow where did you think you were going ill buy you a new drink norris was saying as the serving wench bustled up with a towel to clean up the mess if youve so much as creased a page youll buy me a new book young man alberich replied querulously copies of cantons lives of the philosophers do not grow on trees no they dont im sure norris said agreeably as the serving wench brought another drink and norris paid her for it and i would be devastated to think i had ruined one i particularly admire his scholarly treatise on loval hestalion for instance alberich simply gave him a good long stare as if suspiciously certain that norris was only trying to jolly his way past alberichs anger its lowal hestalion young man as you would know if you had actually read the book rather than making something up to try and worm your way into my favor and what is more the man may be sound enough on other biographies but his treatise on hestalion is little more than a repetition of scurrilous rumor norris threw up his hands and laughed caught well i most sincerely apologize again i have restored your drink and i hope i havent foxed your book so are we quits the book appears to be intact alberich said icily i believe i am also intact and i beg the pleasure of your absence yes sir norris laughed and went back to his place while alberich ostensibly and ostentatiously reburied himself in his book so there you see norris said under the sound of the conversations all around them nothing but a bookworm we could burn down the place around him and he wouldnt notice good enough the games in play tonight the stranger said we think it will play out well good news norris said with satisfaction and my reward youll get it when the bond is sealed the stranger replied even if all goes well there will be opposition we may need you before then and dont forget well also need you after for a time anyway no you wont norris growled sounding irritated now the boys a natural seducer and the girls untried and i absolutely the finest instructor in the arts of seduction that was ever born you say hes showing his hand tonight if he doesnt have her well enchanted before the week is out and wedded within the moon ill eat my hat without salt all well and good but hell still need pretty speeches and hes not bright enough to make them up on his own the stranger said irritation in his own voice until theres an heir in the offing were not safely home and i dont get my theater norris sighed as if much put upon all right then ill stay available but hed better not drag this on too long it doesnt take that long to get a girl with child and after that keeping her bound will be up to him ive never seen a woman born yet that didnt make every excuse in the world for the father of her child after that well have what we need the voice purred the tone made the hair on alberichs head stand up there was something very sinister about it that made alberich wonder uneasily just what it was that the voice and his cohorts needed and he felt very sorry for the girl in question but it seemed that whatever was going on here and now it had little or nothing to do with the security of valdemar evidently norris had been coaching some unscrupulous young man in how to seduce a young woman into marriage he could almost picture her in his mind as he carefully turned another page in his book some young lonely plain thing but wealthyfor surely only great wealth could be the cause for such a scheme would there be any way to warn her assuming he could find out who she was probably not even coming from a herald she probably wouldnt believe anything that anyone told her against her beloved not if she was as infatuated as norris thought and he was a practiced seducer after all but he didnt fool myste a little voice in the back of his mind reminded him yes well myste had been fooled at least once in her past when she was younger you had to have experience in something before you could recognize danger when you saw it and since the stranger called the unknown young woman a girl she probably wasnt old enough to have experience in much of anything poor thing he turned a page of his book groped for his drink without looking at it and took a sip well norris was very generous this was much better beer than the stuff alberich had ordered the first time around the scrape of a stool signaled someones departure and it turned out to be the stranger he eased his way past alberich being exceptionally careful not to jar him alberich ignored him entirely though he would very much have liked to get a good look at him the best alberich could manage was a quick glance at the mans profile it looked faintly familiar in the way that someone looked if seen once or twice it could be anybody alberich had seen around here alberich filed the face in the back of his mind now norris was alonebut not for long there was a bit of a commotion at the door the sound of high shrill voices and a flash of bright color alberich heard norris chuckle under his breath and buried his nose even further in the book but norris was the one who got up and sauntered over to the trio of women who were clearly what alberichs mother had been mistaken for now alberich knew he was no expert when it came to womens dress especially not here in valdemar but there were some commonalities among the ladies of negotiable virtue everywhere and this lot showed every one of the sartorial signs there were flounces and ribbons and curls and painted cheeks and lips all done to excess colors were bright including hair color for all three sported hair of colors not normally found in nature there was a great deal of cleavage a great deal of bare arm and shoulder and even a scandalous amount of leg showing jewelry was positioned the way a general arranged his best troops with the intent of directing the enemys sight to a particular object well my lovelies norris said genially as they clustered around him like gaudy butterflies around a tall flower what brings you here by this time norris had the attention of everyone in the room and very well knew it he was playing for the crowd and the crowd sensed it was going to get a free showshort maybe but nonetheless free you said the boldest flirting acidyellow hair at him weve a bet on that you cant take all three of us at once the entire room howled with laughter in which norris joined throwing back his head and roaring in that case he shouted and alberich at last looked up with an affronted expression on his face youre doomed to lose my bawd in that case cried the second of the trio with hair the same blueblack as a ravens wing boldly twining herself around him we win in the barrage of laughter that followed that sally norris seized the bold one picked her up in his arms and trailing the other two went straight up the stairs to his room now it was entirely possible that all that had been a ruse to cover norris exit through a window but alberich didnt think so for one thing that new corner room would be cursed difficult to get out of without being seen for another norris had looked as surprised as anyone else with the whores replies so there it was he might as well go home since not even norris couldwell it would take him the rest of the night if he was going to make good on his boast and not lose the bet and that was one sort of bet that a man like norris could not bear to lose he shut his book and went over to his room he took off his tunic and turned it insideout now it was brown moleskin he stuffed the hat in the satchel of books and papers now he looked like a welloff working man probably enjoying a night out he saturated a rag with sendal oil and used it to take off his wrinkles then doused his head in the basin to wash his hair clean of the streaks of gray he had painted in he rumpled up the bed making sure it looked slept in and left other signs of recent occupation and when he was certain that no one was watching he went out the window the room was already paid for no one would raise a hue and cry finding it empty in the morning he had told them that he expected to be away by first light theyd simply assume he had been as good as his word still he did have one thing that rather sordid business about the unknown young woman there might be something in that worth investigating later i suppose i can get some sort of list of wealthy young women who have full rights to their fortunes somewhere he reflected and whichever one posts the banns in the next moon or so would probably be the one im looking for he was so involved in his own thoughts that he actually wasnt even thinking about his companionuntil kantor himself startled him great good gods exclaimed kantor in his mind surprising him so much that he stumbled over his own two feet he recovered without falling but he was thoroughly irritated when he answered back what he snapped the masquerade kantor exclaimed selenayat the masqueradeshe just picked karathanelan in front of everyone at the masquerade picked him for what alberich began with even more irritation and then of course it dawned on him kantor would hardly be this shocked over the young queen choosing a dancing partner she chose the prince of rethwellan as her consort but now he was bewildered a little by all that he did not know about valdemar can she do that just pick someone like that she can and she has was kantors reply we had better get back up the hill and quickly every herald in haven is going to want to say something about this since alberich was already moving as fast as he could without being obvious he saved his breath for running which he did when he got into the alleys where no one was there to see him it seemed to take forever before he was safely in his little room at the back of the bells stables though he knew rationally that hed made good time in a remarkably short period of time alberich was back in his gray leathers and they were cantering through the streets heading for the collegium what happened exactly alberich asked moving easily with kantors gait and keeping a sharp eye out for unwary pedestrians kantor told him didnt caryo guess what was going to happen he demanded why didnt she warn the rest of us we could have gone to more pains to investigate him i dont know kantor said mirroring alberichs irritation maybe she thought it would all blow over this shocked everyone no one guessed selenay would do this i suppose she didnt even confide in her own companion he kept his thoughts on that subject to himself all right granted he wasnt the most competent when it came to matters of the heart and particularly of romance but there were some things that were obvious he hadnt set eyes on this prince himself but hed heard from plenty of people that the boy was absurdly goodlooking when you took a young woman like selenay who surely cherished her own dreams of romance even though she knew very well she was unlikely to fulfill themand you presented her with a handsome young man of the proper birth and with all of the advantages that a foreign minister could ask forwell what did you expect to happen the only reason that he alberich had been blindsided was because the young man himself had given no outward signsthat alberich knew ofthat he was interested in a marriage alliance with selenay and valdemar clearly both he and selenay had played these cards very close to the chest if even caryo had thought it would all blow over so what does anyone know about this prince he demanded the way cleared they were in among the manors of the highborn now and the highborn were all still at the masquerade so the way was clear kantor broke into a gallop i dont know anything more than you do kantor replied but youll shortly find out alberich cut his questions short but behind his silence they were piling up like stones before an avalanche and that is all any of us know myste concluded since she was the chronicler she had elected to be the one to collect all of the information there was about the prince and all of the information there was concerning the prince and concerning the reaction this unique declaration was going to have on the council myste sat down on a bale of hay they were meeting in the stablesthe companions stables the building had the advantage of being big enough to hold all of them and away from prying eyes and eavesdropping ears no one seemed particularly ready to break the silence that followed mystes words finally someone coughed and caryo doesnt like him but cant say why said the herald who taught some of the law classes i am reluctant to place too much weight on this not even all of the companions get along all the time there are companions that dislike anyone who isnt a herald including their chosens own relatives i would even hate to speculate it could just be his natural arrogance that gets her back up talamir suggested the boy is arrogant its to be expected in someone with that much rank and privilege who is also that confoundedly goodlooking it could be jealousy said someone else in what sounded like the voice of experience just as peled said were not perfect and neither are they i know the first time i flirted with an outsider my jandal got as jealous as anything someone sighed i dont suppose it would do any good to reason with her about it not if you dont want her to call for a priest and wed the boy on the spot keren said flatly for those of you who dont happen to have experience with first love infatuation keren surely exclaimed someone else first love first infatuation it doesnt matter because its a strong emotion either way keren snapped back shes young she just lost her father and we can guess that hes been playing all the parts she needs right now in a single packagepart comforter part protector part lover and may i add her council has been putting pressure on her to make some kind of marriage with all of that going on not only wont she hear anything bad about the boy shell turn on the one who tries to criticize him ive seen that time and time again in my village the fastest way to get a girl to marry someone is to tell her you dont want her to she nodded with an air of finality alberich saw her looking at him and just shrugged if anyone thought he had any insights on what would work with selenay they were going to be sadly disappointed so what are we going to do asked someone in a small voice that sounded very bewildered in the darkness now talamir cleared his throatand rose to the occasion we will support her and her choice he said firmly no matter how hasty or illthought we believe it to be think the worst the very worst he can do is to make her unhappyat which point since valdemar law supports divorcement he may well find himself packed back to rethwellan with his tail between his legs there were some chuckles at that weak but laughter nonetheless and at least in alberichs case a sigh of profound relief this was the old talamir seeing the larger picture and finding the cleanest path through what could turn out to be a quagmire the best that he can do is to make her happy and if he does that even if we still do not care for him who are we to object talamir went on the shadows cast by the lantern beside him making him look as ancient as a grove oak remember unless he is chosen by a companion and becomes a herald he will never be more than the queens consort who will have only as much power or as little as she grants himand all of it behind the throne talamir looked around managing to meet the eyes of every herald there so let us determine to put a good face on things he continued offer her our congratulations singly and as a group support her choice make sure that she knows that we are there as we always have been for herald selenay as well as the queen and that seemed to be about all that anyone could offer alberich went back to the salle feeling very uneasy he hoped that would be enough he was afraid that it wouldnt be but the game had been played out before any of them even knew it was in play at all now they could only ride along with it and wait the game was played something about that phrase nagged alberich as he fell into an uneasy sleep but it wasnt until he woke the next morning that he realized where he had heard it last and it was only after the recollection jolted him that he realized that there might be a connection between where he had heard it first and selenay he had the flash of memory as he moved into wakefulness and it brought him alert all at once his mind moving from a standing start into a full gallop the game is about to playit had been that stranger talking to norris last night he could hear the voice clearly in his mind it had been a welleducated voice and if there was one thing that it was hard for the welleducated to do it was to counterfeit being a member of a lower class than their own the similarity of phrases was what had given him that shock to the system what if the girl they had been talking about the one alberich had assumed was simply wealthy and plain had actually been selenay and that the young man being tutored in seduction had been the prince of rethwellan it fit it certainly fit untried sheltered accustomed to flattery but not to the kind of practiced seducer norris was she would be easy prey for a man of norris experienceor one coached by him and selenay alone in all of the court was the only young woman who would have been sheltered from such men there was the irony if she had spent any time among her peers she would have seen attractive young men use their looks in such an unattractive wayand young women do the same orperhaps not she had been the heir and even in the court that might have protected her odd as it might seem the cads in court circles saved their wiles for two sorts of womenthe lowerclass girls that they seduced and abandoned and the unattractive wealthy ones they seduced and wedded and abandoned on their estates in the country while they came back to court to enjoy themselves unencumbered by the inconvenient wife they wouldnt have dared to use those ploys on selenay still she had been sheltered in another way from the time she had been chosen she had been at the collegium and not the court she never saw the intrigues among her peers because she was among another set of peers for whom intrigue was simply out of the question even when the occasion had called for it she hadnt spend much time socially in court circles she spent her social time among heralds or at least she had until shed become queen but there should have been one creature above all who would haveor should haverealized what was happening before this and even if she hadnt been able to stop it she should have been able to warn the rest of them kantor he called i follow you his companion replied i hope you dont mind you jarred me awake and i just followed your thought once he would have been angry not now now in fact he was grateful kantor had become the perfect partner in a way the shieldbrother the man you could depend on to fall in at your side and match you move for move thats the way its supposed to work well he could see that clearly it didnt always youre thinking selenay and caryo there was a moment of hesitation you cant understand why caryo didnt nip this in the bud especially since she doesnt much like prince karath and why she didnt realize how far things had gotten exactly alberich replied you and i areexceedingly compatible now we are about the same age with similar experience selenay and caryoarent i mean theyre compatible but their experiences are vastly different alberich blinked in surprise that hadnt occurred to him as a possibility think of caryo as a maiden aunt or a virginal scholarly sister who is much much older than selenay sheswell to be honest shes rather sexless kindhearted and stalwart protective absolutely ready to comfort when selenay is hurt or angry but as thick as two short planks when it comes to romance and especially sex oh this was beginning to make him feel a little ill caryo is the sort of person whose shoulder you cry on when your father dies the wise and clever person you could ask for help with political and administrative problems not the person you go to when youre mooncalfing over a boy and as for sexual attractionyoud be horribly embarrassed even to hint that you had such a thing to her because she would be horribly embarrassed if you brought it up now suddenly it all made sense terrible sense at least insofar as he understood young women and insofar as caryo being in the dark about all this right along with everyone else dear god he replied aghast weve all been blindsided our own damned fault kantor agreed we the companions should have known we know caryo better than anyone but selenayand she was exactly the right companion for a girl who was bound and determined not to think too hard about anything that wasnt involved in being the heir and a herald if sendar was still alive if sendar was alive hed have sent the boy packing after making him look ridiculous and unpalatable in selenays eyes first thats the only way to handle such things alberich was at least on surer ground there as an officer hed had to break up many an illtimed romance but with selenay alone we didnt think about how caryo should change and you heralds didnt think that selenay would find herself looking for something outside of her duties we were fools alberich said flatly she was clearly drowning in duty and we thought a festival or two would be enough blindsided and there is only one way to deal with it and that is to go along with it just as talamir said last night yes even if it turns out that this rethwellan princeling is a rounder and a cad who has been studying how to seduce our queen the very thought made him angry made him want to get hold of the blackguard and beat him with the flat of his swordbut kantor was right and talamir was right hadnt he just been watching plays all this winter and spring that proved that very point the best way to get a young woman set on a particular young man and vice versa was to oppose the match the only way to separate her from someone who was not good for her was to be reserved on the subject of the young man while being supportive of her then when things began to go wrong and only then did you make it clear that you were on her side the only difference between a cliche and a truism was the skill and intricacy with which the latter was presented and unfortunately norris was a much better actor than the tawdry plays he presented for the common folk would have suggested if he was indeed coaching the prince have you talked with caryo about this he asked his companion as he rolled over on his back and stared up at the ceiling not yet right now shes very hurt that selenay didnt even hint of this to her and frankly angry with herself for not seeing it and she should be well he wasnt going to be the one to say anything but kantor was right in retrospect selenay had virtually handed everyone a map to her feelings with that masque and all anyone had thought if theyd thought at all was how clever she was to have devised something that would entertain and honor all at the same time kantor was right in this case caryo had been as thick as two short planks and so had they least said soonest mended the companion said philosophically i am keeping my thoughts to myself until caryo is ready to talk to the rest of us but i think that where selenay is concerned our voices must be raised in a song with but a single refrain which is all we want is your happiness i think he replied its true enough at least the feeling behind that phrase would be absolutely genuine all any of them did want was selenays happiness they just wanted it without the princes presence involved meanwhile i dont think you should give up chasing norris kantor continued now i think that young devlin was probably his contact in the court to pass him information about selenay herself so i dont think you should take your eyes off devlin either he smiled grimly up at the ceiling ah now nor do i in the first place norris might not have been tutoring the prince in the second place if that was indeed what was toward wemay someday need the evidence because what i overheard makes me think that once theres a wedding the prince will slip selenay might excuse him a time or two but she wont put up with it forever and then we can prove to her how she was manipulated then because he was honest he had to add if she was he might really be in love with her he might be everything he seems but my gut says he isnt he felt kantors satisfaction youre better at this business than you were he sighed i could wish that there was no reason to be the weaponsmaster is all i ever cared to be we play the game were put into chosen said kantor which seemed to be about the only possible answer after that however it seemed as if a whirlwind had suddenly engulfed them and the whirlwinds name was selenay alberich never had a chance to voice any opinion at all because it was never asked of him selenay simply seemed to assume that because she was enchanted by the prince everyone else was too she had never before had anything that she wanted really and truly wanted so much as prince karathexcept perhaps for her father to be alive again but the latter was impossible and the prince was entirely within her reach she was lonely she was in love and at the moment there was no more potent combination she could not imagine living without him and she was taking steps so that she wouldnt have to alberich was not present at the council meeting that day after the masquerade where she announcednot asked not even for adviceannounced arbitrarily and making it clear that she would brook no opposition that she and the prince were going to wed and that it would be within the month he was told about it later that evening by elcarth elcarth kyril jadus and talamir were all in alberichs quarters which made it a bit crowded once myste keren and ylsa joined the group elcarth was looking more than a bit dazed kyril a little grim and talamir veryquiet and contained inhumanly so actually it made the hair on the back of alberichs neck rise but they all had other considerations at the moment you ladies wouldnt have known her father when he was at his most stubborn elcarth said rubbing his hands over his temples when there was something he knew he wanted done and he wasnt going to take no for an answer he was a force of nature and there was no point in getting in his way any more than there is in standing in the path of an avalanche and expecting it to stop because you want it to it was like seeing her father all over again with the addition that she was positively fixated on getting her way in this as if it not only would be it had to be or the world would end she simply rode right over the top of any opposition kyril seconded not that there was very much not when orthallen and gartheser threw in on her side but stillive never seen her like this she became a petty tyrant in fact it was as if anyone who said anything contrary to her just didnt exist she was afraid talamir said into the silence fear can make anyone a tyrant the men looked at him blankly alberich was among them he couldnt imagine how talamir had come to that conclusion there was no logic in it but keren and myste exchanged an eloquent glance and after keren nodded myste spoke up she was afraid that if she didnt force this through now she would lose him you mean myste said it was a statement not a question and if she loses him it will break her and she knows it i think so talamir passed a hand over one eye and looked for a moment impossibly frail how can it break her elcarth asked aghast great good gods shes been through much worse than having a love affair end she does not precisely confide in me so i can only judge by what i see and sense based on what i know i have never been in love myself he added somewhat wistfully so all i can do is guess but as for why it will break herit is precisely because she has been through so much in this last year i believe that she sees prince karath asas a sort of lifeline i thinkmaybeits because hes an outsider myste put in i mean she thinks she cant unburden herself to the rest of us because were a part of that burden and anyway hes made himself indispensable now if she loses him it will be that proverbial last pebble that starts the avalanche maybe hes only a pebble but sometimes thats all it takes think about it think back to how you felt with your first loves not what you know now the first time a youngster falls in love theres no way to tell the difference between love and infatuation from the inside ylsa added sadly so as far as selenay and this situation are concerned right now the difference is negligible you mean we treat it as love even though it might beis probablyinfatuation kyril looked pained but remember what i told you about supporting her talamir warned but if she goes on like this overruling everything before anyone even has a chance to object began elcarth but both talamir and alberich were shaking their heads talamir gestured to alberich i think she will not for there is no fear there for her alberich said such things do not rouse her passion or her fear for they do not affect her love precisely talamir nodded why should she be afraid about a matter of budget or of setting a law none of this is going to going to wrench her love out of her arms we should be far more concerned that she stops caring about these things frankly actually jadus spoke up making everyone turn to look at him i think the best thing we could do is get this wedding over and done with if it could be done tomorrow id say to do it because alberich said slowly feeling his way toward the words if mere infatuation it is the sooner reality comes the better solet the prince but think he has her then revert to whatever his true self is he will just as that stranger with norris said he is not bright enough to make up his own speeches when he has her his control over himself will lapse something like that jadus agreed and when she has him she wont fear shell lose him anymore so whether its love or infatuation shell start thinking again instead of reacting with her emotions thats what i meant by treating infatuation the same as if it was love said ylsa even if we are certain its infatuation shes certain its love and that he shares it and if you dont give the emotion the same respect as if it is love shell stop listening to you oh gods elcarth groaned its hard because we all assume we know better than she does were so much older and wiser said myste dryly believe me thats exactly what shes most afraid of she doesnt want to hear about our experience she doesnt want to think that this intense emotional storm that is making her feel so good for the first time in months is based on anything less than truth and hellfires for all we know she could be in the right the prince may be the best thing for her he may be in love with her and she with him hes only a second son there is no way that he is going to be able to aspire to anything but chairwarming at home at least here while he may not be a king hell be more than a hangeron even if he isnt in love with her he may see her as his escape from mediocrity and he may treat her with all the respect and tenderness we could ask because of it but until we have evidence to the contrary and shes ready to look at that evidence then then prompted alberich myste sighed then i believe we need to be planning a wedding the we turned out to be entirely rhetorical with the opposition melted to nothing and perhaps fearing tacit disapproval if not of the marriage itself at least of the haste with which she was insisting it be conducted selenay turned to the court rather than the heralds for her wedding plans now alberich had no more notion of how such things were done than any other sisterless bachelor a month seemed to him to be a perfectly reasonable length of time to plan even a royal wedding after all what did one need a place a priest some new clothing perhaps and a feastsurely no more time was needed for that than for the ice festival evidently not and although he was the most certain man even among the heralds that this rethwellan upstart was nothing more than opportunism wrapped in a cloak of glamour he was relieved to find himself excluded from the planning because the entire court went absolutely mad it was sheer bedlam just for a start apparently every female of rank had to have a new gown and every female of rank with any male relatives was bound and determined to shovel their males into new clothing as well so there was a steady stream of seamstresses and tailors jewelers and fabric merchants furriers and shoemakers going to and from the palace and the manors around the palace from dawn to well past dusk clogging the roads and getting in everyones way then there was the question of where to hold the ceremony for there were at least four enormous temples in haven that demanded the privilege that debate alone occupied the council for an entire day and was only resolved when in desperation the seneschal suggested that the entire ceremony be held outdoors on the palace grounds and there was the question of how long the public celebration would be for an occasion like this warranted feeding the populace at large for a whole day at least if not more there was the problem of food of course and since it was now summer the added problem of spoilage a week was out of the question but a day seemed too meager and once that was settled there were the particulars of the wedding feast and the wedding breakfast here at the palace and why the council should be involved in that alberich could not imagine but evidently they felt they had to decide even the most minute details of the menu the next question that threatened civil war within the court itself was that of precedence and who would serve as which ladies in attendance it actually came to hairpulling in the public gardens on one notable occasion myste solved this question when not even the seneschal could by tracing forward the pedigrees of everyone who had served as ladies in attendance at sendars wedding i had the advantage she admitted later to alberich having that genealogical research at my fingertips to eliminate all those suitors having myste settle the question did earn the heraldchronicler a few enemies among selenays ladies who discovered themselves placed farther down the chain than they wanted but earned but the gratitude of everyone else including the entire council although there was no question of who would perform the ceremony the lord patriarch of course the question of which ceremony would be held was a pressing one the queen had her own personal choice of deities that she worshiped but this was done privately not publicly there was no state religion in valdemar in fact the valdemaran credo was there is no one right way and while this made for great tolerance and freedomit also made for a problem how to perform what was essentially a religious ceremony without offending any of the myriad religions and their adherents became a matter of hysteria until myste in exasperation unearthed a previous wedding that quoted from every major religion in valdemar including to alberichs shock that of the sunlord at that point as far as selenay was concerned herald myste could do no wrong and ill play on that later if i have to she told alberich darkly the list of difficult questions it seemed only grew longer and longer with each passing day it had been a very long time since a reigning queen of valdemar took a consort and many things had changed since that time alberich held himself lucky to be well out of it he understood vaguely that lord orthallen got himself put in charge of it all with the help of the seneschal and that things were being sorted out and that was all he cared to know about it he might not care for lord orthallen himself but there was no doubt whatsoever that the man was a superb diplomat and administrator nevertheless the whole business was shattering discipline on the collegium side the ice festival had been bad enough this was worse he had to get positively savage with some of the youngsters in his classes when the excitement over at the palace started to ooze into the collegia and some of the trainees even had the temerity to skip weaponry classes it was all the fault of the blues actually there was absolutely no point in expecting much of anything out of the highborn blues though and he knew it half the time they werent even at their classes having been pulled out for various reasons having to do with the wedding he was coming to think of it with capital initials and the other half of the time their minds werent on anything that anyone was trying to tell them anyway some of them werent worth the water in a bucket with a hole in it but others had friends among the heraldic trainees and unfortunately they were the ones playing the part of the tempters luring their trainee friends away with the siren song of oh come on it wont hurt to skip just this once the blues were a lost cause and alberich knew it even parents would look at poor marks this one time and say to themselves oh but it was all the excitement of the wedding as for the trainees at least he and the other instructors had ways and means of enforcing their authority in alberichs case there was the threat of humiliation when a truant came back to class the shame that the runaways would find themselves repeating a class brought some back into line the threat of no hurlee or other games got the attention of others but in the end what saved them all was that selenay finally got around to declaring a fortnight holiday for all three collegia which at least solved the problem of keeping absent minds on study and wouldbe truants in their seats and it gave alberich an opportunity all unlookedfor to get back down into haven and concentrate all of his attention on norris and on a new problem the sound of music and laughter from the common room and taproom of the bell was loud enough to reach all the way to the stables wedding fever had begun even down in haven the banners that had greeted the coronation were being hung again more decorations were being hung every day and it seemed to be all anyone could talk about and of course where there was an event there would be commercemedallions flags and banners to wave portraits and statues dozens of songs most bad there were even stalls with pairs of selenay and karathanelan dolls appearingeither dressed as the moon maiden and the prince or in what were fondly supposed to be the queen and princes wedding finery and even the quiet bell was abuzz alberich wasnt terribly unhappy about all the fussit made it easier to slip in and out rather than more difficulta good thing since for a change he was here in broad daylight he was actually in his secret room changing into one of his personae when he heard the stableside door open behind him his heart leaped into his throat he whirled with a knife in his hands one small part of him wondering how anyone had gotten past kantor when he saw it was myste he slipped the knife back in its hiding place hoping she hadnt seen it and was going to say somethingsomething irritated actually since she wasnt supposed to burst in on him like thiswhen he caught the look of worry on her face that and the fact that she was wringing her hands together made him bite back what he had been about to say im in trouble she said and for one startled moment he flashed on the only thing that phrase meant back in karse they want me to become their fulltime clerk accountant and treasurer she continued oblivious to whatever expressions had flitted across his face in that brief moment if any had hed probably looked like an idiot with his mouth hanging open then what shed said penetrated and he realized that the situation was quite serious indeed oh hellfires he said they want her to work for them and only them and how is she supposed to do that and continue being heraldchronicler scratch that spending that much time with them how is she going to manage without getting caught norris has found a backer and hes getting a theater for the company the gods of actors and idiots only know where hes getting the money from but its quite certain and the fellow that handles all the business mattersyou met him rememberwants me to do all of the money things for them its a fulltime job i can pledge you that between managing the take at the door getting everyone and everything paid for taxes hiring things like cleaning women and laundresses she shook her head frantically thank the gods i got wind of this before they actually asked me i think theyre waitingwisely may i addto be sure that the money for the theater is in hand before they say anything to an outsider now her voice took on the tones of a wail of fear but what am i going to do she wasnt panicking but she looked as if she was in knots sit down for one thing you look as pale as a shirt she did as he ordered while he sucked on his lower lip and thought hard all right you cant take that job i couldnt take it and stay undiscovered with a trained actor like norris watching me which means we have to come up with some reason why you cant take it the moment he said you cant take the job he saw relief suffuse her features and he was very glad that it was myste in front of him now and not keren who would have been offended at the very thought that she couldnt keep up the deception i think we have these options to get myste the clerk out of range before the offer can actually be made you can take another positiontell them tonight even that youve been offered a job say on some great lords staff but on his estate so you have to leave you can send them a letter saying that some wealthy elderly relative you didnt even know of before today is sick and wants you to move in and take care of her and if you do youll inherit everything or myste can have a terrible accident and die myste will if we cant figure out something myste said darkly but looked infinitely more relaxed well the first one wont do because every great lord is going to be here until the wedding is over and i want to be able to tell them im leaving tonight id just as soon not close off all options by killing my old self so that leaves the second and i want it to be by letter i dont want to take the chance on arousing any suspicion by giving them a chance to start asking questions about my story the best choice i think he agreed no one is going to seriously suggest that you give up a grand inheritance in favor of a position with a theater company that doesnt even have a theater yet and in case clerk myste ever has to come back to haven it can either be as a visit after your wealthy aunt has died or it can turn out that the wealthy aunt wasnt as wealthy as she made herself out to be and you are back looking for work excellent myste replied and closed her eyes and sagged back against the wall and i have to leave immediately better yet im already gone my aunt sent a coach and i left in it i dont mind telling you i was panicked especially after last night alberich nodded he could well understand mystes concern for last night she had gotten to copy another one of those encrypted messages from norris towell whoever they were to and that gave him an idea writing a letter is perfect he said in fact write two one to the manager of the company and one to norris if you were as infatuated as he thinks you are hed think it strange if you didnt send him a personal goodbye as your old friend ill take them both over and you can go back up the hill as soon as you change what myste began and then she nodded right so that norris doesnt suspect after last night that im a spy who is running off now that i have what i need i think i know just the tone the brokenhearted farewell letter of the hopelessly infatuated woman who knows she had less chance with him than a lapdog but cant bear not to tell him about how her soul will be empty forever without him itll take some clever writing and hold out the offer that if he is ever inthree rivers i think thats far enough and rustic enoughor if he ever finds himself down on his luck he can call on you for anything he needs alberich chuckled a little as myste made a face you might as well spread it on thick oh i will she stood up and went to the small chest that held writing materials this wont take very long and it didnt by the time he was finished changing into his guise as the carter she had finished both letters sanded them to dry the ink folded and sealed them with a blob of candlewax and her thumbprint on the outside of one she made a little drawing of a pen and on the other a mask the mask goes to norris she said handing them to him good would it sound loutish of me to say that i am relieved that this is over for you and that i have never liked having you in this position he asked taking them and stowing them in his pouch no and not half as relieved as i am she replied and unexpectedly kissed him i make a good historian i make a mediocre spy but if it had not been for you he kissed her back feeling warm and peculiarly protective it was a very pleasant sensation now that she was going to be out of danger he had deliberately not thought about her being in danger while all of this was going on it wouldnt have done any good in the first place and in the second well it might have done both of them quite a bit of harm they were first and foremost heralds they had duties only she could do what she was doing and they both knew it but now he certainly knew what people meant by the phrase having your heart hostage to fortune it was not a feeling that he had welcomed i still make a mediocre spy she replied and i hope you never need my peculiar mix of talents again oh i shallbut i hope not as a spy he raised an eyebrow and she flushed but laughed dont forget to tell the innkeeper before you leave the bell where clerk myste is going and that she left in a private coach for three rivers a candlemark ago i wont she promised he gave her a little bow and slipped out the back way the last thing he was going to do especially after this was to go directly from the bell to his destination instead he cut through back alleys and even through a few unfenced yards to get him to the part of town where the tanners and dyers had their workshops before he finally headed for the inn he never came at it from the same direction twice if he could help it and today it would be especially important that there be no association between himself and the companions bell other than that his friend myste had lived there of course he discharged the first errand by leaving the letter in the room that served as an office for the business manager was out on some errand or other but as for the secondthe troupe was rehearsing in the stables and he had heard norris voice when he passed by now he went in and waited patiently until there was a break in the action and norris left the group that was declaiming at each other to get himself a drink of water from the barrel alberich stood beside message for you sir he said making sure that his voice was pitched low his tone harsh rather than high and shrill as the scholar had been he thrust the folded paper at norris who took it automatically but with a look of annoyance still the man did open it and read it his mouth twitching with amusement alberich was rather surprised to find himself wanting to punch that mouth and make him eat that amusement so the little mouse has got herself a granary eh he said carelessly well i can hardly blame her for running off to secure it lads he called to the rest of the group whose heads all turned in his direction that drab little clerk of ours has fallen into the cream some rich aunties got sick and shes run off to nurse and inherit cor i could do with a rich auntie said a beardless fellow enviously hey norris if shes rich enough reckon she can afford you catcalled another as norris made a face shed have to be richer than the head of the goldsmiths guild norris scoffed back throttling down the urge to throttle norris alberich started to turn away to leave because if he stayed a moment longer he might hear something that would make him lose his temper say fellow could i get you to run a similar errand for me norris asked for say a silver penny alberich turned back aye he said curtly as long as it dont take me outo town oh it wont norris pulled an embroidered handkerchiefmasculine in style rather than femininefrom a pocket in his trews a friend of mine left this here by accident last night id like you to take it back to him he lives at a rather grand place on hoberd hill its the one with the wyvern gateposts youll know it when you see it alberich took the handkerchief and the penny successfully concealing his surprise because he knew that address knew it very well indeed it was the location of the rethwellan embassy all the time he was on his way he wondered what exactly he would learn when he got there he knew what the handkerchief business was about of course for sewing a packet of papers between two identical handkerchiefs to conceal them was an old play the bit of fabric had been neatly folded but hed felt the thin papers when he put the object in the belt pouch that had lately held the letters myste had written these last night he was certain of it for the paper was very thin and light so this time norris was prepared to send hiswhatever he was sendingopenly probably more instructions to the prince on how to handle a woman couple that with mystes certainty that norris had found a backer and it was clear that norris was under the impression that his job was complete so maybe he was willing to take a risk he would not otherwise have dared or perhaps he doesnt care now or both orone more possibilitynorris knew that his handler would be as busy with the wedding preparations as everyone else and figured he could afford to be lazy this time for he wouldnt be caught when alberich reached the embassyhe went around to the tradesmans entrance not for the likes of him those wyverncarved doorposts and the imposing workediron gate oh no he followed a narrow passage between the walls until he came to the back of the property where there were signs of life quite a bit actually which was hardly surprising considering that the prince was marrying the queen of his host country it took alberich a while to get the attention of someone who looked as if he was in charge of things what do you want fellow asked the harriedlooking man in rethwellan liverywho then interrupted himself to shout look how many times must i remind you the prince does not like lilies actor by the name of norris sent this he said thrusting the folded cloth at the man who took it then gave it a second startled glance says someone up here left it down at his inn ahyes of course from the mans expression alberich knew that they must be the princes own handkerchiefsand that the man had not expected to get them in quite this wayand that he knew very well there was something inside them thank you my man ill see it gets to the prowner ah he fumbled in his belt pouch came up with a couple of coins and thrust them at alberich without looking at them here for your trouble so you think about the tip and forget about wondering why i needed to march up here to return a handkerchief thankee sir he said with a little bow ill be off out of your way yes yes ofno no no no the man was off chasing down a couple of fellows with what looked like a rolledup carpet alberich absented himself quickly because he didnt want anyone here to get a good look at him he didnt want the man to think about questioning him and above all he wanted to get back to talk this over with talamir for what the man had almost said was ill see that it gets to the prince it would have been a satisfactory end to the tale for selenay to have realized at the very altar that the prince was a cad who was manipulating her for his own purposes it would have been equally satisfactory for talamir and alberich and myste to have presented her with the evidence they had gathered including the decoded papers outliningwell something rottenin time for her to come to her senses and send the blackguard packing in fact nothing of the sort happened the papers were still not decoded and even if they had been selenay would neither have looked at them nor believed what was in them no one who saw her could have doubted that she was insanely deliriously happy the prince appeared to hang on her every word she certainly did on his the wedding plans swiftly turned into preparations without even an incident that could have been thought of as illomened and with no more problems than any other major undertaking in the end of all things it was probably the tedrel wars that were due the credit for organizing so much so well in so little time after putting together armies and encampments and battle plans then seeing to it that everything was smoothly executed selenays people had more than enough experience to pull off a royal wedding in a moon alberich stayed away from the palace as much as possible during the last week he never even left the salle myste brought him some meals from the collegium kitchens for there were no servants to be spared to bring them to him others he simply prepared for himself they assiduously avoided the topic of the wedding concentrating instead on any other matters that could possibly be considered useful and in a curious and careful exploration of each other in fact with the shining example of what not to do so blatantly in front of them somehow they had both come to the conclusion simultaneously that they ought to take a very long time in simply talking about things it was very curious alberich suspected that their companions had a hand in it but he wasnt going to object these long talks provided the pleasant interludes in what was otherwise a period that was not so much ridden with anxiety as resignation he knew that he wasnt the only one who felt this way most of the other heralds that he knew if they were not actually supposed to be taking part in the proceedings were avoiding the palace altogether the feeling that they all seemed to share was most adequately described by one of the fellows from the south who had seen some terrible mudslides when hed been a child you see it start he said and its so slow and so big it seems impossible that it can be happening and then you realize that its actually impossible to stopand impossible for you to get out of its way and if you arent in the path all you can do is stand there and watch knowing that there isnt one damn thing you can do except try and pick up the pieces when its all over he had simply made sure that the guards he trained as the queens bodyguards who were suffering no such misgivings were at their absolute peak of performance and knew in their guts as well as their heads that no matter what happened they were always to protect selenay from anyone that threatened her including her husband when people came to the salle looking for a workout if they were up to his level of expertise he gave them one if they were not he found them partners and supervised then the day of the wedding arrived it was a collegium holiday with all the trainees serving as helpers additional servitors or actually participating with their families it was very quiet at the salle and alberich made himself a solitary breakfast then took the time to give the salle a thorough cleaning and checking the wedding breakfast was for family the highest ranking court members and the three highest ranking heralds after the breakfast would come the preparations no one needed to turn up in the gardens for hours yet by midmorning everything was in perfect shape and he was sitting on a bench outside in the sun working on mending training equipment while kantor watched every so often a bit of breeze carried a snatch of music from the palace gardens but otherwise he could have been all alone out here he had thought about going down into the city but couldnt bring himself to face the crowds partaking of the public festivities finally he couldnt put it off any longer he went back to his quarters donned his formal whites and made his way to the gardens any checking of invitations was going on at the gates in the wall around the complex itself anyone on the grounds was already part of the festivities there were far far more people crowding into the gardens than alberich felt comfortable around and the ones who were not in formal uniforms of white scarlet or green were for the most part so laden with ornaments and so vivid with embroideries that they hurt his eyes and the sound of dozens and dozens of people all chattering brightly at the tops of their lungs was nearly enough to drive him mad fortunately for his sanity the heralds actually had a job to do and a place to go until the moment of the ceremony itself the queens garden was the assembly point and he made his way there the first person to greet him was not somewhat to his disappointment myste it was keren looking unexpectedly sharp in what was clearly a brand new set of formal whites like me new duds she asked in a heavy evendim accent and laughed at his expression never had a set of formals made for me before just had a set that was a handmedown from the stores neither has myste actually were both odd sizes and neither of us had the money for a tailor the way the highborn heralds have and somewhere along the line somebody figured this out in time to have some tailored up for us she backed up a pace and looked alberich over critically now you youve got the proper military bearing and figure must have been a doddle to find a set to fit you i suppose he replied noting that her eyes were a little too bright and figuring that keren was using inconsequential chatter to cover her unease there is it seems some merit in being average you average bite your tongue said myste worming her way between two heralds alberich didnt recognize you couldnt be average if you tried he was saved from having to answer anything by the sound of the trumpet that signaled their part of the ceremony heralds at the entrance to the garden formed into a double line and began filing out the rest of them joined one or the other line in no particular order somehow alberich myste and keren ended up at the end of their lines this didnt displease him on the whole he did not particularly want to be near the center of attention the heralds lined both sides of the path that selenay and her wedding party would take from the door of the palace to the bower where the lord patriarch waited alberich was actually nearest the door in his line and keren was directly opposite him at a mental signal that was passed via their companions they smoothly and simultaneously unsheathed their swords and crossed them overhead forming an arch of shining steel as the swords left their sheaths the chattering stopped there was a moment of absolute silence then the musicians struck up the processional march the door of the palace opened and the first of the ladies in attendance emerged there were twenty of them strewing rose petals on the path from silver baskets last of all came selenay he could not have told what she was wearing though he knew that even heralds who were female would be discussing it for days if not weeks he was only a man after all it was whiteno surprise she was a herald as well as queen it was made of some soft shining stuff overlaid with some gauzy stuff and embroidered with gold and pearls she was swathed in what seemed like furlongs of veil which made it difficult to see her face he thought as she passed that she looked terrifyingly happy though she stared straight ahead both hands holding a huge bouquet of white flowers and ivy her step was firm and brisk and in a moment she was past him and all he could see was the back of her gown it trailed for quite some distance on the ground behind her and there were two of the little tedrel orphans carrying her train and one of them was that little lad in formal trainee grays an exact duplicate of formal whites except done in gray he looked terribly solemn and a little scared but when he saw alberich he brightened and alberich raised his free hand in a formal salute that made him look still happier as he passed fortunately the children were too young to have been infected with the doubts that plagued their elders the heralds held their pose until the entire wedding party had assembled at the altar then with another signal passed by the companions they pulled their swords into a formal salute and simultaneously sheathed them as the musicians ended the processional with a flourish they turned as one to face the altar alberich was just as glad that all he could see was the back of the herald in front of him he was reminded of all of the ceremonies he had attended as a member of the sunsguard after he had realized how many of vkandis sunlords priests were corrupt and venial creatures with no more calling than a cat then as now he had made his mind a blank and set his face in an expression of bland attentiveness the ceremony which made reference to every deity worshiped in all of valdemar and rethwellan was a long one before it was over long before in fact he sensed the restlessness of some of his fellow heralds who had not spent their youths in military training anyone who had been a soldier got used to standing at attention for unconscionably long periods of time this should have been a joyful occasion it struck him as inexpressibly sad that it should have become one that was merely endured at long last the final vows were spoken somewhere up there ahead of him the rings were exchanged selenays veil lifted the first marital kiss given bells rang out all over the complex which signaled the bells of the city below to begin pealing a cheer rose over the assembled crowd and it might have been noticed that the heralds were not cheering except that someone had decided that they should form the swordarch again at full attention whether that someone had been talamir or even myste the action made certain that no one was going to have to try and force out something he didnt really feel the procession came back through the arch led by selenay and her new consort he had his arm around her possessively but selenay was between him and alberich so the weaponsmaster didnt get much of a look at him they all retired back into the palace to be divested of parts of their costumesveils and trains being highly impractical for outdoor receptions and feastsand make a first appearance on a balcony above the gardens once again the heralds salutedeach other this timeand sheathed their swords but now the double line swiftly broke apart to be absorbed into the milling crowd some heading for the formal gardens others on errands of their own myste was one of the latter alberich gathered that she had some little wedding duties to attend to in the matter of protocol he loosened his collar and feeling heavy in spirit swiftly separated himself from the throng and headed back down to the salle once there he stripped himself of the detested finery as quickly as he could and donned a set of his oldest and most comfortable leathers what did you have in mind for the rest of the day asked kantor i suppose he began then heard footsteps on the path and looked up to see elcarth approachingwith a bottle in one hand we might as well stay out here he said by way of greeting the others will be here shortly others alberich inquired raising an eyebrow youll see soon enough elcarth told him with a sardonic twist to his lips and within the candlemark jadus keren and ylsa all arrived bringing their bottles and last of all bringing up the rear came myste with healer crathach more bottles and a hamper between them the last evidently came as a surprise to the rest myste and crathach set down the hamper and the healer surveyed them all hands on hips as they tried not to look guilty myste advised me of what you were likely to do he said and alberich tried not to wince or feel betrayed or shall i say the state you were likely to get yourselves into but crathach was only warming up to his theme now all things considered i am somewhat in sympathy with the idea of finding a bit of ease in drink at this particular time but i told her that you were not going to undertake this without me we are going to get drunk he announced we are going to get genteelly drunk pleasantly drunk and we will remain in that state with careful application of food as well as drink we will not drink ourselves sick we will not drink ourselves stupid or maudlin or unconscious and i will make personally sure that when we finally seek our beds we will do so in a state that will permit us to sleep and wake without hangovers are you with me they set out a kind of alfresco area under the trees since none of them really wanted to be inside and at any rate alberichs little sitting room would have been horribly cramped with all of them crammed into it i certainly dont need to be up there now there are a couple dozen people wholl be giving me their notes myste said sourly jerking her head in the direction of the gardens including talamir i cant figure grandfather on this at all keren replied waving vaguely at the palace alberich wondered if shed gotten a start on all of them back in her own quarters for although she walked and moved perfectly well and her speech was clear she had a glazed quality to her eyes as she passed him a full mug of wine grandfather he asked keren had her nose in her mug so it was myste who answered talamir is kerens grandfather her people marry off early and its usually arranged between families myste replied since he was the only boy in his he had to take a break during his trainee period to go home and fulfill hisahobligation four breaks to be precise keren added with a smirk fortunately for me im half of a twin set and traditionally only one of us had to do the duty so when i was chosen that left my brother teren as the one but is teren also not a herald alberich asked puzzled he got chosen after hed provided the family with a litter keren replied and shrugged what can i say with so many close relational ties my people have to be more pragmatic about marriage you marry whos available and if it turns out theres a love match all well and good but if not nobody cares who you sleep with for love or pleasure as long as no one is harmed by it about your grandfathertalamir alberich prompted wanting to change the subject back to its original topic keren lay back on the old worn rug shed appropriated and stared up at the branches waving overhead i dont understand why he isnt doing something about this she said finally i mean its wrong we all know in our bones that its wrong though we cant put a finger on why elcarth interrupted thats the reason i think we dont have a reason and somewhere down inside were all uncertain that the only thing we can object to is that the prince is an outsider but none of us objected to sendars choice of wife jadus said slowly none of us had this feeling of wrongness about her and she was not a herald but she was valdemaran said crathach and turned to alberich and have you anything to contribute alberich shrugged no foresight if that is what you mean he admitted only the same feeling that this marriage will prove to be a grave mistake he did not mention the things he had learned about the princes contacts with the actor in no small part because it was not yet proven but he exchanged a look with myste who gave a small shrug which could all too easily be nothing more than prejudice ylsa pointed out shrewdly he certainly has gone out of his way to be agreeable to everyone too agreeable keren asked then snorted as if it matters well myste said slowly it does if we arent just making a mountain out of nothing if this is going to turn into a bad situation then the best thing that we can do for the queen is to support her in every way including keeping an eye on him so that if he does something against her or against valdemar we can do something about him thats more or less what grandfather said keren admitted but of all things i hate i hate having to play a waiting game the most dont we all jadus replied and that seemed all that anyone could say they passed the remainder of the evening assiduously avoiding the entire subjectbut it was with them as an unseen presence a kind of specter at the feast the whole time alberich left them early feeling that not all the wine in the world could wash away his unease and feeling wearier than he ever had in his life he sought forgetfulness in sleep and for the first time in his life actually found it whatever was wrong it was not immediate enough even to give him uneasy dreams the collegium was back in session things were getting back to normal again the last of the classes was over for the day and alberich was working with kimel of the guard while two more of kimels fellows waited their turn to bout with him they were outside on the practice grounds rather than inside the sallewhenever possible since the mirror incident alberich preferred to run practices that were by their nature unpredictable on the grounds outside alberich caught movement on the path long before the prince and his entourage arrived he sensed it identified it as outsiders by the lack of whites or guard uniforms and dismissed it as currently unimportant all in a heartbeat the group of seven or eight paused a prudent distance outside the edge of the practice ground and watched there was some murmuring but nothing more than that certainly there was no hint of scorn or scoffing in the tones of the muttered conversation perfectly acceptable that was alberich finished the bout in a draw with kimel he probably could have beaten him he usually did but caution made him decide not to do so in front of outsiders the two of them drew back and saluted and only then did alberich turn his attention to the audience it could not have been clearer that the one in the middle was prince karathanelan the man was alberich supposed handsome enough he could certainly see that selenay would have no reason to find the arrangement of his features less than pleasing the cut and style of his clothing was a bit different from roughly half of the young men around him the effect was of foreignness but was reasonably flattering the others were apparently friends of his from rethwellan alberich had heard something of them that a number of the princes landless friends from rethwellan had arrived in time for the wedding and that selenay had already granted them holdings of their own from unclaimed properties on the border with karse and rethwellan alberich wished them joy of their new lands they werent the most prosperous even at the best of times being mostly sheep country what alberich didnt like was the posture of those around him these were sycophants nothing more they devoted themselves to pleasing someone stronger if any of them had ever had an original thought in his head he had quickly suppressed it a man who surrounded himself with men like these in alberichs experience was a man who had a great deal of difficulty in understanding that the world did not happen to run itself to his desire there were a great many sunpriests like that still the look on the face of the prince suggested that he had some respect for alberichs ability alberich gave him a sketchy sort of salute while the guards gave him the full bow due to his position as consort he waited resting to see what the prince would do or say although a brief shadow passed over the princes face aside from that flicker of displeasure the princes expression did not change and his voice when he spoke was polite and pleasant enough you are the weaponsmaster he asked the karsite weaponsmaster herald alberich alberich confirmed karsiteborn yes your highness the prince looked him over carefully and karsitetrained i am told interesting as he was surveying alberich the herald was doing the same for him theres muscle there he observed to kantor no matter what hes been doing since he got here hes not soft kantor agreed i should like to bout with you the prince said abruptly alberich did not bother to point out that the prince was hardly dressed for a round of vigorous exercise he was clearly one of those who did not trouble himself over the ruin of a suit of clothing he merely glanced at the two guardsmen who quickly effaced themselves with a little nod making it clear that they were perfectly willing to yield their time to the prince one of them picked up a set of practice swords and offered them to the prince as some of his entourage helped him to take off his elaborate doublet and relieved him of some of his jewels would your highness make a choice of practice weapons the guardsman asked but the prince waved them off live steel is the choice of men he said with a touch of arrogance that made the guardsman flush stupid overconfident kantor said acidly testing me alberich countered as he took up his own sword from where it was lying with the guardsmens and he knows that there is no way that i would dare harm him he has me at the advantage he thinks the question was whether that advantage was real or only in the princes mind there was muscle under that silk but somehow alberich doubted whether the prince had ever had a weaponsmaster who really tested the prince to the limits of his ability there was too much sly arrogance there nevertheless alberich was not at all certain that he wanted to show the prince which of them was the superior fighter the prince was the enemy here but he was an enemy who had not yet truly shown his hand he knew far more about the prince he would warrant than the prince knew about him so there was a distinct advantage in leaving the prince with the impression that his expertise was less than it actually was all that flashed through his mind in a few moments as he made sure that his weapons were in good condition and his own muscles thoroughly warmed up then they faced off and the combat began it was no real challenge alberich was not only able to react automatically to the princes blows and feints his mind was free to think about what he was doing despite the fact that they were using live steel weapons the princes style of fighting was a curious combination of aggression and stealth that told alberich far more about the princes personality than the prince would ever guess he did notquiteengage in the underhanded moves of the streetfighting bravos that alberich had encountered in his own nighttime prowlings but the things that he did left alberich with no doubt that he was perfectly well acquainted with such tactics and while alberich himself made no bones about teaching his trainees those moves he doubted that the prince had any notion of this so he pretended that he had not noticed those little suggestions of a feint and proceeded exactly as if he was fighting in the classical style and he thought that he saw the princes lips tighten in a selfsatisfied little smile when alberich failed to respond to those feints so much for the testing having established the perceived limits of alberichs expertise the prince abruptly switched tactics and went for a very aggressive straighton attack alberich kept up a purely defensive strategy and did not respond to any of the openings that the prince gave him this was surely puzzling kimel and the other guards but alberich wasnt working for their benefit only for this audience of one the impression he wanted to leave the prince with was that selenays weaponsmaster was skilled competent strong but limited in his visionand thus in what he was teaching the trainees ill have to have someone watch the boy when he practices he realized there was a lot he could guess from what the prince had done so far but if it ever truly came to a fight between the two of them he wanted to be sure of what the prince could and could not do gradually the princes style began to drift and for a moment there was a nagging sort of familiarity to it that alberich could not pin down it was flamboyant definitely overconfident and grew more so as time went on then as the young man committed to a traveling lunge with a shout a lunge that would have gotten him into a world of difficulty if he had not had lightning reflexes and stupendous athletic ability alberich realized where he had seen this style and knew who had been teaching him norris should i let him beat me he wondered then i wouldnt kantor cautioned he might guess that you did and besides you want him wary of you yet sure he can beat you if he really puts his mind to it wait until he gets a little careless and take advantage in such a way that it can be a drawthere but alberich had already spotted the momentary distraction and drove in so that the two of them ended up bodytobody with their blades hopelessly entangled a draw and the prince withdrew with a salute that was notquitemocking an excellent bout weaponsmaster he said jovially removing the practice helm and tossing it carelessly to kimel who caught it unthinkingly thank you alberich gave him a grave bow without speaking and as the prince and his chattering entourage sauntered back up the path to the palace he disarmed and turned his attention back to his guardsmen kimel gave him a questioning look but said nothing the others took their lead from him alberich nodded sometimes he said quietly it is as well not to reveal all kimel grunted and nodded i wondered he said and left it at that but alberich was not quite done i would be grateful should anyone an eye to that man keep should he be found in weapons practice kimel nodded again and this time so did the other guardsmen well see to it weaponsmaster he said and alberich clapped him on the shoulder with a feeling of satisfaction the undercurrents of that simple conversation had said more than the words themselves kimel and the others had seen the hints of underhandedness and had not liked what theyd seen and perhaps they had already observed some things in the prince that made them uneasy for the first time alberich had some coconspirators who were not among the heralds or in crathachs case the healers and that would be very useful indeed nevertheless this was hardly something that needed to be pursued immediately it was unlikely having had this round of exercise that the prince would choose to go find another sparring partner and continue the practice that was not how alberich was reading his nature he would bask in the admiration of his friends and sycophants none of whom had or ever could have taken alberich to a draw and after he tired of the admiration he would probably either find another subject or move into a dissection of the bout but he would not now that he was warmed up follow it up with more practice nor would he make much of an effort to find out what his cronies knew about alberich so the immediate need was to continue the practice that had been interrupted perhaps now with an eye to drilling in the counters to those abortive moves that the prince had displayed so rusken alberich said picking up a wooden blade and gesturing to the guardsman your turn it is i believe dutifully though her heart was not in it selenay forced herself to concentrate on the dull details of the council meeting when what she really wanted to do was to lapse into a daydream she felt like a cat full of cream she wanted to smile and purr and generally make a spectacle of her contentedness and of course she could do nothing of the sort she had to look grave and attentive and pay attention to her council debating over the details of the trade agreements with rethwellan that were a consequence of her marriage when she didnt want to think about trade at all she wanted to think about tonight and what would happen when she and karath were alone at last no wonder that people would do and say nearly anything for love she had known that it would not be pleasurable at first shed had plenty of instruction from a sympathetic healer named anelie during the weeks before the actual wedding but the at first had not been long ruthlessly she dragged her attention back to the meeting in time to nod gravely as the councilors finally agreed on a trade package then went on to the relatively simple matter of signing off on the grants of property that karath had asked her to settle on his friends it was a small enough thing there were properties along the southern border whose owners were no longer among the living thanks to the tedrel wars and here were landless second sons out of rethwellan who were eager to take responsibility for them the councilors had no great objections and the papers were quickly written up so ended yet another tiny problemwith the income from these properties those landless second sons would now be able to support themselves in haven at least half of the year karath would have friends here something that had worried herthough he did seem to be getting along very well with some of her own young courtiers that was in fact where he was now out hawking with some of the young men of the court he had also said something about wanting to test the mettle of her famed weaponsmaster she hoped that alberich would go easy on him the council meeting went on for what seemed to be an interminably long time yet she had to admit that there was a great deal of business to take care of as much had been set aside in the rush attending on the hasty wedding and the week she had stolen for herself thereafter but it was concluded at last when it appeared that if it was not concluded the councilors would be forced to do without their dinner and as this was not an emergency sending the pages out for cold viands and drink and continuing the businesseven if selenay herself had been prepared to put up with itwas not to be thought of the councilors like their comforts too and were not prepared to do without them having been forced to do so for the last months of the tedrel wars she took her leave of her councilors and all but flew to her quarters and the hands of her maids as she changed her clothing and submitted to their attentions she heard with an internal thrill the sounds of laughter as karath approached the door he and his friends must have had a grand day while she had been working and after all why not he was not coruler and could not be unless he was chosen which was looking less and less likely as time passed so why shouldnt he be spending his time in sport in fact by socializing with the courtiers he would be taking the burden from her of doing the same ho selenay he cried bursting through the door waving some of his friends who laughingly tried to follow back into the hall i have met your weaponsmaster and tried his blade she leaped up from her seat as the maid who had been fixing her hair waved her hands in fruitless protest he enfolded her in his arms and kissed her her lips parted beneath his and his tongue teased hers as she tasted the salt on his mouth she felt herself melting as always it was he who pulled away first and what came of that my prince she asked breathlessly oh karath said carelessly i think had i exerted myself i could have taken him but he is a fine swordsman conservative but fine i am sure he is a good weaponsmaster selenay almost said something then for that certainly did not sound like alberichalberich conservativebut then she thought better of it alberich was certainly doing her a favor letting karath think himself the finer fighter and where was the harm in that in fact now that she came to think of it she felt a surge of warmth toward dour alberich that he would compromise his own reputation in order to make karath feel the superior so she resolved not to say anything about it she simply smiled and said i doubt it not and let him lead her in to dinner the contest turned out to be something of a topic of conversation among karath and his friends with a great deal of gesturing and boasting she discovered with a flush of pride that karath was very much considered to be the superior swordsman among his cronies and she thought given the apparent sincerity of their talk that this was not just flattery that he had fought alberich to a deadlock was considered to be amazing by those of his friends who were valdemaran and their admiration was considerable karath warmed under their regard and expanded on the theme describing other bouts he was particularly proud of she smiled and paid little attention to the chatter which sounded to her ears very like that of the younger trainees when they first began to gain some success in arms and concentrated instead on merely watching him he was hardly insensible of her regard and looked as if it gave him a great deal of pleasure bless himlet him preen and strut a little he had never been forced to use that sword of his and if she had her way he never would it was all still a game to him and not the deadly business that she knew it was she took great pleasure in that from dinner the court went out into the gardens where there was music and some simple dancing he remained assiduously at her side showing by means of a smile or a casual whispered remark that he was as eager to withdraw as she was but of course this sort of thing was as much of a duty as the council sessions and she carefully exchanged pleasantries and conversation with not only the rethwellan ambassador but all the other notables present it did give her a great deal of pleasure however to be able to tell karaths friends over the course of the evening that they were to receive official word of their grants from the council on the morrow she loved the way that karath smiled and accepted their effusive thanks graciously finally it seemed that to her that they had distributed their attention enough for one evening and when she whispered to karath my lord shall we withdraw he smiled knowingly and nodded it was not the custom in valdemar much to her relief for the monarch to leave a social gathering with any fanfare so they simply drifted off under the everwatchful eyes of her guards and took the private entrance back into the royal suite once there her maids descended on her like a swarm of ants while he sauntered off to his dressing room to the like attentions of his servants the days were long gone when she could dress and undress herself being queen apparently meant wearing gowns that it was impossible to get into or out of without help but once her maids had taken down her hair and gotten her stripped down to her shift she dismissed them all slipped into a silken bed gown and with a shiver of anticipation got into bed to await karath he was not long in coming with a knowing grin when he saw her waiting for him he extinguished the last candle and she felt the mattress take his weight in the sudden darkness in the next moment he had slipped the gown from her shoulders and his lips were on hers insistently his tongue probing at her mouth her lips opened immediately as she felt her skin flush and for a moment his hands cupped the sides of her face as his tongue teased hers but then his hands were moving lower caressingly clever fingers making her skin tingle and when his hands reached her breasts she gasped at the sensations he awoke in her body and with that nowfamiliar feeling of melting lay back into the softness of the mattress as one hand slipped still lower his mouth took over where his hands had been evoking still more intoxicating thrills of pleasure and she moaned softly under his caresses by this time she was nearly mindless all of her attention bound up in the sensations that he was creating in her body feeling herself on fire with pleasure and desire and an urgency driving her towards that peak she now not only knew existed but which had become so very necessary to her life so that when he finally took her she was all animal crying out as she raced toward the goal nothing else mattering in all the world but their bodies moving together to that moment when she exploded in pleasure convulsed and paralyzed at the same time a cry escaping from her that she could not have stopped and didnt want to and before she had fallen from that pinnacle of sensation he had come to his own shuddering climax so that they fell together tangled in sweatgleaming limbs into dreamy euphoric lassitude and then when he had pulled the covers over them both sleep karath was eating and talking at the same time and it always amazed selenay that he managed to eat as much as he did and still look trim and fit at the moment he was eating his way through the plate of breakfast pastries like a fire going through dry timber selenay was just as happy to let him have all of them to himself a little dry toast and some tea was all that she could bear to stomach at the moment and her stomach was not altogether pleased about that and alas this was no mere illness which she could expect to recover from in a day or so oh no she had somewhat to her dismay discovered that eternal truth that most women learn soon or late the pleasures of the bedroom undertaken without precautions end in babies three days of discovering that she could not rise in the morning without recourse to a basin had told her that much of course in her case the pleasures of the bedroom were supposed to end in babies and in fact were required to end in babies as many as possible in factbut at least the typical heir and a spare so that there were two chances of being chosen that was after all what her council had been nattering about for monthswhy theyd wanted so desperately to find her a husband in the first place when she let them knowwell theyd be thrilled at least right up until the moment that it occurred to them that there was some risk in childbearing not that she was worried she was in the best of health and positively surrounded by healers shed been in a lot more danger of injury watching a hurlee game i just didnt think it would happen so quickly she thought mournfully and told her stomach sternly to behave itself while karath went on with his meal and his onesided conversation utterly oblivious to her discomfort of course the healers would have things that could help in this casebut that would mean going to the healers and then they would know she was pregnant and then everyone would know she was pregnant and that would open up an entirely new set of things for the council to natter at her about yet another worry why was it that she always seemed to add concerns and never seemed to actually get rid of any karaths chattering usually about things that interested her only vaguely like hawking and the recent exploits of his friends tended to pass through her head at the best of times like an express coach without stopping to unload any information this morning as preoccupied as she was with keeping her scant breakfast down she almost missed what he was saying entirely except that one word caught her distracted attention forcing her to bring her mind back to the breakfast table and she blinked and finally looked at him forgive mei was woolgathering for a moment she said apologetically what was it you just said he pouted a little he pouted as he did everything beautifully it was distinctly unfair if shed been able to pout that prettily she would never have to fight her council sometimes i wonder if you ever hear anything i say in the morning he complained you always seem distracted at breakfast i said i think id like to have that handsome black stallion that just came into the royal stables as our wedding gift from lord ashkevron for my coronation mount coronation mount hadnt he been paying attention at all i thought that was what you said she replied choosing her words with great care you can certainly have the stallion all to yourself since i have no use for him but karath i thought it had been explained that there wont be a coronation for you you cant be crowned king of valdemar why not he asked pouting even more though his eyes were getting stormy dont you valdemarans crown your kings in a public ceremony we do she felt a cold nausea that had nothing to do with pregnancy as she realized that they were about to have their first fight good godsshe knew all this had been explained to him it had been in the marriage contract hadnt he even read it but you cant be king his mouth suddenly went from a pout to a hard angry line why not he asked tightly you are the ruler here your council doesnt have any power except to advise you ive seen what you can do when you want to youve handed out properties and titles to anyone you choose without even telling them you can make me king if you wanted to you can tell your council just like you told them that you were going to marry me no i cant she said the nausea rising into her throat and it has nothing to do with the council its the law thats keeping you from it and not even the queen is above the law you cant be king because you arent a herald only a herald can be a king or a queen in valdemar he snorted with exasperation as if he suspected she was prevaricating then make me a herald he exclaimed angrily if that is all that it takes just make me a herald and get it over with i dont know why you havent bothered to do it already i cant make you a herald she replied now getting a little angry herself hadnt he listened to anything anyone had told him since he had arrived here or did he only listen when what he heard was what he wanted to hear heralds arent made theyre chosen then choose he began but she interrupted him they arent chosen by a person theyre chosen by their companion she told him flatly a chill over her words that he seemed oblivious to so you cant be a herald because none of them have chosen you she didnt bother to add that he would then have to go through the collegium like anyone else before he became a full herald and could be crowned coconsort and king if he really had ignored something so fundamental as needing to be a herald before becoming a king he would never grasp having to be schooled for four or more years first youre telling me he said slowly and incredulously that the reason i cant be king is because i dont have a white horse they arent horses she began but he was already pushing away from the table there must be fifty or a hundred of those beasts in that field next to the palace he said a dangerous edge to his voice they cant all belong to somebody well see about this nonsense he stalked out and she might have tried to stop himexcept at that moment she lost her battle with her stomach and with that her will to try to break him of his delusions gently evaporated let him stand around in companions field with a carrot in his hand for the rest of the day if he elected to hed only look silly and maybe when he was tired hot and ready to come back to the palace hed be more reasonable chosen kantor said just as alberich was correcting one of the younger trainees aim with his bow nudging his feet into a better stance showing him how to aim along the shaft then elevate to allow for the arrow dropping in flight i dont want to interrupt you but there is about to be something of a crisis and we are the closestwe and keren and dantris of courseto the situation calmly alberich stepped back and let the trainee shoot not changing his expression by a hair what crisis what situation prince karathanelan is coming to companions field he has three friends they are all mounted and they all have ropes he thinks hes going to catch and break a companion so he can be made coruler evidently when selenay convinced him just now that he couldnt be crowned unless he was a herald he put his own interpretation on being chosen hardly surprising if he was the sort of prince that alberich thought he was the arrow hit the target this time at least which was an improvement over the trainees last several shots i fail to see the crisis surely you arent going to try to tell me that he can catch one of you if you dont want to be caught it wasnt as if the prince could pin a companion in a corner the fence around the field was mostly to keep people out not companions in in fact alberich would not have put it past a companion to leap the wall around the complex at need and besides that any companion in danger of being caught against his will would be instantly rescued by the entire herd no horse would stand there and face a charging companion herd no matter what his rider wanted of course not kantor replied now coming into view through the trees trotting toward him but i believe caryo intends to be caught so she can kick the fewmets out of himand other than you and i and keren and dantris i think the rest are inclined to let her have her way she has put up with a great deal since he arrived here and done without much of the company and attention of her chosen ah that put an entirely different complexion on things at the least if the prince was damaged selenay would be distressed if he was embarrassed hed make her miserable and even if caryo was not the sort to have murder on her mind accidents could happen he didnt bother to ask if the other companions had tried to reason with her caryo was as stubborn as any companion born and as kantor had pointed out shed had to put up with a lot of aggravation since selenay met the prince this was one insult too many students he said aloud as kantor reached him some small trouble there is that i must attend trainee telbren you are in charge and as he finished the sentence kantor stood steady and he vaulted onto kantors bare back as soon as he had his balance the companion whirled on his rear legs and broke into a gallop which looked like more of an impressive feat of horsemanship than it actually was companions were legendary for their ability to keep their chosen in the seat they were also legendary for their speed but as they came out of the trees bearing down on four strangers mounted on mere horses he saw it was already too late there was caryo neatly caught standing meekly with four ropes and a saddle and bridle on her his heart sank oh no they used a horsebridle if there had been any chance that the prince might be forgiven his faux pas by the other companions given that caryo was burning to teach him a lesson it had just flown swiftly away no companion would ever forgive the insult of having a bit stuffed into his or her mouth nor forgive the insult to a fellow companion and there was the prince down off his horse and approaching her with a swagger grabbing the reins and preparing to mount highness he shouted as a second white streak that could only be keren and dantris came into sight from the direction of the riding arena highness look out but it was far far too late if he had blinked he would have missed it as it was in one way he was glad he had not though in another he wished he had from meek docile and trussed up caryo turned into a whirling spinningand quite deadly if she chosefury in that brief moment the merest breath she expertly yanked three of the four ropes out of the hands of their holders and freed herself from their control probably leaving the palms of those hands bloody and torn in the process though they were in too much shock to register the pain immediately the fourth rope was in the princes hands and instead of ripping it out of his hands she wound it around herself as she whirled and used it to pull him in closer he being not bright enough to let go and as soon as he was in range both hind feet lashed out in a precisely calculated kick which landed right in the princes midsection he went flying backward through the air most spectacularly caryo rid herself of all four ropes though he could not make out how she did it she simply seemed to give a kind of shrug and they loosened and fell off and she stepped out of the loops lying on the ground she spit out the bit shrugged off the bridle as easily as she had the ropes then she bucked off the saddle and kicked it after the prince and went galloping away head high tail flagged evidently with the probable intervention of two heralds and their companions at hand she considered that the single kick was enough behind her three young courtiers were bent over their hands and their saddlebows cursing and gasping the prince was on the ground also gasping not a surprise given that the hammer blow of hooves to his gut must have driven every bit of air that had been in his lungs out of them but he could have had broken ribs he doesnt kantor said though hell have blackandblue hoofprints on his belly for days caryo didnt actually kick him it was more like a calculated and very powerful shove keren got to the prince first rolled him on his side then slammed him across the back until he could breathe again then helped him to his feet talking the whole time alberich reached them just in time to hear her finish terrible insult like putting a slave collar around your neck highness she said alberich could tell though that the prince wasnt listening he was redfaced now and it was with anger i will hunt that beast down this moment and i dont care who it belongs to he said between clenched teeth and i will destroy it enough was enough alberich seized both his shoulders turned him so that he was looking right into alberichs eyes and shook him twice hard like a wolf with a snake then on trial for murder and treason you will be and pay for both with your life he rasped harshly to kill a companion is murder by valdemaran law to kill the queens companion treason do not force your bride to hang you prince for she will evidently alberichs words penetrated for the prince gaped at him in shock for a horse for a companion blessed sunlord just how stupid was this fool theyarenothorses he continued emphasizing each word with a hard shake no matter what your eyes tell you your eyes lie he had done some reading since the prince arrived on mystes insistence and now he was glad that he had have you broken ribs a broken pelvis no because it was a companion that kicked youshoved you with her hooves ratherand not a horse think had it been a horse that had done this would you not in blood and broken bones be lying in your own land lives the shinain tarmaso i know that you know of this the companion is like to her kyree warrl be grateful she did no more than kick you for your insults he saw the princes eyes widen then narrow again at the comparison he heard also heard kantors snort of disgust at being compared to a kyree but kantor knew better than to object since at least now the prince had some basis for comparison that he might believe so karathanelan got out around clenched teeth how do i get one of them to let me ride it choose you you mean alberich replied letting go of the young mans shoulders after this he shook his head and wondered at the monumental hubris that would permit the prince to even think of such a thing he considered trying to explain that it might happenif the prince were to have such a complete change of character as to be a different person he opted for the simpler choice for karathanelan would never believe that he needed to change his character after such an insult to all companions as thisnever not even if the queen was to come here and beg them upon her knees and satisfied at least that the fool was in no condition to try any more foolishness he gave the merest sketch of a bow and turned on his heel two steps took him to kantor and he mounted and rode off there were more important matters to tend to than the petulant prince at least for now myste was laughing so hard that there were actually tears coming from the corners of her eyes and her lenses fogged oh gods she gasped oh gods i wish id seen it she mimed the princes ungraceful arc through the air with one hand eeeeeeeeeethump oh i wish id seen it no you dont alberich contradicted her sourly the prince has a good memory and although he probably will not dare to touch another companion he is going to find a target for his anger more than one i suspect anyone who actually witnessed his disgrace is going to find themselves on his short list of people hell mark for punishment and revenge with his reputation and manliness so utterly refuted he will want to make someone pay and what could he do to a herald myste scoffed i dont know he replied and that is what concerns me he has already tried to have me dismissed from my post as weaponsmaster todayfor putting violent hands on a prince of the blood if you please it was only the reaction of the council to that statement that persuaded him that i am out of his reach for now he shook his head kyril stood up and said that he was lucky i had not finished the task caryo started and that for laying violent hands on a companion he could have found himself in the palace dungeons the palace doesnt have dungeons myste said without thinking i know that and you do but the prince apparently does not alberich shrugged that is not relevant the point is he has already sent his three friends packing he tried to disgrace me keren has been warned and is going to try to stay out of his sight he grimaced poor selenay why poor selenaymyste asked surprised caryo is her companion he reminded her i do not think that he will harm her physically but there are other ways he can make her unhappy many other ways actually he wondered how caryo had broken the news to selenay for surely she would not have waited for the prince to tell his version of the tale first she shrugged i suspect that after he hears the news he wont be inclined to take any of his pique out on her if he wants a validation for his masculinity hell surely have it the news he looked at her blankly what news shes going to have a baby of course myste tsked men i suppose you think it isnt important but her words made his blood run cold as he remembered that overheard conversation with norris on the contrary he said it is very important if what we suspect about the prince is in fact true myste lost her sarcastic smugness and went a little pale id forgotten about that once the babys born if he cant be king there is nothing in the laws of valdemar that say that a regent must be a herald alberich finished grimly for her and even now you would find it difficult to persuade most of the members of the council that he should not be regent for his own child should something happen to selenay selenay had thought she was prepared for an unpleasant time with her husbandinsofar as it was possible to be prepared after getting a shock like that from caryo bless her heart caryo had not said i told you so she had only given the bald facts of the matter and all she said in her own defense was i was afraid if he managed to catch one of the youngsters someone would have gotten seriously injured before it was over and i admit i wanted to put him in his place i didnt exactly kick him though selenay theres nothing broken but his pride she could scarcely countenance not only that he had tried to force a companion to his will but that he had done so in the mistaken belief that he would then be a herald and could be crowned king and coruler it was as if every lesson in valdemaran law that he had been given had soared over his head hadnt he even bothered to listen a little apparently it was only to what he wanted to hear when caryo first told her she was so furious she could not even see and had to sit down as her knees went weak rage and an empty stomach do not combine well she raged inwardly at him nevertheless how dared he lay violent hands on a companion how dared he think that such a despicable act would actually gain him the crown if he had come to her at that moment she might have snatched up some old sword hanging on the wall and beaten him with the flat of it but as a little time passed she regained control over her temper though she was still going to give him a lashing it would be with her tongue and not a whip or a sword blade and she had the first phrase ready on the tip of her tongue when he finally appeared she had thought that after such a monumental act of stupidity karath would have come to her contrite and looking for forgiveness in fact she could not imagine any other scenario instead he burst in through the door slammed it behind him and proceeded to shout at her quite as if she were somehow to blame for all this and as if this business of not being made her coruler was somehow her fault something she had concocted to keep him from his rightful place and as if the debacle with caryo had been something that she had planned to humiliate him and that made her furious all over again his ranting was like a spark in dry grass she pounced on the first available pause for breath and then she made her riposte if you think im going to take your side in this you are very much mistaken karath i told youand if i told you once about how things are here i told you a dozen times selenay shouted at the angry face of her husband the council told you your own ambassador told you for the gods sake karath it was in the marriage contract that you signed in both languages just how stupid are you to have missed it that many times she knew the moment that the words left her mouth that they were the wrong thing to say but she couldnt help it just how stupid was he or did he live in some fantasy world where because he wanted something it would simply be given to him well maybe that was the way things had been back in rethwellan but that wasnt the way it was in valdemar stupid enough to have wedded you he shouted back such a fine bargain i have made for myself i have wedded no power no responsibility and no rank but that which i was born with and for this i have what a wife with neither the face nor the form to stand out in a crowdwith common tastes and common petty morals a little girl who thinks more of her horse than of her husband for this bargain i take a cold naive ignorant virgin who grasps her little power as a miser does gold who does not even know how to properly pleasure a man and before she could retort he stormed out and before the astonished eyes of her guards who had no doubt heard it all he slammed the door behind him leaving her feeling as if he had dealt her a blow she was left staring at the door he slammed behind him torn between wanting to throw herself to the ground weeping and wanting to strangle him the latter won out but not by much and as she paced back and forth across her sitting room there were tears streaking her cheeks as well as anger making her clench her jaw until it ached her heart ached too ached bitterly for every insult he had thrown at her felt like a blow she managed to get some control over herself in order to put herself into the hands of her maids tonight she took extra care with her appearance for surely he who was so conscious of the trappings of status would not absent himself from dinner where he sat at her right hand common was she she would show him she would make him mad to take her in his arms again and she would by the gods make him beg for the privilege and apologize not only to her but to caryo but the chair at her right remained empty all evening she put on a good face of course replying lightly to talamirs query that he was probably passing the time with the friends who had come up from rethwellan to whom she had given titles and property they are probably celebrating now that it is official she said with a false lightness and after all talamir you can hardly expect a young man to hover over his wife every moment of the day at some point every young man i have ever known be he never so devoted has longed for the company of his old friends her laugh sounded hollow to her own ears but talamir made no sign that he had noticed her unhappiness just because we are wedded this does not mean that we are joined at the hip no of course not talamir agreed and nothing more was said on the subject in her hearing but as the dinner wore on she was able to think less and less clearly by the time the sweetmeats were served she would almost have been ready to ask forgiveness of him if it would put things back the way they had been yesterday she kept listening dreading that she would hear something about the debacle in companions field but evidently no one was going to talk about it where she could overhear maybe that was why he wasnt here he didnt want to have to answer any questions about what hed done he didnt want to have to explain himself she felt a great surge of relief then and was able to talk normally able to think of something besides wondering where he was she was still angry at him especially for the cruel things he had said to her but she was ready to forgive him so long as he asked for forgiveness except that he did not appear in their quarters after dinner tonight she had retired to her suite as soon as dinner was over letting her court amuse itself for a change and he did not appear as the hour grew later and later she filled the time with attending to her private correspondence something she had neglected badly over the past fortnight or two but her heart was not in it and time after time she had to throw out a letter that was ruined by tears falling on it he had not come when her maids arrived to help her prepare for bed and he still had not arrived when they blew out the candles leaving her alone in the dark in that great bed and when she realized that he wasnt going to come the anger ran out of her what was wrong how could he not understand at least by now how she was powerless in the face of the law how could he not realize by now the enormity of the insult he had given caryo of course he had been angry but how could he have flung those horrible insults at her she thought he had understood her as no one had ever understood her before hadnt they shared all those long conversations about how miserable it was to be a child of royal birth hadnt he commiserated with her about it as no one else had ever done before hadnt he told her how he had dreamed of finding someone he could care for as well as merely marry for the sake of an alliance and had given it up as an idle dream until he met her how many times had he sworn that to her how many times had he shared his dreams with her and how many times had she discovered to her joy that they were the same as hers what had gone wrong how could he have changed so what had she done to make him turn away from her she had no answers for any of this and she waited fruitlessly in her cold lonely bed until at last she cried herself to sleep alberich contemplated the glass image of the sunlorddefined at the moment by the lines of leading rather than the colors of the glassand tried to think of all of the possible paths that the prince might take after this afternoon the most obvious of course was the most direct wait until the baby was born and engineer an accident that would kill or incapacitate selenay there was no law in valdemar that the regent had to be a herald as regent it was even possible that he would have the same power as the monarch just without the title but that was only one of a number of courses he could take chosen the royal guard kimel is coming down the path kantor warned breaking into his train of thought i cant imagine hed be coming to see anyone but you at this time of night forewarned alberich got up to meet the young man as soon as he entered the salle greeting him at the door but it wasnt until he got to alberichs private quarters that the herald could see his expression and it was both grim and troubled master alberich the young man said when hed taken the proffered seat and been offered and refused any refreshment i overheard a conversation this evening thatthat i do not much like did you alberich replied noncommittally the guard nodded it was during the hour of dinner for the court i was on duty when i heard two voices raised in argument on the other side of the wall where i was standingi happened to be in the gardens and there was an open window right above my head assume i must that you overheard something that might of importance be alberich prompted two men arguing kimel replied and one of them was the prince he coughed i knew about what happened this afternoon and i guess hed gone to someone to complain about it he frowned as he concentrated on what he was going to say i didnt recognize the voice but he got not much sympathy in fact the person he was talking to gave him a regular dressingdown about it the man said that the prince was on the verge of spoiling it all though he didnt say what it was go on alberich told him surely there was more to this story well then the prince said something about the unfairness of it all and the other man told him to be patient and that selenay was here kimel blushed well anyway what he went on to say was once the child is born there is no law preventing you from becoming regent when something happens to selenay all you have to do is to be patient and the prince muttered something and the man laughed and they all went out of the room so there it was you may have done her majesty a great service kimel alberich said gravely i am in a position to do more the young guard replied to alberichs surprise so long as i wear my uniform and look as if i am guarding something no one ever notices me i could make sure that if i am not on duty elsewhere i can follow the prince all over the grounds of the palace perhaps i might discover who he was speaking with if you did invaluable it would be alberich said hardly able to believe the luck then i will that seemed to be all that kimel felt urged to say on the matter he remained a little longer but not much and excused himself well he said to kantor when the young man was gone i think weve gotten an ally who will at least be watching out for selenay i dont know how useful what he learns or overhears will be its better than nothing which was all we had alberich pointed out yes chosen it is at that everyone knew the obvious that nightthat the prince had not attended the queen at dinner by morning though there was a better bit of gossip to take its placethat the prince had not spent the night with the queen nor even it was said in the palace by breakfast that gossip had inflated further with the addition that the prince had returned at last from somewhere outside the palace walls and he had gone to his own suite not the queens valdemaran royal marriages like most royal marriages were not always for love hence the consort always had his or her own suite of rooms within the larger royal suite it had its own entrance the one who occupied it could come and go without disturbing the monarch it would not be the first time that the monarchs spouse had elected to take up residence in his own private space the trouble was this defection of the prince would have gone unnoticed except that this was supposed to have been a love match selenay herself had virtually bullied the marriage through the council and now it seemed it was already falling apart so tongues were wagging from the first and alberich did not think it possible that selenay was unaware of the gossip shed have to be blind and deaf and she was neither it made him sick inside to think how unhappy she must be but there was little he could do about it she was paying a heavy price for her infatuation this was going to be a very expensive lesson in thinking things through however unhappy the prince was with his wife and his situation alberich doubted that karathanelan was going to relinquish what he did have willingly once he realized the alternatives even if selenay became so unhappy as to wish to dissolve the marriage such a move could not be made without the agreement of the other partyand the prince would never agree no unless the prince actually committed an overt act of treason selenay was stuck with her bad bargain and if she was unhappy now when the last of the infatuation wore off she was going to be even less happy alberich wished there was something he could do but he knew that in this case there really was nothing he was entirely the wrong person for her to confide in on two counts first the task required someone who was a close friend which he was notsomeone perhaps that was selenays yearmate at the collegium second his sex was against him he knew instinctively that to become a confidant and adviser in this situation a man just would not do which unfortunately left talamir out of the running as well perhaps she was confiding in her companion perhaps at this point caryo was about the only one she could confide in he hoped that caryo was wise enough to know not to criticize the prince herself at this pointbecause selenay would feel impelled to defend him and that would only prolong the agony so to speak the prince continued to shun the company of his queen one or two days stretched into a week with no sign of him in or around the palace from the time he rose until the timewhich was usually very latehe returned from wherever he had just spent his day alberich grew increasingly weary of the words they say as the days passed but not weary enough not to listen for there were several nuggets of information to be mined from the dross one of them sent him out in disguise one evening to an establishment known as the silver horn which catered to the discriminating tastes of gentlemen or at least it catered to those with money who cared to call themselves gentlemen certainly you could find both the highborn and the monied lowborn there although there were special places within the establishment to which money alone did not guarantee entrance alberich already had a persona established here that of an elderly semideaf gentleman with a substantial fortuneelderly because that way he would not be looked on askance for not making use of the opulent rooms up the parlor stair and the ladies who inhabited those rooms as jewels graced a setting alberich would every now and then dodder in partake of a splendid meal and sit enjoying the entertainments on offer in the more public roomsgenerally scantily clad young ladies singing or dancing though it was said that they performed far more interesting maneuvers elsewhere in the establishmentuntil he apparently nodded off then if he had overheard nothing of importance he would wake and dodder off again he found the place far more useful than the court for obtaining information about the goingson of the highborn the horn provided something of an educational tradition with the aristocracy young men were often brought here by brothers or even fathers for their first so far as the parent knew sexual experiences then as they grew older they would come here by themselves or with friends to make a night of itfine meals gambling entertainment and then a romp it wasnt cheapbut alberich wasnt paying for this out of his own pocket and there were times when he felt as if given the number of candlemarks he had spent in the broken arms and other even fouler dens lurking on street corners in the freezing dark getting soaked with rain or baking in the hot sun that he had earned an occasional evening in the horn even if all he did was have a meal and lurk he had heard that friends of the prince were going to introduce him to the pleasures of the horn and as a consequence both of that and of an internal prodding too vague to really be called foresight after the third night in which the prince did not appear alberich began haunting the horn nightly he was a forgettable enough character that no one really noticed and the prince did indeed appear that first night and every night subsequent unfortunately to alberichs vast disappointment the prince kept himself to the exclusive areas for the most part and alberich never saw more of him than his back as he swaggered through the public rooms and into the private areas it seemed after three nights that alberich was wasting his time that all the prince was doing was roistering fine he could bring this to selenay but what good would it do yet that vague prodding only strengthened as the nights went on and although he never got a glimpse of foresight after the fourth night he knew with absolute certainty that if he kept up his watch something significant would happen and then on the seventh night it was not the prince who became the center of attention when he walked in the door it was the actor norris and with him was young devlin alberich was in a shadowy corner slumped in one of the horns supremely comfortable chairs fingers interlaced over his paunch chin on his chest seeming to doze this time he had chosen a seat because of the feeling that this was where he needed to beagain it was a feeling and not a vision nothing concrete but he was certain that it was linked to his foresight and he acted on it one of the young ladies had made certain to tuck a cushion on either side of him so that he wouldnt put a crick in his neck he had muttered vague and sleepy thanks and she had giggled and left him alone now everyone seemed to have forgotten he was there which gave him ample opportunity to watch the room from mostlyclosed eyes when myste had made absented herself from the theater alberich had continued to keep an eye on the actor at a distance through other contacts but there did not seem to be any sign of further chicanery in fact norris was so busy alberich couldnt see how he managed to find the time to sleep much less write letters and find ways to pass them to anyone in addition to rehearsing and performing he spent every waking moment at the site of his new theater obsessing over details and virtually flogging the workers into going faster but here he was and as soon as they saw him those young ladies who were not otherwise occupied left what they were doing and clustered around him with exclamations and coos of delight the odd thing was although he put on a very good show of being pleased and it was clear that young devlin was nervously gratified to have him here alberich got the distinct impression that he very much would rather not be there then again as busy as the man was alberich wondered where he had found the time to come here in the first place the only possible corner of the room that could have been considered secluded was the one in which alberich had ensconced himself norris accepted refreshments teased and flirted with the ladies but took none of them up the stairs which was so entirely out of keeping with everything that alberich knew about the man that he was immediately on alert devlin did not move from his side either and it seemed to alberich that the young noble was keeping a sharp watch on the door and perhaps threequarters of a candlemark later the prince strolled in with an escort of young sycophants except that one of them apparently was not as much of a sycophant as the prince had thought because before karathanelan could vanish as usual into one of the private parlors that young man steered him over to norris chair devlin and the other young man exchanged a glance devlin nodded and within moments the newcomer gathered up the princes escort and hustled them into the private parlors highness devlin said with a bow to the prince our patron wishes you to have a discussion with my friend and at that he took himself off going not into the back like the others but back out the front door alberich was torn between followingfor surely he was going to report to someoneand staying to listen but his own internal urging said stay so stay he did and norris looking up indolently at the prince indicated with a nod that karathanelan should take a seat beside him run away my beauties the actor said in an amused tone of voice we gentlemen need to discuss things too delicate for your tender ears with giggles and pretty pouts as the prince glared his outrage the ladies did as they were told sit down norris said and then when the prince did not move repeated with force sit down now i shall do nothing of the sort the prince said tightly i will have you horsewhipped and thrown into the street for your insolence you wont if you know whats good for you norris said without turning a hair i am here at the behest of and doing a very great favor for our mutual sponsor and if you dont sit down i am going to walk out of here and tell him why i did so you can see what will happen to you without his protection then but i dont recommend it the prince sat down thats better norris said pleasantly what about him the prince growled nodding at alberich nothing to worry about norris dismissed alberich with a shrug hes older than dirt half senile mostly deaf i tested him norris grinned then if hed been conscious when i tipped little kassies skirts up hed have at least twitched yes and you arent quite as clever as you think alberich told him mentally because a real agent wouldnt have reacted even if youd taken the girl on the spot he wasnt sure he would have had the ability to remain asleep but then againhed yawned through worse down in the broken arms now norris continued losing the grin before we begin ill trouble you to remember that i have no loyalty to you or to anyone else who has not paid my fee once bought however i stay bought this is good business and it is why our patron brought me here but remember that i do not give a damn what happens to you my part of your education should have been over moons ago and it would have been if you hadnt been such an idiot a week ago idiot the prince hissed i think not exactly norris interrupted you dont think if you did you would realize that you are expendable fellowmylad the prince started and looked at norris as if he thought the actor had run mad norris wagged a finger at him turnabout is fair play sauce for the goose will serve for the gander if your bride has done her dynastic duty by getting with child so quickly you have done your work at stud and she doesnt need you anymore didnt that ever occur to you over the past few days while youve been doing your best to make her hate you alberich couldnt see the princes face but he sounded smug she cannot be rid of me i would not agree to the dissolution of the marriage which just shows how much of a fool you are norris countered flatly certainly a marriage cant be dissolved without the consent of both partiesif you were an ordinary couple but you arent you are in a foreign land and the law can be whatever she gets the council to agree to and if you should be so indiscreet as to do something treasonable she wouldnt even have to dissolve the marriage she could simply arrange for the council to make her a widow norris examined his nails critically they hang traitors to the crown in valdemar you know shecouldnt the prince gasped as if it hadnt occurred to him she could norris replied matteroffactly and youre skirting perilous close to it let me tell you if your lovely bride had chosen your little folly in the matter of a mount would have had you facing a high court already in fact the only reasons you havent been charged with treason already are because our patron is protecting you and because our patron is fairly certain that your wife is still weeping over your misbehaving and hasnt yet gone from tears to anger which is why our patron brought me here because you mean nothing to me i owe you nothing you can do nothing to me and i can and will tell you what no one else around you would dare he leaned forward and shoved his index ringer at the prince now you listen to this youd better believe it and youd better act on it our patrons patience is not inexhaustible and he wont continue to support and protect you while you run about like a tomcat youre wasting those very expensive lessons of mine you can be replaced and you will be once your wife decides that shes going to stop crying herself to sleep in an empty bed and start doing something about the situation you might survive the experience but id bet not our patron has enemies of his own and theyd be perfectly happy to bring you down and replace you with one of their own choices and he wont go down to save your worthless hide alberich snored gently and wondered just who the mutual patron was more than that what did this mysterious entity expect to get out of his patronage of karathanelan if he could protect the prince surely he could get whatever he wanted for himself the prince was silent for a long moment i dont like this how do i know that this is true he said at last i dont care what you think about it norris replied impatiently and i dont have to prove anything to you i already have what i wanted out of the bargain and i dont particularly care whether or not you believe me you are wasting my time not the other way around time to wake up and deal with the mess youve made lad before you find yourself neckdeep and no way to get out norris very indifference seemed to work as a powerful argument with the prince what do i do he asked at last grudgingly norris snorted do i have to draw you a map but when the prince looked at him blankly he sighed apparently i do all right then the first thing you do is go apologize to your wife for whatever you said to her and everything youve done since you quarreled with her groveling to her if need be until you get her forgiveness i will never the prince began hotly you will if you want to keep your head on your neck norris hissed and once youve groveled enough you tell her that now that youve come to your senses and have looked back on your unspeakable conduct these past several days you realized tonight how unsatisfactory all these other women youve been bedding are compared to her the prince sniggered norris shrugged of course thats ridiculous but thats what she wants to hear and believe me it is the only thing you could say that will make her forgive you for sleeping with anyone else then you will have to go right back to your first lesson with her and woo her all over again only it will be a little easier this time because she knows what you can do in bed and you wont be handicapped by having to hold back with her to save her virtue remember what i taught you and everything our patron managed to find out use that make her feel that you are the only person in the whole world who could possibly understand her i wrote you the scripts drag them out again the prince seemed to think it over and finally said grudgingly if this is what our patron wants hang our patron this is the only thing that will keep you out of a dungeon cell norris said bluntly as alberich mentally cursed if only he could have counted on the princes arrogance to push things and keep pushing them until selenay was ready to be rid of him well it looked as if that was a vain hope very well the prince got up but did not offer his hand to norris you and our patron have been right in the past i must assume that you are right now fare you well right norris replied waving him away indolently just see that you remember what ive told you the next time youre tempted to assert yourself alberich continued to doze until the prince was inside the door to one of the private parlors and norris was surrounded again by his bevy of beauties then with a start he woke surveyed the room indulgently then levered himself up out of his chair to totter away part of him wanted to string up norris as soon as the prince had been dealt with but part of him which had been listening to the conversation with keen interest had a better idea i think we should hire him when this is over he said knowing that kantor had been following everything that had transpired you what kantor asked incredulously kantor had no need to ask who he was i think we should hire him as our agent alberich amended mind i wouldnt tell him just who is hiring him but he could be damned useful to us but he said himself he could be bought kantor protestedthen stopped and he said that once he was bought he stayed bought didnt he that was exactly what he said alberich replied i think he could be a valuable agent more valuable alive and working for us than in prison if we could even find something to charge him with which i doubt emotionally i dont like it kantor replied unhappily but logicallyyoure right hes an amoral beast but better hes been bought by us at least then we can control him as much as such a one is ever controlled alberich finished and sighed and this assumes that his patronwhoever that isloses interest in him if hes the sort who stays bought well never get him otherwise good kantor said firmly id rather we didnt id rather we could have him thrown in jail which we cant because he hasnt done anything wrong alberich pointed out all hes done that we know of is to give the prince lessons on how to woo and win the queen which is hardly illegal and we cant even prove that he did that much really not to satisfy a law court but oh how i wish he hadnt been here tonight i know exactly what you mean kantor said glumly karathanelan might have been an arrogant selfcentered beast but apparently he was bright enough to know when he was getting good advice he was also phenomenally lucky because the next day the very next day word came from rethwellan that his father the king was dead now that might not have been thought of as luck except that word also came from rethwellan that the king had already been buried that karaths presence was not required at home and that in fact his brother the new king faramentha suggested strongly that he should remain in valdemar at the side of his new bride and do his mourning in private even while the rethwellan embassy was being swathed in black karath hurried to the palace and in full view of everyone as selenay herself was hearing the news and flung himself weeping at her feet selenay canceled the rest of her audiences that day and took him with her back to her chambers alberich could not know of course what the prince told her aside from the script that norris had provided for him but he could guess what would appeal to selenay more than to have her beloved husband suddenly bereft of his own father certainly he went about after that in heavy mourning and certainly selenay was as unshakably attentive to him as he was to her to alberichs disgust he was more firmly in selenays good graces than he had been before always by her side and playing the devoted husband selenay spent a disturbing amount of time gazing at him or into his eyes with every sign of being firmly under his spell and in public at least he was as devoted as she could ever have wished in public he was also playing the tragic figure of the mourning son and rejected brother when a new ambassador came from rethwellan to replace the old one he showed a very chilly face to the man who was in his turn no better than icily polite which meant nothing to alberich until talamir enlightened him one late summer evening oh do think about this for a moment talamir told him with unusual impatience the prince was not told of his fathers death until faramentha was firmly on the throne and he was not recalled what does that tell you ah alberich shook his head i was thinking too much of our own side of this and not beyond our borders faramentha does not trust his brother and the prince holds faramentha in enmity so sowhether or not the old king was privy to karathanelans plans the new one is not probably talamir nodded and unless i miss my guess he added shrewdly the princes grief is not all sham not that he is brokenhearted over being rejected by his brother nor mourning terribly for his father if he is alberich was moved to point out the ladies of the horn have not noticed precisely but if there is one thing the prince cares about its his own wellbeing and with his father dead and his brother who despises him on the throne he has nowhere to go if he fails here alberich felt cold i do not like this neither talamir said delicately do i but there was not much either of them could do about it karath had too many good cards in his hand and selenays own condition was aiding him by summers end as the first leaves began to turn selenay was deep in work and when she wasnt working she was generally asleep or at least resting her pregnancy was hard on her not so much that it was difficult but that she was finding it exhausting according to crathach who made no secret that he disapproved of her getting with child so quickly this left ample opportunity for the prince to comport himself as if he was a bachelor but he went about it so discreetly that most of the court had no idea unfortunately one of the things that was wearing selenay out was that he still had not given up the notion of being crowned even though he was not fighting with her about it using less aggressive means to get his point across roughly once a fortnight he would find some other reason to bring the tired old plaint back up or some new scheme to get around the law this alberich heard from talamir usually when alberich came up to the collegium to report on whatever new information he might have gathered on his prowls in haven the city was quiet of late as the season passed from summer into autumn even the criminal element was up to no more than the usual trouble there seemed nothing that required alberichs intervention stalking devlin to try and find the identity of the patron was proving to be fruitless where devlin went none of alberichs personae was welcome as for norris the actor was so busy with his new theater that even he was beginning to look a little frayed about the edges hes come up with another one today talamir said lowering himself wearily down into a chair by the hearth he looked ancient tonight and very transparent alberich wondered what he had been doing to wear himself so thin he wants to be gone came the unbidden thought hes faced with things he cant do anything about and he just wants to be gonefrom problems from life and he wants it with all of his heart he might want itbut he wasnt pursuing it at least duty held him here at selenays side however poorly suited he thought himself to the task at that moment alberich pitied the queens own this time what alberich asked knowing that the he could only be the prince and that the another one was yet another ploy to pressure selenay into somehow getting him a crown that shes shaming him in front of his familyor so he says talamir said wearily according to him that she hasnt made him king means that she thinks he is unworthy of a crown and now he says that this is why his own brother has rejected him and kept him from his fathers side when the king was dying ah so now he attempts guilt alberich replied i would guess said talamir and shook his head at least she came to me with this looking for reassurance and i planted another seed perhaps you can use the papers soon alberich hazarded they finally had a translation of them it took long enough to break the code when they had as alberich had suspected they proved to be instructions on what to do and say to selenay to win her with some very intimate details some were things that alberich blinked at things that one would have thought were the sort of confession that selenay would not have given to anyonegirlish daydreams actually about the sort of man she was looking for and the loneliness of being who she was the despair that she would never have the kind of marriage her father had enjoyed where had all of that come from even talamir had been surprised at the bitterness and anguish of some of it but maybe selenay had been pouring her woes into the ears of one of her servants alberich would have thought they were trustworthy and probably they were but he supposed there was no reason why they shouldnt tell others what selenay had told them some of what had been written were intimate glimpses into selenay personally and what to say to her to play to her sympathies but otherswell alberich had found himself blushing at the stepbystep instructions for seduction they did not merely border on the pornographic they were pornographic and alberich was no longer surprised that norris was so popular with the ladies nor that selenay was so deeply infatuated with the prince how could she not be if the prince was following these instructions meant to make selenay believe that here past all her hopes was not only her soulmate but a lover who could guarantee the satisfaction of a female partner closely and with all his attention part of him wanted to burn the wretched papers but they were useful very useful if ever selenays attachment began to fade at the right moment showing her these things could turn her fading infatuation to distaste only she could know how closely the prince followed his scriptsbut the more closely he had the more obvious it would be that he was following a script and that there never had been any real feeling behind his act not until after the child is born talamir sighed crathach says that he doesnt want any more stress on her right now between matters of state and the princes continuous pressure shes got more than enough on her hes playing the bereft orphan very convincingly and of all of the acts he could contrive thats the one that will make her excuse him nearly anything alberich counted up the months in his mind spring then he said with a sigh but the prince himself will perhaps overstep before then but talamir shook his head no i think that this patron whoever he is has found a way to clamp controls down over the prince more than just norris i mean or even young devlin devlin cant be more than a messenger it astonishes me and i wish i knew how real the threat to selenay is alberich nodded there was the real question truth be told there were actually a number of interpretations that could be placed on what norris had said to his control first it could be all bluster it was one thing to say that the queen was dispensable it was quite another to actually act on those words norris was when it all came down to cases a commoner whatever he knew about life at court he could only learn from brief glimpses and the rather unrealistic views of life among the highborn that he got from his plays or just perhaps by whatever his patron told himassuming the patron told him anything at all about life at court selenay was surrounded night and day by guards that alberich himself had trained and could vouch for and by the heralds as well to actually assassinate her someone would have to get past them and selenays own impressive selfdefense abilities and it was guaranteed that whoever tried would not survive the attempt so the enemy would have to find someone highly skilled clever and suicidalnot an easy task poison was out of the question healers checked everything that she ate and drank and even if someone managed to slip poison past them there were no instantaneous poisons other than some rare snakebites healers would almost certainly be able to save her norris and presumably his patron might simply be counting on the hazards of childbearing to remove selenay to alberichs mind that was as foolish a hope as finding an assassin selenay was in excellent health and by no means delicate women gave birth without complications every day without the small army of healers to attend them that selenay had i wish i could hazard a guess talamir replied it seems a preposterous idea on the face of it the foreseers are no real help either alberich knew what that meant too many future possibilities to sort out that or so he had been told was why he never got any visions inspired by foresight that extended into the future by more than a candlemark his gift evidently operated in the same fashion as he didif there were too many choices his gift elected not to show any of them so that he could concentrate without distractions pulling him in a dozen directions at once it only showed him things he could actually act on it is that i think sometimes our gifts are more hindrance than help he said sourly some of them at any rate talamir agreed he looked broodingly off over alberichs left shoulder for a long moment staring at nothing but doing it in a way that tended to raise the hackles on the back of alberichs neck what was he looking at so intently with that expression of focused detachment alberich was used to that listening look that heralds got when they were conversing with their companions and this wasnt that expression it also wasnt the absentminded look most people got when they were engrossed in their own thoughts the closest analogy that alberich could come to was that odd look that cats sometimes got when they stared intently at something that apparently wasnt there it was a karsite tradition that when they did that they were looking at spirits talamirs look was very like that but if the queens own was seeing ghosts he hadnt said anything about it to anyone alberich repressed a shiver and coughed quietly to bring talamirs attention back to the present talamir blinked and picked up the conversation where it had left off i have to think at this point that your actors conversation was a deliberate attempt on his part to remind his control and his patron that he knows where all the skeletons are talamir said i think he was trying to extract more money from them to buy his silence in case anything did happen to the queen alberich thought that over it was plausible more plausible than any of his own theories norris might stay bought but when you did that there was less incentive for your employers to try to keep you in their pocket once they had what they initially wanted and theaters were more expensive to maintain than a stable full of racehorses a dangerous ploy that one alberich observed he could be removed before a danger he becomes perhaps perhaps talamir admitted but that is the best fit for what you overheard alberich nodded his agreement but not without a sense of relief if that was all it was they finished their business and alberich made his way back to the salle through the dark not alone of course the moment he crossed over the fence into companions field kantor joined him youre still troubled his companion observed i dont like it for some reason alberich admitted unfortunately i dont know why well what can you do about it he pondered that for a moment trying to think of all of the times selenay could be vulnerable not when holding court not at council meetings probably not in the gardens or in her own quarters or at meals or entertainmentsunless the harpists suddenly produced arrows and used their instruments as bows not very likely but before the arrival of the prince selenay had occasionally donned the working whites of a common herald and gone off for a long ride down to the home farms outside the walls of haven usually accompanied only by talamir and sometimes not even him and then if ever you know i believe i am going to start attending the hurlee practices he said slowly i believe i will begin working with the hurlee players she might object to an escort she wont object to a crowd of cheerful youngsters nattering about sport in fact she might even enjoy their company but it will not take much to turn them from gamesmen to meleeexperts hurlee is cursed like a melee already kantor observed and that is the point alberich replied furthermore unless she is really craving privacy selenay wont think anything of a hurlee team riding along with her theyre only trainees not guards so she wont object he smiled i believe she will welcome them then he sobered the hard part will be in training them to be weapons at her side without any of them realizing that is what i am doing if anyone can kantor said firmly you can he sighed and hoped his companion was right a harsh cold wind blew across the hurlee ground rattling the last of the sere brown leaves still clinging to the trees a helm and neckbrace werent much help in protecting from the cold the wind ripped gleefully down the weaponsmasters collar and the sudden chill brought back memories of long patrols in the lonely hills of karse in weather worse than this when he would wake cold patrol until he and his men were warm only where their bodies were in contact with their horses hides then gather around smoking fires where you warmed little bits of yourself while the rest stayed achingly cold nowwell he had come from a warm salle and he would be going back to it this was just minor discomfort inconsequential alberich gravely surveyed the twelve best hurlee players in the collegium now gathered before him in their turn they gazed fearlessly back at him they were all superior athletes all either in their last or nexttolast years and all were old enough to give alberich respect untempered with fear they were past that halffearful halfawestruck stage past thinking him an unreasonable taskmaster they knew him now knew what he was about knew why he did what he did with them there were those that were this lots yearmates that still had not grasped those truths that was why he had picked his candidates so carefully and if they suspected what he was about with them now was going to be something more than turning them into vicious hurlee playerswell he reckoned they only thought to the moment when they were to get their whites and assumed that he was fitting them better to be heralds in some of the more dangerous sectors and it was true enough that this training would serve that end so they were not entirely wrong the real purpose was a secret held by him talamir kantor and rolanand the companions of these dozen young grays after careful consultation with kantor he and talamir had elected to include the companions but not the trainees because of the risk that someone would let something slip no secret was ever safer and he and kantor felt that to get the best result he needed the informed cooperation of the companions other than that no one else had been told not even myste knew though of course he would tell her eventually for the sake of the chronicles just not now later when the danger was past and his fears were proved falseor true the twelve sat shivering in their saddles waiting for him to speak they wore more than the usual hurlee protections shin knee and calfguards kidneybelts elbowguards armguards neckbraces and they were finding as he already knew that none of these protections helped against the teeth of the wind there were no observers today no one wanted to sit in the cold in the open with no shelter on a day like this not even to watch the best hurlee players in haven it seemed an especial irony that rather than being overcast the sun shone down among swiftlymoving scuds of cloud in a mostlyblue sky it gave no help against the cold two teams of six for now he said and pointed harrow you sit out throw in the ball referee i will play this third and the next when hurlee had first been turned into a game and not a form of exercise it had started with as many players as could be crowded onto the field but now the official tally was twentyfour on the field twelve to each side two of the twelve were goaltenders two played close to the goals and another two were rovers outside the scrum on the alert for a misshit ball or a pass from one of their own side alberich was paring the teams down again to two goaltenders and four others four roaming players one on the home goal one on the shared goal a new rule he continued the companion a fair target is he was counting on any ambushers being armed with swords rather than any other exotic weaponsit would be easy enough to incapacitate companions by thrusting the shafts of spears among their legs in a meleea broken leg would send a companion down as easily as a horse but it was still possible more than possible for a companion to be killed by a sword thrust he would have to teach them to avoid the possibility and as for the stroke that had killed the king and his companion and killed rolans predecessorwell that would be coming in later lessons yes he repeated with a little more force the companion a legal target is that startled them though the companions all nodded or snorted and pawed the ground to indicate willingness well they knew and knew why this only surprised their chosen startled and shocked them as if he had suggested that they should practice assassination techniques on infants still they were all intelligent and in a moment they nodded too and this probably confirmed their suspicions that he was fitting them for dangerous missions missions in which their companions would most definitely be targets the targets of people who were out to kill them not incapacitate them well he was if he needed them it would be facing people who would probably strike at their companions first the prince might be willfully ignorant when it came to the companions but his comrades werent and they would know what the tedrels had known kill the companion and the herald is lost as well and companionsyou are to target opposing riders he continued and he thought he caught a wicked glint in one or two blue eyes pull them down out of the saddle knock them over chase them to the boundaries the companions would be quicker to adapt than their chosen at least at first the companions of this lot were all full adults more experienced than their riders so he held up his stick the traditional beginning to a hurlee game was for all players to raise their sticks and crack them together belatedly the rest of them cracked theirs against his harrowthrow in the ball and referee signal no fouls only danger or hurt we play harrow had a whistle but under these rules he wasnt to blow it except to start game play unless someone was injured these were real noholdsbarred conditions with the hurlee stick becoming a weaponclub spear staff whatever suited as the two teams lined up against each other staring at each other waiting it occurred to him to be amused at himself who ever would have thought that his impulse to give a set of overexcited youngsters something to burn off some energy with would have turned into this harrows whistle cut through the cold air and the game began as he had expected the trainees promptly forgot the new rule about targeting companions he hadnt though and kantor charged straight into the companion of the opposing teams captain using his greater bulk and muscle to literally knock the other off his feet the others scattered before that charge kantor in a full charge was a terrifying sight kantor angled sideways at the last moment ramming the other with his chest as alberich thrashed at the rider with his stick and missed the rider ducking under the blow the shock of the meeting jolted through him the companion went over knocked right offbalance his rider remembering his equitation classes and jumping free at the last minute and as alberich charged down on him he brought up his stick defensively in time to deflect the blow alberich was aiming at his head alberich and kantor galloped past and kantor whirled with a hipwrenching reversal of direction charging for the opposing teams goalminder meanwhile thinking just a little faster on his feet than the rest alberichs sharedgoal minder followed the weaponsmasters example and slapped his counterparts companion over the rump with his stick trumpeting indignation the offended companion leaped out of the way giving alberichs team a clear shot at the goal which they took harrow whistled to stop play and ran in to fetch the ball the first play was over and the only casualty was one rider unhorsed one companion slapped and the second would likely not happen again alberich felt his heart swell with pride they were good they were more than good they were brilliant adaptable and clever and before time to change came up they were all playing by the new rules without having to think about it too much not that any of them had much of a chance against alberich because he was not holding back for their benefit he wanted them to feel what it was really like fighting against an adult and an experienced and cunning one as well he had tested the princes skills himself and he was not going to assume that the princes chosen accomplices should he try this thing were going to be any less skilled but unless the prince somehow recruited people from the tedrel wars none of them would have had anything like real combat experience nor anything like what he and these trainees were practicing when changeup came and harrow signaled them for the sake of making it a bit fairer as far as scoring was concerned he switched sides harrow came in and a player from the other team came out and the game began again except that this time they all were playing like they meant it and at the third changeup alberich sat out altogether and ran a critique from the sidelines by this time they were playing by the new rules without having to concentrate on them and the riders suddenly found themselves confronted by something that had never happened to them before their companions were no longer entirely mindful of their chosen not when they were busy avoiding dangerous blows themselves that meant that there were moments out there when they were no better off than if theyd been riding a superbly trained horse those were the moments of greatest danger just as they had been in real combat those were the moments when if they thought about it at all these young trainees got their first taste of real bonechilling fear when he brought the game to an end they were allhimself includedabsolutely exhausted bruised and battered and there was a light of grim readytodrop satisfaction in their eyes and youre warm kantor observed with weary humor though you wont stay that way if you start making a speech alberich ignored him good he said and their eyes lit up very good look you this a special class will be every day this time until i say for now we hurlee asaddle but the next step will beunhorsed and you hurlee aground until you can get mounted again and those mounted will try to separate you from your companion and you will be trying to take the companion down from the ground so be thinking on this yes weaponsmaster they said in a ragged chorus harrow quicker than the others looked pale but asked you mean were trying to repeat what killed the king and the monarchs own companion you are striving to prevent that alberich corrected gently and it will take time so here you will be every day for two candlemarks or a full game whichever arrives first but what if weve got a class or work scheduled one of them piped up voice trembling only a little see talamir he will tend to it alberich ordered this class precedence has and several of them exchanged meaningful glances sober ones too he was proud to see so they knew somehow in this first round of mockcombat they had learned that deadly lesson that fighting was dirty foul and uglythat combat meant hurt that they could be hurt which was a difficult lesson for any young person to grasp he did not think that they had yet come to grips with the other lessonthat they could die but at least they knew that there was no glory to be found in this and there was a great deal of danger he hoped oh they know and theyre thinking furiously trying to come up with the reason for all of this kantor told him dont worry well encourage the right answer good he needed them to concentrate on that answer because by the time the snow was falling hed have them practicing in full armor and by the time it melted he would have them practicing in sets of custommade armor that would not show under trainee grays when that armor arrived he wanted them to be firmly fixated on their own answer and not his he raised his stick automatically they raised theirs and they all clashed together overhead good game he said with satisfaction same time tomorrow fat fluffy flakes of snow fell thickly from a sky that was a uniform featureless gray from horizon to horizon the damp still air seemed oddly warm but perhaps it was only because there was no wind blowing at the moment already the new snow was a thumbsbreadth deep everywhere covering the old crusty kneedeep stuff softening the harsh bare bushes and skeletal tree limbs it covered everywhere except the hurlee field which was a churnedup mess of dirty snow clods of earth and grass there was not a single spot on the field that wasnt pounded down with hoofmarks despite the muffling effect of the falling snow the game was loud enough not because of the shouting of spectators there werent any nor the shouts of the players themselves mostly they just grunted no it was the clash of stick on armor every one of the players wore armor including alberich thigh shin and footguards breast and backplates shoulder neck and armguards and of course the helm it wasnt articulated plate of the sort that a knight might wear the trainees wore protective plates riveted onto leather much lighter and easier to move inrelatively easier to fit under or over other garments anyway under the armor they wore padded gambesons and over it padded surcoats the companions were armored too at least for these practice sessionsa faceplate to protect their heads articulated plate along their necks and legguards alberich didnt want any of them injured either he was on homegoal guard this session which gave him more opportunity to watch the rest as they skirmished and they had made amazing progress in the past few moons i should have expected it i suppose looking back on how all those young trainees drove themselves before the last tedrel war he felt a warmth toward them that was almost paternal challenge them and they rose to the challenge let them but think that there was a challenge in the offing and they rose to it and theyd go through fire to meet it most of the noise was coming from sticks connecting with the companions armor since they werent wearing any padding over it and he wondered if perhaps he shouldnt order the armor off when the day came that they began riding guardian on selenay there was no way to disguise what was essentially horsearmor so the companions would have to do without if it was making the companions dependent possibly careless its not they just arent ready yet to have us dodging underneath them not with all that extra weight kantors assurance was all he needed he stopped worrying about it this was only the third session under armor and they still werent used to it fortunately the custommade and fitted armor he had ordered up for them was going to be lighter than this stuff not as strong or protective but it should easily be good enough against the kinds of light courtblades that the prince and his friends sported if alberichs worst fears came true and if the prince and his friends elected to attempt to hire professionals rather than doing the dirty work themselves alberich would hear about it there was no job involving dirty work in haven that at least one of his personae didnt hear about either via the rumor vine or directly if the prince decides to hire out his evil work wouldnt it be a great irony if he approached me directly just as he thought that the melee surged toward his goal he judged his moment and as soon as they drew near enough to be a threat to the goal kantor charged the rider nearest him the companions powerful muscles surged under him kantors unusual weight and sizequite as large as any warhorsewas next to impossible for another companion to stand up to the best they could do was to try and turn aside at the last moment so that he slid along a flankor to dodge out of the way but there was nowhere for this companion to dodge to and no room to turn kantor hit him hard and the shock of the meeting jarred both his body and alberichs they bounced back kantor anticipated the shock and caught himself without a slip the other companions hooves scrabbled desperately in the snow as he tried to stay upright the rider dropped his stick grabbed the hold on the pommel and hung on grimly and kantor charged again while alberich swung at the rider it was a short charge more of a push but the other companions hind feet slid right out from under him at the same time that alberichs stick connected with the riders helm with a solid clang that vibrated up the stick and into alberichs arm down they both went the companion sliding over sideways with a squeal of pain the rider justfalling not jumping free not even trying and alberich knew as soon as they started to fall that they were both hurt blessed sun lord so did shanda who was refereeing she gave a blast to her whistle as the two hit the slushy ground and the scrum instantly stopped what have we done the rider groaned and tried to rise as alberich leaped off kantors back and ran for him the companion got to his feet with a lurch and a scramble whining under his breath with pain but when he stood it was on only three legs not broken kantor relayed instantly but its a bad sprain alberich unfastened harrows helm strap and lifted the helmet from harrows head look at me he commanded and it didnt take a genius to see from the unequal size of the boys pupils that hed been concussed and it didnt take a genius to see why either the padding had come loose and slid down the back of the helm to bunch up against the neck protector shanda was on the case already she and her companion were dragging up the twohorse stretcher they kept at the side of the field alberich didnt have to give them a single order they worked as if they had rehearsed for this disaster half of them lifted harrow straight up off the ground without moving his back or neck and placed him on the stretcher within a moment they were heading toward healers collegium with harrow held securely by the straps around the stretcher meanwhile the other half of the trainees left behind were buckling harrows companion onto the saddles of two more companions so they could take some of his weight and he wouldnt have to put that injured leg to the ground in another moment they too were on their way to the healers picking their way through the uneven snow alberich was left to pick up the helm and stare numbly after them he felt sick but what could he do there were injuries like this even in normal practice much less the risky stuff he was asking them to do now and if he didnt push themif they didnt push themselvesif it came to a real fight they might not live through it he wasnt going to apologize but what were they thinking find us a substitute weaponsmaster called brion over his shoulder as the second lot limped toward the collegium with harrows companion were not good enough yet and this just proves it get us a substitute or get us just a referee and you substitute and well pick this up tomorrow the words both startled and gratified him and for a moment he actually felt his eyes burn i will he called after them hoping that they didnt notice the slightly choked quality caused by the lump in his throat but session is ended for today i think tell the others with harrow will you he asked kantor certainly there was a pause harrow says to tell you he apologizes for not checking his helm better and that this is all his fault that called for an apology tell him that he is rightbut that it is also my fault for not checking the equipment first myself and that i also beg his pardon for my carelessness that ought to scare him out of his bed kantor chuckled you apologizing but as alberich hung the faulty helm on the pommel of his saddle and turned to mount kantors saddle and head for the salle he caught sight of movement out of the corner of his eye for one horrible moment he thought it was someone from the court perhaps one of the princes people which could be a disaster then he saw the color of the mount and the riders clothing and had another sickening feeling this was another trainee and companion and theyd seen the accident if he thought he was being portrayed as a monster before no companion thinks youre a monster he hadnt seen them there hed thought there had been no one watching in a moment he recognized them with something of a start the trainee was young mical his companion elorantwo of the unholy trio whose antics had broken that mirror in the salle and had inadvertently sent him down the road to discovering what the actor norris had been up to what were they doing here but micals punishment was long since over what could he possibly have been doing out here it wasnt for pleasure he looked practically blue with cold and he must have been here the entire time theyd been playing weaponsmaster alberich the boy called as soon as he was within easy conversational distance can we volunteer to be that substitute alberich raised an eyebrow making certain that none of his considerable surprise showed on his face although his jaw ached with the effort of keeping it from dropping he knew very well that young mical had a reputation as a demon hurlee player despite the late start that he and eloran had on it because of the punishment work hed been doing but that was regular hurlee not thisthis combat version surely no one sane would volunteer for this not after today not seeing that the weaponsmaster would injure one of the trainees and apparently not think twice about it and mical had at least three more years to go in his training not one or less than one how long have you watching been he asked keeping his tone flat he expected to hear a slightly cocky long enough but once again he got a surprise a little more than two moons mical replied it took me a while to get my chores scheduled so i had the candlemark free i heard about it and i started watching at first it waswell because it was hurlee he emphasized the game as if invoking the name alone would explain everything then i stayed kantor snorted well well this is interesting this no kind of game is alberich told him harshly not anymore not this group there is this serious injury today more there are likely to be i know that weaponsmaster mical replied head up eyes blazing but im good really good at regular hurlee and i want to help his companion moved forward until he was nearly nosetonose with alberich and the rest of his speech was made in a whisper i know why youre doing this he continued and if his hands and voice trembled a little his gaze was firm that is i think i know what youre doing youre training up a bunch of people who are always at the collegium until they graduate into whites and who nobody is going to even consider as adequate protection not even the queen so we could go anywhere you think that if the queen ever leaves the palace grounds someone is going to try to kidnap her maybe even the princes friends to try and get the queen and the council to agree to make him a king since that was very near to what alberich was afraid of he actually started and stared at the boy and this time he didnt even try to keep his jaw from dropping buthow he began mical shrugged healer crathach is my second cousin and my uncle knows people who know the princes set im good at putting things together and my gift is touchreading at alberichs puzzled look he explained if i pick up something barehanded and i want to know sometimes i can tell where its been and what its been doing going back to when it was first made he gulped i havent had it working for long not so i could trust it otherwise id have told you alberich blinked again so did kantor i was under the impression that micals gift was fairly unreliable my giftteacher still thinks its unreliable mical continued but in the last moon its been getting a bit more under control and that was when i noticed something if someone has been handling what i pick up very recently and feeling strongly about something its pretty deadaccurate i can pick up bits of what theyve been thinking about when i realized there was something strange about this hurlee team i he flushed i started snooping on you youve been awfully worried lately and youve been doing a lot of repairs on the practice equipment his chin firmed i know this is dangerous you just cracked harrows skull for him and that was just in practice but i still want to help alberich thought about it for a long long moment as the snow fell all about them sealing them off from the rest of the world inside a wall of white curtains all right he said at last come down to the salle with me i will need to measure you and get you armor and your gods be with you mical went off with his measurements taken a set of armor of the approximate size ready for him and an admonishment to say nothing of his speculations not even to his fellows on the team tell them that you are the substitute you may alberich told him if you care to mical just shook his head they arent my yearmates and itll be better coming from you he replied showing a maturity that alberich hadnt expected if you say it theyll just figure you picked the best you could think of if i do itll sound like im boasting it sounded as if young mical had learned a lot more in that glassworks than how to make mirrors and there had not been one single attempt on micals part to suggest some of the stagefighting techniques he had been so enamored with a year ago hed done a great deal of physical growing in the past year too hed gone from weedy adolescent to a young powerhouse with muscles as hard as rocks it was no wonder that he was reputed to be such a demon hurlee player evidently pumping those bellows had been very good for him but as alberich brooded over his solitary supper he was still worried the boy might be big and strong but he was still a boy still three years younger than the rest of the team hed volunteered but did alberich have the right to accept him he thought of poor harrow even now being taken care of by the healers he would be throwing young mical into the middle of a team that was already playing a deadly game theyd had moons of practice at it and mical and eloran didnt but hes been watching kantor reminded him watching isnt the same as playing would mical just end up in a bed next to harrow in the next day or two eloran is getting some special coaching this minute kantor told him this business is half the companions job remember and eloran is a lot faster than harrows companion another shock this was a day full of them i thought all of you were fairly equal oh no not that any of us is the companion equivalent of myste there was a snicker in that and alberich could hardly blame him poor myste by now she was so notorious that selenay just had a page assigned to her to follow around behind her picking up the things she dropped and gathering up the things she put down and forgot well she might forget where she left her spare pair of lenses she never forgot a fact a law or a precedent some of us have different priorities he replied truthfully as do we at any rate eloran is a little nimbler than lekaron with slightly better reactions that should make up for lack of experience but he detected a hint of doubt in kantors mindvoice and oddly enough that comforted him if kantor was having feelings of guilt at least it meant that alberich wasnt being overly nice about this situation theyre terribly young he said gloomily lavan firestorm and his companion werent any older and lavan never got the opportunity to grow any older kantor was silent for a moment lavan never really got the opportunity to volunteer mical did there was that but could someone that young have any real idea of what he was volunteering for bad enough to take the trainees he hadall adolescents to one extent or another thought they were immortal that death was something that happened to someone else the older lot at least were well aware that they could be horribly hurt but fifteenyearolds truly thought that they were immortal yes and invulnerable that even injuries would nod and pass on by and in spite of what hed seen was this truly informed consent when do you trust someone kantor asked seemingly out of the blue excuse me when do you trust someone is it by age or maturity what is the magic number when do trainees start to think like adults he understood what kantor was saying of course and his head agreed with it mical had been there on the worst day the team had experienced hed watched them for two moons at least and hed evidently learned some sobering lessons in the glassworks hed shown every sign of acting in a measured and mature fashion this afternoon so when did alberich stop doubting and start trusting when my gut decides to go along with my head i suppose he replied glumly and my gut is going to be screaming but hes only a child for a little while longer at least he might have said something more but at just that moment a bell rang out cutting across the winter night and for one horrible moment he thought it was the death bell and his thoughts fastened on harrow but no it wasnt it was the great bell at the palacenot the collegium bell that sounded the candlemarks and the meals but the huge deeptoned bell that sounded only for major occasions so what a moment later his question was answered its time its selenay said kantor and given the gravid condition of the queen that was all kantor needed to say selenay had gone into labor by dawn valdemar would have an heirpresumptive and from that moment on the queen would be standing between prince karathanelan and his ambitions alberich shivered it had begun im sorry weaponsmaster mical sighed he pushed the papers away from him and reluctantly alberich took them and folded them up tightly all i get from them is he screwed up his face the writer was in a hurry really annoyed with something and wanted to get this over with i think he was that actor fellowthe one we all thought was sointeresting he paused again then smiled wanly and about the only thing that i can tell you besides that is that he thought the person he was writing to was very very thick alberich sighed it had been a long shot of course hed hoped that somehow the secret instructions from norris to the prince would have some link to the unknown patron butno luck it seemed whoever the patron was norris had not been thinking of him when hed been writing the princes scripts my thanks regardless mical he said he saw mical glancing with longing at the door and he found a bit of sympathy for the boy it was the first fine day inwell since autumn and mical no longer under punishmentduty was probably afire to be out in it go along he hadnt so much as gotten the words out when mical was out the door like a shot frustrating said myste redundantly weve got one end of the pathnorris to karath we have the other devlin to norris but we still dont have the socalled patron who links it all into a neat circle nor will we alberich said with grim certainty i believe it was the same person who was paying for unrest against the queen earlier i even believe it was the same person who was selling information out of the council during the wars and i have my suspicions who that person is unfortunately i do not have a shred of proof he is too clever at covering his tracks and hiding his identity he is probably in disguise most of the time when he deals with underlings this certainty was not true foresight but it came with the scent of foresight on it he would have liked to confide his suspicions to someone who had some other gift that might be used to spy upon this person but unfortunately the suspicion was so wild that he knew that even the heralds would have stared at him with incredulity yes even talamir even myste even perhaps most of the companions but not me said kantor with equal certainty so you and i will watch and wait and bide our timequietly well catch him eventually so all we can do is keep a guard on selenay myste asked mournfully it seems so he replied she sighed i wish i could tell her he said to his companion you can when its over kantor replied youre used to keeping secrets and that alas was only too true it was just too bad that selenay had not realized that little fact before all of this had begun and had confided in him rather thanwellwhoever she had who had been so poor at keeping them selenay tried to concentrate on the reports in front of her but her eyes kept drifting to the window and her thoughts drifting off into nothingness it was only two moons since the babys birth two moons spring was just beginning outside those windows and she was stuck inside and when she managed to wrench her eyes and her thoughts back to the job at hand an angry wail from the next room cut across her concentration and she winced and shoved down the surge of angry irritation that made her want to go into the nursery and put a pillow over baby elspeths face and immediately she felt sick with guilt horrible thought she was a horrible mother how could she think such things about the baby she should have been all moonyeyed and willing to bear with anything she should be longing to hold elspeth to cradle her for hours and hours she should be spending every waking moment hovering over the cradle gazing down at the little mite with adoration instead she had thoughts of wanting to smother the poor thing she was unfit to be a mother she should never have had a child thats not a child caryo said testily its a stomach with a warhorn attached to one end and a mechanism that produces more excrement than a fullgrown cow attached to the other selenay was glad that there wasnt anyone in the room to see her as she choked on a laugh there was some truth to that though selenay herself seldom had to attend to the latter still the former elspeths wails scaled up a notch selenays own nurse old melidy was in charge of the nursery but she seemed to have her hands full with elspeth who had an awfully robust set of lungs for something so small and the need to demand attention constantly do all babies cry so much at least baby elspeths demands were reasonable milk comfort a clean napkin unlike her father selenays irritation increased as did her headache hed been pouting again this morning he didnt even have to say anything anymore just pout and look aggrieved and putupon his pouts didnt seem quite so attractive anymore either and his bereftorphan pose was beginning to look a great deal more like a pose than like her own real grief she knew what true mourning looked like from the inside andwell all his protestations to the contrary it had begun to look to her as if his fathers death and brothers estrangement were things he really didnt feel deeply about if at all oh come now said her conscience you cant blame him for wanting to be a king now that his brother is king of rethwellan and hes been thoroughly agreeable since elspeth was born didnt he say he had sent for his old nurse for her so that old melidy wouldnt have to do all the lookingafter by herself and with two chief nursery attendants on the job there shouldnt be any more of this howling while youre trying to get some work done agreeable he might be but she couldnt help the feeling that it was all on the surface he certainly wasnt about whenever something needed doing when they retired for the evening and she wanted to tell him about the annoyances of the day just to get them off her chest he would launch off into some hunting story or other ignoring her hints that another topicany other topicwould be welcome and what had happened to karath the lover all very well to speak tenderly of wanting to give her plenty of time to recover from elspeths birth but just how long did he think she needed besides it wouldnt hurt her to be held and comforted now and again she could do with more of the commiseration about the burdens of the crown that he used to give her and less complaining that he wanted the crown himself hes the father of your child she reminded herself though as elspeths wails turned into distinctly angry howls that was seeming less and less of a good thing finally just when she thought that her head was going to split she heard the sound of feet running into the nursery and the howls cut offand lest she worry that someone else had put a pillow over the babys face she heard suckling and cooing noises the wet nurse had been found it seemed her highness was now satisfied if only his highness could be satisfied so easily she sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose to try and ease the pain in her head demands for attention demands for service wanting everything now this moment totally selfcentered perfectly reasonable in an infant not so attractive in her father and unfortunately at this late date he was unlikely to grow out of it things seemed dreadfully clear all of a suddenwhen she wasnt looking into those beautiful eyes and listening to that honeysweet voice whispering in her ear when she had been sleeping alone for far too long when she realized that the demands were never ever going to stop and she began to understand caryos antipathy to himand wonder which karath was the real one what was i thinking she thought with despair what have i done she dropped her head into her hands and for a moment gave way to the despair she who had been afraid of being trapped had trapped herself she was trapped within the hard shell of the crown trapped with an infant she had not really planned for trapped with a husband who was face it selenaywho is beginning to look like someone who put on a show for you she wanted suddenly to get away away from the palace away from the crown not forever just for a few candlemarks where she could be just selenay not the queen not a mother just herself she needed to be able to think clearly and she couldnt even think at all with the baby fussing in the next room something had changed between her and karath she needed to figure out what it was and somehow get things back to the way they had been before that terrible quarrel if she could she had to think about that too she had to be able to step back from the whole situation and try to look at it objectively as if this was selenay sitting in judgment in the city courts if only she could go somewhere that held no memories of the prince where she could be herself entirely again the selenay she used to be ill do it to the seven hells with these reports they can wait a few candlemarks more she pushed away from her desk and stood up caryo would you be amenable to a ride to the home farms just the two of us this was the best day for practice that they had gotten in a long time spring rains hadnt yet begun the ground was good and dry and although the air was chill it was not cold enough to be uncomfortable even if you werent moving alberich watched his teams as they writhed in a knot of flying sticks and flailing bodies the view was excellent from the sidelines and he allowed himself a moment of grim satisfaction they were good and they were ready he had believed in them and they had repaid that belief in full even young mical that most unlikely of prodigals the boy had flung himself into his selfappointed niche with the controlled energy of a tightlywound spring and a concentration alberich suspected he never would have had if he had not spent those moons in the glassworks you dared not lose your concentration around hot glass for if you did the best you could expect was the total ruin of all your work and the worstthe worst could cost a limb or a life or worse than just your life if you were a glassblower he didnt know if the collegium healers could do anything about scorched lungs before the patient died of the injury he did know that it was one of the nastier and more painful ways to die although no such disaster had occurred at the glassworks while the two trainees had been serving their time there mical had probably been witness to several minor accidents and certainly had been told all of the horror stories it was amazing to see the level of steadiness and concentration he had attained it was nevertheless true that steadiness and concentration couldnt make up for a difference of three years of age and growth the boy was not the most skilled of the skirmishers although in the normal hurlee games mical was a star player in these practices he was merely at the level of all the others still given that they were three years older than he and had several moons of learning and practice that he hadnt had that was absolutely astonishing part of it alberich was sure was a natural ability in combat or exercises that were combatlike alberich had taught a few youngsters who possessed that nearmagical combination of reflexes strength coordination cleverness and the instinct for combat mical was definitely one of that number take for instance the way that he and eloran worked together moving through the pack smooth as an otter in a fastflowing stream never a wasted moment often managing to anticipate the next blow and thwart it by the simple expedient of not being there when it fell the next blow flash of blue alberich clung to his pommel as the foresight vision slammed him between the eyes selenay but it wasnt a long one it didnt need to be actually he had spent the last several moons anticipating exactly what it showed him all it needed to give him was the where and the when where outside the city walls on the home farms he recognized that spot along the riverbank beyond the point where he and selenay had fished for eels it was secluded there quiet and out of sight of any of the farmworkers when soon too soon moments at most terror rose in him not for us kantor said fiercely before he could even begin to panic as the players suddenly froze in place their companions relaying to them what alberich and kantor already knew weapons cried harrow no time shouted someone else and suddenly they were all in motion alberich and kantor in the lead flying across the grass leaping obstacles scattering trainees and courtiers out of their way and out of the main palace gate before alberich even had time to think about what they were doing they knew how did they know nono they didnt knowor hadnt known consciously before this moment but the peak of readiness they had attained was such that at this point they had been ready for anything warn caryo he told kantor urgentlyand needlessly of course ithe traps sprung dont panic we can get there in time and with grim satisfaction they werent expecting her to fight alberich had his sword for even in the hurlee practices he never left the salle without putting it in a saddle sheath the teams however had no weapons but they did have their modified hurlee sticks special sticks sheathed in metal of a wood so hard they called it ironwood so dense and tough that even without the metal sheath it dulled blades that tried to cut it and they were all in their fitted armor which alberich had insisted they wear as soon as it was available and the companions were armored in all the time that alberich had been a herald he had not understood what it was like to be in the saddle when kantor was at full gallop he had heard about the extraordinary speed of a companion but he had never fully experienced it for himself when kantor had rescued him from the burning shed and carried him out of karse he had been drifting in and out of awareness it was exhilarating and terrifying already the troop was down in the crowded streets of haven and the houses and shops blurred past as the hapless bystanders pressed themselves against the walls in an effort to get as far out of the way as possible somehow the crowds were parting before them like a school of minnows in front of a pike thank the sunlord being in the lead as he was he could see them making way as if something invisible was shoving them to either side of the street ahead just in time to avoid being trampled but if someone didnt get out of the way in time they will you leave that to us somewhere behind them the palace and collegia were aboil of course only he and his teams had been instantly ready to respond but the rest every man and woman who was in whites and no few in grays were scrambling to join the rescue getting weapons saddling upsome like keren probably not even bothering with a saddle how did that bastard know the vision had shown him the prince and a mob of his hangerson how had he known that selenay would be there and alone when even he hadnt known shed left the palace he must have had a small army of watchers on the palace waiting for her to leave under exactly the right circumstances following her to see where she went sending back the message he had been waiting for this was not spurofthemoment or something conceived in passion this had been long in the planning probably from the moment he came into valdemar or else someone else had planned it all for him no time to think about that now he had to try and remember what the vision had shown him swiftly as swiftly as kantor was running he worked out a rough plan theyd have to be fools not to expect rescue coming from the heralds but they wouldnt be looking for it so soon alarm bells were sounding all over the city if the prince had thought he was going to be able to carry this off quietly he was going to get more than one rude surprise at least the alarms had the effect of clearing the streets entirely kantor somehow redoubled his speed and they shot through the gates going at such a rate that even alberich was dizzy and he was not going to think about what would happen if any of them tripped and fell there was no finesse in this down the road in at the gates of the home farms riders clutching their weapons in grim silence hooves pounding like thunderso loud they couldnt hear the fighting ahead of them so loud that the ambushers surely thought it was thunder and they didnt even pause as they sighted their target just as the team had been taught just as they had practiced for moons and moons they crashed in among the milling ambushers exactly as if it was a hurlee skirmish they broke into the mob around selenay and their sticks went to work in that first and last glimpse alberich got the sudden heartsinking realization that there were more of them than he had thought there would be or than he had seen a lot more the odds were roughly twotoone in fact hard on the heels of that realization was anotherhe hadnt heard about this down in the rough parts of haven because the prince hadnt needed to recruit anyone for this plan hed brought them with him in the guise of servants of hangerson of sycophants and last of alleven as he raised his stick and kantor ran straight into the horse of one of these pseudoservants he looked up and saw selenay lose her sword to norris norris who had regarded women as mere objects of convenience and would no more hesitate to kill her than he would hesitate to kill a fly there was a bulwark of fighters three deep between him and her there was no way he could fight his way to her in time and that was when he saw the incredible the miraculous the totally insane eloran coming in at full gallop from the side where there was no one in the way crashing into norris horse just as mical rose in his stirrups pushed off and with the momentum of elorans charge behind him flung himself out of his saddle at norris somehow he wrapped his arms around the actor when he hit pinning norris sword to his side as they tumbled out of the saddle to the ground somehow he managed to stay uppermost they went over the side of the horse and out of sight selenay took advantage of the moment of confusion that followed to get caryo a little farther into the open where the companions hooves came into play that cleared a little more space for her to fight and as alberichs stick connected with the man in front of him kantor shoved through to her side here he shouted and tossed his sword hiltfirst at her here alberich he heard from somewhere below and as kantor pirouetted on his hindlegs mical thrust a sword up at him from the ground hilt first doing so lefthanded holding his right tight to his belly norris wasnt moving so the blade was presumably the actors alberich snatched it and mical scrambled out of the way eloran rammed his way in beside his chosen and even onehanded mical was able to haul himself back up into the saddle from the way he was holding that arm however he wasnt going to be a further factor in the fighting then it all stopped having anything to do with thought as the mob closed in around them again and he and selenay fought sidebyside against the tightening circle kantor kept himself interposed as much as he could between the fighters and caryo he was armored caryo was not norris sword wasnt much better than a hurlee stick but at least it had a pointed end and not a blunt one and that was just about all that alberich had time to think about then for what seemed like forever it was all shouting blow and counterblow screams and blood and lastminute parries and far too many people trying to kill his queen until suddenly the fighting melted away from in front of him and those who were not on the ground groaning or dead were in full retreat as the reinforcements came pounding up on their companions with swords in their hands and rage on their faces and it was at that moment that he looked down and realized that the last man he had bludgeoned to death with that pathetic excuse for a sword was the prince he had not even known who it was he was fighting mical had a broken wrist there were some slices and cuts to the others but his was probably the most serious injury alberich could have wept with relief his gamble of putting them into armor had worked for the princes ambushers had foolishly worn none at all mical had done the impossible and norris phenomenal luck had run out just before the princes had for when mical had hit him and taken him down to the ground he had not been able to compensate for his attackers weight all of his agility and training had after all counted for naught hed broken his neck as they hit the ground together alberich limped over to where crathach was tending to the boy who looked up at him too weary and full of pain to care about much of anything that one of your fool playacting moves was alberich growled yes the boy nodded and practiced it you have been mical hesitated um sort of with a strawman eloran and i didnt think it was really going to work so wed kind of given up on it but when we came up on the ambush and saw norris with selenay he shrugged and hissed with pain i knew i couldnt fight him its not just stagefighting he knows and hes better than me the important thing was to immobilize him long enough for you to get to her he would have said more but alberich held up his hand enough good reasoning right action never do it again your neck broken it could have been not his mical turned a bit green and not from the pain alberich didnt blame him this was his first kill and it had literally been with his bare hands not an easy thing for a boy of fifteen to cope with alberich turned on his heel and left him with crathach who was better suited to helping him deal with the emotional ramifications than the weaponsmaster himself was alberich went to find the rest of his team make sure they were all right and if not see that they were under someones wing before he went looking for the queen he found harrow last of all the boy was staring down at one of the ambushers bodies running his hands reflexively up and down the hurlee stick just as alberich came up to him he looked at his hands and realized what he was doing with an expression of repulsion he threw the thing away i am never playing again he said to alberich who nodded understanding all that the youngster could not put into words that it wasnt a game anymore that it would be forever tainted for him that he could never even think of hurlee without knowing that he had killed at least one man with his stick go to see crathach was all he said and then made sure that he did so why do i think that hurlee is now going to fade away into the mists that hold all old fads kantor asked rhetorically oh someone might revive it again when this lot has gone on into whites not until then and thats not a bad thing it wont be such an obsession when it comes around for the second time he personally wouldnt be sorry to see it go the business of the collegia was learning after all not gamesmanship and there were other ways to teach teamwork selenay was sitting a little way away under a tree when alberich came up to her talamir was speaking earnestly to her in a low voice alberich caught the name norris and the word script before they both looked up at him she had been crying quietly and she rubbed the tears from her face with the back of her hand so it was an act from beginning to end she said bitterly every bit of it tailored precisely to you majesty alberich agreed since she seemed to be waiting for a reply sorry i am i dont want your pity she snapped then wilted damn i apologize its not your fault and i probably wouldnt have listened to you before the tears started again she seemed unaware of them its not fair im glad you killed him majesty i am not alberich replied and she looked up at him startled in death he has escaped the consequences of his actions and left you to deal with them i am not glad and what his majesty of rethwellan will say and do i know not leave that to me talamir said instantly although given not only what karath claimed but what my agents have verified for me there was definitely no love lost between the king of rethwellan and his brother he brooded a moment no no love lost at all he seems to have beenmore welcome in his absence than his presence and it was not by his doing that he was not told of his own fathers death until it was long past the moment when he could have been recalled for the funeral alberich nodded that wasnt much of a surprise so king faramentha not so displeased to hear of this will be talamir shrugged i believe that if we are discreet or as discreet as we may be having roused all of haven this will probably be no more than a matter of some delicate maneuvering in fact i suspect it will be of more import that it is clear that we do not hold his majesty responsible for his brothers actions than that wewere forced to eliminate a prince of rethwellan alberich caught a little movement from the corner of his eye selenay was staring at him and when i think of what youve been doing so quietly all this time alberichand to think that at one point i thought you were just jealous because he was as good a swordsman as you and that was why you werent up at the palace anymoreyoure she was about to say it he cut her off selenay no hero am i he told her firmly but gently for heroes look to young mical who i think was certain he would be killed when the actor he attacked or myste who is no great dissembler and could not have herself defended had norris discovered her intent if you are no hero then what are you she demanded he managed a smilethe first genuine smile he had felt on his face since shed married your weaponsmaster your herald and he held out his hand i hope your friend and brother nothing more she took it and looked long and hard at him and he knew then that at one point she herself must have had something of a crush on him now long pastbut that she was afraid that he might now be the one with secret feelings for her it wouldnt have been the first time such a thing had happened he was just as glad that the whole notion was so absurd i always wanted a brother growing up she said aloud and let go of his hand good he smiled again then if my advice you will take you will make of myste and mical great heroes and let your shadow herald stay where best he is suited and i will second that talamir agreed and gave alberich a look that the weaponsmaster had no trouble interpreting you can go now hmph we know when we arent welcome dont be absurd he chided kantor do you really want her weeping and raging at us then do you want to be embroiled in the political maneuvering this is going to cause well kantor admitted no good he scratched his head encountered a patch of someone elses dried blood in his hair and grimaced i want a bath lets go home i may never forgive you myste said her head on his shoulder it was the first time shed been in his quarters since the rescue and he was mortally glad to have her there he would be even gladder to have her in his bedbut not quite yet for now it was enough to have her in his arms for telling selenay to make you a hero he asked amused and shifted a little on the couch so that his position was a little more comfortable someone has to be but why me she demanded because you earned it he replied staring into the stainedglass face of vkandis sunlord because people need heroes but primarily because you are the least likely hero i can think of well there i agree with you but wouldnt that hear me out he interrupted people need heroes and heralds are that but heralds arent very ordinary hmm she did think about it i see your point most of them are athletic and even if they arent handsome the whites at least make them look distinguished but you my dear chronicler represent someone who is just like them or like people they know and you went and did something very dangerous something that your whites would not protect you from something that not even your companion could have protected you from hmm she pushed her lenses up on her nose i see your point and mical everyone likes to have heroes who are young handsome and a touch reckless he laughed it wont spoil him he knows if he gets too much above himself its back to the glassworks for another couple of moons she chuckled to think all this began over a broken mirror isnt that supposed to mean bad luck it was bad luck he pointed out for norris and karathanelan because if it hadnt been for norris the mirror would never have gotten broken in the first place she fell silent then leaving him alone with his thoughts comforting as it was to think that they had closed the circle he knew that this was not in the least the case someone had been karathanelans patron and norris someone who was high in court circles and privy to some very personal information about selenay and they still didnt know who that was no the game wasnt over yet and if or when that person was uncovered there would without a doubt be more troubles on the way but at least for a little while there would be some breathing space and in the end that was all anyone herald or queen or ordinary citizen could ask for now he breathed into her hair would you like to find out how a hero is rewarded her response was everything he could have wished forand he knew that for a few marks at least the world would be completely all right for both of them it would not remain that way for long but it was enough that it remain that way for now
