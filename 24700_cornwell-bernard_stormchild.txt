stormchild by bernard cornwell stormchild is for art and maggie taylor part one the sea was weeping it was a gray sea being kicked into life by a sudden wind a sea being torn into raggedness and flecked white the fishermen called it a weeping sea and claimed it presaged disaster it wont last my wife joanna spoke of the seas sudden spite the two of us were standing on the quay of our boatyard watching the black clouds fly up the english channel it was the late afternoon of good friday yet the air temperature felt like november and the bitter gray sea looked like january the deteriorating weather had inevitably brought out the windsurfers whose bright sails scudded through the gloom and bounced dangerously across the broken waters of the estuarys bar where the high bows of a returning fishing boat battered the sea into windslavered ruin our own boat a contessa called slipslider jerked and pitched and thudded against her fenders on the outer pontoon beneath our quay it cant last joanna insisted in her most robust voice as though she could enforce decent easter weather by sheer willpower itll get worse before it gets better i said with idle pessimism so we wont sail tonight joanna said more usefully but well surely get away at dawn tomorrow we had been planning a night passage to guernsey where joannas sister lived and where after church on easter morning my wifes family would sit down to roast lamb and new potatoes the easter family reunion had become a tradition and that year joanna and i had been looking forward to it with a special relish for it seemed we had both at last recovered from the tragedies of our sons death and our daughters disappearance time might not have completely healed those twin wounds but it had layered them over with skins of tough scar tissue and joanna and i were aware of ordinary happinesses once again intruding on what had been a long period of mourning and bafflement life in short was becoming normal and being normal it presented its usual crop of problems our biggest immediate problem was a damaged fourandahalfton yawl which had been standing ready to be launched when our cranedriver had rammed it with the jib of his machine the damage was superficial merely some mangled guardrails and a nasty gash in the hulls gelcoat but the yawls owner a petulant obstetrician from basingstoke was driving to the yard next lunchtime and expected to find his boat launched rigged and ready billy our foreman had offered to stay and make good the damage but billy was already covering for my absence over the easter weekend and i had been unhappy about adding to his workload so the ill wind that had made the sea weep at least blew billy some good for i sent him home to his new wife while i towed the big yawl into the shed where wind and rain rattled the corrugated tin roof as i stripped out the damage under the big lamps i planned the next mornings sail as i worked if the marine forecast was right and this sudden hard weather abated we could leave the river at daybreak and endure an hour of foul tide before the ebb swept us past the anvil and out into midchannel we would make guernsey in time for supper and the only possible inconvenience in our revised plans was the probability that the visitors marina in st peters port would be filled by the time of our arrival and we would have to find a mooring in the outer harbor as night fell it seemed improbable that the weather would relent by dawn the shrieking wind was flaying the river with white foam the gale was strong enough to persuade some of the sailing club members to borrow our launch and tow a gaggle of the clubs dinghies off the midstream buoys and into the shelter of our pontoons joanna helped them then spent two hours bringing the boatyard accounts up to date before braving the filthy weather to fetch two bags of cod and chips from the high street it was while she was gone that harry carstairs phoned thank god youre still there carstairs greeted me i thought you might have gone away for easter carstairs was a yacht broker who worked out of an airconditioned office in londons mayfair his clients were not the smallboat sailors who were my bread and butter but rather the hyperrich who could afford professional skippers at the helm naked starlets on the foredeck and strollon strolloff berths in monte carlo our yards normal business was much too paltry for carstairss expensive trade but that year joanna and i happened to have a great steelhulled sloop for sale and though at over a hundred and fifty thousand pounds stormchild was at the very upper range of our stock she barely scraped in at the slum end of harrys business ive got a likely client who wants to look at the beast tomorrow he told me in his champagne and caviar accent is that all right with you i hesitated before answering of late as our life returned to normal joanna and i had discussed buying stormchild for ourselves we had dreamed of selling our house hiring a manager to look after the yard then sailing away to far white beaches and exotic harbors stormchild would have been the perfect boat to make those dreams come true but the trouble was they were only dreams not plans and i knew we were not ready to make the change just as i knew i could not pass up a proper offer for the big steel boat stormchilds still here i reluctantly told carstairs and the yards open from eight until six so help yourself to a viewing you can get stormchilds keys from my foreman his names billy and ill make sure he puts some heat into the boat the customer will be with you at middayharry ignored everything i had saidand hell try to knock you down to a hundred and ten but i told him you wouldnt go a penny below onethirty hang on i protested angrily it was not the suggested price that was making me bridle but rather harrys bland assumption that i would be available to show stormchild to his customer ill be halfway to the channel islands by midday tomorrow why cant you show the boat yourself because i shall be in majorca selling a tripledecked whorehouse to a sheik of araby harry said carelessly then after a deliberately worrying pause ok tim if you dont want to sell your sloop what about that big german yawl at cobbs quay do you know if shes still available sod you i growled thus provoking an evil chuckle from harry who knew joanna and i should never have taken stormchild onto our brokerage list the big yacht was out of our league but she was an estate sale and the widow was an old friend of the family and we had been unable to refuse her request that we look after the sale out of sentimentality we had even waived our brokerage fee but not even that concession had shifted the big sloop off our jackstands and thus for over a year now stormchilds fiftytwofoot hull had taken up precious space in our yard and she looked like she would be staying for at least another year unless we found a buyer who was immune to britains skyhigh interest rates harry carstairs knew just how desperately i needed to make room in my cramped yard which was why he was so blithely confident that i would change my easter plans for a few seconds i contemplated letting billy handle the london lawyer but i knew my foreman was neither good at nor happy with such negotiations which meant i would have to stay and deal with the sale myself ok harryi resigned myself to the inevitableill be here good man tim the customers name is john miller got it hes a more than the usually poisonous lawyer but hes rich of course which is why i promise im not wasting your time i put the phone down and ducked into the pouring rain to see if joanna had returned the streetlights on the far side of the river shook and danced their reflections in the black water and i thought i saw a moving shadow silhouetted against one of those liquid spears the movement seemed to be on board slipslider and i assumed joanna must have taken our supper down into the contessas cozy cabin jo i shouted toward the shadow the yard gate clanged shut behind me im here joanna ran through the pelting rain to the shelter of the yards office come and eat while its hot just a minute i turned on the yards security lights rain sliced past the yellow lamps but otherwise nothing untoward moved on the waverocked pontoons and i guessed the shadow by slipslider had been my imagination or perhaps one of the dozen stray cats that had taken up residence in the yard what is it joanna asked me from the office doorway nothing i killed the lights but still gazed toward the rainhammered river where at the midstream buoys that the sailing club had emptied at dusk i now thought i could see a big dark yacht moored but the smeared afterimage of the bright security lights blurred my sight and made me uncertain whether i was seeing true or just imagining shadows in the darkness i went to the office and told joanna about harrys prospective customer and we agreed that the opportunity of selling the big yacht was too good to pass up the widow of stormchilds owner was feeling the pinch and in consequence we were feeling responsible that guilt was unreasonable for the state of the economy was the fault of the bloody politicians but reasonable or not that guilt meant i would have to sacrifice this weekends family reunion in an effort to sell the boat joanna offered to stay as well but i knew how eagerly she was looking forward to easter day so i encouraged her to sail alone to guernsey perhaps you can get a flight joanna suggested though without much optimism for she knew that the chance of finding a spare seat to the channel islands on an easter saturday flight was remote but look on the bright side joanna said wickedly because now youve got no reason not to hear your brothers easter sermon oh christ i hadnt thought of that my brother david rural dean in the local diocese and rector of our parish church frequently complained that while he often patronized my place of work i rarely patronized his davids muscular christianity was not entirely to my taste but thanks to a london lawyer it looked as if i would have to grin and bear a dose this easter i left joanna with the accounts and went back to finish the yawls repairs as i ran across the yard i noted that the midstream buoys were empty which meant that the big yacht i thought i had seen there must have been a figment of my imagination which made sense for no one in their right mind would have slipped and gone to sea in the teeth of this vicious wind the weather seemed to be worsening making a mockery of the marine forecasts promise of a fair morning but joanna more trusting than i went home at nine oclock to get a good nights sleep before her early start when i followed her up the hill three hours later the gale was still blowing the sky ragged yet when the alarm woke me before dawn the wind had indeed veered westerly and lost its spitting venom i told you so joanna said sleepily did you finish the yawl i nodded the buggerll never know it was hit she opened the bedroom window and sniffed the wind its going to be a fast crossing she said happily joanna had grown up in guernsey where she had learned to sail as naturally as other children learned to ride a bicycle she relished strong winds and hard seas and anticipating that this day would bring her a fast wet channel crossing all spray and dash and thumping seas she was eager to get under way i cooked joannas breakfast then drove her down to the river she was dressed in oilies while her redgold hair beaded by a light shower sprang in a stiff undisciplined mop from the edges of her yellow woolen watch hat she suddenly looked so young that for an instant her eager face cruelly reminded me of our daughter nicole you look miserable joanna catching sight of my expression called from the cockpit i knew better than to mention nicole so invented another reason for my apparent misery i just wish i was coming with you i wish you were too she said in her nononsense voice which acknowledged we could do nothing to change the days fate but you cant so be nice to the london lawyer instead of course ill be nice to him i said irritably why of course you usually growl at customers you dont like and ive yet to meet a lawyer you dont treat like something you scrape off a shoe joanna laughed then blew me a kiss perhaps i should stay and make the sale i smiled and shook my head ill be good to the bastard i promised her then i released slipsliders bowline and shoved her off the pontoon give me a call when you arrive i will and go to davids sermon and eat properly lots of salad and vegetables joanna had released the stern line and put the engine in gear love you love you i called back and i was struck again by joannas sudden resemblance to our daughter then after a last blown kiss she turned to look down river to where the channel waves crashed white on the estuarys bar i watched her hoist the sails before a gray squall of sudden hard rain hid slipslider and made me run for the shelter of my car i drove to a lorry drivers cafe on the bypass where they made a proper breakfast of blood pudding eggs fried bread bacon sausage kidneys mushrooms and tomatoes all mopped up with bread and butter and washed down with tea strong enough to strip paint by the time i opened the yard for business the rain had eased and a watery sun was glossing the river where one by one the boats hoisted their sails and slapped out toward the boisterous sea i stripped the tarpaulins from stormchilds decks and jealously thought how joanna would be sailing slipslider sharp into the wind slicing the gray seas white while i swept stormchilds topsides clean then put two industrial heaters into her cabins to take the winters lingering chill out of her hull the london lawyer turned up an hour late for his appointment he was a young man no more than thirty yet he had clearly done well for himself for he arrived in a big bmw and before climbing out he ostentatiously used the car phone so that we peasants would realize he possessed such a thing but we were more inclined to notice the girl who accompanied him for she was a tall willowy model type who unfolded endless legs from the car the lawyer finished his telephone call then climbed out to greet me he was wearing a designer oilskin jacket with a zipin float liner and a builtin safety harness tim blackburn he held out his hand im blackburn i confirmed im john miller this is mandy mandy gave me a limp hand to shake youre quite famous arent you she greeted me am i daddy says you are he says you won lots of races is that right a long time ago i said dismissively i had been one of the last englishmen to win the singlehanded atlantic race before the french speedsleds made the contest a gallic preserve then for a brief period i had held the record for sailing nonstop and singlehanded round the world those accomplishments hardly accorded me rockstar status but among sailors my name still rang a faint bell daddy says it was impressive anyway the girl said with airy politeness then gazed up at the deepkeeled stormchild which was cradled by massive metal jackstands golly isnt it huge you must stop saying that to me the lawyer who was no more than five foot two inches tall guffawed at his own wit then sternly told me he had expected to find the boat in the water with her mast stepped and sails bent on hardly at this time of yeari was remembering joannas instruction to be nice to this little man and thus kept my voice very patient and calmthe seasons scarcely begun and no one puts a boat in the water until they need to besides i went on blithely i thought youd appreciate seeing the state of her hull there is that of course he said grudgingly though i doubted he would have noticed if the hull had been a ratinfested maze of rust holes john miller clearly did not know boats and that ignorance made him palpably impatient as i ran down the list of stormchilds virtues those virtues were many the yacht had been custom built for an experienced and demanding owner who had wanted a boat sturdy enough for the worst seas yet comfortable enough to live aboard for months at a time the result was a massive heavy boat as safe as any cruising yacht in the world with a powerful brute of a turbocharged diesel deep in her belly but stormchild was also a pretty boat with fine lines a graceful rig and decks and coach roofs handsomely planked in the finest teak which is why i told the lawyer a little too brusquely id be grateful if you took off your street shoes before climbing aboard miller scowled at my request but nevertheless slipped off his expensive brogues mandy who had begun to shiver in the unseasonably cold wind discarded her stiletto heels before tiptoeing up the wooden boarding stairs and stepping down into stormchilds cockpit shes ever so pretty mandy said gallantly the lawyer ignored her he was peering at the cockpit instrument display and pretending that he understood what he was seeing youll take a hundred thousand he challenged me suddenly dont be so bloody silly i snapped back my anger was piqued by the knowledge that stormchild was horribly underpriced even at a hundred and fifty thousand pounds and i felt another twinge of regret that joanna and i were not ready to buy her miller had bridled at my flash of temper but controlled his own perhaps because i was at least fourteen inches taller than him or perhaps because my fading fame carried with it a reputation for having a difficult temperament one tabloid newspaper had called me the solo seadog who bites which was unfair for i simply had the prickly facade that often conceals a chronic shyness to which i added an honest mans natural dislike of all lawyers frauds pimps politicians and bureaucrats and this lawyer despite his pristine foulweather gear was plainly a prick of the first order we were thinking of keeping her in the medmiller tapped the compass as though it was a barometeri suppose you can deliver her it might be possible i said though my tone implied there could be vast difficulties in such a delivery for eager as i was to sell stormchild i was not at all certain that her proper fate was to become a flashy toy to impress millers friends and clients stormchild was a very serious boat and i loved boats enough not to want this beautifully built craft to degenerate in the hands of a careless owner if its a warmweather vacation boat that you want i said as tactfully as i could then perhaps you ought to think about a fiberglass hull they need much less maintenance and they offer better insulation there are plenty of people willing to do maintenance work in the med the lawyer said unpleasantly and we can always bung some air conditioners into her my flash of temper had clearly not discouraged the little runt so i tried warning him that cooling a boat the size of stormchild would be an expensive business let me worry about expense miller said then bared his teeth in a grimace that i could if i chose translate as a smile in my line of work blackburn i occasionally need to impress a client and you dont do that by being cheap surely the best way to impress clients is to keep them out of jail i suggested he gave a scornful bark of laughter good god man im not a criminal lawyer christ no i negotiate property deals between the city and japan its quite specialized work actually he insinuated correctly that i would not understand the specialization but the japanese are pathetically impressed by big white boatshe glanced at his shivering girlfriendand by the girls that go with them mandy giggled while i suppressing an urge to wring millers neck took him below decks to show off the impressive array of instruments that were mounted above stormchilds navigation table miller dismissed my description of the satnav decca radar and weatherfax saying that his marine surveyor would attend to such details miller himself was more interested in the boats comforts which though somewhat lacking in gloss nevertheless met his grudging approval he especially liked the aft master cabin where warmed by one of my big industrial heaters mandy had stretched her lithe length across the double berths kingsize mattress hello sailor she greeted miller oh jolly good miller was clearly anticipating the effect that mandys lissome beauty would have on his japanese clients will you take a hundred and ten he suddenly demanded of me he had obviously smelled that stormchild was a bargain and i felt a terrible sadness for i knew that once the boat had been used as the sweetener on a few deals and once miller had made his fortune from those deals she would be left to rot in some stagnant backwater why dont you take a good look at the other cabins i said with as much patience as i could muster then we can negotiate a price in my office would you like some coffee waiting for you decaffeinated he ordered imperiously with skim milk and an artificial sweetener i planned to give him powdered caffeine laced with condensed milk and white sugar the coffee will be waiting in the office i promised then left them to it billy who had just finished rigging the repaired fourandahalfton yawl ambushed me halfway across the yard his chivalrous concern like that of every other redblooded male in the yard was for the lubricious and goosepimpled mandy bloody hell boss what does she see in the little fucker she sees his wallet billy did you see the fuckers oilskin coat billy asked indignantly it can get very rough on the boating pond in hyde park i said reprovingly then i turned away because a car had just driven past the big sign that read absolutely no unauthorized vehicles beyond this notice and i was readying myself to shout at the driver when i realized that the car was my brothers antique riley theyre not racing today are they billy asked and my own first thought was that david must have come to the yard to launch his racing dinghy my reverend elder brother was a lethal competitor and like others who were addicted to the frail wet discomfort of fragile racing boats he pretended to despise the sybaritic conveniences of longdistance sailors like myself you mean you have a lavatory on that barge he would boom at some hapless victim you pee in windless comfort do you next you will inform me that you have a cooking stove on board you do then why not just stay in some luxury hotel dear boy youre not taking your eggshell out in this wind are you i greeted david as he opened the rileys door then i saw he could not possibly be thinking of taking out the for he was wearing his dog collar and cassock and even davids mild eccentricities did not extend to sailing in full clerical rig instead he was dressed ready for the afternoons easter weddings and i supposed he had come to inveigle me into buying him a pub lunch before he performed his splicing duties then the passenger door of the riley opened and another man climbed out it is at that point just as brian callendar climbs out of davids car that my memory of that easter weekend becomes like some dark and sinister film that is played over and over in my head it is a film that i constantly want to change as if by rewriting its action or dialogue i can miraculously change the films ending brian callendar comes toward me he is an acquaintance rather than a friend and he is also a detective sergeant in the county police force and there is something about his face and about davids face behind him which suggests that the two men have not come to the boatyard for pleasure the rileys engine is still running and its front doors have been left open i remember how the wind was whirling woodshavings out of the carpenters shop and across the sloping cobbles of the boatyards ramp tim callendar said in a very forced voice i am still smiling but there is something about the policemans voice which tells me that i wont be smiling again for a very long time tim callendar says again and i want the film to stop i so badly want the film to stop but it wont david took my elbow and walked me down to the pontoon where he stood beside me as callendar told me that a yacht had exploded in midchannel some wreckage had been found and amongst that wreckage was a yellow horseshoe life buoy with the name slipslider painted in black letters i stared at the policeman no i said i was incapable of saying anything else no a dutch cargo ship saw it happen mr blackburn callendar as befitted a bringer of bad news had slipped into a stilted formality they say it was a bad explosion no the word was more than a denial it was a protest davids hand was still on my elbow church bells were clamorous in the town foretelling the afternoons weddings callendar paused to light a cigarette there are no survivors mr blackburn he said at last at least none they could find the dutch boat has been looking and the navy sent a helicopter but all theyre finding is wreckage and not much of that either no i was staring blindly at the river who was on board mr blackburn i turned to look into the policemans eyes but i could not speak was it joanna david sounded uncomfortable as he always did when raw emotions extruded above the calm surface of life but he also sounded heartbroken for he knew exactly who would have been sailing slipslider the question still had to be asked was joanna aboard i nodded there was a thickening in my throat i wanted to turn and walk away as though i could deny this conversation i looked back to callendar to see if he was joking i even half smiled hoping that the policeman would smile back and it would all turn out to be a bad joke was anyone else aboard mr blackburn callendar asked me instead i shook my head just joanna i was shaking nothing was real the world had slipped its gears in a second david would laugh and slap my back and everything would be normal again except david did no such thing but just looked stricken and unhappy and embarrassed oh jesus i said i had given up smoking fifteen years before but i took the cigarette from callendars fingers and dragged on it i supposed that either the navy or the dutch boat had called the coastguard with slipsliders name and the coastguard would have looked in their cardindex and discovered that i was slipsliders owner then they would have called the police and callendar being on friendly terms with me would have volunteered for this horrid duty but he had first recruited david to help him oh jesus i said again then threw the foultasting cigarette into the river when i asked when did it happen not that it mattered but all i had left now were questions which would try to turn tragedy into sense just after nine oclock this morning callender said but nothing made sense nothing except the slow realization that my joanna was dead and i began to cry the film goes scratchy then scratchy and fragmented i didnt want to watch the film yet night after night it would show itself to me until i was crying again or drunk or usually both i remember telling the london lawyer and his girl to fuck off i remember david pouring brandy into me then taking me to his home where his wife betty began to cry david had to leave and marry three couples so betty and i sat in the cheerless comfort of their childless home while the church bells rang a message of joy into the windscoured air the first reporters sniffed the stench of carrion and phoned the rectory in an effort to discover my whereabouts betty denied my presence but when david came back from his weddings a group of pressmen waylaid him at the rectory gate he told them to go to hell i felt i was already in that fiery pit david more comfortable with actions than emotions tried to find a mechanical reason for joannas death he wondered if there had been a leak of cooking gas on slipslider but i shook my head we had a gas alarm installed joanna insisted on it alarms dont always work david said as though that would comfort me does it matter i asked i only wanted to cry first my son had been killed then nicole had disappeared and now joanna i could not believe she was dead somehow hopelessly i thought joanna might still be alive for the next few days i fiercely tried to imagine that she had been blown clear of the exploding boat and was still swimming in the channel i knew it was a stupidly impossible scenario but i convinced myself she would somehow be safe even when they found joannas remains i tried to convince myself that it was not her it was of course and when the pathologists were done with what remained of my wife the undertakers put the scraps in a bag then into a coffin and afterward they made up the coffins weight with sand before david buried her in the cemetery high on the hill where she and i had used to sit and watch the channel joanna was buried in the same grave as our son dickie who had also died in an explosion just as a year was blossoming into new life a navy boat scooped up what remained of slipslider and the wreckage was brought ashore and examined by forensic scientists who confirmed what the pathologists had already deduced from their examination of joannas remains my wife had been killed by a bomb i remember gaping at sergeant brian callendar when he told me that news and i again tried to deny the undeniable no no im sorry tim its true there was not much physical wreckage for the forensic scientists to analyze just the life buoy some shredded cushions from the cockpit a plastic bucket the manoverboard buoy the radar reflector the dinghy one oar the shaft of a boathook and the wooden jackstaff to which the red ensign scarred by the bomb blast was still attached it was in the shaft of the jackstaff that the scientists discovered a tiny cogwheel which they later identified as coming from a very common brand of alarm clock and i was able to confirm that to the best of my knowledge there had been no such clock on board slipslider which meant the cheap alarm must have been used to trigger the bombs detonator the police laboratories despite the paucity of slipsliders remains were nevertheless able to deduce what kind of explosive had been used and how it had been detonated by analyzing where each scrap of wreckage had been stored on board the forensic men could even tell that the bomb had been planted low down on the port side of the engine block the blast of the bomb would have driven a gaping hole in slipsliders bilges through which the cold sea must have recoiled in a torrent but the blast had also erupted razor shards of shattered fiberglass upward and outward to throw whatever and whoever was in the cockpit into the sea in the same blinding instant the explosion must have filled slipsliders cabins with an intolerable pressure that had blown the decks clean off the hull the boat would have sunk in seconds and joanna brian callendar assured me would have known nothing callendar had come to the house where he had made me a cup of tea before giving me all the grim details of the forensic findings it means theyll bring in the hard men from scotland yardhe pausedand it means youre going to be run ragged by the press the reporters were already besieging me i protected myself as best i could by taking the phone off the hook and barricading myself in the house where i lived off whiskey despair and the sandwiches david brought me the journalists shouted their questions whenever they saw a shadow at the windows but i ignored them i had no answers anyway the journalists just like the police wanted to know who had planted the bomb for a time the police suspected me but when the hard men from london searched the boatyard and the house they found nothing incriminating and nothing to suggest our marriage had not been happy the police grilled me about my army experiences but that was of no help to them either for my time in the army had been spent almost entirely in davids company playing bonecrunching rugby or going on uselessly strenuous expeditions that had not the slightest military value david and i had kayaked through the northwest passage dogsledded across greenland and climbed allegedly unconquered peaks in the andes and all courtesy of the british taxpayer whose only reward had been press photographs of grinning maniacs with frostencrusted beards what i had never done in the army was learn to use explosives nor did i have any motive for destroying slipslider yet there were other men who might have had a motive to plant a bomb on board the boat the same men who had constructed the bomb that had killed my son but that bomb inspector fletcher said was your common or garden provisional ira mark one milk churn remotely detonated by radio and stuffed full of czechoslovak semtex remind me where it happened freeduff the name still sounded so stupid to me freeduff county armagh was the inconspicuous farmlet where lieutenant richard blackburn commanding his very first patrol had been blown into gobbets of scorched flesh and shattered bones freeduff fletcher said in the voice of a man recalling old pleasures between crossmaglen and cullyhanna am i right i gave him a long meditative look inspector godfrey fletcher was the hardest of the hard men who had been assigned to investigate joannas murder and he was evidently no ordinary policeman but an official thug who moved in the shadowy world of counterterrorism and political nastiness he had the narrow face of a predator and eyes that were not nearly so friendly as his manner the old adage advises that you set a thief to catch a thief and on that basis fletcher was probably a man well suited to catching murderous bastards he was also a man who had clearly enjoyed his time in northern ireland what were you i asked him after a while sas he pretended not to have heard me lighting a cigarette instead but the bomb that killed your wife was not a mark one provo milk churn was it his gunfighter eyes stared at me through the cigarette smoke and the provos never claimed responsibility for your wifes death did they it was two weeks after joannas funeral and fletcher had come to the house to tell me very grudgingly that he no longer suspected me of my wifes murder but nor it now seemed did he think that the provisional ira was responsible it had been the press who in the absence of any other culprits began the speculation that the provisional ira had planted the bomb that destroyed slipslider it was not such a fanciful notion as it might have seemed for joanna and i had often loaned the contessa to british army crews who wanted some race experience slipslider had won her class in the last fastnet race with a crew of green jackets aboard and some newspapers surmised that the ira had assumed an army crew would be sailing the contessa that easter weekend but this wasnt your average ira bomb fletcher went on the provos are too sophisticated to use mechanical clocks they like to use siliconchip timers out of microwaves or vcrs using a ticktock these days is like planting a blackball with a smoking fuse its messy and crude maybe it was a splinter group of the ira i was repeating the press speculation but without any conviction then why didnt they claim responsibility whats the point of slaughtering an innocent woman for the cause of a new ireland unless you tell the world of your achievement because if you dont boast about your murders then the libyans wont know where to send their money and youve merely wasted a bang and these days the ira want bigger bucks for their bangs fletcher was standing at the open kitchen door staring down the long valley toward the restless channel joanna had bought the house for that gentle long view toward the sea fletcher blew smoke toward the orchard no mr blackburnhe did not turn round as he spokei dont reckon your wife died for a new ireland your son did but his death was an explicable act of political terrorism your wifes death was made to look like an ira followup but it wasnt the ira dont use toytown bombs anymore so who does who are your enemies mr blackburn he turned from the door and stared into my eyes i dont have any enemies i said fletcher crossed the kitchen in two quick paces and slammed his fist hard on the table who knew about your traditional easter family reunion he waited but got no answer did someone assume that youd both be on that boat he insisted who tried to kill you and your wife together his eyes had the blank cruelty of a hawks gaze i still said nothing and fletcher despised me for my silence who scoops the pot if youre dead mr blackburn he asked in a scornful voice dont be so bloody ridiculous i snapped there must be a fair bit of scratch in your family fletchers voice was sour as bilgewater your father was a harley street surgeon wasnt he one of the very best and one of the most expensive how much did he leave you and your brother half a million each its none of your damned business i snapped ah but it is he leaned forward to breathe cigarette fumes into my face anythings my business mr blackburn until ive nailed the fucker who killed your wife or was it a bitch who did the killing i said nothing fletcher dropped his halfsmoked cigarette into my halfdrunk cup of tea if you wont help me he spoke sourly then youll probably cop the next bomb yourself and frankly mr blackburn youll fucking deserve it unless you tell me where she is i looked into his merciless gaze but said nothing you know its her dont you fletcher demanded no i said no and once again that simple word became a protest as well as a denial no no no fletcher was suggesting that my daughter nicole had murdered her mother fletcher was crazy it was not nicole not my daughter not nicole richard and nicole were twins nicole was always the leader the braver the instigator of disobedience and daring though richard was never far behind his tomboy sister at ten years old they had been rescued off the cliffs to the east of the town though nicole who had led her brother on the expedition to find gulls nests had defiantly insisted that she and richard had been entirely safe at thirteen in a sudden spring storm their heron dinghy had been pulled off the shoals by the towns lifeboat the lifeboats coxswain being a good man had first saved their lives then given them each a good hiding and said that the next time he would leave them there to drown nicole had been furious not at the coxswain for clapping her ears but at herself for being trapped on a drying lee shore shes a wild one the coxswain had told me the next day spat at me like a cat she did nicole became wild when she was thwarted she thwarted herself most of all failing in some ambition she had set for herself not that she failed often for she was a capable and an extraordinarily tough girl you learn about peoples characters when you sail with them in small cruising yachts and i learned a lot about nicole even though she prided herself on hiding her feelings i watched her in gales in cold and in fogs and i never once saw her come near breaking point the harder a voyage became the harder nicole proved her brother relied on humor to cushion hardship but nicole cultivated a rockhard endurance sometimes that hardness worried joanna and me for it spoke of a lack of sympathy in our daughter yet we also had much to be thankful for nicole like her twin brother grew into a goodlooking adolescent with straight strawcolored hair seablue eyes and broad shoulders the twins had the attractiveness of good health and physical confidence yet still there was that unsettling streak of ice in nicoles character richard could be immensely giving and understanding but nicole was intolerant of any weakness either in herself or in others nicole had to be the best with one and only one exception her twin brother richard and only richard was allowed to be her equal and even her superior they were inseparable the best of friends and nicole regarded dickies victories as hers and his defeats as personal slights on her once when richard was beaten three times in one afternoons dinghy racing by a newcomer to the town nicole was furious richard was typically generous in praise of the newcomer but nicole regarded his victories as an insult she swore revenge but nicole sailed a shearwater a catamaran while richard preferred a fireball which was a monohull nicoles uncle david who had missed a place on an olympic team by just one race and therefore knew a thing or two about dinghy competition warned nicole that the newcomer was too good and that her unfamiliarity with the fireball dinghy would lead to a hiding but nicole would have none of it she practiced for a week and at weeks end in her brothers boat and with her mother as crew she routed the newcomer she won every race and never once according to joanna cracked a smile it was war out there joanna said terrifying nicole calmed as she grew older by her late teens she had learned to put a governor on her temper and by the time she went to university she could as her brother lovingly put it do a passable imitation of a normal human being richard had already left home going much to my pleasure into my old regiment nicole who had been suffering from a temporary bout of antimilitarism had initially disapproved of richards career but the disapproval passed she herself went to a northcountry university where she studied geology for a time joanna and i worried that the constraints of scholarship might irritate nicole into rebellion but instead she settled down and even displayed an academic aptitude that surprised us both not that the old angry nicole vanished entirely she threw herself eagerly into campus politics and succeeded in having herself arrested for throwing eggs at the prime minister in a protest against powerstation emissions when i said that it seemed damned silly to be arrested for throwing eggs i was treated to a half hours scathing denunciation of my generation my views and my carelessness for the planets future yet despite her passionate intolerance for any views other than her own nicole seemed happy and purposeful and joanna and i had begun to anticipate the day when we could fulfill our longheld dream of selling the house and buying a boat large enough to live aboard permanently then in an irish springtime when the blossoms exploded white in the deep hedgerows of county armagh richard had died and something in nicole had died with her twin brother she abandoned her studies and came home where like a wild thing she raged against lifes injustices joanna and i were advised to give nicoles grief time to work itself out like some splinter of shrapnel but instead it seemed to go deeper and there sour into a grim and hopeless misery nicole lost weight became pale and snappish and for a time she haunted the local churches even going so far as to declare an intention of entering a discalced carmelite house in provence her uncle david told her to snap out of it which she did but only to hurl herself in entirely the opposite direction she was arrested for being drunk and disorderly and three weeks later for possession of marijuana joanna and i paid those fines only to discover that our daughter was pregnant and had no idea who the babys father was nicole herself opted to abort the child and afterward sank into a sullen vituperative mood that was worse than her previous extremes of religiosity and carnality it isnt your fault david tried to reassure joanna and me though david who had no children himself was hardly an expert on childrearing i could understand joanna had said if wed dropped her on her head as a baby or abused her or disliked her but nickel had a wonderful childhood nickel was the familys nickname for nicole its just her nature david had said some people are excessively ambitious and competitive and nickels one of them its a blackburn trait and youll just have to endure while she learns to channel it right now shes like a motor given too powerful a fuel but shell eventually learn to control it and then youll be proud of her mark my words nickel will achieve great things one day joanna had sighed i hope you are right then that same summer nicole met caspar von rellsteb she met him in our boatyard where he had docked to repair his catamarans broken forestay it was a saturday and joanna and i had been trying to hack some order into our tangled garden when late in the afternoon nicole came home and calmly announced that she was leaving to live with a man called caspar im going right now she added now with caspar caspar who an astonished joanna had asked just caspar nicole either did not know the rest of his name or did not want us to know hes an ecologist hes also a liveaboard like you want to be she airily told us and hes leaving on this evenings tide leaving where joanna asked i dont know just leaving nicole went into the house and began singing as she collected her oilskins and seaboots for a moment joanna and i had just stared at each other then we had tentatively agreed that our daughters sudden and unexpected happiness might prove a blessing and that running away with the mysterious seagoing caspar had to be better than a life of shoeless desiccation in a french nunnery or of witless drunkenness in the towns pubs nicole her kit bag hastily packed did not want us to go to the boatyard to see her off but she could hardly stop us so we drove her to the river where caspars boat proved to be a great brute of a wooden catamaran called erebus erebus was a graceless craft nearly fifty feet in length with a boxy clumsy appearance that suggested she had been constructed by an amateur builder who had compensated for his lack of experience by making every part of his craft hugely heavy that precautionary strength must have paid off for erebus carried the unmistakable marks of long and hard usage her gear was chafed her hulls were streaked and her decks had been blanched by long days of hard tropic sunlight there was no indication of where the boat had come from for no hailing port was painted on either of her transoms and her ensign was an anonymous pale green rag that hung listless in the days sullen heat the big catamaran was moored at our visitors pontoon clothes and dishrags were hanging to dry from her guardrails but there was no other sign of life on board until quite suddenly a tribe of very small very fairhaired and very naked children erupted from the cabin to scream and chase one another across the coach roof and down onto the trampoline netting that formed the catamarans foredeck are they caspars children joanna asked with what i thought was a remarkable forbearance yes nicole said as though it was the most normal thing in the world for a girl to wander off and join a readymade family she had met only two or three hours before so hes married i asked dont be a toad daddy nicole swung her kit bag onto her shoulder and walked down to the pontoon the four naked children on the catamarans foredeck netting were shrieking with loud excitement but then a very tall and excruciatingly thin man who had a pale green scarf knotted around his neck suddenly appeared in erebuss cockpit shut up he spoke in german which i had learned years before and still half understood the four children were immediately quiet and utterly immobile oh dear sweet lord joanna murmured for the man apart from the wispy pale green scarf was bareassed naked his skin was tanned the color of old mahogany against which his long white hair and straggly white beard showed bright he glowered at the cowering children for a few seconds then turned as he heard nicoles footsteps on the wooden pontoon he smiled at her then held out a hand to assist her on board time to become the heavy father i said grimly then climbed out of the car into the summer afternoons sunshine billy grinned at me from the inner pontoon where he was rerigging a beneteau but i did not grin back instead i strode down the pontoon past the fuel pumps and jumped down into erebuss cockpit nicole nicole and the naked man had disappeared into the catamarans spacious main cabin i ducked down the companionway into the familiar cruisingyacht reek of unwashed bedding and smelly oilskins once in the big saloon my immediate impression was of a tangle of sunbrowned skin and greasy hair then i unraveled the impressions to see that besides nicole and the bearded man there were two other girls in the big cabin both girls were about nicoles age and both girls were naked one was completely nude while the other a startling redhead wore nothing but a pale green sarong that was loosely knotted round her waist that girl seemed to be helping nicole undress what the hell is going on i demanded fiercely this is my father nicole offered in laconic explanation the two girls both as blond as nicole snatched up clothes to cover their nakedness while the man whom i assumed was the beguiling caspar turned slowly to face me he said nothing but just stared at me with an oddly quizzical look on his thin face what the hell is going on i demanded again do you want to join us the man asked in a courteous voice nicole for gods sake i said come away daddy please go away nicole said as though i was being tiresome tim that was joanna calling me from the pontoon caspar slowly unfolded himself to stand upright in the spacious cabin he found a pair of faded khaki shorts which he pulled on then he gestured for me to go back to the cockpit i would like to talk with you he said and his manner was so polite that i felt i had no choice but to do as he requested you are unhappy he asked when we were both in the open air his english was strongly accented with german and held a tone of pained puzzlement you think your daughter is coming to some harm yes i am sorry it is just that we are most casual on the boat he smiled contentedly as though inviting me to share pleasure in his explanation but i was beyond reason youre running a bloody whorehouse i shouted joanna standing on the pontoon tried to calm me down caspar offered her the hint of a bow my name is caspar von rellstebhe introduced himselfand i welcome you both on board erebus your daughter wishes to join our small group and i am delighted for her and for us he waved a thin hand about the boat encompassing the frightened children who huddled together at the catamarans bows we have work to do he added mysteriously work joanna asked we do not sail for our recreation caspar von rellsteb said very portentously but to measure the damage being done to our planet his voice was suddenly tougher and i saw that despite his scrawny build he was no weakling but had hard muscle under the deeply tanned skin i guessed he was about my own age early forties though it was hard to tell because his long hair which had gone prematurely white made him look older while the lithe movements of his tanned and sinewy body suggested a much younger age nicole tells us youre an ecologist joanna said in her best conversational tone it is a convenient label yes though i prefer to think of myself as a surveyor of the planet my present task is to gauge the extent of pollution and of speciesmurder my small boat is illequipped to fight such evils but i monitor them so that the extent of the worlds ills will be understood hes not an ecologist i broke in scornfully hes just running a private knockingshop i pushed past the tall man and shouted into the cabins shadows nicole there was no answer caspar von rellsteb half smiled as though nicoles lack of response was a measure of his victory nicole is an adult mr blackburn he explained to me in a patronizing voice and she can choose her own life you can choose to use violence against me if you wish but nothing you can do will alter what is ordained he turned away from me nicole do you wish to leave erebus and return to your parents home there was silence except for the small waves slapping at the twin hulls and the raucous cry of gulls in the warm air answer me nicole caspar von rellstebs voice held a sudden heart of steel i want to stay nicoles voice was unnaturally timid as though she feared this skinny mans displeasure and joanna and i hearing such unaccustomed meekness in our daughters voice were both astonished then stay you shall von rellsteb said magnanimously but first it is only right that you should say farewell to your mother and your father come he left us alone with nicole who was now wearing a shirt and trousers in the pale green that seemed to be the uniform color of the erebus crew when they wore any clothes at all im sorry she said awkwardly its just something i have to do what is i demanded too angrily oh daddy she sighed and looked at her mother who was making soothing noises and telling nicole to look after herself you dont know anything about this man i attempted one last line of attack nicole shook her head in denial of my anger caspars a good sailor and he means to do something about a filthy world and thats a good thing isnt it her head went up as she recovered some of her usual defiance i want to make a difference i want to leave the world a better place is that so bad oh god i thought but there was no way of dissuading the young when they discovered the worlds salvation was in their passionate grasp i love you i said awkwardly and i tried to give her all the money in my wallet but nicole would not take it instead she kissed me kissed her mother then cuffing tears from her cheeks ushered us both ashore joanna and i walked to the car then drove to the cross and anchor from where we could watch the tideway joanna nursed a gin and tonic while i drank beer after a half hour we saw erebus shove off from the pontoon and motor out into the fairway all three girls were now on deck and all were wearing pale green clothes nicole looks happy joanna said wistfully she had fetched a pair of binoculars from the car and now offered me the glasses dont you think she looks happy and maybe this is just something she has to work out of her system its what that superannuated hippie is working into her system that riles me i said grimly then the hippie himself appeared on the catamarans deck dressed in his shorts with his white hair tied into a long ponytail there was something goatlike about him i thought and something very disturbing in the girls matching clothes which somehow suggested that they had uniformly humbled themselves before von rellstebs authority hes a very charismatic man joanna said unhappily balls he defused you joanna stroked my hand as the clumsy catamaran motored past us toward the sea the tide was flooding which suggested von rellsteb planned an eastward passage perhaps back to germany i focused the binoculars to see that nicole who did indeed look happy had taken the catamarans wheel while caspar von rellsteb was winching up the mainsail the erebuss sail was banded in broad stripes of white and pale green the same green as the odd uniform clothes that nicole and the other girls were wearing shes enlisting in a very good cause tim joanna said as she watched her daughter sail away shes volunteering for a floating harem i insisted theyre young joanna said patiently and theyre full of idealism and hope besides nicoles always been an environmentalist and surely thats better than getting arrested or having abortions shell have that goats baby instead i demanded angrily they just want to clean up a polluted world joanna said whats wrong with that nothing i said except i dont think that bastards a real environmentalist hes an opportunist he knows how desperately the young want a cause so he attracts them with a load of earnestsounding claptrap then turns them into his private harem you dont know that joanna said patiently if hes such a wonderful environmentalist i demanded then why are his engines so filthy the erebuss twin exhausts were leaving a dirty cloud of black smoke to drift across the river i should have stopped her you couldnt have stopped her joanna said her eyes on the departing catamaran she paused for a long time then looked sadly at me ive never told you this tim because its so very unfair and so very stupid but nickel blames you for dickies death me i stared at joanna the accusation was so unexpected and so untrue that instead of shocking me it merely surprised me she blames me because you encouraged dickie to join the army oh jesus i swore in exasperation why didnt she talk to me about it lord knows i dont understand the young im sure she knows it isnt really your fault but joanna unable to finish the thought shrugged it away shell be back tim but i was beyond such hopeful consolations i was watching my daughter who blamed me for her brothers death sail into the unknown legally she was a grown woman able to make her own choices but she was still our daughter and now our only child and i had just lost her to a man i had instinctively hated at first sight i also knew i had handled my confrontation with caspar von rellsteb very badly but i had not known how else to cope with the man i now thought of as my daughters abductor nicoles tough joanna tried to find more reassurance as we watched our daughter expertly steer the catamaran through the bull sands channel shell use him and his ideas to get what she wants and then shell come home hes an attractive man but i doubt hes clever enough to keep her you mark my words shell be home by christmas but nicole was not home by that christmas nor by the next she did not write to us nor did she telephone our daughter had disappeared gone we knew not where with a man we could not trace on a boat we could not find she sailed away and she never came home though fletcher my grimly unpleasant policeman still insisted that nicole had come back like a thief in the night to plant a bomb that had killed her mother and had been meant to kill her father too no i dismissed fletchers allegation scornfully fletchers knowing smile derided my denial is she still in your will he asked when i did not answer he assumed correctly that nicole was she gets everything does she he insisted its none of your business change your will fletcher ignored my anger cut her out so even if the next bomb does get you she wont profit from it we dont want the wicked to flourish do we mr blackburn dont be so offensive i snapped at him but even to myself the retort sounded futile and for the first time in my life and despite my fame as a solo sailor i felt entirely alone the public interest in joannas murder faded as the months passed and no one was arrested the newspapers found juicier bones to chew while the police transferred their efforts to fresher crimes that were more easily solved joanna was forgotten my life recovered then limped on to my astonishment the london attorney miller bought stormchild after all or rather he and his partners purchased the boat which they announced was to become a client hospitality facility the law firm paid a decent price then offered my yard yet more money to have the boat rigged and launched miller demanded that her name be changed from stormchild to tortaucitron which was evidently some kind of legal joke and though i told him it was bad luck to change a boats name he insisted it was not my luck that was at risk but his and so i had the new name painted on stormchilds transom miller and a group of loud friends came from london to take the newly christened tortaucitron on her first voyage they did not hoist the sails but merely motored beyond the bar where they anchored and drank champagne in the summer sunshine before bringing the beautiful boat back to the yard can you keep her until a delivery crew fetches her miller asked me how long i asked suspiciously because i did not want to tie up one of our precious moorings for too many weeks a month at the most im having her delivered to antibes he clearly wanted me to know that he did his business in fashionable waters i agreed he could keep tortaucitron on one of the yards moorings for a month but at that months end no delivery crew had arrived then another month passed and still the abandoned boat swung to her mooring on the changing tides autumn winds shivered the river cold and the first gray frosts of winter etched tortaucitrons rigging white but still no one fetched her her hull became foul with weed and her coach roofs streaked with gull droppings telephone calls to millers office elicited no instructions so i sent him a whacking bill for the moorings rent but the bill like the boat itself was ignored not that i cared very much for joannas death had left me in a state of numbed despair the house decayed about me the garden turned rank and wild and the boatyard only functioned because the staff ignored me and ran it by themselves i wallowed in selfpity i had lost a son and a wife my daughter had disappeared and i seemed trapped in hopelessness for weeks i wept in the night the tears fueled by whiskey my friends rallied but it was the friendship of marriage that i missed most i missed it so much that i often wished i was with joanna and richard in their graveyard high above the sea christmas was a nightmare and joannas birthday a purgatory david tried to comfort me but his efforts did not work my brother was never a comforting kind of man to be a comforting man one needs a much greater sensitivity to pain than david either possessed or wanted to possess well at least you might cut your hair he finally told me you look like a damned hippie the mention of a damned hippie made me think of caspar von rellsteb then of nicole and for the umpteenth time i wondered aloud where she was and how i could send her news of her mothers death since the bombing i had renewed my efforts to locate nicole i had contacted an old friend who now worked in army intelligence and he had pulled official strings in germany but no one there knew of a man named caspar von rellsteb or had heard of a boat called erebus nicole had simply vanished if she knew her mother was dead i insisted to david shed come home i know she would david muttered something about letting bygones be bygones he wanted me to forget nicole not because he disliked her but because he doubted she would ever return home my brother with his vigorous view of life wanted me to dismiss the past and start again and a year after joannas death he tried to kickstart that new beginning by introducing me to a widow who had moved to our town from brighton but i bored the lady by talking of nothing but joanna and nicole i did not want a replacement family i wanted what was left of my original family david finally challenged me over nicole do you have the slightest evidence that she cares about you or wants to have anything to do with you if she knew her mother was dead i insisted shed feel differently dear sweet god david sighed has it ever occurred to you tim that nicole herself might be dead perish the thought but that catamaran she sailed away on doesnt sound like the safest vessel afloat maybe she is dead i said listlessly one prays not david said enthusiastically but whatevers happened to nicole you simply cannot ruin your life wondering about it you need a new interest tim youve always liked dogs havent you dogs i gaped at my brother dogs he said again i mean i quite understand if irene wasnt the lady for youirene had been the widow from brightonbut bettys found a charming woman who breeds dogs up on the downs i dont want a dog breeder i snapped i want to find nicole but i thought you agreed she might be dead fuck off i told my reverend and insensitive brother david might have half wanted nicole to be dead yet oddly it was he who found her or rather who brought me the evidence that nicole might still be alive it happened on the sunday after our brief argument i was at home trying to ignore the whiskey bottle as i contemplated opening a can of soup for lunch when david still in his cassock appeared at the back door its me he said unnecessarily then dropped the color supplement of one of the sunday newspapers on the table beside my can of tomato soup mrs whittaker gave it to me after matinshe explained the newspaperbecause she recognized well you can see for yourself page forty mind if i have a whiskey i did not answer instead with a heart thudding like a diesel engine i turned to page forty i knew it was nicole david did not need to say anything there was something in his demeanor that told me my daughter had at long last reappeared nicole was in a photograph that showed a group of environmental activists harassing a french warship on the edge of frances nuclear weapons testing facility in the south pacific the picture was part of a long article about the growing militancy of the ecology movement and there in the very center of the photograph was nicole my heart skipped as i stared at the photograph nicole i wanted to laugh and to cry the fifteen months of despair and sadness since joannas death were suddenly shot through with brilliance like a spear of lightning slashing through gray clouds nicole was alive and i was not alone my breath caught in my throat and my eyes pricked with tears the picture taken in black and white through a telephoto lens showed a catamaran that was festooned with banners carrying antinuclear slogans in the foreground an inflatable boat manned by armed french sailors was motoring toward the catamaran which was wallowing hoveto in a surging sea six young people lined the catamarans cockpit all evidently shouting toward the photographer who had presumably been on board a french warship astern of the inflatable boat nicole was one of the six protesters her face distorted by anger looked lean and tough oh god i said weakly because seeing my daughters face after four years seemed something like a resurrection genesis david said he was striding up and down the unwashed kitchen tiles and was plainly uncomfortable with my emotion genesis i asked him wondering if i had missed some subtle biblical point look below the photograph in the box davids tone clearly suggested that he believed this reminder of nicoles continued existence could do my life no good whatsoever he drank a slug of my whiskey lit his pipe then stared gloomily at the birds in my unkempt orchard at the bottom of the page was a box in which the newspaper listed the various militant groups that were using sabotage which they called ecotage to jar the worlds governments into paying more attention to the environment one of those groups was called the genesis community presumably the writer averred because its members wished to restore the world to its pristine condition not much was known about genesis except that it was led by a man called caspar von rellsteb who was one of the most outspoken supporters of ecotage and that the group specialized in seaborne activities they had attempted to sabotage the sixtymile drift nets with which the japanese and taiwanese were obliterating life in the pacific ocean and were believed to have attacked two japanese whaling ships the groups activities were confined to the pacific where they had made strong though futile efforts to stop french nuclear testing it doesnt say where theyre based i protested obviously in the pacific david said oh very helpful i said sarcastically then looked again at the photograph as though there might be some clue in its grainy composition as to where i might find my daughter yet all the picture told me was that nicole had been alive when the picture was taken the previous autumn i recognized the catamaran as the erebus which nearly four years before had taken nicole out of my life i could not see caspar von rellsteb in the photograph if any one of the six protesters seemed to dominate the scene it was nicole herself the obsessive look on her face was so familiar to me a look of such determination that it veered toward bitterness buggering up the french bomb eh i said enthusiastically good for her if the frogs want a nuclear bomb david said irritably then they have to test it somewhere its not doing us any harm is it dont be such a fool i said good for nicole david puffed a smoke screen from his pipe if you read the rest of the article he said in a very guarded voice youll notice that the attacks on the japanese whaling ships were made with dynamite there was a second of silence then i exploded with indignation at the inference he was making dont be so bloody ridiculous david im not being ridiculous he said but merely pointing out to you what that damned policeman will undoubtedly notice fletchers lost interest i said besides if anything this article proves that fletcher was wrong it proves nicole cant have killed her mother it does david asked how shes in the pacific i pointed out even fletcher will have to admit that its difficult for someone in the pacific to plant bombs in england hows she supposed to have done it she just popped out one night sailed halfway round the world planted a bomb then sailed back again is that it of course youre right david had not intended to trigger my anger and now mollified it by changing the subject he picked up the can of soup is this lunch yes youd better come to the rectory instead bettys made a loin of pork with applesauce no dog breeders you want me to meet none at all he promised so i went to sunday lunch at the rectory where the three of us discussed the article examined the photograph and agreed that nicole looked wonderfully well i was feverish with excitement which worried david and betty who both feared that my hopes of a reunion with nicole might be horribly premature yet i could not resist my own pleasure my daughter was alive and was working to make a better world her activities were far away which suggested she could not have known of her mothers death im going to find her i told david find her and tell her itll be a bit difficult david warned me that article doesnt give you much of a clue where genesis might be but the name was clue enough and the next morning still excited i went to london to find out more matthew allenby was the secretary founder chairperson inspiration spokesperson and dogsbody for one of britains largest and most active environmental pressure groups he was also a remarkably modest and kind man i did not know him well but we had sometimes met at conferences where i was a spokesman for the boat trade against the protestors who complained that our marinas polluted coastal waters allenby had always treated my arguments fairly and i liked him for it now though we had not met for at least two years he greeted me warmly i should have written with condolences about your wife he said ruefully and im sorry i didnt i couldnt bring myself to read the letters anyway he offered me a smile of grateful understanding i suppose it must be like that he poured me coffee then after the obligatory small talk asked me just why i had been so insistent on an immediate meeting to answer i pushed the color supplement across his desk i had ringed nicoles face with ink shes my daughter i said and i want to find her ah genesis matthew allenby said with immediate recognition he pronounced the word with a hard g and with a note of dismay genesis i was querying the hard g the german pronunciation he explained i believe the groups leader was born in germany ive met him have you now allenby immediately looked interested i havent met von rellsteb not many people have i described the circumstances of my encounter with the naked harem on von rellstebs catamaran allenby seemed amused by my account and he was a man clearly in need of amusement for his office was papered with posters that depicted the torn and bloody corpses of seals dolphins whales porpoises manatees and sea otters other pictures showed poisoned landscapes fouled rivers oilchoked beaches and skies heavy with toxic clouds it was not a cheerful office but nor were the evils against which allenby had devoted his life and which had given him a sisyphean gravity beyond his years what i really want to know i finished up is who genesis are and where i can find them genesisallenby still stared at the photograph of nicoleis an impassioned community of environmental activists green militants theyre remarkably secretive and as a result somewhat notorious notorious i said with some surprise i never heard of them before yesterday allenby pushed the color supplement back across the desk thats because until now the genesis community has confined its activities to the pacific but believe me within our movement they are notorious you sound disapproving i challenged him thats because i do disapprove of them his disapproval was qualified perhaps because he did not want to sound too disloyal to a group that espoused his own organizations aims genesis believe that the time for persuasion and negotiation is long past and that the enemies of the environment understand only one thing force its a view he shifted uneasily in his chair but the trouble with ecotage mr blackburn is that it can very easily become ecoterrorism does genesiss ecotage involve killing people i asked and hated myself for indulging the suspicion that nicole had been responsible for her mothers death but the articles mention of dynamite had sown a tiny seed of doubt that i wanted eradicated no not that i know of allenby said to my relief in fact i think most of their actions have been somewhat clumsy theyve made various attempts to tow paravanes equipped with cutting gear into japanese drift nets but i believe they lose their gear more often than they destroy the nets which is a pity do you know about the drift nets not much i admitted and allenby described the fifty and sixtymilelong monofilament nets with which the japanese taiwanese and koreans were destroying sea life in the pacific nothing living can escape such a net allenby could not disguise his bitterness its the nuclear weapon of the fishing industry and it leaves behind a dead swath of sea in the short term of course the profits from such a device are phenomenal but in the long term it will strip the ocean of life the men who use the nets know that but they dont care the newspaper says that genesis used dynamite in some of their attacks i said ah rumors he said in a very neutral voice just rumors i probed he paused as though weighing the wisdom of retelling mere rumors then shrugged as though it would do no harm last year two japanese whaling ships were being scaled in south korea when bombs destroyed the dockgate mechanisms both ships were effectively sealed inside their dry docks a dozen green organizations claimed responsibility for the ecotage but there is substantial evidence which points to genesis as the responsible group he frowned thoughtfully of course the japanese insisted that the whaling ships were being used merely for scientific research but the japanese always make that claim you will detect mr blackburn a certain ambivalence in my attitude toward genesis on the one hand i believe they do nothing but harm to our movement alienating the very people whose help we need if were to achieve our aims but on the other hand i sometimes find myself applauding the directness of their actions i tried to imagine nicole as a green storm trooper could she risk a korean jail by planting a bomb and if so would she risk a british jail for a similar crime the suspicion that my daughter was a bomb maker first planted by fletcher then nurtured by the newspaper article would not die in me have you heard of any genesis activity in the atlantic i asked allenby forcing myself to use the german pronunciation with its hard g none at all but that doesnt mean theyve never operated here they specialize in hitandrun tactics and they could i assume sail in and out of the atlantic without any of us being the wiser you of all people must surely appreciate that possibility crossing the atlantic i thought to myself was a more complicated task than allenby evidently took it to be of course nicole had not planted the bomb of course not how do i find genesis i asked allenby instead of pursuing the possibility of nicoles guilt i honestly dont know matthew allenby spread long pale hands in a gesture of helplessness part of the groups appeal is their secretiveness they dont publish an address they must have a base somewhere again he made the oddly graceful gesture of helplessness for a long time they were based in british columbia von rellsteb grew up there of course so hes canadian i asked with surprise for i had long assumed that von rellsteb was a german he was born in germany allenby explained but he grew up near vancouver i didnt know i said at last understanding why my researches in germany had turned up nothing but its no good looking for genesis in canada now allenby warned me they had an encampment on an island off the british columbian coast but they left it four or five years ago and no one seems to know where they went my instant guess was that the genesis community was still in british columbia because that coast was a nightmare tangle of islands straits and inlets and if a man wanted somewhere to hide from the world then there were few better places than the waters north of vancouver allenby was sifting through a heap of business cards he had spilled from a bowl on his desk if anyone can help you he said these people can he offered me a card that bore the name molly tetterman and had an address in kalamazoo michigan usa under the name was printed the legend chairperson the genesis parents support group mrs tettermans daughter like yours joined genesis and hasnt been seen since allenby explained and mrs tetterman wrote and asked for my help but alas i had no more information to give her than ive been able to give you youve been very helpful i said politely i picked up the color supplement which had printed nicoles photograph and leafed through its pages to find the name of the journalist who had written the article perhaps he can help me i doubt it allenby smiled he got most of that information from me anyway oh i felt the frustration of a trail gone cold but what i will do allenby offered is ask around and pass on any information i might discover i cant really encourage you to be hopeful but its odd how things turn up when you least expect them id be grateful i said but my acknowledgement of his offer was almost as automatic as his making of it for i could tell from allenbys tone that he did not truly expect to discover any new information about genesis perhaps i should talk to this journalist after all i tapped the article in the magazine you never know he might have found another good source if you talk to the journalist allenby said very carefully then hell want to know why youre so interested in genesis and even the dullest journalist will eventually connect your inquiry about bombed whaling ships in korea with an unexplained bomb in the english channel im sure theres no connection he said gently but journalism thrives on such suppositions i stared into allenbys intelligent face and realized how very astute he was and how very kind too for he had just saved me from blundering into a heap of unwanted publicity there is no connection i said loyal to my belief in nicoles innocence of course there isnt allenby agreed but the coincidence is too palpable for any journalist to ignore so why dont you let me talk to the journalist he offered without mentioning your name and ill also talk to some of my canadian and american colleagues and if i discover anything anything at all then ill pass it straight on to you and in the meantime what you can do mr blackburn is to keep on running a nonpolluting boatyard i thanked him and went back to do just that but despite allenbys good advice i could not resist trying to discover more about genesis for myself i telephoned fletcher but he knew nothing of von rellstebs organization ive heard of a rock group called genesis but not a green group he said sourly then asked why i was so interested i revealed that nicole was a member of genesis and i immediately heard a professional interest quicken fletchers voice youre suggesting that theyre connected with your wifes murder he asked no i am not i said firmly the greens are all so pure arent they fletcher had entirely ignored my denial but that doesnt mean theyre not as bloody minded as anyone else after all weve got the animal liberation front who think its cute to use bombs on humans i mean i can just about understand the ira but blowing up people on behalf of pussycats the policeman paused are you going looking for this genesis mob theres not much point is there i dont know where they live well if i hear anything ill let you know the promise was purely automatic and i heard nothing more from fletcher even matthew allenby could only send me some fiveyearold pamphlets written by caspar von rellsteb the pamphlets printed on recycled paper by an obscure environmental press in california proved to be savage but imprecise attacks on industry there was no mention of genesis suggesting that the groups name had not been coined when the pamphlets were written though one of the tracts did outline a communal style of ecoexistence an ecommunity in which children could be raised to think ecorrectly and that individual greed would be subsumed by the groups ecoidealism the suggestion was nothing more than the old utopian ideal harnessed to an environmental wagon and i assumed that the ideas in the pamphlet had become reality in the genesis community the pamphlets provided no clues as to where the genesis community might have moved when they abandoned their british columbian encampment i wrote to molly tetterman in kalamazoo and in reply received some typewritten and photocopied newsletters from her genesis parents support group but the newsletters added very little to what i already knew caspar von rellsteb had established his canadian ecommunity on a private island north of the johnstone strait but had since vanished and the newsletters far from solving the mystery of the communitys present whereabouts only made it more tantalizing by appealing for anyone with any information to please contact molly tetterman in kalamazoo michigan people cant just disappear off the face of the earth i complained to david of course they can happens everyday thats why the salvation army has a missingpersons bureau so what am i supposed to do report the genesis community to the salvation army david laughed why not theyre very efficient at finding people instead of the salvation army i tried the french navy politely inquiring whether they had any information about the activists who had harassed their nuclear tests in the pacific but their only reply was a formal denial that any such harassment had even occurred it seemed as the weeks passed that von rellsteb had truly succeeded in vanishing off the face of the polluted earth then matthew allenby struck gold actually i didnt do a thing he said modestly when he telephoned me with his news it was one of our american groups who found him out where i said eagerly have you ever heard of the zavatoni conference allenby asked me no its a biannual event a chance for environmentalists and politicians to get together and its convening in key west in two weeks most of us would like to hold it somewhere more ecologically significant but if you dont offer politicians the comforts of a fivestar hotel then they wont turn up for anything but the point is mr blackburn that the organizers sent an invitation to von rellsteb they knew where to write to him i interrupted angrily thinking of all my wasted efforts to discover genesiss whereabouts of course they didnt allenby said soothingly instead they placed advertisements in all the west coast environmental magazines but the amazing thing is that hes accepted their offer hes agreed to give the keynote speech its something of a coup for the organizers because most of the ecotage people wont agree to debate with the mainline organizations and where exactly is this conference i interrupted matthew allenby again i told you in key west florida he gave me the name of the hotel so how do i get in i asked if you make your own travel and hotel arrangements allenby suggested with diffident generosity then ill say youre one of my delegates but i know that hotel doesnt have any spare rooms so youre going to have trouble finding a bed i dont give a damn i could already feel the excitement of the chase ill sleep in the street if i have to dont be too eager allenby warned me von rellsteb might not turn up in fact if i had to give odds id say theres less than an even chance that he will actually arrive those odds are good enough for me it really is a long shot matthew warned me again but i reckoned that only by a long shot would i ever find nicole and so i bought myself a ticket to miami david opined that i was mad an opinion he hammered at me right until the moment i left england he drove me to heathrow in his ancient riley nicole wont be at key west you do realize that dont you how do you know of course i dont know he said it is just that like other sensible human beings i predicate my actions especially the expensive actions on probabilities rather than on vague hopes that will almost certainly lead to a debilitating disappointment you dont believe in miracles i teased him of course i do he said stoutly but i also believe in the existence of false hopes disappointment and wasted efforts all i want to do i explained very calmly is to find nicole and tell her about her mothers death nothing else that was not entirely true i also wanted i needed nicoles assurance that she no longer believed i was responsible for her brothers death that belief of nicoles might be irrational but it had snagged in my heart and still hurt and to find nicole i went on im willing to waste quite a lot of my own money is that so very bad david sniffed rather than answer my question then for a few silent miles he brooded on my obstinancy they have pink taxis there did you know that he finally asked as we turned into the airport pink taxis in key west he said ominously as though the existence of pink taxis was the final argument that would prevent my leaving he braked outside the british airways terminal pink taxis he said again even more ominously it sounds like fun i said then climbed from the car and went to find my child david was right there were bright pink taxis in key west and i was suddenly glad to be there because it was a preposterous outrageous and utterly unnecessary town a fairytale place of victorian timber houses built on a sundrenched coral reef at the end of a onehundredmile highway that skipped between a chain of palmclad islands across an impossibly blue sea i felt i had been transported out of grayness to a sudden vivid world that contrasted cruelly with the damp drabness that had been my life since joanna had died my hangdog spirits lifted as the pink taxi drove me from key wests tiny airport into the old towns tangle of narrow streets i was headed for a private guest house that my travel agent had somehow discovered which proved to be a pretty house on a treeshaded street close to the town center the guest house was owned and run by a man named charles de charlus who when i arrived was flat on his back beneath a jackedup austinhealey he wriggled backward stood to greet me and i saw that he was a handsome tall and deeply tanned man whose face was smeared with engine oil our visitor from england how very nice de charlus greeted me as he wiped his hands on a rag you look exhausted mr blackburn come inside he ushered me into a hallway lavish with beautiful victorian furniture where he plucked a room key from the drawer of a bureau im giving you a room that overlooks the jacuzzi in the courtyard do feel free to use it we have a weight room if you need some exercise and an electric beach an electric beach an electric tanning salon for cloudy days i doubt ill have much time for relaxation i said trying not to show the awkwardness that suddenly flared through me im here for the zavatoni conference oh youre a green well of course arent we all these days charles led me upstairs and ushered me into a wonderfully comfortable room youll forgive me if i dont come in and show you where everything is in explanation he held up his hands which were still greasy from his car then tossed the room key onto the bed your bathroom is through the blue door and the air conditioner controls are under the window enjoy he left me in the cool of the airconditioning the curtains were closed presumably to fend off the fierce sun but i pulled them aside to let in some light and found myself staring down into the palmshaded courtyard where the bright bluetiled jacuzzi shimmered and foamed in the heat two men were sprawled in the water both were stark naked one of them seeing me raised a languid hand in greeting i let the curtain drop i could feel myself blushing joanna i thought would have been mightily amused and i could almost hear her accusing me of a most ridiculous embarrassment i took her framed photograph from my seabag put it on the bedside table and thought how very much i missed her then i sat on the bed and fished out the visiting card that matthew allenby had given me i dialed molly tettermans number in kalamazoo michigan the phone rang four times then an answering machine announced that molly could not come to the phone right now so would i please leave a message i gave my name and said i had come to america because caspar von rellsteb was supposed to be giving a speech at the zavatoni conference in key west and if the genesis parents support group had any observers at the conference id be very glad to meet them i dictated the guesthouse telephone number to molly tettermans answering machine then overcome by tiredness i lay back on the beds pretty patchwork quilt and slept the next morning a monday was the opening day of the zavatoni conference i walked to the conference hotel where i discovered that matthew allenby had left my name with the registration desk in the entrance foyer i also found that i was just one of hundreds of other delegates which surprised me for i had somehow imagined that the event would be a small and rather obscure conference like those i had attended in britain the zavatoni conference was to be a fullblown celebration of the environment and of the efforts being made to preserve it the tone was set from the moment i registered and was presented with a badge which read hi im tim and i care the badge was printed in a livid dayglo green its made from recycled plastic the friendly official reassured me then directed me to a huge notice board that listed all the days attractions at the conference most were the predictable fare of such conferences i could see a film about greenpeaces work or attend a lecture on the depredations of the logging industry in malaysia or catch a bus that would take delegates to see the endangered key deer on big pine key yet this was also a conference for political action so there were axes being ground a swedish parliamentarian was lecturing on environmental taxes a strategy for fiscal ecoenforcement while the women against meateaters were caucusing with the coalition for an alcoholfree america in the hemingway lounge the european proletarian alliance against oil producers was holding a multicultural symposium in the henry morgan suite where their guest celebrity was a british actress and i wondered for the millionth fruitless time just why the acting profession labored under the misapprehension that trumpery fame gave its members the expertise to tell the rest of us how to conduct our lives i decided to give the actress and all the other meetings a miss though i did avail myself of the exhibition in the versailles mezzanine where all the environmental groups who were officially represented at the conference displayed their wares the exhibition ranged from a tableau vivant mounted by mothers against nuclear physics which showed cosmetically scorched women holding halfmelted plastic dolls in rigidly agonized postdisaster poses to the land of milk and honey exhibit which was neatly staffed by well dressed bornagain christian fundamentalists matthew allenbys organization had an intelligently sober exhibit as did the sierra club and a score of other mainline pressure groups but despite caspar von rellstebs agreement to address the conference there was no display illustrating the life and work of the genesis community i went back to the lobby where i was accosted by a woman wearing a clown costume who solicited my signature for a petition demanding an end to offshore oildrilling throughout the world other activists were attempting to ban nuclear power stations sexism fur coats mercury in dental fillings and pesticides i signed the petition on fur coats then spotted matthew allenby standing in the open doorway of a crowded room where he was listening to a lecture i feel rather guilty for telling you about this conference he said i rather suspect ive encouraged you to waste a good deal of your money and time theres absolutely no sign of von rellsteb and im told it would be very typical of him to agree to attend but then not turn up it wont be your fault if that happens i said any parent would snatch at the smallest chance of finding his child wouldnt he yes of course matthew agreed though he still sounded dubious we had wandered close to the hotels front door outside of which a number of demonstrators angrily harangued arriving delegates the anger was directed at anyone who arrived in a car and thereby contributed exhaust fumes to global warming theyre from wash matthew gestured at the angry demonstrators wash i assumed it was a town i had never heard of or else a contraction of washington its an acronym matthew explained wash or the world alliance to save humanity he grimaced for a time their british branch picketed my office your office i said in astonishment what were they accusing you of they thought my organization should support their call for the abolition of private cars matthew sighed the green movement is riddled with a holierthanthou attitude which means that the extremists are always trying to show how much purer they are than the mainstream groups its all rather counterproductive of course if we cooperated and agreed on some specific goals then we could make real progress we could certainly outlaw drift netting in the pacific we could probably end the use of cfcs in refrigerators and aerosols we could seriously reduce carbon monoxide emissions and we might even save whats left of the rain forests but what we cant do is ban all cars from the road and we dont help our cause by saying that we can ordinary people dont want to lose their cars just as they dont want to go cold in winter merely because theyre told that oil and coal power stations pollute the air and nuclear power is unsafe i know because im an ordinary person and i dont want to stop using a car and i dont want my children to be cold in winter the problem with our movement mr blackburn is that were always trying to ban things but we dont offer alternatives and i mean genuine alternatives that will heat peoples homes and apply deodorants to their armpits and propel their automobiles people will listen to us if we offer them hope and theyll even pay a few pennies more if they think the extra cost will help the planet but if we offer them only doom theyll accept the doom and decide they might as well be comfortable as they endure it its the primrose path syndrome why be uncomfortable if youre going to hell i smiled you sound as if you ought to be giving the keynote speech ive been asked to do just that but only if von rellsteb doesnt turn up on wednesday night of course my speech wont be as popular because common sense never is as interesting as fanaticism if von rellsteb comes and rants about paying back pollution with violence then hell make every newspaper in the free world while my realism wont even make two inches in the local paper there was certainly a great deal of press and television interest in the conference the numerous reporters were not required to wear the delegates dayglo green name badges but instead had officiallooking red press tags that under their names announced what newspaper or magazine they worked for as matthew and i stood by the entrance one such reporter arrived to run the gauntlet of wash hatred she was a pale and flusteredlooking girl with something so disorganized in her looks and so fearful in her expression that i instinctively felt protective toward her she was wearing a long yellow skirt which gave her a fresh springlike appearance she must have arrived by car or taxi for the wash demonstrators were giving her a particularly hard time you can see matthew said quietly just how easily fanaticism could spill into terrorism are you saying wash are terrorists no but they think their cause justifies their actions and it wont be long before frustration with results will demand even more violent action no doubt that will be caspar von rellstebs message on wednesday night if he comes the frail reporter her fair hair awry made it safely into the hotel where in her relief she spilled a great pile of papers and folders onto the floor she looked as if she would burst into tears but then a hotel porter hurried to help her pick up the strewn pile wednesday night matthew repeated to me if von rellsteb is going to come mr blackburn youll see him on wednesday night until then i suspect you wont need to bother yourself with these proceedings the pale and worriedlooking girl her papers rescued had disappeared into the crowd but something about her face stayed in my mind it was not her beauty that had lodged in my consciousness for the girls looks had hardly been striking but rather it was her vulnerability that made her attractive or perhaps it was her greeneyed gaze of anxious innocence i smiled for that sudden pulse of interest was the first resurgence of something i thought had died with joanna in the bombchurned waters of the english channel key west with its vividly improbable happenings was making me feel alive again and genesis or no genesis i was glad to have come next day trusting matthew allenbys intuition that i need not bother with the conference until wednesday i explored the pretty treeshaded streets of key west and i thought how much joanna would have liked the old town the houses had been built by nineteenthcentury shipwrights whose techniques of allowing a ships timbers to flex with the surge of the sea had enabled the houses to ride out floridas awesome hurricanes the facades were intricately carved and shaded by flowering trees the smell of the sea pervaded every street and courtyard and the heat was made bearable by the ocean breeze charles my guesthouse host explained key wests prettiness by saying that for years the old town had been too poor to afford new buildings and thus had been forced to keep its old ones now the beautiful gingerbread houses were reckoned to be american architectural treasures though it took us to realize it charles said indignantly us you know what the realtors say follow the fairies because we always find the prettiest forgotten places then we fill them with marvelous restaurants and wonderful shops if you want to increase property values in your hometown tim then invite a gay colony to move in he saw my fleeting look of alarm and laughed it was tuesday afternoon and i was sweating with the effort of raising the engine block of charless austinhealey charles had discovered that i had once owned a similar car and knew more than a little about engines so he had recruited me to help him install a rebuilt clutch as we worked he drew from me the full story of my journey to key west the tale of joanna and nicole and of von rellstebs genesis community what will you do if von rellsteb does show up tomorrow night charles asked me grab the bastard and ask him to take a message to nicole it was not much of a plan but it was all i could think of perhaps id better come and help you charles offered im good at grabbing men he flexed his arm muscles and though i somehow doubted that any physical force would be needed the thought of charless companionship was comforting i telephoned the conference organizers the next day but no one could tell me whether or not von rellsteb had arrived if the genesis leader had come to florida he was leaving his appearance until the very last moment even when charles and i drove the repaired austin healey to the hotel that evening we still did not know if the guest of honor had actually arrived charles was in high spirits anticipating an adventure though i suspected the evening promised to bring nothing but disappointment because as the delegates drifted toward the banqueting hall von rellsteb had still not shown up i found matthew allenby frantically polishing his moderate speech in anticipation of having to fill von rellstebs shoes im sorry he said to me as though it was his fault that i was to be disappointed it doesnt matter i reassured him he might yet come matthew said and in that hope charles and i took our positions at the back of the banqueting hall we deliberately did not try to find places at the tables preferring to wait by the rooms main doors if von rellsteb did come he would enter the room by those doors and our new plan of attack enthusiastically proposed by charles was that we should grab him as he arrived i had spent a thoughtful afternoon writing a letter to nicole that letter was in my jacket pocket charles reasoned that von rellsteb ambushed at the door would agree to take the letter just to be rid of us but as the meal went on and there was still no sign of the guest of honor my letter and charless enthusiasm both seemed irrelevant the speeches began the conference chairperson gave a short talk extolling the life of otto zavatoni whose vast brewing fortune left in trust made these biannual conferences possible then the visiting politicians were introduced and applauded most i noted came from small european opposition parties and were politicians whose hopes of office had long faded and whose careers therefore could not be hurt by an association with the more extreme green elements and there was a handful of politicians from the third world who received the loudest and warmest receptions the introductions took a long and tedious time and for want of any better way of entertaining myself i looked around the huge banqueting hall for the reporter who had been wearing the yellow skirt i did not see her nor was there any sign of von rellsteb conference officials still hoping for his arrival scurried in and out of the banqueting hall the room was restless i noted how many reporters were present clearly drawn by the chance of meeting the mysterious proponent of ecotage but von rellsteb still did not show and finally the chairperson stood and bleakly announced that a change of plans was unfortunately dictated by the absence of the guest speaker but that nevertheless the conference was most fortunate in having the company of matthew allenby who had agreed to replace the absent caspar von rellsteb the applause that greeted the announcement was scattered and unenthusiastic matthew gave his reasonable and sensible speech he was a good orator but even so i could see the more extreme delegates shifting unhappily as he talked of consensus and education and of agreement and cooperation many of the delegates had not come to hear about consensus but about confrontation and five minutes into matthews speech there were the first stirrings of dissent as a table of scandinavian activists started to heckle matthew made his voice stronger temporarily stilling his critics by now it was dark outside and the big windows that faced the sea were a black sheen in which the chandeliers ablaze with thousands of light bulbs reflected brightly matthew spoke of setting attainable goals and of the importance of not alienating the ordinary man and woman who wanted to feel they could make a genuine contribution toward repairing the damaged fabric of the earth a man who disagreed with the moderation of matthews proposals struck the handle of his knife against his empty water glass someone else joined the ringing protest and suddenly the room was clamorous with dissent the chairperson called for order while a conflicting voice yelled at matthew to sit down and be quiet i was about to shout my own protest against the protesters when suddenly the great rooms lights blinked out the western sky sheeted a fiery red and the first guests screamed with horror genesis had come at last the doors behind charles and me were kicked violently open a woman at a nearby table screamed in terror i turned to see three bearded men silhouetted against the hallway lights that were still shining bright the three men half stepped over the banqueting halls threshold everything was happening so fast that i was still pushing myself upright from where i had been leaning idly against the wall then the three men hurled missiles deep into the darkened room and i twisted awkwardly and frantically aside i saw smoke trails fluttering behind the objects christ i thought the bastards are using grenades and i was instinctively shrinking into a groinprotecting crouch as the first missile cracked apart in a foulsmelling gout of chemical stench the grenades were stink bombs come on tim come on charles had recovered more quickly than me and was already pursuing the fleeing men i followed only to be crushed in the sudden crowd of choking screaming and panicked delegates who fought toward the cleaner air of the hallway a fire alarm had begun to shrill its bell filling the hotels vast spaces with a terrible urgency the stink bombs were pumping a noxious gagging smoke that overwhelmed the air conditioner ducts i heard a crash as a table was overturned a woman in a sari tripped and fell in front of me i dragged her upright shoved her out of my way then drove my shoulder hard into the press of fleeing people to make a path through them this way tim charles was free of the panic and running toward the hotel gardens the men who had attacked the conference were fleeing through those gardens toward the sea scattering leaflets in their wake i could just see the three running figures in the eerie light of the flickering flames that illuminated the hotel grounds i tore myself free of the crowd and sprinted after charles he had already rammed through a door and jumped off the terrace where the tables were set for breakfast i leaped after him palm trees were burning at the edge of the beach and i realized it had been their ignition that had sheeted the sky with red flame the night air stank of burning and of the gasoline i guessed had been used to set the trees alight the thatched roof of a beach bar had also caught the fire and was furiously spewing sparks into the night wind charles was overtaking the fugitives who ran toward the sea which lay just beyond the burning trees the three men were wearing green overalls and had ninjalike scarves round their heads and i realized with a sudden excitement that it was the same pale green in which caspar von rellsteb had uniformed nicole when she sailed away on erebus one of the fugitives slower than his companions dodged between the empty lounges beside the hotels swimming pool and charles leaped onto the mans back with a flying tackle that would have made an international rugby player proud there was a terrible crash as the two men fell into the wooden furniture and i heard the genesis fugitive cry aloud in pain hold him i shouted at charles in unnecessary encouragement the other two men turned back to help their comrade i reached the pools apron ran past charles and his struggling prisoner and charged the two men i shoulder butted the nearest one who toppled shouted in fear then fell backward into the black pool the second man tried to swerve past me but i grabbed his arm turned him and thumped a fist into his belly i followed that blow with a wild swing at his face that was cushioned by the mans vast and springy beard into which i tried to hook my fingers but the man managed to find his balance and tear himself free leaving a handful of wiry hairs in my right fist abandoning his two companions the man sprinted toward the beach the man i had pushed into the water was already climbing out of the pools far side and i saw that his green overalls were discolored by black streaks which together with the thick stench that polluted the night air made me realize that the swimming pool had been deliberately fouled with gallons of black and stinking oil behind me charles suddenly grunted and i turned to see his captive still desperately struggling i ran over and thumped a boot into the mans midriff get him into the bushes i said conference delegates were flooding into the gardens i did not want to share my captive with anyone but instead wanted to force some swift information from the man charles dragged the bearded figure into the deep shadows behind the small hut where the hotels bathing towels were kept the prisoner made one last frantic effort to twist out of charless grip but only received a smashing punch in the stomach for his pains he doubled over but i grabbed his beard and rammed his head back so that his skull thumped painfully against the huts wall do you want me to give you to the police i asked him the man said nothing i could barely see his face so dark were the shadows but i could see that our captive was not caspar von rellsteb do you speak english i asked him still he said nothing i sensed charles moving beside me and the prisoner suddenly gave a small cry of pain i speak english the man said hastily he had an american accent and breath that smelled rotten are you from genesis i asked and in my excitement i pronounced it the english way genesis i corrected myself yes he said but with difficulty for i was holding him by the throat listen i said and slightly released the pressure of my hooked fingers as i spoke my name is tim blackburn my daughter is nicole blackburn do you know nicole he nodded frantically i could see the whites of his eyes as he glanced in panic toward the urgent voices of the conference delegates who were milling excitedly by the fouled pool i could smell the fear in our captive he had been hurt by charles and now feared that i was about to add to his pain or worse was about to hand him over to a vengeful mob is nicole here tonight i asked urgently he whimpered something that i did not catch is she i insisted no no so where is she i demanded i dont know but shes with genesis yes he said where is genesis i hissed at him wheres your base he said nothing answer me i said too loudly still the man said nothing so i rammed a fist into his belly where the fuck is my daughter i shouted at him suddenly not caring if we were overheard the man stubbornly shook his bearded face he had evidently decided to act the heroic prisoner he would give me his name rank and number but he was determined not to reveal where the genesis community lived where i gripped him by the throat and shook him like a dog shakes a rat hurry charles urged me flashlight beams were raking the nearby bushes and it could only be minutes or even seconds before we were seen hurry charles said again was von rellsteb here tonight i asked our prisoner yes i want to meet him tell him that tell him ive got some important news for nicole ask him to give her this letter but tell him id like to talk with him first i took the letter from my jacket pocket then borrowed a pen from charles and wrote the guesthouse telephone number on the back of the envelope afterward i fumbled about our captives overalls until i found a pocket into which i stuffed the precious letter tell von rellsteb to telephone me at the number on that envelope tell him theres no trap i just want to meet him do you understand the man whimpered his assent behind us a flashlight beam slashed through the bushes and a burning frond of palm whipped over our heads the hotels fire alarm was at last silenced though somewhere in the nights distance i could hear the visceral wail of approaching sirens and when you next see nicolei still held the genesis man by the throattell her i love her the man looked somewhat startled at the incongruity of those last words but he managed to nod his comprehension i pushed him away from me go i said for a split second the man stood astonished then he twisted away and ran frantically toward the sea he was now a messenger to my daughter and i silently urged his escape past the angry conference delegates who seeing the fugitive flee from the bushes shouted the alarm and set off in renewed pursuit my messenger almost did not make it to freedom he ran just inches ahead of his pursuers i saw him leap off the sea wall and i thought he must have been overwhelmed by the flood of people who jumped after him but when charles and i reached the walls top we saw that our man was still inches ahead of the hunt we also saw that there was a large black inflatable boat a few yards offshore with people aboard who were shouting encouragement as our man splashed into the shallows tell nicole i love her i yelled after him but my voice was drowned by the crackle of flames the shouts of the crowd the growl of the inflatables outboard engine and the scream of the sirens as key wests firefighters reached the hotel the outboard engine roared as the helmsman curved toward the beach driving the clumsy rubber bow into the surf where the bearded fugitive hurled himself into the face of a breaking wave there goes your letter charles said the crowd of angry delegates stampeded into the sea after the fugitive their feet churned the water white as they charged the man was swimming now a woman lunged after him but fell fractionally short then hands reached from the inflatable boat the man was half dragged over the gunwale and the outboard motor was throttled up so that the lopsided boat thundered away toward the open sea the man had escaped i think you owe me a drink charles said in a hurt voice a big drink ive ruined a perfectly good pair of pants on your behalf his white cotton trousers had been ripped presumably when he had tackled and overpowered our captive we left the hotel before anyone could ask us questions and i bought charles a very stiff scotch in one of the many bars that claimed to have been ernest hemingways spiritual home i ordered myself an irish whiskey and as i drank it i unfolded and read one of the leaflets that the fleeing genesis activists had scattered in their wake the leaflets had been handwritten and copied on an oldfashioned copier that had left smudges of ink on the glossy paper to the traitors of the environment the leaflet endearingly began you have cut and burned the worlds rain forests so we shall cut and burn your fancy trees you have fouled the worlds waterways with oil so we shall take away your toy pool you have soured the worlds skies with noxious fumes so we shall make you breathe a similar stench you consort with the enemy with politicians and with their panders so how can you expect a real warrior of the worlds ecosystem to address your traitorous conference the leaflet went on in a similar vein of capitalized hatred ending with the boast we are genesis we make clean by destroying the dirtmakers very charming charles said with fastidious distaste when he had skimmed through the poorly written leaflet but why attack fellow environmentalists why dont they attack a conference of industrialists i suppose its von rellstebs way of making a bid for green leadership he obviously thinks that greenpeace and all the others are hopelessly respectable and this is his way of showing it it seems very puerile charles said and so it did oil and stink bombs were the weapons of naughty children not of the ecowarriors the genesis community aspired to be yet at least i consoled myself they had not used dynamite im sorry about your trousers i said to charles it was stupid of me to have worn them charles looked painfully at the rip in the white cotton i could not help grinning at the anguish in his voice for a raggedtrousered fairy charles i complimented him youre good in a fight he looked even more pained ill have you know that alexander the great was gay and who made up the sacred band of thebes a hundred and fifty fairy couples thats who and they were reckoned to be the most lethal regiment that ever marched into battle and your lawrence of arabia knew his way around a turkish bath well enough yet he was no slouch in a fight you should be very glad that we gays are mostly pacifists or else wed probably rule the world he finished his scotch and put the empty glass in front of me perhaps if youre going to air all your pathetic prejudices about my kind you should buy me another drink first i spared him my prejudices but bought him another drink anyway and wondered if von rellsteb would call no telephone call came on thursday and by that evening i suspected that no call would come why should von rellsteb contact me he had gone to immense trouble to hide himself and his followers from the world and i could see no reason why he should risk that concealment by responding to a plea from the distraught parent of one of his activists besides the phone number like the letter had probably been obliterated by the seawater you tried charles attempted to console me yes i tried and when no message arrived on friday which was the conferences last day i realized i had failed i had lunch with matthew allenby who ruefully compared the halfinch of column space that his speech had earned in the florida newspapers with the massive coverage that the genesis attack had provoked the local television news had made the genesis assault their lead story reporting that the police and coast guard had found no sign of the perpetrators the publicity is why von rellsteb does it of course matthew allenby said wistfully i thought how fletcher had talked of terrorists wanting more bucks for their bangs and does publicity generate cash for genesis i asked matthew frowned i dont see how it can they publish no address for anyone to send a donation yet they must need money they have to move around the world buy their equipment maintain their boats recruit their people they have to feed themselves and the word is that theyve got upward of fifty members perhaps they have a secret benefactor he crumbled a bread roll if i was a journalist he went on slowly thats the question id want answered where do they get their money i picked listlessly at my salad matthew sensing my disappointment with the weeks events apologized yet again for tempting me to key west but maybe hell still call maybe i agreed but my flight home left miami in less than fortyeight hours and i knew i had chased nicole across an ocean for nothing then next morning just when i had finally abandoned hope von rellsteb called i had left the guest house to buy some small presents for david and the boatyard staff charles was out so one of the kitchen help took the message which he said was from a man with an unremarkable accent the message merely said that if i wanted the meeting i had requested i should wait at the end of the main dirt road on sun kiss key at midnight the caller stressed that i had to be alone or else there would be no rendezvous i smacked a fist into a palm showing an excitement that the more cautious charles did not share you mustnt go on your own he insisted but i did not reply i was too excited to care about caution do you hear me charles asked earth to tim earth to tim of course im going on my own i was not going to risk losing any news of nicole by disobeying the cryptic orders suppose its a trap charles asked why on earth should it be a trap i asked with stubborn incomprehension because its all so secretive charles said dirt roads at midnight no one else to be there id say it was a trap wouldnt you why on earth would they want to trap me because we hurt that fellow thats why and he probably wants revenge nonsense i dont like it i dont trust it charles said unhappily he had fetched one of the tourist guides from the guesthouse reception desk and discovered that sun kiss key was a realestate name for a proposed housing development on one of the middle keys that lay some twenty miles from key west he telephoned a realtor friend and learned that none of the houses had yet been built and that consequently there was nothing on the island but newly excavated boat canals and a network of unpaved roads at night it would be deserted if i stay a hundred paces behind you charles suggested then maybe they wont notice no i insisted then take this he opened the drawer of a bureau and brought out a holstered revolver its licensed he said as though that made possession of the handgun quite acceptable i felt the surprise and revulsion that most europeans feel for handguns but nevertheless i gingerly reached for the weapon it was a longbarreled singleaction ruger only caliber but it looked lethal enough have you ever fired a handgun charles asked me i nodded though the last time had been twenty years before in the army and even then i had only fired six reluctant shots to satisfy an insistent firearms instructor im sure i wont need this i said to charles though his supposition that von rellsteb wanted revenge was enough to make me keep the small gun if you dont need it then just keep it hidden but if you do need it then youll be glad to have it along charles took the gun from me and loaded its cylinder with cartridges why do you keep a gun i asked him he paused for a second once upon a time he said my car broke down in texas id decided to drive all the way to san francisco in an old packard it was an antique car very rare and someone had told me i could sell it for a lot of money in california but its back axle broke in texas then two guys stopped in a pickup i thought they were going to help me but he stopped abruptly and i wished i had not asked the question for i saw how the memory pained him but then he grinned and thrust the revolver toward me fairy firepower tim it shoots slightly up and to the right and i suppose youll want to borrow the car as well can i i asked you may he said grandly indeed you may but bring it back in one piece you can be replaced but austinhealeys are rare indeed i spent that afternoon writing another letter to nicole in case the first was illegible it was much the same as the first letter i told my daughter that i loved her that i wanted to see her and that i was lonely for family i told her i had not killed her brother and i was sure she knew that too it was not a long message but it still took a long time to write then filled with hope and dread i waited the weather forecast hinted at the possibility of a thunderstorm over the keys so i borrowed a black nylon rain slicker from charles which i wore over black trousers black shoes and a dark blue shirt black suits you charles said approvingly i growled something ungrateful in reply dont let a compliment go to your head he told me because your appearance could still take a few basic improvements a waterbased moisturizer for your skin a decent haircut and some nice clothes would be a start shut the hell up i said and tucked his holstered gun into my righthand trousers pocket i had nicoles letter in my shirt pocket where if it rained it would be sheltered by the nylon slicker and for gods sake charles went on stay under the speed limit on the highway if the police find you with that gun well both be up to our buns in trouble i stayed under the speed limit as i drove up the overseas highway which arced on stilts across the channels between the islands i had left key west at nine oclock wanting to arrive very early at sun kiss key so that i could scout the rendezvous to smell for even the smallest hint of trouble not that i expected trouble but the strangeness of the occasion and the heaviness of the thundery air gave the whole night an unreal tinge ahead of me like a grim sign of doom the northern sky was banded by jet black clouds while overhead the stars pricked bright there was a halfmoon in the east that made the unclouded part of the nights sky lighter than i had anticipated i found the dirt road leading off the highway as i slowed and turned my headlamps flashed across a massive billboard which advertised sun kiss key your home in the sun waterfront lots from just beyond the billboard the dirt road lay like a white ribbon through the low scrubland to my left a few pilings had been driven into a cleared patch of land the pilings were evidently supposed to form the stilts of the developments show house but work must have come to a standstill for the pilings were now being used only as supports for a couple of ragged osprey nests the water in the newlycut canals was black and still i looked in the mirror no one was following me dust from the sport cars tires plumed to drift onto the bushes i passed another of the canals that was designed to provide boat docks for the planned houses behind me the headlight beams blazed and faded along the highway but no vehicles turned to follow the austinhealey onto this lonely and bumpy road i came to the end of the track where i parked the austinhealey in a patch of inky shadow with the engine switched off the night seemed very silent then my ears tuned themselves to the noises of a myriad of insects and to the faraway drone of the traffic on the overseas highway behind me i climbed out of the car the night was warm and still far off to my left the sea sucked and splashed at the shallows that edged the keys while beyond the reefs a motorcruiser with brightly glowing navigation lights ran fast toward the southwest to my right beyond the highway i could see the lights of the houses on the atlantic side of the island the halfmoon hung above those houses while to the north the clouds seemed thicker and blacker sheet lightning suddenly paled those dark clouds hinting at rain over the everglades i walked to the waters edge to see that it was a mangroveedged channel leading to the open sea sun kiss key was a lonely place for egrets and bonefish herons and ospreys but a place doomed to be destroyed by bulldozers and pile drivers by houses and carports by powerboats and barbecues waves fretted on the offshore coral more sheet lightning flickered silent to the north someone i thought was having a bellyful of bad weather though the dark clouds did not seem to be spreading any further south the thought of bad weather gave me a sudden and stunningly realistic image of hard ocean rain falling at sea an image of clean fresh water thrashing at a boats sails and drumming on her coach roof and sluicing down her scuppers and i wondered just how many months it had been since i had last sailed a boat properly it had been too long i thought much too long apart from the odd delivery job upchannel and shunting boats about the boatyards pontoons i had not sailed properly since joannas murder i had not had the energy to provision a boat nor to face the problems of navigation yet suddenly in the humid night air of sun kiss key i missed the ocean i wanted to feel the chill winds bite again i wanted to go far from land into the blank emptiness of the charts where the only guide to life was a belief in god and the high cold light of his stars i thought of tortaucitron stormchild as was and i resented that she was rotting on a mooring when she and i could have been sailing the long winds of nowhere and that sudden yearning made me feel that i was at last waking from a nightmare and i vowed that when i got home i would rig a boat any boat and late though the season was i would cross the channel and sail round ushant to where the biscay rollers would shatter themselves white on my boats stem i smiled at that thought then looked at my watch i still had two hours to wait it had been stupid of me i thought to arrive so early and even more stupid to bring the gun that was a hard lump in my pocket good evening mr blackburn christ i jumped like a fearful thing twisting round to face the sudden voice i had recognized the voice immediately for von rellstebs german accented english had not changed since my last confrontation with him on the deck of erebus how the hell had he gotten so close without my hearing him i could see him now a dark shape just fifteen yards away had he come by boat was he alone im quite alone he chuckled as though taking pleasure in anticipating my question he stepped closer and i saw by the moonlight that his appearance like his beguiling voice had not changed his face was as narrow and goatlike as i remembered it and he still had a waistlength ponytail of white hair and a thin straggly beard he also demonstrated a calm confidence as he reached out to shake my hand i rather hoped you would be early he said midnight seems such a witching hour for a meeting does it not but alas at the time i made the arrangement i did not think i could reach this place any sooner luckily things freed up for me how are you i had warily shaken his hand but did not respond to his friendly question preferring to ask one of my own wheres nicole ah shes well and shes safe you got my letter for her it was rather ruined by seawater the telephone number was written in ballpoint and decipherable but the rest i suspect it was washed away i am sorry he shrugged apologetically i have another one for her i took the letter from my shirt pocket and held it out to von rellsteb i was feeling extraordinarily clumsy von rellsteb not i had taken charge of this encounter von rellsteb took the letter and pushed it into a pocket you told george that you had important news for nicole i assume that news is in the letter i wanted to tell her that her mother is dead her mother is von rellsteb began to echo my words then a look of awful pain shuddered across his face and i thought of the police suspicion that the genesis community had planted the bomb that killed joanna and i knew that if those suspicions were true then this man was one of the greatest actors who had ever lived von rellsteb momentarily closed his eyes my dear mr blackburn he said at last i am so very sorry was it an illness no i did not elaborate poor nicole von rellsteb said poor nicole and you too how very sad no wonder you are so eager to see her he had handled the news of my wifes death with a superb assurance most of us confronted with the mention of death become tonguetied and confused but von rellstebs comforting sympathy had been instant and seemingly heartfelt and i at last began to understand how my daughter could have been attracted to this gaunt man i remembered how joanna had described him as attractive and i could begin to see why his long thin face had the appeal of sensitivity and intelligence which made him appear competent to handle the secret hurts of those he met you must understand though von rellsteb continued that your daughter is frightened nicole frightened i asked she thinks you will not forgive her von rellsteb paused to frown in thought sometimes you know we do things and then we find they are gone too far to be retrieved do you know what i mean not really i said von rellsteb gave me a swift apologetic smile i do not always express myself well in english nicole is frightened because she did not write or talk to you for so long that each new day makes it harder for her to risk facing the disappointment she knows you must feel but i love her of course you do he smiled complicit with my grief then stirred the air with his hand as if frustrated in his efforts to find the right words he might conjure them from the nights darkness i think nicole knows you love her but she fears you will be angry because of her absence she even told me that perhaps you had disinherited her von rellsteb offered a small shrug as if to share with me the ridiculousness of such a notion and i did not think to notice that even the mention of disinheritance was an oddity in this admittedly odd rendezvous disinherit her i said instead of course not not that it matters von rellsteb said loftily we should be above such mundane matters yes and i want to see her naturally you do naturally von rellsteb said with eager understanding behind me the lightning flickered eerily to blanch the rippling water in the mangrove channel but its difficult von rellsteb murmured after a pause what is i sounded hostile i try to keep the genesis community separate from the world why i thought you wanted to save the world he smiled we are not apart from the world but rather from the people who make the world unclean the sins of the fathers mr blackburn are being visited on their children so we children must be pure if we are to redeem our fathers world his thin expressive face was suddenly lit by another sheet of lightning which rampaged across the everglades i am expressing myself badly von rellsteb went on but what i am trying to say is that we in genesis have forsaken family mr blackburn it is a measure of the seriousness of our purpose the pretensions of his words struck me as preposterous seriousness i challenged him stink bombs oil in a swimming pool he smiled at the accusation of course stink bombs are a joke but those people at the conference are so what is the word complacent they talk and talk and talk and congratulate one another on the purity of their commitment but while they talk the dolphins are dying and the worlds hardwoods are being cut down and oil is being spewed into the seaways i think it will be the genesis community and groups like genesis who will cleanse the world not these fashionable environmentalists with their shrill talk and soft hands i wanted the journalists at that conference to be aware of the need for extreme measures if the world is to be saved so i used stink bombs would you rather i had used real bombs could you have i asked him coldly no mr blackburn no his voice was very gentle as though he dealt with a fractious child where is nicole i asked him in the pacific where exactly i insisted von rellsteb paused i wont tell you he held up a placatory hand to still my protest then as though he needed to move if he was to think and express himself properly he began pacing up and down the channels bank i have long dreamed of a community that could devote itself to oneness with the earth a biocentric community without distractions living in a silence that might let us hear the echoes of creation and the music of life he gave me a sudden smile you of all people know what i mean youve known the transforming wonder of sitting in a small boat in the center of an ocean in the middle of a night and suddenly feeling that you steered a vessel among the stars you could live forever at that moment theres no history no anger no pride just you and creation and a terrifying exhilarating mystery if i am to pierce that mystery and find its meaning then i must live in the center of silence thats what we do he paused seeking a further explanation that would satisfy me perhaps were making the first ecoreligion perhaps the new millennium will need such a faith but to forge it we must live without distraction and so our first rule our golden rule is that we keep ourselves private that mr blackburn is why i will not tell you where we live he had almost seduced me with his gently beguiling voice but some part of me a robust part of me would not be sucked into his vision you call lacing a swimming pool with oil living in the center of silence oh dear von rellsteb seemed disappointed with me he was quiet for a few heartbeats then offered a further explanation we dont want to be selfish we dont want to withdraw totally from the world most of the community does stay separate but a few of us like myself and nicole have to go into the world and deliver shocks to those people who would fill the planet with noise and disgust and dirt and rancor one day mr blackburn the whole world will live in harmony and the genesis community both anticipates that era and tries to bring it about but if i told people where we lived then i know visitors would come to us and distract us and maybe weaken us you dont have much faith in your vision do you i have no faith in those who do not share my vision von rellsteb said firmly and even though i am sure you are not hostile to it you are still not one of us unless youd like to join us no he laughed then stepped back ill give nicole your letter i know shell be pained about her mother i want to see her maybe you can von rellsteb stepped back another pace he was going into the darkness what the hell does that mean i demanded if she wants to see you then you will see her he stepped further back i felt my chances of seeing nicole slipping away with von rellstebs retreat tell her i love her i called to him the world is love mr blackburn lightning slashed at the sea drowning the air with its sudden light and in its slicing brilliance i caught a frozen glimpse of caspar von rellstebs face and in that instant he seemed to be laughing at me with satanic glee what earlier had seemed comforting and intelligent now looked evil but when my eyes adjusted to the dark again von rellsteb had vanished he had come from the night and seemed to have dissolved back into it von rellsteb i shouted there was no answer the sea sucked at the mangrove roots von rellsteb but there was only silence and darkness i turned away i felt dizzy almost drunk as though i had been mesmerized by von rellstebs voice yet i could not shake the memory of that sudden satanic epiphany had he been laughing at me had his victory this night consisted of fooling a man whose wife he had killed and whose daughter he had seduced i stopped and despite the heat i was shivering i also realized that my encounter had yielded me nothing i had achieved nothing and i had learned nothing then why i suddenly wondered had von rellsteb agreed to meet me what had been his purpose this night to mock me then i thought of his denial that he might have used real bombs instead of stink bombs and remembered the real bombs that had stranded the two japanese whaling ships in their korean dry docks fear surged inside me suppose nicole was dead suppose that von rellsteb had killed her and joanna and now wanted to kill me fletcher had been right when he guessed that my father had left david and me comfortably provided for we were not flamboyantly wealthy but nor were we stretched for money and inheritance has always been a motive for murder and why else it suddenly crashed on me would von rellsteb have raised the subject of nicole being disinherited sweet god i thought that was how von rellsteb made his money by making heirs and heiresses of his cowed disciples god he was clever i remembered the uniformlike clothes nicole had worn on the day she left with von rellsteb clothes which suggested a perverted subservience to von rellstebs wishes did he have some kind of mesmeric hold over his women and once they were under his spell did he manipulate their lives to enrich his own even matthew had wondered where the genesis community found its money and now i knew i knew but i had to carry my knowledge off sun kiss key and if von rellsteb wanted me dead so that nicole would inherit my wealth where better to kill me than on this empty key in the middle of a thunderripped night fear swamped me i ran to the car i freed the revolver from its holster slid into the drivers seat and fumbled for the keys the engine banged reassuringly into life i was panting sweat was streaming down my face as i let out the clutch and the car lurched forward were they waiting for me had they thought to have a backup party guarding against just such an escape as this i scrabbled charless gun close to me then shifted into second gear i had left the headlights switched off the car bounced sickeningly on the rough track i shifted again accelerating hard spewing a plume of white dust behind me as the bright red car charged toward the highway moonlight was bright on the dirt track while lightning blazed to the north no one fired at me no gun muzzle sparked and flamed in the night yet still the irrational panic made me crouch low behind the leathercovered steering wheel as the little car bucked and banged and howled in the night i could see the headlights of a great truck hammering down the highway and i knew i should slow down and let the truck go past but surely the best position for a genesis ambush was where the track joined the main road so i ignored good sense and put my foot down to the floor to try and race the truck the trucks noise filled the night its chrome trim gleamed in the light of the small orange lamps that the driver had strung across his high cab this beast of a truck was an eighteen wheeler one of the behemoth super tankers of the highways and it was thundering south with a tractor trailer attached and i was about to spin charless small car under its juggernaut wheels christ but it was too late to stop now i shifted down making the austinhealeys reconditioned engine scream in protest then i had the back wheels drifting because the main road was close very close and still no one fired at me but it did not matter for i was about to die anyway under the hammer blow of a mack trucks impact the driver flicked his headlights to full beam as he hit the klaxons and the blinding night was suddenly filled with the violence of his giant horns i kept going and the truck driver stood on his brakes so that the macks rear end slewed across the road as i accelerated into its path the austinhealeys back wheels screamed and smoked on the blacktop the steering wheel shuddered as the cars righthand wheels began to lift and then the little vehicle skidded toward destruction under the trucks massive tires the big rig was threatening to jackknife and its towering chrome radiator grille was filling the noisy night just inches from my rear fender the klaxons howled at the moon tire smoke hazed the bitter air then the austinhealeys starboard wheels hit the road and the small car found its traction and suddenly i was accelerating safely away while behind me the truck driver went on hammering his horns in angry and impotent protest i drove a full mile before putting on my lights and slowing down sweat was pouring off me i felt like a fool i had not panicked like that in years not since david had pulled me off a rock face in the dolomites where i had frozen in absolute terror that had been over twenty years ago and then i had at least had real reason for the fear while tonight the panic had been entirely selfinduced my imagination had worked on my fears turning von rellstebs sinister face into a devilish threat that had never existed i was still shaking i slowed down worried that the truck driver might have alerted the police with his cb radio but no patrol car waited for me as i drove back to the warren of key wests streets nor as i at last parked in the small driveway of charless guest house i turned off the engine then sat in the car for a few seconds feeling the jackhammer beat of my still frightened heart the revolver had fallen off the seat when i skidded onto the highway i groped on the floor for the weapon then wearily i climbed out of the car the guest house was dark though i was sure charles would be waiting up for me even if only to reassure himself that i had not damaged his beautiful austinhealey i closed the car door then from the deeply shadowed porch behind me i heard the scrape of a footstep i turned in a renewed and terrible panic realizing that of course they would ambush me here where else if i died here it would be written off as just another street crime and so i ripped the gun from its holster then half fell against the car as i twisted desperately away from the threat of whoever had been waiting for me in the darkness i used both hands to raise the ruger and pointed dead center at the shadow which now moved toward me from the porch no it was a girl who flinched away from the threat of the gun and who screamed at me in a panic every bit as frantic as my own no please no no it was the girl from the conference the girl in the yellow skirt the girl who had obscurely made me feel glad to be alive and i had almost shot her i hate guns the girl was gasping in her panic i hate guns its all right i said with an urgency equal to her terror its ok i hate them her fear seemed out of proportion to its cause she had twisted away so violently from the sight of the gun that she had dropped her huge sacklike handbag which had consequently spilled its contents across the path have you put the gun away she asked in a stricken voice she was still shaking like a sail loosed to a gale its gone i said she dropped to her knees to retrieve the slew of notebooks pens tape cassettes lipstick chewing gum and small change that had cascaded from her enormous bag are you tim blackburn she turned her anxious face up to me yesi stooped to help her collect her scattered belongingsand im sorry i frightened you you didnt frighten me the gun frightened me ive never had a gun pointed at me before ive been waiting for you why didnt you ring the doorbell and wait inside i telephoned she explained as she grabbed coins out of charless flower beds and someone said you were out but would be coming back later so i came straight round here but there were no lights on downstairs i thought everyone must be in bed already and i didnt want to disturb anyone so i waited a long time she nodded long enough i thought journalists didnt care about waking people up she blinked at me in gratifying astonishment how did you know i was a journalist i noticed you at the conference i confessed and saw you had a press badge wow her amazement seemed to stem from the fact that anyone might have noticed her she retrieved a last pencil and straightened up my names jackie potten actually my name is jacquelinelee potten but i dont use the lee because it was my fathers name and he left my mom when i was kind of little and molly tetterman says shes sorry she wasnt at home when you phoned but she was away in maine because her son is in college there and she was visiting him all week and she only got home today and i phoned her tonight and she told me about your messages on her answering machine and she asked me to talk to you which is why i wanted to see you and im sorry its so late but im leaving tomorrow whoa i held up my hands to check the impetuous flow found my key and opened the guesthouse door come and have a drink i told jackie i did not yet know her connection with the genesis parents support group or exactly why she wanted to see me but there was something in her disorganized volubility that i liked her presence was also good for me because her vulnerability forced me to control the panic that raced had my own heart and filled me with an inchoate fright i dont drink alcohol or coffee jackie informed me in an anxious voice as though i might be about to force those poisons down her throat come in anyway i said tim charles hearing his front door open shouted from the private parlor upstairs he was waiting up for me as i had assumed he would so i gave him the news he really wanted to hear which was that his precious austinhealey was unscratched i didnt expect you back so soon charles who was splendidly dressed in a chinese silk bathrobe appeared at the top of the stairs what happened he was early i said then placed the gun on the hall table i didnt need it but thank you anyway and who on earth are you charles imperiously demanded of jackie potten who faced with the ethereal creature on the stairway shrank back into the doorway my names potten she said jackie potten i assume charles said haughtily that you are the person who telephoned earlier you may wait for mr blackburn in the guest parlor and he will help me make a pot of coffee charles walked slowly downstairs come tim as soon as we were in the kitchen charles dropped his absurdly pretentious manner so what happened tell me not a lot he was early we spoke he took the letter and then vanished i didnt learn a thing is that all charles was disappointed thats all i sat on a stool and shook my head i dont know charles for a time there i actually liked the bastard then at the end i thought he was laughing at me i had also thought that von rellsteb had wanted me dead so that nicole could inherit but there had been no ambush so even that theory was wilting you dont need coffeecharles saw the weariness in my faceyou want something stronger your usual irish please charles pulled open a cupboard and sorted through the bottles what do you know about that creature he waved in the vague direction of the parlor where jackie potten waited shes a journalist i explained and i suspect she must be interested in the genesis community because she said molly tetterman told her about me you dont mind her being here do you he offered me a dramatic shudder of course i mind shes such a drab little thing drab i sounded offended i dont think shes drab at all you dont that hair and that awful blouse and the skirt that skirt wasnt tailored tim it was a remnant from a chainsaw massacre here he tossed me a bottle of jamesons i think shes rather appealing i said stubbornly charles raised his eyes to heaven then poured himself a large vodka would you like to find out what this ravishing creature of your dreams wants to drink she told me no coffee or alcohol a club soda and ice then charles decided im certainly not wasting designer water and a twist on such a creature i carried the soda water back to the parlor where jackie was staring very solemnly at an alabaster reproduction of michelangelos david charles followed me so tell us what happened he instructed me as though we had not already spoken in the kitchen i told leaving out only the details of my panicked flight from sun kiss key lest charles should think i had been anything less than careful with his precious car not that there was much to tell for my meeting with von rellsteb had been remarkably unproductive i should have come with you charles said what good would that have done i asked i would have pointed the gun at him and then told him he had five seconds to tell me where the genesis community lived what is it this last rather brusque question was addressed to jackie the ice cubes she gestured at her club soda are they made with tap water of course she blushed do you mind she began fishing out the ice which she dropped into an ashtray charles was amused but pretended to be exasperated jackie potten once the offending ice was safely out of her drink took a tentative sip then searched through her capacious handbag for a notebook and pencil how did von rellsteb travel tonight i dont know i mean by boat car i dont know he sort of appeared then vanished by broomstick charles said happily gee jackie frowned at me i mean they had a boat the other night so i guess they must have come to florida by sea i hired a motorboat to look for them and i searched most places from here to marathon key but i didnt see them what were you looking for i asked her erebus erebus she frowned oh the catamaran they renamed her genesis one theyve got two other boats we know of genesis two and genesis three how do you know molly asked the state department and they gave us copies of complaints that japanese fishing boats had made it was nothing to do with the state department really because none of the genesis boats are american but the japanese complained to them anyway and sent some photographs and you looked for one of the boats here she nodded but i didnt see any of them i wondered if von rellsteb and the others flew here maybe i should try and find their records in the airline computers she seemed to be asking my advice but i knew nothing of such matters and had nothing useful to say so i merely shrugged i wished i could have been more helpful because i was finding her oddly attractive i did not understand why she was an unremarkable girl but i was acutely aware of her presence i decided her eyes were her best feature they were large and a curious silvery green though perhaps that was just the reflection of the seagreen lampshades charles favored in the guest parlor otherwise jackies face was very narrow in the chin and broad in the forehead her skin was chalky pale and she seemed under the billowy clothes that had so offended charles to be painfully thin her fair hair was in disarray despite the pins and clips she had used to tame it i put her age at mid to latetwenties but her innocence made her seem more like a fourteenyearold waif the orphan of some heartless storm would you mind telling me charles asked in his silkiest voice just who you are miss potten oh gee she was instantly flustered im here for the genesis parents support group she paused as if expecting us to respond and when neither of us spoke she added a nervous explanation im mollys investigator she added in further reassurance investigator i sounded incredulous i investigate genesis jackie said defensively so youre not a real journalist charles made the question sound like a sneer oh yes i work for a paper in kalamazooshe paused because charles had sniggered but then she decided not to make anything of his scornand the editor isnt really sure that the genesis community is a proper story for our paper i mean our only connection with genesis is through molly tetterman but the editor doesnt like molly very much not because she isnt a good person because she is but because she can be very insistent and she keeps on pestering norman hes the editor about the genesis parents support group jackie i interrupted her very politely but i was becoming aware that this orphan of the storm could talk the back legs off a herd of donkeys unless she was checked what were you doing at the conference oh she was momentarily confused as if trying to remember just what conference i was talking about i went there because i hoped to get an interview with caspar von rellsteb which i didnt of course she looked at me rather pathetically its been a wasted trip really and mine i said as though it might make her feel better did you ask von rellsteb where genesis lived jackie asked me i nodded but he wouldnt tell me he just fed me a whole lot of mystical nonsense about how genesis needed its privacy i think its alaska jackie said suddenly alaska i asked the genesis group has always been based in the pacific jackie explained and when they left british columbia they probably wanted to stay somewhere on that same coast and von rellsteb has always been intrigued by alaska no one would know if they were there because parts of that coast are really inaccessible so they wouldnt need to bother with green cards or anything like that but why alaska i insisted because i found the man he shared a prison cell with in texas and he said von rellsteb was always talking about alaska and how it was the new frontier and a place where a man could prison i interrupted jackie nodded but for once had nothing more to say why was he in prison i asked it was attempted robbery jackie said but i only found out about it last month so i havent had time to write it up in mollys newsletter it all happened ten years ago he served two years of an eightyear sentence and when he was released they sent him back to canada because he should never have been living in texas anyway he tried to hold up an armored truck you know the kind that collects money from stores and banks but it all went wrong and he didnt steal a penny in the end the whole thing was really kind of stupid except he was carrying a gun which didnt help his defense in court his lawyer tried to claim that von rellsteb was alienated and that he was only protesting against society did he fire the gun charles asked jackie shook her head the police say it jammed but for some reason the technical evidence about the gun was inadmissible but if the evidence had been admissible i said slowly von rellsteb might have been arraigned on a charge of attempted murder jackie nodded slowly as though she had not thought of that possibility before i guess so yes bloody hell i said charles plainly bored with the nights lack of interesting news yawned and jackie hurriedly said she had to be leaving she was driving back north the next day and we agreed that she would give me a lift as far as miami airport the hundredandfiftymile journey would give us each a chance to pick the others brain for more news of genesis though of what use such a dull creature can possibly be is beyond me charles said grandly after jackie had left for her motel she returned at ten oclock the next morning in a tiny imported japanese car that was spattered with bumper stickers so many stickers that they had spread off the fender onto the fading paint of the trunk vegetarians do it on a bed of lettuce one sticker proclaimed while another warned i brake for the physically challenged which seemed to imply that the rest of us plowed indiscriminately into wheelchairs with merriment aforethought you car i asked jackie sure i worked out that it would be cheaper to drive than fly so long as i stayed in really economical motels jackie explained that her editor in kalamazoo was not interested in genesis so she had attended the conference on her own time and on her own and molly tettermans money i put my seabag onto the cars backseat said farewell to charles then climbed into the cramped front passenger seat of jackies car where one dashboard sticker thanked me for not smoking and another enjoined me to buckle up we took four wrong turns in our mutual attempts to navigate out of town but eventually jackie steered the car safely onto the overseas highway where she gingerly accelerated to fortyfive miles an hour are you really going to drive all the way to kalamazoo i asked in astonishment she evidently thought i was being critical of the car rather than of her nervous driving it sort of shakes if you go too fast she began to describe various other symptoms of the car and while she spoke i surreptitiously examined her and wondered just what it was that attracted me to her she did not after all have the impact of beauty and i did not know her nearly well enough to determine her character yet still i felt an odd excitement in her company it was i finally decided her very touching look of earnest innocence which made her seem so very fragile and which made me feel so very fatherly toward her she was after all just about young enough to be my daughter when she had exhausted the problems of car ownership i asked what had first made her interested in genesis berenice jackie said as if that would explain everything then realizing that it explained nothing she rushed into more detail shes mollys eldest daughter you see and she went off with von rellsteb about five years ago and molly thinks that berenice was brainwashed by him because shes never even written her mother a letter and they were really close berenice was my best friend i mean we told each other everything everything which is why ive been trying to find her i know she wouldnt just have just cut me dead i mean people dont do that do they perhaps she wanted some peace and quiet i suggested wickedly she looked immediately contrite i talk too much she said miserably i know i do my mother always says i do and so does molly and so did professor falk he was my ethics of journalism professor there are ethics in journalism i asked of course there are she offered me a reproving look which taking her gaze off the highway made us wander dangerously across the center yellow line i leaned over and steered the car back toward safety so berenice just ran away she went to a school in virginia where she met this guy and in her senior year he took her to british columbia for spring break which i thought was kind of weird because shed always gone to florida before thats where she met the genesis people they werent called genesis then that came later they were some kind of weird commune know what i mean and they just swallowed berenice alive no letters no calls nothing and youve been trying to reach her ever since jackie nodded i even visited british columbia but they threatened to call the police and have me arrested for trespassing i couldnt believe their nerve she frowned but at least they didnt point guns at me i thought she was reproving me for my behavior of the previous night and i offered yet another apology i dont mean that she said hurriedly but genesis is heavily into survivalism didnt you know that i dont even know what survivalism is she bit her lower lip as she framed her definition its a kind of apocalyptic horror thing know what i mean no survivalists say that the nuclear holocaust is inevitable but theyre determined to survive it right so they live in really remote places and they have guns so that if any other survivor tries to take their women or food stocks they can fight them off charming i said its kind of freaky jackie agreed then stopped talking as an eighteenwheel truck like the one that had nearly killed me the previous night overtook us in a thunder of vibration and noise jackie was plainly terrified by the trucks looming proximity and i wondered how she was ever going to endure the hundreds of miles between here and kalamazoo why did they leave british columbia i asked she shook her head i dont know unless they just wanted to be somewhere more remote their island was pretty terrible sort of coldwater standpipes and mud everywhere and real primitive but a sympathizer let them use it for free and it had a sheltered harbor for their boats i guess boats are important to von rellsteb do you know anything about boats a bit i said then changed the subject back who was the sympathizer who gave them an island shes a rich widow whos into new age you know channellers and crystals and all that really weird stuff i think she was charmed by von rellsteb i mean she was really cut up when he just left her without saying anything he didnt even tell her where they were going jackie paused she must have given him money and i guess he was screwing her she touchingly glanced at me to make certain i was not embarrassed by her allegation she thought that maybe hed moved genesis to europe because they disappeared soon after he came back from his european trip but i dont think shes right i think theyre still in the north pacific with my daughter i said grimly and jackie then wanted to know about nicole and so i spent a half hour telling my familys story before we stopped for lunch at a waterfront cafe where jackie ordered a salad of celery lettuce and a ghastly concoction called tofu which she told me was made from soybeans but looked to me like the foam insulation that my boatyard sometimes pumps into the space between a steel hull and the cabin paneling i assume youre a vegetarian i asked her i havent eaten flesh since i was six she said enthusiastically mom tried to make me eat chicken or turkey and some fish as well because she said i needed the protein to grow properly but i couldnt bear to think of all the suffering and even at thanksgiving i used to make my own fake turkey with vegetables and bread i used to mix them and jackie i said warningly i know she was instantly contrite im talking too much she suppressed a shudder at the size of the steak on my plate then reverted to the safer subject of the genesis community she told me how difficult it was to get even the smallest scraps of information we cant even talk to people who used to belong because so far as we know not one member of genesis has ever left the community since they moved out of british columbia not one a handful left before that but none of them know where von rellsteb might have gone it took me a few seconds to understand the implication of jackies news you think he kills them if they try to escape jackie was unwilling to endorse the implication of murder but she thought it more than probable that some members of genesis were being held against their will i never got beyond the pier when i visited british columbia she said but i got this really bad feeling i mean like von rellsteb was into control like heavy discipline i spoke to this professor at berkeley and he told me that a lot of utopian groups finish up by substituting control systems for consensus because their leaders arent really into agreement and compromise but have this blueprint which they insist will only work if its followed exactly and they somehow manage to impose it on the group then enforce it with rewards and punishments do you know what i mean i was nodding eagerly because jackie was reinforcing my own theory that von rellsteb had some kind of sinister mastery over his followers and jackies revelation offered an explanation of my daughters silence nicole had ignored me because she had no choice nicole was not a convert but a convict and i told jackie about the unsettling image of the three girls wearing von rellstebs strange green uniform on the day nicole had sailed away its not just uniforms jackie said this guy at berkeley says these groups make really weird hierarchies for themselves some groups degrade into slaves and owners and in others the underlings have to work their way up the hierarchy by pleasing the guys at the top it makes sense i spoke enthusiastically for how else could my nicoles vivid spirit have been broken except by some brutal methodology nicole i suddenly knew was a prisoner and my suspicion that von rellsteb used his disciples to make himself wealthy seemed overwhelmingly confirmed by jackies description of how utopian ideals deteriorated into fascist regimes jackie suddenly looked very troubled arent you going to eat your salad of course not im not a rabbit its good for you she waited to see if that encouragement would make me relent then took the salad for herself when it was obvious i was not going to eat it i watched as she picked at the lettuce why doesnt your editor want you to write about genesis i asked her because he doesnt really believe genesis is as bad as i say and the paper cant afford to send me all over the world to find out if im right and i havent got enough proof or experience to persuade a bigger newspaper to let me do it if i took the story to a chicago paper theyd just put one of their own staffers on it which means id be passing up my best chance of a pulitzer so im chasing the story in my own time and with mollys help of course so you can get a pulitzer sure why not she responded as though that achievement was well within her grasp and i decided there was more to ms jackie potten than her unprepossessing exterior promised it depends on the story of course she explained i mean if von rellsteb really is holding people against their will then it will be a pulitzer story but if hes running just another survivalist commune then its page thirtytwo beneath the fold its no story at all i said if you cant find him what id like to do is track down where he gets his money of course id like to find where theyre all living but i guess that would be difficult because the coast of alaska is really huge and its got lots of inlets and islands they could be anywhere and maybe theyre not even in alaska she sounded rather despairing at the difficulty of the task she had set herself then she cheered up but there might be another way of finding them the paper trail paper trail i asked in bemusement people cant just disappear jackie said with renewed enthusiasm there are always records how does the genesis community get their money they must use a bank somewhere and if they use a bank then the internal revenue service has to know about them so maybe i should go that route i know where they get their money i said with some satisfaction where she was immediately interested so i told jackie about my suspicions that von rellsteb was raising funds by forcing inheritances onto his cowed followers who in turn would pass the money to von rellsteb after all if joanna and i had both died in the english channel then nicole would have inherited our expensive house that overlooked the sea our investments and our boatyard with its healthy cashflow and if nicole was indeed a brainwashed prisoner of the genesis community as i now believed her to be then von rellsteb would have become the effective owner of that plump legacy and i had no doubt that von rellsteb was still interested in that legacy why else i asked would he have raised the matter of nicoles inheritance he did what i told jackie about von rellstebs odd concern that perhaps nicole might have been disinherited isnt it obvious why he raised the subject i asked her i dont know jackie was clearly unconvinced by my theory i havent heard of any other genesis parents just disappearing and why would von rellsteb go all the way to europe to find a victim a lot of his followers come from canada or the states so why not pick on them because i suggested a murder in europe is far less likely to be traced back to a commune in alaska jackie was still unconvinced it would be a messy way of making money think of all the other family members hed have to deal with let alone the lawyers mind youshe was clearly worried that i might be upset by her abrupt dismissal of my theory so she tried to soften itwe know so little about what makes von rellsteb tick i still havent discovered why he went to europe four years ago and it was clearly important because it was after that trip that the whole commune disappeared jackie was referring to the journey during which he had met nicole and i suggested that perhaps von rellsteb had been on a recruiting trip maybe jackie said but without enthusiam perhaps he was going back to germany i said he must have relatives there jackie stared at me then very slowly laid down her fork i bet thats why he went to europe she said in the tone of voice that betrayed the dawning of an idea why oh boy why didnt i think of that what jeez she was mad at herself wow ive been dumb you know that really dumb his father father only his mother emigrated to canada theres no record of a father but ill bet thats it then being jackie she told me the story from its very beginning from the time that caspar von rellsteb had been born in hamburg in the very last months of the second world war which i realized with a pang made him almost my exact contemporary jackie confessed that she had discovered nothing about von rellstebs real father but had instead concentrated her research on his mother who had been a german national called eva fellnagel in eva fellnagel had married a canadian army sergeant called skinner and afterward had gone to live with him in vancouver caspar evas son had traveled with the couple and though the marriage to sergeant skinner had not lasted long it had been sufficient to secure both eva and her son canadian citizenship jackie said she had always assumed caspars aristocratic surname had been an affectation wished on him by his mother but perhaps there really was a von rellsteb jackie said excitedly and maybe thats why caspar went to europe to find his real father and if we could find him too i suggested sure jackie was excited certain that by retracing von rellstebs european footsteps she could track him all the way down to the present then her face fell theres just one problem she said ruefully id have to go to germany which you cant afford to do i took a guess at the reason for her dubiety i havent got any money she confessed and mollys spent almost all her savings ive got money i said very simply because suddenly life had become extremely simple nicole was being held prisoner by a man who was trying to forge his own insane utopia i would find that mans hiding place and i would free my daughter it would take money but i had money and i would do anything to get my daughter back i was going hunting youve done what david asked me when i told him the results of my american visit ive hired an investigator oh good god youve hired someone to do what to find nicole of course good god at first i thought david was upset because of my profligacy but then i realized he was frightened of my obsession with nicole expecting it to end in crippling disappointment tell me for gods sake i told him about jackie potten and the telling took all the way from heathrow airport to the coast where before taking me home david stopped for lunch at the stave and anchor we sat at our usual table by the fire where i took pleasure in a pint of decenttasting beer and david took an equal pleasure in mocking me so let us celebrate your achievements tim you have permitted some american girl to fleece you of sixteen hundred pounds i do applaud you tim i really do it was lunchtime but a depression that had brought a gale of wind and rain up the channel had also fetched a mass of clouds that made the pub windows as dark as evening the lights were on in the bar where a group of idle fisherman amused themselves by listening to our conversation i tried to defend myself against davids scorn jackie potten is a very enterprising reporter i insisted with as much dignity as my tiredness would allow thats what i like about the americans theyre so full of enthusiasm theyre not like us you mean they dont roam the world giving away their wealth to passing females david inquired robustly good god tim the trollop must have thought christmas had arrived early she must think you are the greatest fool in christendom you never did have any sense of financial responsibility i am merely subsidizing jackies investigations i insisted oh dear lord my brother said in despair he scratched a match on the stone of the hearth then laboriously lit his pipe as he prepared his next broadside you remind me of tuppy hargreaves do you remember tuppy he had that very rich parish in dorset and a rather grand wife but he abandoned them both to run away with a girl young enough to be his granddaughter and in no time at all the poor sod was wearing a wig and gobbling down vitamins and monkeygland extract he died of a heart attack in bognor regis as i recall and the floozie drove off with an italian hairdresser in tuppys wolseley i took the cremation service in some ghastly place near southampton they only paid me two pounds i remember two measly pounds no doubt a similar fate awaits you tim with this jackie creature dont be ridiculous i said it is not me being ridiculous david said very grandly then gave me a most suspicious glance was this child beautiful did she bat false eyelashes at you is that it i am merely paying for jackie to continue her investigation of genesis her investigation of gullibility david pounced gleefully good god tim how gullible can a grown man be this miss potten presents you with a few tattered assumptions about the genesis community and you reward her with the balance of monies in your pocket barely leaving yourself enough to buy a pint of ale do you really believe shell travel to germany on your behalf david despite his calling had little faith in humankind not that we can do much about the girl now he went on youre home the damage is done so now you can do some proper work what does that mean i asked suspiciously it means that your boatyard now that youve had your fling could profit from a firm managerial touch david usually kept an eye on the yard while i was away not that billy doesnt do his best he added hastily because he does but he hasnt got the swiftest brain ive ever encountered in a parishioner and hes a hopeless salesman and thats what you need tim a salesman you must sell some of the yards inventory before you entirely run out of space you wont believe this but tortaucitron is back on the market god knows what that lawyer thought he was playing at when he bought her but youve got her back and doubtless youll have to haul her out of the water and let her clutter up the yard again stormchild is for sale again i asked in mild astonishment stormchild yes or tortaucitron david confirmed it seems young miller rather overplayed his hand in buying the boat and his partners are now understandably keen to get the brute off their books i warned them that in todays market it wont sell quickly but if you can find a buyer tim i think theyll be willing to drop their price pretty savagely in fact i think theyll take a loss just to put the whole embarrassing exercise behind them maybe theyll go as low as ninetyfive i wondered good lord no david seemed offended youll have to ask a higher price than that at least a hundred and ten thousand remember tim youre on a brokers percentage and theyre lawyers in the words of the good lord himself screw the wretches till they squeal ninetyfive i said again because ive already got a buyer lined up david stared at me with a gratifying amazement you do yes i said me that stopped david cold he gazed at me for a few seconds over the rim of his glass took a long swallow of ale then momentarily closed his eyes i could have sworn you said you intended to purchase tortaucitron for yourself please inform me that i misheard instead of answering i took our glasses to the bar and had them refilled when i carried the pints back to the table i confirmed davids worst suspicions ive decided to sell the house i said put a sales manager into the yard and buy stormchild i was damned if i would go to sea in a boat named after some legal jest she would have her old name back with any luck ill be away before christmas cheers i raised my glass to david go and see doc stilgoe and have him prescribe you a nerve tonic my brother advised i smiled truly david ive had time to think about my life and i dont want it to trickle on like it is besides i was never any damned good at running the business joanna was always the one who did the books and im a much better sailor than i am a salesman so ill buy stormchild then go looking for nicole you cant just disappear david exploded at me why ever not nicole did she was young she was a fool she was irresponsible and im alone i said and what responsibilities do i have you have responsibilities to nicole for a start david said trenchantly if the silly girl ever does decide to come home then its going to be mighty difficult for her if home is halfway round the globe and still moving nickels not coming home david none of the genesis community has ever left von rellsteb at least not since he went into hiding maybe some of his followers have tried to escape but hes made damn sure that none get away to tell any tales so what the hell are you going to do just wander away on a boat and grow a beard im going to find nicole of course i said then held up a hand to stop david from interrupting me i believe shes being held against her will i cant prove that of course unless i find her so thats what ill do david snorted derision you are mad he was scornful yet i also heard doubt in my brothers voice as though he knew i was right and was simply reluctant to admit it no i said very seriously im doing what you and i have often dreamed of doing im going on an adventure an oldfashioned quest across far seas and perhaps at the end of it i shall find nicole my dear tim what terrible things the florida sun has done to your sanity david said though i heard a distinct tone of jealousy in his voice david often complained that the world had become dull and offered no chances for adventure why dont you come with me i asked him he laughed my dear tim im busy god will give you a sabbatical wont he im overdue for one he said wistfully and i could see he was tempted but he was also frightened of the temptation in some ways the relationship between david and myself was like the one that had existed between nicole and her brother nicole like me was the daring one the instigator of mischief while david like dickie was more cautious my brother tough as he was did not like embarking on uncertain endeavors that i often thought was why he preferred dinghy sailing to deepwater cruising however fast and exciting a racing dinghy might seem it is almost always sailed within sight of land in sheltered waters and in daylight bluewater cruisers on the other hand go out into the great waters where tempests darkness and dangers wait damn it tim id love to come david now said but duty forbids outside the pub the gray wind beat bleak rain across the towns roofs and brought the far sound of the wild seas breaking on the rivers bar to me the noise was music for it was the sound that would take me back to sea and to the worlds far ends and if god willed it back to nicole in a boat called stormchild i craned tortaucitron out of the water scrubbed her hull clean of a seasons weed and barnacles then gave her a triple coating of antifouling paint first though i took the ridiculous name off her transom and painted her original name in its place she was stormchild again and i was sentimental enough to think that the lovely boat was grateful for the change i paid ninetysix thousand for her she was worth nearly double that price but i had persuaded millers legal partners that she had deteriorated badly the lawyers should have insisted on a survey but they took my word on the boats condition confirming davids suspicions that millers partners were simply glad to be rid of the yacht which suited me for i now possessed a boat superbly suited to my purpose stormchild was tough but she was also fast safe and comfortable my plan was to provision her then leaving david to tie up the loose ends of my affairs i would head south across biscay i could expect a lively time of that crossing for it was already very late in the year but i would be heading into the regions of perpetual summer and when the trade wind belt moved north i would go west toward america youve heard nothing from that wretched child i suppose david never called jackie by her name that was not from unkindness but rather out of davids fear of the unknown and i who knew my brothers foibles only too well knew i would never shake his preconception that jackie being young and foreign was a threat to me ive heard nothing i confirmed a fool and his money are easily parted david said with sanctimonious relish it was five weeks after my return from florida and on a bitterly cold day he was helping me rig stormchild we had craned her into the water the day before and now she floated lone and glorious at the winter pontoons she might contact me yet i said defensively though in truth i had rather abandoned hope of jackie potten i did not for one moment credit davids belief that she had cheated me but i did fear that her investigatory skills had not proved equal to discovering why von rellsteb had made his journey to europe i had not heard from jackie nor from nicole i had harbored a secret hope that the carefully written letter i had given to von rellsteb on sun kiss key would spur nicole into a reply but i had to assume that the letter had never been delivered if that wretched girl doesnt come through with the goods david said acidly then youre sailing into the unknown are you not not really i think alaska or british columbia are the places to search i had bought the admiralty charts for those far inhospitable and secretive coasts and the more i studied the charts the more i became convinced that von rellsteb might indeed have taken refuge in one of the tortuous inlets of the north pacific in that expectation i now prepared stormchild for desolate and icy waters i had put a dieselpowered heater into her saloon and new layers of insulation inside her cold steel hull i had built extra water and fuel tanks into her belly and crammed spare parts and tools into every locker i had treated myself to the best foulweather gear that money could buy and i was stocking stormchilds galley with the kind of food that fought off winters gloom cartons of thick soups cans of steak and kidney pies stewed beef and plum duff thus day by cold day my boat settled lower in the water some of the equipment i needed was not available from my own chandlery or from any yachtsmans discount catalog i had been alarmed by jackie pottens description of the genesis community as survivalists and impressed by her contention that utopian communes often became degraded by the imposition of a controlling discipline and i did not want to face such a belligerent group unarmed so i quietly put the word about that i was in the market for a good rifle billy my foreman solved the problem by revealing that his father had hoarded two british army rifles as souvenirs of his war service silly old bugger shouldnt have them at all billy said not at his age bloody things aint licensed and all the old fool will ever do is shoot hisself in the foot one day youd be doing me a right favor to take them out of the house he wanted me to buy both rifles they were leeenfields the no mark i version which was a robust boltaction weapon tough and forgiving with a tenshot magazine and a maximum range of twelve hundred yards though only an optimist would bother to take aim if the target was much above three hundred paces the leeenfield had once been the standard rifle of the british forces and was still used by armies that appreciated the merits of its rugged construction both guns still had their armyissue brasstipped webbing slings while their stocks and barrel sleevings had been lovingly polished with linseed oil david helped me hide the two guns deep inside stormchild one we placed in a specially disguised compartment under the generator in the bow while the other we hid behind the timber paneling of the after companionway its sensible to take two david said with a most unchristian relish because if one goes wrong then you can always shoot von rellsteb with the second one dont be daft i said im not going to shoot him im only taking the guns as a precaution dont let him shoot first david warned me to my brother stormchilds voyage had transformed itself from an exercise in futility to an enviable demonstration of moral absolutes that would end with good triumphing over evil davids initial opposition to my expedition had changed when i told him how idealistic communes like the genesis community often became fouled by the politics of domination to david therefore nicole had become a pristine maiden victimized by a prussian villain and that dislike intensified when i told david of my conversation with von rellsteb and how he had expressed a desire to live at one with the planet that was just the kind of heretical mysticism that brought out the christian soldier in my straightforward brother and so enthused by righteous indignation he encouraged me to slay the enemy and release nicole but that enemy was well armed and i was sailing alone which was one of the reasons i wanted david who was my closest friend as well as my brother to accompany me i made my strongest effort to change his mind on the day when at long last we took stormchild for a long shakedown sail off the southern english coast nothing would please me more than to accompany you david said but its impossible betty wouldnt mind would she shes all for it she says it would do me good david was standing at stormchilds wheel which in the manner of many brilliant dinghy helmsmen who find themselves sailing a larger yacht he twitched far too frequently we had left the river long before dawn and flown upchannel in the grip of a bitter east wind that had now gentled and backed into an evening whisper stormchild had taken the days whitetopped waves beautifully while now serene and beautiful she ghosted the evenings flood tide homeward she sails very sweetly david said as he glanced up at her towering sunsettouched main she does i agreed but i still wouldnt mind a second pair of hands aboard doubtless doubtless david crouched out of the small wind to light his pipe then chucked the dead match overboard even the bishop said a sabbatical might do me good he added wistfully then come i said exasperated by his refusal it would be sheer irresponsibility he said with a touch of irascibility besides im older than you i dont think i could cope with the discomforts of longdistance cruising balls he shrugged if i could find someone to look after the parishes i would maybe he sounded very uncertain i wish you would come think of all the bird life in alaska there is that he said wistfully david and betty were both ardent ornithologists and their house was filled with bird books and pictures so come i urged him he shook his head youve been itching to make a long voyage for years tim its been too long since you sailed round the world but im not itching for the same thing ive become a creature of habit people think im a curmudgeonly old clergyman and thats exactly what i want to be you go and ill stay at home and pray for you and ill keep a pastoral eye on the boatyard too if you change your mind i said you can always fly out and join me thats true thats true our wake was now just a shimmer of evening light proof how seakindly was stormchilds sleek hull we were hurrying home in an autumn dusk sliding past a dark shore where the first lights hazed the misted hills yellow there was a chill in the air a foretaste of winter an invitation to follow the migrating birds and turn our boats bows south in front of us the sea was dark studded by the winking lights of the buoys while astern of stormchild the empty sea was touched with the dying suns gold so that it looked like a shining path which would lead to the earths farthest ends and to where all our secret hopes and wildest dreams might one day come true i had stormchilds compasses swung professionally then had a technician give her radar a final service i had learned that the alaskan coast was prey to shipkilling fogs so the radar was more than a frill it was a necessity the aerial was mounted at the masts upper spreaders and fed its signal to two screens a main one above the navigation station at the foot of the companionway and a repeater screen that was mounted in the yachts center cockpit a new spray hood arrived it was made from stout blue canvas with clear plastic windows that would shelter the forward section of stormchilds cockpit against the bitter northern seas and shrieking winds stormchild had a small auxiliary wheel mounted in that forward section of the cockpit while the main wheel was further aft astern of the large main wheel was the teakplanked coach roof over the after cabin that cabin was the most comfortable aboard but not in a rough sea when the motion amidships was always easier so i was using the after cabin as a storeroom i planned to live sleep navigate and cook in the main living quarters amidships on the starboard side of those midships quarters was the navigation station which was equipped with a generous table good chart stowage and plenty of space for the radios and instrumentation aft of the navigation table was a shower and lavatory while opposite on the port side of the companionway was a large galley forward of the galley was the saloon with its two wide sofas table and wall of shelves that held books and cassette tapes the dieselpowered heater looked something like a small and complex woodstove and gave the saloon a decidedly cozy air a feeling heightened by the framed pictures and glassshaded oil lamps forward of the main cabin were two smaller sleeping cabins that shared a common bathroom i had turned one of the cabins into a engineering workroom while the other was crammed with stores last were two chain lockers a sail locker and a watertight compartment that held stormchilds small diesel generator under which one of the two rifles was hidden on deck i had a life raft in a container a dinghy that was lashed to the aftercoach roof and a stout rack filled with boat hooks whisker poles and oars at the stern on a short staff i flew the bombscarred red ensign which had flown from slipslider and which the navy had rescued from the channel i would take that ragged flag to my own journeys end as a symbol of joanna stormchild had been rerigged repainted and replenished the work had taken me eight weeks exactly and now she was ready the sale of my house was progressing smoothly the boatyard had a new manager and all i needed now was the right weather to slip down channel and round ushant that weather arrived in early november and i topped up stormchilds water and fuel tanks checked her inventory one more time then went ashore for my last night in england i stayed with david and betty and used their telephone to make a final effort to reach jackie potten there was no answer from jackies telephone and only the answering machine responded when i called molly tettermans house so much for the ladies of kalamazoo i thought and put the phone down without leaving any message the next morning in a cold rain and gusting wind i carried the last of my luggage down to the boatyard where the heavily laden stormchild waited at the pontoon friends had come to bid me farewell and cheered when davids wife betty broke a bottle of champagne on stormchilds stemhead david said a prayer of blessing over the boat then we all trooped below to drink more champagne david and betty gave me two parting gifts a book about alaskan birds and the book of common prayer not the modern rubbish david assured me but the version it was a beautiful and ancient book with a morocco leather binding and giltedged pages too good for the boat i protested nonsense it isnt for decoration anyway but for use take it billy on behalf of the boatyard staff then presented me with a ships bell that he ceremoniously hung above the main companionway its proper brass boss he told me so itll tarnish like buggery but thatll make you think of us every time you have to clean the sod we opened still more champagne though i who would be taking stormchild down channel when the tide ebbed only drank two glasses it was a sad bittersweet day a parting but also a beginning i went to find my daughter but i also went to fulfill a dream that had given such joy to joanna the dream of living aboard a cruising boat of following the warm winds and long waves i was going away leaving no address and no promise of a return at midday as the tide became fair my guests climbed back onto the pontoon friends shouted farewells as the rain slicked stormchilds teak deck dark i started the big engine billy disconnected the shoreside electricity then slipped my springs leaving the big yacht tethered only by her bow and stern lines david was the last to leave the boat he gripped my hand good luck he said and god bless are you sure you wont come good luck he said again then climbed ashore i looked ahead past stormchilds bows at the rainbeaten river down which joanna had sailed to her death and from where nicole had sailed into oblivion now it was my turn to leave and i glanced up at the hill where my wife and son were buried and i said my own small prayer of farewell people were shouting their goodbyes most were laughing and a few were crying someone threw a paper streamer billy had already let go the bow line and david was standing by the aft ready tim he shouted let go i called youre free tim david tossed the bitter end of the aft line onto stormchilds deck good luck god bless bon voyage i put the engine into gear water seethed at stormchilds stern as she drew heavily and slowly away from her berth next stop the canaries goodbye a score of voices shouted good luck tim more paper streamers arced across stormchilds guardrails and sagged into the widening strip of graywhite water bon voyage i waved and there were tears in my eyes as the streamers stretched taut snapped and fell away one of the boatyard staff was sounding a raucous farewell on an airpowered foghorn goodbye i shouted one last time mr blackburn a small and determined voice screamed above the racket and i glanced back across the strip of propellerchurned water and there crammed among my friends and dressed in a baggy sweater and shapeless trousers with her bulging handbag gripped in a thin pale hand was the lady from kalamazoo jackie potten had surfaced at last she had not let me down after all mr blackburn she shouted again i banged stormchilds gearbox into reverse white water foamed and boiled as the propeller struggled to check the deadweight of over twenty tons of boat and supplies i slung a line ashore david and billy hauled and ignominiously just thirty seconds after leaving i and my boat came home again jackie potten was panting from the exertion of running through the boatyard carrying a suitcase and her enormous handbag a man at the marina office said you were leaving and i just ran she explained her breathlessness and i cant believe i caught you wow this is some boat is it yours yes mine i ushered jackie into stormchilds cockpit where i introduced her to david and betty who alone of the rather bemused crowd who had come to bid me farewell had returned on board the yacht my brother now behaved with an excruciating gallantry toward her he invited her down into the saloon enjoining her to watch the stairs and not to crack her skull on the companionway lintel i tried to telephone you from london airportjackie talked to me all the way down into the saloonbut they said your home number was disconnected and then i telephoned the boatyard and they said you were leaving today and i would have been here hours ago but british rail is some kind of joke they just pretend to run a railroad anyway i caught a bus in the end which was kind of interesting is this some cabin are those books for real you read yeats the yeats belonged to nicole i said i had put a lot of nicoles books onto the shelves which were equipped with varnished drop bars to hold their contents against the seas motion is this really a stove thats neat i didnt know you could heat boats and a carpet wow this is more comfortable than my apartment david standing beside me at the chart table watched jackie explore the big saloon i see i did you an injustice he said softly meaning shes hardly a salome is she or a cleopatra not at all the sultry jezebel i had imagined i hired her for her journalistic skills i said testily not for her looks thank god for that david said with amusement and jackie in her voluminous and colorless clothes did look more than ever like some drab wan and orphaned child an impression that was not helped by a brown felt hat of spectacular ugliness can i use this jackie potten referred to the saloon table where she sat and spread some crumpled and dirty papers i have to account for your money see i guess i really did some pretty dumb things and im not really sure that i separated out all mollys german expenses from mine you took mrs tetterman to germany i interrupted to ask sure but not on your money really she sounded very anxious guides honor david instantly divining the girls innocence could not resist teasing her guides honor jackie frowned at him oh you mean like girl scouts sure scouts honor except maybe some of the receipts got muddled and thats why i need to run through the paperwork with you mr blackburn because you never said that molly should go but she kind of insisted and shes really hard to turn down know what i mean and she speaks german too so it was a real help having her along but we got those tickets you book thirty days in advance and we traveled midweek only my ticket cost a lot more because i had to come here as well and molly didnt shes flying straight back to detroit while ive come to report to you i dont think we were really extravagant i mean we stayed at this real fleabag it was weird they had a pool which i thought was kind of neat but the germans swim naked these fat guys right really gross molly said it was just natural and healthy and she went skinnydipping with them but i couldnt do it i really couldnt and the food was awful they dont know what vegetarian food is quiet i sang out i was only trying to tell you jackie made another valiant effort to keep going while david and betty were trying hard not to laugh aloud quiet i had entirely forgotten this girls capacity to talk i put a finger on my lips to keep her silent as i walked slowly to the cabin table once there i put my hands on the tables edge and bent toward jackie pottens indignant pale face did you find out why caspar von rellsteb sailed to europe fourandahalf years ago i asked her at last thats exactly what i was about to tell you jackie said very indignantly yes i did oh blessed girl i sat opposite her so tell me now i was already telling you ok i held my hands up in mock surrender please continue molly insisted on going to hamburg because that was where von rellstebs mother came from molly said two heads were better than one and it really was a good idea because she speaks german and she found this lawyer and he was terrific he had a cousin who lives in detroit and i guess that helped because we could tell him all about detroit and he was really interested because hes never been to the states and he was thinking of going in fact he was thinking he might go this christmas and molly jackie i snapped i do not care where your goddamned hamburg lawyer will spend his christmas i want to know about caspar von rellsteb david was half choking with laughter while betty who was used to organizing the waifs and strays of society looked as though she wanted to tuck jackie under her arm and carry her away for a proper feed jackie astonished at my reproof gazed wideeyed at me for a few seconds then looked contrite im sorry she said but the thing is that friedrich thats the lawyer i was telling you about was really terrific and he didnt charge us a penny and that was what i was trying to explain to you because youve got to review these accountsshe pushed the untidy pile of scruffy papers toward meto see that we didnt spend your money unwisely and friedrich and this is what ive been trying to tell you all along only you keep interrupting me knew all about the von rellsteb legacy because it was quite a celebrated case and he dug all the papers out of the archives and he gave molly and me copies and of course we paid for the photocopying youll see it down there at the bottom of page three there see twentynine marks and thats cheap for photocopying because in america you probably pay ten cents a sheet in fact a place near my house charges fifteen cents a sheet fifteen and we paid much less for two copies each of a hundred and ten pages ive got a proper receipt for the photocopying as well she dug through her vast bag i know ive got it i remember putting it aside david hugely amused by jackie had gone to the table where he leafed through her carefully handwritten accounts whats this he demanded with mock sternness six marks and thirtyseven pfenning on ice cream oh gee jackie blushed with embarrassment i told molly we shouldnt have bought the ice cream but she said it was all right because we deserved some reward for all our work and the food was really terrible all those sausages which neither of us would eat and wed run out of our own money and we just wanted some ice cream ill pay you back mr blackburn truly i will you can have the ice cream i said magnanimously if you tell me about caspar von rellsteb she did though it took her the best part of a half hour betty made us all tea and we sat in the big stateroom listening to the wind sigh in the rigging and to the rain patter on the coach roof and to the small waves slap on stormchilds hull as jackie potten slowly unveiled the mystery caspar von rellstebs father jackie said was not alive but had died in the air battles at the very end of the second world war caspar von rellsteb had discovered his fathers identity when he went through his mothers papers after her death and the same papers suggested that he might have a claim on his dead fathers considerable property he had sailed to germany to make that claim taking with him a letter in which shortly before his death oberstleutnant auguste von rellsteb had bequeathed his whole estate to caspars mother fräulein eva fellnagel the letter written from a luftwaffe station late in the war was hardly a legal will but auguste von rellsteb left no other instructions for the disposition of his property before he was killed when his fockewulf was shot down by an american mustang the legal status of the letter was challenged by the estates trustees but the german judges had dismissed the challenge and upheld the validity of oberstleutnant auguste von rellstebs last wishes caspar von rellsteb had won his case so how much did he inherit betty quite caught up in jackies breathless retelling of the story asked its kind of hard to say jackie answered then explained that the legacy went back to the early nineteenth century when a certain otto von rellsteb the youngest son of a landed junker family from east prussia had crossed the atlantic to the newly independent republic of chile otto von rellsteb like thousands of other hopeful germans had gone to buy land at the southern tip of south america an area so popular with german immigrants that it had been nicknamed the new bavaria otto unable to afford the richer farmland on the argentine pampas had purchased a huge spread of cheap coastal land in chile where he had established his finca his estate and where he had raised thousands upon thousands of sheep he had also discovered an easily quarried deposit of limestone on his finca and thus provided by nature he had prospered as had his descendants until his greatgreatgrandson auguste hating the bleak wild stormy coast and detesting the sound of sheep and loathing the dumb insolent faces of his workers had returned to europe where glorying in the reich he had joined the luftwaffe impregnated a whore with his son then died in a blazing aircraft for his führer jackie potten carefully unfolded a photocopied map that she pushed across stormchilds cabin table its there she said all thats left of the von rellsteb finca i did not look at the map instead my mind was reeling with the sudden understanding that the genesis community was not in alaska after all but in patagonia how big is the estate david turned the map toward him it was not a very helpful map showing hardly any detail but instead just some shadedin islands that rimmed the wild western coast of south america caspar inherited about twelve thousand acres jackie said the estate lost a good deal of land when allende was in power but pinochet restored most of it to the german trustees general pinochet really liked the germans you see and i guess he was kind of hoping that a german might go back and live at the finca theres evidently a really big farmhouse and there are still some industrial buildings left at the quarry because they went on extracting limestone right up until the second world war the land cant be worth anything david said dismissively but what a perfect hiding place i said and i pulled the photocopied map toward me and saw that otto von rellsteb had made his finca in the archipiélago sangre de cristo the islands of christs blood in the magellanic region of chile at the very end of the earth in the last land god made in the remotest region any man might search for his enemies in patagonia i knew something about the patagonian coast because i had once made plans to take a british army expedition there but those plans had collapsed when the ministry of defense had tediously demanded either scientific or military justification for the jaunt perhaps i had been lucky in the ministrys obduracy for though there are one or two wilder places than patagonia there is no coast on earth where the sea and wind combine to vent such an implacable and relentless anger patagonia has a coast out of a nightmare it is a seashore from hell it is a coastline that is still being formed a coastline being ripped and burned and forged from the clash of volcano and tectonic plate and of ocean and glacier on a chart the coast looks as though it has been fractured into islands so numerous they are uncountable it is a coast of dizzying cliffs murderous tidal surges howling winds whirlpools sudden fire and crushing ice it is the coast where the massive fetch of the great pacific rollers ends in numbing violence from the gulf of corcovado to the northern limit of the land of fire are five hundred miles of ragged islands about which the wild sea heaps and shatters itself white there are no roads down that coast a few wild tracks cross the andes from the grass plains of the argentine but no roads can be built parallel to the tortuous chilean coast so the only way to travel is by boat threading the narrow channels between the inland glaciers and the outer barrier islands yet even the innermost channels offer no certain safety to a mariner a chilean naval ship taking food to one of the coasts rare lighthouses was once trapped in such a channel for forty days as the frenzied pacific waves pounded the outer rocks and filled the sky with stinging whips of freezing spume within the channels where thick growths of kelp clog propellers and thicker fogs blind helmsmen and lookouts williwaws or rafagas which are sudden squalls of hurricaneforce wind hurtle down the mountainsides to explode the seemingly sheltered waters into frantic madness such winds can destroy a boat in seconds the coast inhospitable though it is still has its few inhabitants a handful of ranches cling to the islands and mainland hills there is one fishing settlement with the unlikely name of puerto eden and one surviving limestone quarry which still extracts stone but otherwise the long savage coast has been abandoned to the seas and to the winds to the smoking vents of volcanoes to the glaciers and to the earth tremors which reveal that this is a place where a seam of the planet is still grinding and tearing itself into ruin the nightmare coast comes to its end in the land of fire the tierra del fuego at cape horn where before the panama canal was dug the great ships used to die and where the biggest seas on earth still heap and surge through the narrow and shallow drake passage which runs between the land of fire and the northernmost tip of antarctica it is a horrid coast a bitter coast a dangerous and rockriven coast where men and boats die easily it was also a coast which if i was to find my child and let her loose from a madmans thrall i would have to search remember peter carterpirie i asked david i was just thinking of him carterpirie betty asked he was a mad royal marine i explained who used to sail a wooden boat to unlikely places david and i met him in greenland when we were guineapigging survival gear for the army and he rather excited us at the prospect of sailing the patagonian coast hed been there a couple of times you see and i remember he told us quite a bit about it and none of it particularly good david said grimly he said the bird life was remarkable i reproved davids pessimism lots of condors steamer ducks penguins that sort of thing if i remember rightly carterpirie went there to prove that patagonia was the breeding ground for the greatercrested snipe or something like that there is no greatercrested snipe said betty with the easy authority of an expert though there is a patagonian hummingbird the greenbacked firecrown jackie potten was staring at the three of us as though we had lost our collective marbles hummingbird she said faintly id rather like to see that hummingbird david said wistfully patagonia cant be a very comfortable place for a hummingbird i suggested i thought they sipped nectar in warm climes it cant be a very comfortable place for von rellsteb and his genesis community eitherdavid was peering at the mapif indeed theyre there where else i asked but patagonia means rather a drastic change in your plans tim does it not david inquired not really i spoke with an insouciance i did not entirely feel it just means that i turn left when i reach the pacific instead of turning right you mean jackie potten frowned at me i glanced across the table at her oh im sorry i never told you where i was going did i when you arrived i was just leaving to find the genesis community in this she gestured round stormchilds spacious saloon its a great deal more suitable than a ford escort i said very seriously you were just leaving she ignored my feeble jest but you didnt know where to look i had a mind to try alaska i explained but i would probably have tried to telephone you as soon as i reached the far side of the atlantic and i guess youd have told me to try patagonia instead so now youll just go to chile jackie seemed astonished that such a decision could be made so lightly how do you get there sail south till the butter melts then turn right david offered the ancient joke ill sail south to the canary islands i offered more sensibly and wait there till the trade winds establish themselves then ill run across to the west indies after that itll be a brisk sail to panama and im guessing now because im not familiar with the waters but i imagine it will be easier to go west into the pacific then dogleg back to south america rather than fight the humboldt current all the way down the coast and with any luck i should be in chile by march next year which will be toward the end of their summer and if theres ever a good time to sail in patagonian waters late summer is probably that time wow jackie potten said in what i took to be admiration but then it was her turn to astound me can i come stormchild sailed on the next tide just after midnight she slipped unseen down the river with her navigation lights softly blurred by the light rain instead of the champagne parting and the paper streamers there had only been david and betty calling their farewells from the pontoons and once their voices had been lost in the night there were only the sounds of the big motor in stormchilds belly the splash of the water at her stem and the hiss of the wet wind that wind was southerly but the forecast promised it would back easterly by dawn and if the forecast held good i could not hope for a better departure wind it was blowing hard but the big heavily laden and steelhulled stormchild needed a good wind to shift her ponderous weight i raised sail at the rivers mouth killed the engine and hardened onto a broad reach the wake foamed white into the blackness astern as the coastal lights winked and faded in the rain that still pattered on the deck and dripped from the rigging the green and red lights of the rivers buoys vanished astern and soon the only mark to guide stormchild was the flickering loom of the far portland light i had lost count of how many times i had begun voyages in just this manner slipping on a fast tide downchannel making my way southerly to avoid the tidal rips that churn off the great headlands of southern england then letting my boat tear her way westward toward the open atlantic yet however many times i had done it there was always the same excitement gee but its cold jackie potten said suddenly if youre going to moan all the way across the atlantic i snapped then ill turn round now and drop you off there was a stunned silence i had surprised myself by the anger in my voice which had clearly made jackie intensely miserable i felt sorry that i had snapped at her but i also felt justified for i was not at all sure that i wanted her on board stormchild but the notion of jackie accompanying me had energized david and betty with a vast amusement and they had overriden my objections with their joint enthusiasm betty had taken jackie shopping returning with a carload of vegetarian supplies and armfuls of expensive foulweather gear that i had been forced to pay for i had ventured to ask the american girl whether she had any sailing experience at all only to be told that she and her mother had once spent a week on a miamibased cruise ship but you can cook cant you david had demanded a bit jackie had been confused by the question then you wont be entirely useless davids characteristic bluntness had left jackie rather dazed dazed or not jackie was now my sole companion on stormchild which meant i had the inconvenience of sharing a boat with a complete novice i could not let her take a watch or even helm the ship until i had trained her in basic seamanship and that training was going to slow me down worse she might prove to be seasick or utterly incompetent all in all i was sourly thinking it had been bloody inconsiderate of david and betty to have encouraged her to join the ship there was also another and murkier reason for my unhappiness i had felt an inexplicable tug of attraction toward this odd little stray girl and i did not want that irrational feeling to be nurtured by the forced intimacy of a small boat i told myself i did not need the complication and that this girl was too young too naive too idealistic too noisy and too pathetic i thought you had a job to go home to i said nastily as though being reminded of her employment jackie might suddenly demand to be put ashore arent you the kalamazoo gazettes star reporter i was fired she said miserably what for talking too much i immediately regretted the jibe and apologized i do talk too much she said i know i do but that wasnt why i was fired i was fired because i insisted on going to hamburg i was supposed to be writing some articles on date rape in junior high schools but i thought the genesis community was a better story so i left the paper and now ive got a chance to sail the atlantic so you see i was quite right molly says that we should always take our chances in life or else well miss out on everything its a pity to miss out on roast beef i said nastily what is all that sprouting shit you brought on board it isnt shit she said in a hurt voice you put seeds in the trays water them twice a day and harvest the sprouts its a really good fresh source of protein i glanced up at the pale mass of the mainsail did you know that hitler and mussolini were both vegetarians and so was the guy who founded the kgb there was a pause then miss jackie potten showed me another side of her character i know youre captain of this ship she said but i think its important that we respect each others beliefs and that we dont mock each others private convictions i kind of think thats really crucial i had just been told off by a floozy young enough to be my daughter i was so mortified that i said nothing but just clung to the big wheel and glanced down at the binnacle to make certain we were still on a course of degrees because we all need our private space jackie went doggedly on evidently translating my silence as incomprehension and if we dont recognize each others unique human qualities mr blackburn then we wont respect each other and i really believe that we need to share mutual respect if were to spend so much time together youre right i said briskly and im sorry i meant the apology too though my voice probably sounded too robust to convey the contrition i genuinely felt but i had been boorish and jackie had been right to protest she had also been very brave but it was evident from the embarrassed silence that followed that the display of defiance had exhausted her courage is there anything i can do to help then she finally asked me in a very small and very timid voice you can call me tim i said and then you can go below and make me a mug of coffee with caffeine and milk but no sugar and you can get me a corned beef sandwich with butter and mustard but nothing else and certainly with nothing green in it right tim she said and went to do it by the time we docked in las palmas in the canary islands i had developed a healthy respect for the fraillooking jackie potten not that she looked so frail anymore for fifteen hundred sea miles had put some healthy color into her cheeks and bleached her mousy hair into pale gold after her complaint about feeling cold on our first night out she had uttered not a single grievance in fact she had proved to possess a patient tenacity that was well suited to sailing and despite her fondness for a diet that might have starved an anorexic stickinsect she had a stomach that could take the roughest motion of the waves in the beginning as stormchild had thrashed into the great gray channel rollers with their hissing and bubbling white tops jackie had been nervous especially when the first sullen dawn showed that we were out of sight of land that to me is always a special moment when at last you can look around the horizon and see nothing but gods good ocean for jackie when all she saw was the cold crinkling heave of the careless waves her overwhelming sensation was the terror of insignificance the terror did not last instead she began to enjoy the challenge and learned to have confidence in the boat and in her own ability to control stormchild within two days she was watchkeeping alone at first only by daylight but within a week she was standing the night watches and all traces of her initial nervousness had disappeared she was a natural sailor and as her competence grew her character hardened out of timidity into confidence she even talked less and i realized her previous volubility had been merely a symptom of shyness we marked off our private territories within the boat jackie had excavated a sleeping space among the heaped stores in the starboard forward cabin where she settled like some small cozy animal once in a while i would hear her speaking aloud in that cabin at first i thought she was just chattering to herself but later i learned she was dictating into a small tape recorder she was making a record of the journey but would not let me listen to the tape im just making notes she said disparagingly only rough notes we raced across biscay where jackie equipped with stormchilds copy of the birds of britain and europe learned to identify the various seabirds that kept us company there were fulmars on either beam storm petrels flickering above our wake and handsome slimwinged shearwaters effortlessly skimming all about us as jackie learned to identify the birds i taught myself more about stormchilds character she was a stubborn boat good in heavy seas but sluggish and sullen when ten days into our voyage we encountered light winds north and east of madeira the winds eventually died to a flat calm and the sails slatted uselessly to the boats motion on the long swell i was tempted to turn on the powerful engine but there was no point in wasting fuel for nothing would hurry the establishment of the trade winds and i reasoned that we might just as well wait it out at sea than pay daily harbor fees of seventy pesetas per foot of boat length in a canary islands port after three days the winds came again and stormchild dipped her bows to the long ocean swell the weather had turned fiercely warm i changed into shorts but jackie had no summer clothes so stayed in her usual baggy attire i stored our foulweather gear in a hanging locker and suspected that storms apart we would not need the heavy warm clothes again until we had long cleared the panama canal for now we were entering the latitudes of the perpetual lotuseaters and would stay in these warm latitudes for weeks we raised the canary islands on a sunday morning and by midafternoon we had cleared the spanish immigration procedures in las palmas jackie was wideeyed with the realization that it was in this ancient harbor that columbus himself had waited for the trade winds to take him into the unknown west next day for lack of space in las palmas we moved to the harbor at mogan on the islands south coast mogan like all the other island harbors was crammed with cruising yachts waiting to make the atlantic crossing there had been a time when barely a dozen small yachts a year made this passage but now the canary island ports could scarcely keep up with the demand for berth space hundreds of boats would cross with us making a great flock of sails that would speed across the blue heart of the atlantic so how long do we wait for the trade winds jackie asked a month maybe longer we collected our mail from the english pub where david god bless him had sent every available chart of the patagonian coast he had also sent me the details of the chilean governments regulations for visiting boats which were complex together with his advice to see a chilean consul somewhere in central america im going to talk to peter carterpirie he wrote to me for his advice on sailing the patagonian channels ill have his words of wisdom waiting for you poste restante in antigua with copies to panama betty and i send best wishes to the lady from kalamazoo that is if youre still talking to each other i could almost hear davids evil chortling as he wrote that sentence i took the charts back to stormchild where i planned to spend the afternoon studying the awful coast where the genesis community had apparently taken shelter i had stormchild to myself for jackie had taken the boats folding bicycle to explore the nearby countryside and to look for shops where she could buy galley supplies i had also instructed her to buy herself some summer clothes for the weather was stifling and she could not go on wearing her shapeless sweaters and capacious trousers i spread the patagonian charts in stormchilds cockpit over which i had rigged a white cotton awning then settled down with a tall jug of bloody marys i discovered the archipelago of christs blood to be a tortured group of islands some two hundred miles north of puerto natales which was where the settlements of tierra del fuego began i traced my finger northward from puerto natales across a tangle of islands fjords channels and glaciers and noted the odd mixture of place names some were english legacies of the great naval explorers of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries thus there was an isla darwin a nelson straits an isla duque de york and an isla victoria the majority of the names naturally enough were spanish some pious like the isla madre de dios and some ominous like the isla desolación but a good number of german names were also salted among the anglospanish mix i found a puerto weber the canal erhardt the isla stubbenkammer and the monte siegfried just enough teutonic names to record how many hopeful people had emigrated from germany to chiles bleak and inhospitable coast none of the charts marked von rellstebs finca but of the score of islands which made up the archipiélago sangre de cristo only one seemed large enough to sustain a ranch that island bore the ominous name of isla tormentos the isle of torments and i wondered if it had been so named by shipwrecked sailors who had suffered on its inhospitable coasts the long pacific shore of the isle of torments was shown as a stretch of gigantic cliffs pierced by a single fjord that reached so deep into the island it almost slashed isla tormentos in half the opposite shore of the island was far more ragged than the oceanfacing cliffs the eastern coast was a cartographers nightmare for it looked as though the island had been raggedly ripped from the rest of the archipelago to leave a tattered scattered and shattered litter of rocks and islands and shoals which in turn were all navigational hazards within the forbiddingly named estrecho desolado the desolate straits the patagonian coast was thickly printed with such depressing names but the archipiélago sangre de cristo seemed to have more than its fair share of forbidding nomenclature suggesting that sailing its labyrinthine channels would be hard and dangerous work i traced the difficult course of the desolate straits to find they were not true straits at all but rather a blind sea loch that ran uselessly into the heartland of the isle of torments i was distracted from these dispiriting researches by jackies noisy return she came laden with string bags that were crammed with papayas avocados tomatoes leeks pineapples cabbages bunches of radishes and the islands small goodtasting potatoes she was clearly delighted with the canary islands i got talking to this dutch lady whos on one of the boats moored by the wall over there and she speaks spanish and she talked to the lady in the shop and she told us that everything in the shop was grown organically everything isnt that just great tim its absolutely astonishingly terrifically wonderful i said with an utter lack of enthusiasm did you buy some organic meat for your organic skipper yeah sure of course i did she produced a cellophane pack which held a very scrawny portion of tiredlooking chicken then dived enthusiastically down the main companionway with her purchases chickens ok isnt it they had rabbits too but i really couldnt bring myself to buy a dead bunny rabbit tim im sorry she shouted the apology up from the galley where she was evidently storing the food into lockers did the dead bunnies have their paws on there was a pause then her small wedgeshaped face frowned at me from the foot of the companionway i didnt look why is it important if the paws are still on the carcass then it probably is rabbit i said but if the paws are missing then its a pretty sure bet youre looking at a dead pussycat a heartbeat of silence then no cat doesnt taste bad i said with feigned insouciance it depends on how well the family fed the pussy really the ones fed on that dry cat food taste like shit but the others are ok gross me out but she laughed then went back to her chores she began singing but her voice faded as she went forward to her own cabin while we were in port i had taken over the stern cabin to give us both some privacy at sea i could collapse onto a saloon sofa but in port it was more difficult to preserve mutual modesty if i was sprawled in the boats main living space silence settled on the boat and i guessed jackie was resting after the excitement of discovering organic stickinsect food in the middle of the atlantic i sipped my bloody mary and looked back to the charts of the archipiélago sangre de cristo i assumed that if the von rellsteb finca was indeed on the isla tormentos then it must be built on the tangled eastern coast facing the desolate straits for in the nineteenth century when the estate wanted to take its fleeces to market or to ship its quarried limestone to the world it would doubtless have used coastal sailing vessels to carry the produce north to puerto montt such ships could never have found shelter on the oceanfronting western coast so i could safely assume that the settlement if it was on the isla tormentos must stand on the eastern shore where if the old charts were accurate several bays looked promising as possible harbors tim what do you think jackies oddly coy voice startled my somnolent researches she had appeared on deck but instead of using the main companionway she had climbed through the forward hatch into the bright sunlight of stormchilds foredeck i looked up from the estrecho desolado to blink at the sudden brilliance of the tropical daylight in which to my considerable surprise a very shy jackie potten was standing in a newly bought bikini you dont like it she responded anxiously to my half second of silence i think its very nice i said with clumsy inadequacy and i knew i was not referring to the bikini which was yellow and more or less like any other bikini i had ever seen but to jackie herself who was unexpectedly revealed as sinuous and shapely and i had to look quickly down at the charts as though i had noticed nothing out of the ordinary i hope you bought some good suntan lotion i did yes lots she sounded very chastened and i guessed she had never worn anything as daring as a bikini before the dutch lady made me buy it jackie explained she said it was silly to wear too many clothes in the tropics ive bought some shorts and a skirt as well she added hurriedly because the lady in the shop said that its kind of respectful to look pretty decent in the town but that the bikinis ok on the beaches or on board a boat is it really ok she asked very earnestly yes i said very truthfully it really is ok she needed still more reassurance its a very very nice swimsuit i said inadequately and you look terrific and the realization that i had spoken the truth was suddenly very embarrassing because jackie was only a year or so older than my nicole and i also realized that i was blushing so i looked hurriedly down at my charts and tried to imagine the speed of the winds funneling through the estrecho desolado but somehow i could not concentrate on winds and tides and currents i looked back to the foredeck but jackie was lying down hidden from me by the thick coils of halyards that hung from the cleats at the base of the mainmast i sighed and shut my eyes i told myself that bringing her on this voyage was a mistake that it had always been a mistake and that now it suddenly threatened to be an even bigger mistake because i could feel the temptation to make a damn bloody great fool of myself over some crumpet from kalamazoo so i poured myself a great drink instead we waited for the winds to take us away my birthday came and jackie had somehow discovered its date and solemnly presented me with a book of robert frosts poetry that she had miraculously discovered in a secondhand bookshop in las palmas and that night she served me a birthday dinner of rabbit stew the cooking of which was a real triumph of friendship over conviction and she invited the dutch woman who had helped her shop and whose boat was moored nearby to join us with her husband the four of us sat round a dining table under the cockpits awning and three of us drank wine until at last jackie decided that she would not die if she tried it too after which four of us drank wine and told tall stories of far seas and i felt the subtly pleasurable flattery of being mistaken for jackies lover i didnt realize jackie said after the dutch couple had left us that you were kind of famous its a very fading fame i said if it ever was really fame at all the next day still waiting for the trade winds we took a ferry to lanzarote where we hired a car to explore the famous black island jackie wanted to ride one of the camels that carried tourists up the flanks of the volcano and i who had taken the uncomfortable trip before let her go on her own the camels were rigged with curious wooden seats that accommodated three people abreast one on each side and one perched high on the beasts hump and jackie found herself sitting next to a young frenchman he was obviously attracted to her and i watched the animation with which she responded to his remarks and felt a twinge of the most stupid jealousy but nevertheless a twinge so strong that i had to turn away to stare across the landscape of black lava joanna i said my wifes name to myself over and over as though the repetition would prove a talisman to help me i was tempted to insist that jackie fly home except now i did not want her to go things would be better i told myself when we could leave for then we would become absorbed in the routine of sailing a boat at sea on a shorthanded yacht a crew sees remarkably little of each other i would be awake when jackie slept and she awake when i slept and in those few moments when we might share the deck or a meal together we would be far too busy with the minutiae of navigation and shipkeeping to be worried about my adolescent fantasies more and more boats left i waited not because i wished to draw out these lotuseating days but because the winds about the islands were still depressingly light and i did not want to motor the heavy stormchild all the way south to where the unvarying trade winds blew across the atlantic i was waiting for a northerly wind to take me away and each day i haunted the splendid meteorological office in mogan to study their synoptic charts soon tim soon one of the duty weathermen would greet me each morning jackie translated my irritability as an impatience to leave the canary islands she confessed to some impatience herself declaring that she had developed an unexpected taste for sailing i mean i used to watch the yachts on lake michigan right but i never guessed i would ever be on one i thought yachts were just for the rich or at least for the middle class arent you middle class i asked idly jeez no mom works in a hardware store my dad left her when we were real little and he never sent us any money so things have always been kind of tough jackie spoke without any touch of selfpity she was sitting in a corner of the cockpit with her bare brown knees drawn up to her chin it was evening and behind her the sun was setting toward the high harbor wall and its light imbued her untidy hair with a lambent beauty she laughed suddenly mom would be really knocked out to see me now does that mean shed be pleased dont be stuffy tim of course it means shed be pleased mom always said i should get more fresh air because i guess i was kind of bookish as a kid my brother was always outofdoors but i was the familys nerd mom would be really astonished to see me now she turned to watch a graceful french sloop that was motoring slowly toward the harbor entrance a lot of boats liked to leave at nightfall thinking to use an evening breeze to spur them through the doldrums its strange i said how we dont really know our children we think we do but we dont i never thought nicole would do anything stupid then of course her brother died and she really went berserk she was fond of her brother i nodded they were inseparable i paused thinking about nicoles childhood raking over the ancient coals of guilt to discover whether i had caused her unhappiness the trouble is i was away a lot when they were little i was sailing round the world being mildly famous and joanna was always busy so the twins were left alone a lot but they were happy they did all the things kids are supposed to do i poured myself another finger of irish whiskey i was really proud of her she was a tough kid but i thought she was levelheaded jackie smiled and thats important to you tim isnt it being levelheaded absolutely and you think when nicole ran off with von rellsteb she wasnt being levelheaded of course she wasnt i said firmly maybe she was tim jackie stirred the ice cubes in her glass then added a shot of diet cola one of the advantages of being alongside a pontoon was that we could connect the boats refrigerator to shoreside electricity and thus satisfy jackies insatiable american appetite for ice cubes though jackie with her terror of ingesting anything that might harbor a microbe insisted on freezing only bottled water and not the perfectly good stuff that came out of the pontoon hose the pontoon not only had electricity and water it even had television cables so that the more lavishly equipped boats could watch dallas in spanish french or english jackie her drink suitably chilled into tastelessness frowned at me just because we both believe that caspar von rellsteb is a weird guy it doesnt mean that his group hasnt achieved some good things theyre surely right to try and stop drift netting and whaling arent they they are i agreed if thats all they do jackie heard the tension in my voice and stared gravely at me over the rim of her glass youve really convinced yourself that von rellsteb planted the bomb that killed joanna havent you i shrugged i cant think who else would have done it that was not the most convincing proof of von rellstebs guilt but it was the only explanation i could find for joannas death and the explanation convinced me we knew that von rellsteb had made himself independent of his canadian benefactress by means of his fathers legacy and it made cruel sense to me that if von rellsteb found himself in need of more money he would seek a further inheritance mine i also believed nicole to be in von rellstebs thrall a victim of his malevolent hierarchy and that she had consequently been unable to prevent his machinations we know von rellsteb uses criminal violence i began to justify my suspicions and we once jackie interrupted to reprove me we know he committed one crime in texas tim and that was over ten years ago and no one was hurt she frowned thinking were going on a journey of discovery thats what were doing were going to find out just what von rellsteb is because we dont really know anything about him we dont really know if he keeps people against their will or if he uses violence we might even discover that hes running a really legitimate operation a bit fanatical maybe but straight balls i said jackie laughed youre so full of shit tim listen it was my turn to speak earnestly im not sailing halfway round the damn world with an open mind im sailing because i think von rellsteb is an ecoterrorist his aims might be good but you dont approve of terrorists just because you agree with their political aims thats the mitigating plea offered by every terrorist in the world the innocent have to suffer so that ireland can be united or the whales saved or israel destroyed or apartheid dissolved or whatever else is the cause of the month and the terrorist claims exemption from civilized restraints on the grounds that his cause is too noble in fact he claims not to be a terrorist at all but a freedom fighter but if you disagree with this freedom fighter then hell murder you or kidnap your wife or blow up your children i had spoken with a more venomous anger than the conversation had deserved and in doing so i had said more than i probably believed for i did not know whether von rellsteb was a terrorist or not for all i knew he might be nothing more than a holy fool though i suspected he was considerably more dangerous at best i imagined caspar von rellsteb was a manipulative man who sheltered his activities behind the virtuous smokescreen of environmental activism giving even his survivalist notions a dubious respectability by a green antinuclear stance but as jackie had maintained i had no direct proof that he was a terrorist i saw that my anger had disconcerted jackie and as the fury ebbed out of me like a foul tide i apologized to her jackie dismissed my apology with a shake of her head youre thinking of your son right of course and of joanna oh god im sorry she stared across the harbor to where a bright painted fishing boat was chugging toward the sea is this a crusade for you tim a crusade i asked i mean have you condemned von rellsteb already is that why youre going to chile to punish him it was a shrewd question and i almost answered it unthinkingly by saying that of course i wanted to shoot the goatlike bastard i remembered that moment on sun kiss key when i thought he was laughing at me and i wondered as i often did whether the reason he had agreed to meet me in florida was just so he could gloat over the fool he had bereaved and whose daughter he had bedded of course i wanted to kill him but instead i just said i was going to patagonia to find my daughter jackie nodded at that answer then frowned as she swirled her melting ice around her glass what if nicole doesnt want to leave von rellsteb she asked after a while then she can stay of course i said so long as she tells me that herself and so long as im convinced von rellsteb isnt forcing her to say it or isnt forcing her to stay in patagonia against her will and what will you do if you think he is forcing her to do what he wants for an answer and because i remembered her extravagant reaction to the revolver in key west i just dismissed the question with a wave of my hand but jackie would not be so easily fobbed off youre not thinking of fighting von rellsteb are you she waited but got no answer youd better not tim because i told you he used to be into survivalism and ill bet he still is which means hes bound to have a lot of guns she shuddered at that thought then shot me a penetrating look you dont have a gun do you her tone was indignant as though she had already guessed the true answer no i said too hurriedly then like a fool compounded the lie of course i dont have a gun im english we dont carry guns like you mad yanks you did in key west she accused me that was because of charles he just wanted me to take care of his precious car because i really hate guns jackies suspicions were subsiding theyre just a stupid statement of intent right people claim guns are only for defense but thats bullshit i mean you can defend yourself without using a mechanism designed to kill people dont you agree sure i agree i said dismissively because i did not want to talk about guns i leaned my head on stormchilds lower guardrail and stared past the awnings edge at the first bright star that was pricking a hole of light in the softening sky then because the sun had dipped below the harbor wall and because i ran an oldfashioned boat which meant that our bombscarred ensign only flew during the hours of daylight i stepped past jackie and took the flag off its staff then reverently folded the faded and torn cotton are you ok tim jackie must have sensed a sudden saddening in me im fine i told another lie because i was not fine but rather i suddenly felt lonely and i told myself that the attack of selfpity had been triggered by the memories that lurked in the sunwarmed weave of the cotton i held in my hands im fine i said again yet that night lying sleepless in the stern cabin i heard a couple making love on the next boat and i felt insanely jealous i heard a womans warm soft laughter unforced and full of pleasure a sound to aggravate puritans and feminists and loneliness a sound old as time comfortable and full of enjoyment the gentle laughter died into contentment and i consoled myself with the sour thought that it did not matter for we would all die one day then i tried to sleep as the water slapped petulantly at stormchilds hull the next morning unable to bear the idle frustration any longer i sent a fax to david telling him our next destination and my estimated arrival date then i slipped stormchilds mooring lines jackie knowing that the winds were not yet propitious was puzzled by our precipitous departure but her respect for my sailing experience made her accept my muttered explanation that despite the depressing forecast i was expecting a northerly blow at any minute we motored our way offshore and suddenly five miles from land and against all the careful predictions of the weathermen a steady northeaster did indeed begin to blow i killed the motor trimmed the sails and let stormchild run free the unexpected wind proved to jackie that i was a genius while i knew i was merely a fraud two days later we found the trade winds and turned our bows west and thus we ran in columbuss path bound for the americas we furled the big mainsail lashed the boom down then whiskerpoled our twin headsails one to port and the other to starboard the wind came from dead astern the twin sails hauled us the wind vane guided us the flying fish landed on our deck and stormchild crossed the atlantic rolling like a drunken pig just as every other boat had run the unvarying trade winds ever since columbuss santa maria had first wallowed along these same latitudes under the command of a man who insisted he was sailing to the orient and who to his dying day angrily denied that he had ever discovered the americas jackie and i sailed through sunlit days and phosphorescent nights we saw no other boats hundreds of craft were out there strung and scattered across the conveyer belt of the trade wind latitudes but we sailed in apparent solitude lost in an immensity of warm sea and endless sky under which we fell once more into our watchkeeping routine i took the first watch from midnight until four then jackie would take the deck until ten in the morning she then slept until nearly six oclock in the evening when she would join me in the cockpit for our main meal of the day at eight i would go below and try to sleep until midnight when jackie would wake me for the first watch with a cup of coffee i was always on call in case of an emergency but she never needed to rouse me she claimed that the hounds of hell could not have woken me so deeply and well did i sleep at sea my snores jackie claimed began the moment i went below i did sleep well for the first time since joannas death i was sleeping the night through unharassed by regret there was only one single morning on that whole voyage of two thousand seven hundred miles that i woke early on that morning my eyes opened just after eight a full hour before i usually rolled out of my sleeping bag and for some reason i could not fall asleep again it was not the solo sailors instinct for danger that had woken me because there was nothing wrong with the boats motion and there were no odd sounds that betrayed a piece of broken rigging and i could tell jackie was safe because i could hear the shuffle and slap of her bare feet on the foredeck i wondered if she had gone forward to deal with some small emergency that had woken me and which before i was fully conscious she had brought under control i could think of no other explanation for being awake i yawned wriggled out from behind the lee cloths which held my sleeping body against the boats rolling motion and climbed toward the cockpit i paused at the midpoint of the companionway and turned to look forward only to see jackie doing strenuous aerobic exercises on the sundrenched foredeck i froze in sudden and acute embarrassment because she was doing her bends and stretches in the nude for a few seconds i stared at her half in amazement and half in admiration then before she became aware of my early appearance i ducked swiftly back into the galley where i ostentatiously clattered some pots and pans together youre awake early she called down a few seconds later couldnt sleep whats it like up there i shouted the question so she would not think i had already been on deck same as ever sunny warm and a forcefour wind ive got six flying fish for your lunch chuck them back there comes a point when the taste of flying fish palls do you want your tea now i asked her jackie had brought on board an herbal concoction of caffeinefree leaves which i gallantly brewed for her whenever i took over the watch please by the time i reached the deck she was in her bikini looking positively overdressed you can turn in early if you like i said im not tired she sat crosslegged on the far thwart and i was suddenly assailed by a vivid memory of her lithe tanned body flexing and arching between the foresails sheets i stared upward so that jackie could not see my blush and high above stormchilds swinging masthead i saw a transatlantic jet scratching its white contrail against the sky they say you can navigate by those jets i said just to distract myself you can do what jackie had been concentrating on harvesting her sprouts which grew in their plastic trays with an astonishing vigor and which she ate with an equally astonishing enjoyment im told that some people have successfully navigated the atlantic by following the vapor trails of big jets she looked up at the white line scratching itself between the puffball clouds figures cheaper than buying a sextant the next morning six dolphins appeared to escort stormchild their arrival gave an ecstatic pleasure to jackie and i had not seen such joy in another person since the day i had woken nicole to the exact same sight twelve years before nicoles delighted face had shown an unusual softness and now with jackies enthusiasm to bring the memory into sharp and sudden focus it did not seem so odd that nicole had become the disciple of a man who claimed to be a fanatical environmentalist tim theyre so cute jackie enthused they taste good too oh shut up she laughed and hit me there were times when she seemed impossibly young and i hated those times mostly to hide my feelings i treated her with an exaggerated formality and she seemed to reciprocate the courtesy but once in a while as when she watched the dolphins leaping her polite mask would slip and i would feel the scar being torn from my soul i convinced myself that joannas death had made me unusually vulnerable to a young womans charms and i armored myself against any display of that vulnerability by my painfully correct behavior thus we sailed on stormchild threw us a few problems but none that were unusually difficult a steel cotter pin snapped on the selfsteering gear so that the boat suddenly rounded up toward the wind and the sails slatted like demented bat wings jackie was on watch and by the time i was on deck she had already recovered the helm and had opened the locker where we kept the spare fastenings another day i discovered the bilge was slowly flooding and traced the problem to a pinhole leak in a spare water tank the odd sail seam opened but nothing that a few minutes with a needle and sailmakers pad could not mend day by day the pencil line that represented stormchilds progress inched its way across our chart i measured its advance by taking running fixes with the sextant a process that at first jackie had liked to doublecheck by turning on the satellite receiver and waiting for the small green numerals to betray the ships position but gradually she learned to trust the sun more than the clever box of silicon chips and soon she wanted to master the sextant herself i taught her and it was a good day when i was able to congratulate her for fixing our position within fifty miles she laughed rightly pleased with her achievement then she spread her arms as though to encompass all of stormchild and all of the unending sea and sky i could do this forever tim you mean sail forever oh sure her eyes were alight theres nothing to stop you i said and felt my heart racing with a ridiculous and futile hope yeah there is she turned away money and a job sure i said meaninglessly and the ship rolled to starboard back to port and jackies plait swung against her shoulder blades with stormchilds endless motion jackies hair which had been mousy and bobbed when i first met her had grown wildly long and had been bleached into a pale white gold by the salt and sun so that now it lay in startling contrast against her darktanned skin she looked exotic and fit now and it was hard to see in this lean brighteyed and confident girl the nervous timid baggytrousered waif who had first accosted me in florida we sailed on mile after rolling mile in what for me was the most perfect tradewind crossing of the atlantic i had ever made i doubt that a single wave broke high enough on our cutwater to wet stormchilds deck and only at the end as we neared the caribbean did two squalls briefly soak our topsides with a sudden and drenching rain not long after the squalls as our deck steamed dry under the tropic sun we at last saw the airy castles of white cloud rising high above the horizon and i told jackie that the clouds were forming above land that afternoon an extravagantly tailed frigate bird swooped close to stormchild and both jackie and i felt the nervousness that is engendered by an approaching landfall it is a nervousness that comes from a reluctance to abandon the safe security and comforting routine of a ship for the dangers of a strange harbor and its unpredictable people i washed our shoregoing clothes by sloshing them around in a plastic garbage bag half filled with seawater and detergent later as the clothes dried in the rigging we loosed the lashed down boom and hoisted the huge mainsail and let stormchild steady onto a port reach the rolling stopped immediately and the noises of the ship which had stayed so constant for four weeks changed with the new motion i turned on the vhf radio and heard the intrusive babble of voices two mornings later we were safe in antiguas english harbour where blessedly there was space at the dockyard quay the dutch couple with whom we had dined on my birthday and who had sailed from the canaries a full month before us took our mooring lines and jackie to celebrate the completion of her first transatlantic sail insisted on buying a bottle of cheap champagne that we all four drank at lunchtime i didnt think you had any money i said lightly when the friendly dutch couple was gone i used my last crumpled dollars she said though i do have some plastic but im afraid to use it because the bills would never reach me and then the bank will have me crucified she leaned back on the thwart under the shade of the cockpit canopy that i had rigged once more this is fun tim she said with languorous warmth then reached and lightly touched my hand thank you for letting me come god but this is fun a week later our ship dressed overall with what flags i could muster and with underwear filling in the gaps we celebrated christmas i gave jackie a coral necklace and she gave me a woolen scarf that she had been secretly knitting ive nothing else to give you she apologized and you said it will be cold in patagonia its wonderful i said thank you it isnt much i bought the wool in the canaries its real nice wool isnt it i felt an urge to kiss her just as a thank you but i did not have the courage to move or else i had too much sense to move and jackie must have intuited that something was out of joint for she looked at me oddly then smiled and twisted away up the companionway its weird isnt it she said to be having a hotweather christmas i suspected she was covering a moment of mutual embarrassment with a meaningless babble of conversation i have an aunt who goes to florida every winter and she cooks a turkey and all the trimmings but she has to turn the airconditioning way up before she can bear to eat it oh wow look at that that was a majestic french yawl agleam with bright work and brass that had shaken out its mainsail ready for sea i envied the french crew for i too would have liked to have been at sea where somehow coexistence with jackie was easier than in port but i was waiting for davids promised letter which would enclose the sailing directions for the chilean coast i telephoned him on christmas day but got no answer i decided to wait until new years day after which letter or no letter jackie and i would sail again jackie telephoned her mother on new years eve and afterward called molly tetterman she wanted to come down and join us jackie said when she joined me outside the telephone office but i couldnt bear it she never stops talking never then she burst into laughter as she remembered how i had used to accuse her of the same sin have i changed tim yes i said you have we were walking back toward the dockyard in the hard bright sunlight is it a good change jackie asked coyly yes i smiled i think it probably is suddenly and with what seemed like an impulsive artlessness she put her arm through mine i was so scared of you at the beginning i suppose i should never have asked to come with you it was kind of rude of me right but once i was on board you were so awful to me i was not you were i just happened to mention that i was a tiny bit cold and you jumped down my throat i thought you were going to throw me off the boat i laughed i dont want you to get off the boati hesitated knowing i should not say the next word but i said it anywayever and immediately after i had spoken it i felt like such a damn fool that i wanted to take the word back i felt jackie stop then pull her arm out of my elbow she stared up at me looking shocked and i knew i was blushing tim her voice was suddenly very serious look i began to try and explain myself and jackie began to say something at the same moment and then we both stopped to let the other carry on and i was cursing myself for being such a clumsy and insensitive idiot then we were both interrupted by a voice that boomed at us from across the street there you are tim good man well done dont move splendid and miss potten too first class i was on my way to the harbor piece of luck finding you here it was my brother david who lugging two enormous seabags dodged between the bicycles and brightpainted taxis to join us im signing on he said as he dropped the bags on the pavement by my feet youve come to join us i asked in horror indeed i have dear boy i decided you were right i need the change i need the rest i need the inspiration my god do i need that i have been granted a sabbatical twenty years miss potten i have labored in the lords vineyard and now i am free to sip the wine for a season of idleness he beamed his pleasure at me betty sends her love she let you off the leash she cut the leash she almost insisted that i come so i have left her the keys to the riley and i have installed a low church curate in my place who will probably destroy my congregations faith but i care not david turned his happy face to jackie who i thought did not seem overjoyed at his arrival my dear miss potten permit me the liberty of observing that you look positively different jackie forced a smile hi hi indeed david plucked his seabags from the pavement the last time i was here the admiralty inn served a halfway decent beer and a damn good meal it still does i said then show me to it dear boy show me to it we found a table in the pub but there was an immediate awkwardness between the three of us to which david full of news of home seemed oblivious the boatyard he said was surviving my absence there had been a fire in a hardware store in the towns high street but no one had been hurt the bishop had broken his leg on a dryski slope in the local shopping precinct it was entirely his own fault david said with unholy relish i see the church has to be relevant to modern life but that doesnt need to be proved by hurtling down plastic ramps the bishop doesnt mind you taking a sabbatical i asked david hes all for it he thinks ive been working too hard he also believes that rubbing up against some foreign cultures will broaden my horizons but i told him that was nonsense i just wanted to do a bit of birdwatching david rubbed his hands gleefully just think of it tim the greenbacked firecrown hummingbird i thought you were feeling too old to cope with a yachts discomforts i said accusingly old david laughed im only fifty just three years older than you tim jackie glanced at me then looked away quickly so david spread his arms to encompass the table what do the next three months hold for us youre here for three months i gaped at him i had somehow thought he might have come for just two weeks that should be long enough to settle von rellstebs hash david said happily and still give us time to spot a hummingbird or two but first we have to beard the monster in his patagonian lair how do you plan to do that i unfolded a paper napkin found a pen and still dazed by davids blunt happiness made a crude sketch of south america we sail to panama as soon as possible i said then make a loop out into the pacific to avoid the humboldt current im afraid there wont be any time to make a visit to easter island or to put in at any of the ports in northern chile instead well go straight to the southern coast probably to puerto montt i stabbed my crude map low down on the chilean coast you seem to be in a devil of a hurry david lit his pipe from everything i hear its sensible to make a landfall in patagonia before the end of february i said and between now and then weve got the best part of five thousand miles to go so yes im in a hurry i paused its going to be a very uncomfortable voyage david david laughed he thinks ive gone soft he confided in jackie then looked back to me i assure you im as fit as you are tim whos keeping an eye on the boatyard while youre away i asked with alarm your new manager very good chap by the way knows his onions oh christ i sighed because my elder brothers arrival threatened to tear my life into shreds just three months ago i had been begging for his company but now isolated in the strange relationship i had with jackie i did not want davids loud intrusion except he was here now and could not be sent back which meant that the small fragile bubble in which jackie and i had been so delicately existing was about to be obliterated by the great gales of davids bluff goodwill jackie clearly felt the same sense of violated privacy for she had spoken hardly a word since we sat down in the pub but now she leaned toward me with a frown on her suntanned face i think maybe you dont really need me anymore tim now that your brothers here of course i need you i said hastily every ship must have a cook david put in his three cents worth of appalling insensitivity shut your bloody trap i snapped at him then looked back to jackie you cant jump ship now what i was thinking she said and without even acknowledging davids presence at the table was that i ought to fly home and make sure everythings ok there with my mom you know and with my apartment i mean hell i just walked away from it things may need looking after youre abandoning the genesis community i asked in disbelief no i just ought to visit home thats all and when im there ill try and raise the cash to fly down to chile and meet you i mean if we really are going to find the genesis community then i ought to be prepared for it and i dont even have a camera with me what kind of a journalist am i without a camera i have a camera david seemed oblivious of the effect his arrival had caused but he had never been a sensitive man a good man but not subtle he unzipped one of his bags and pulled out a mm camera that he put on the table its an efficient camera but if you find it too complicated my dear then we can always buy one of those idiotproof pointandshoot jobs isnt that so tim i ignored david while jackie who had gone pale under her tan just continued talking as though my brother had never spoken and maybe if i go home tim i can sell the story to an editor i know a lot more about genesis than i did before and maybe a major newspaper will listen to me now theyll certainly listen if you tell them that the famous circumnavigator tim blackburn is sailing to chile to shoot a bloody ecologist david hooted with laughter at his own wit shut up i spoke with hissing menace to my brother then looked back to jackie why dont you get the story first then sell it to a newspaper i dont know tim jackie glanced very quickly at david thus suggesting to me that his bluff arrival was her real reason for not staying she seemed not to have taken his words about shooting von rellsteb seriously which was a relief but david was never a man to let a sleeping dog lie and now he pushed his camera across the table toward jackie take it dear girl with my blessing no really jackie tried to push the camera back of course you must take it we are one for all and all for one are we not david offered jackie his most benevolent smile besides you look much too frail to use one of the rifles not that i think we shall need the guns david palpably changed mental gears and offered me his most serious expression i need to talk with you tim about what we plan to achieve in patagonia i really dont think i can involve myself in violence it just wouldnt look good in the church times of course if were attacked and we do have to defend ourselves then i assure you ill be shoulder to shoulder with you he smiled at jackie and frankly those old leeenfields have the devil of a kick so i doubt youd be strong enough to fire one not that i think well need them but you never know shut up i said plaintively but much too late leeenfields jackie asked what are leeenfields tim i did not answer i had been cornered in a lie and i was desperately thinking how to find an elegant way out but there was none are they guns jackie demanded of me there are two rifles on board stormchild i told her very flatly i hid them before i left it seemed a good idea at the time a damned good idea david said with an elephantine lack of tact jackie stared at me very coldly are you planning to fight von rellsteb tim is that what youve been planning all along im planning to find my daughter i said as calmly as i could for which purpose youre carrying guns jackie accused me youre the one who warned tim that these wretched people are survivalistsdavid was trying to retrieve the damage he at last perceived he had causedand you cant really expect us to face such maniacs unarmed can you jackie ignored him im going to the archipiélago sangre de cristo to secure a story tim and i thought you were going to help me she paused in an effort to control the fury that was suffusing her voice but instead of calming down she seemed to shake with a sudden rage but now i find that you lied to me that youre carrying guns and that you expect me to help you in your stupid macho crusade there was silence some americans at the next table embarrassed by the intensity of jackies words raised their voices as if to demonstrate that they were not really eavesdropping while david realizing that he had sown the wind that had raised this whirlwind desperately tried to calm the storm dear girl please calm down jackie still ignored him fixing me with a fierce look instead did you lie about the guns yes i said wretchedly im sorry so all this time when youve been talking about finding your daughter and reasoning with her you were really planning to use violence no i insisted though weakly because i was again lying i believed von rellsteb had murdered joanna and i knew i would take revenge if it was possible i could see jackie did not believe my feeble denial so i tried another and more plausible justification if were attacked i said then we have to be able to defend ourselves even the act of carrying a weapon is offensive jackie said passionately and is liable to encourage violence in others oh come david said does carrying a fire extinguisher make a man an arsonist jackie threw down her napkin i thought we were going to chile to find a story to discover a truth i cant be a part of some stupid scheme to start a fight her eyes were bright with tears and she shuddered clearly in the grip of an overpowering emotion and i will not involve myself in even the smallest part of your futile and primitive violence she glared at david not even as a fucking cook her piercing voice had now attracted the attention of half the bar someone cheered her last words for gods sake girl david tried frantically to calm her but jackie would not be calmed she flung her chair backward and stalked away between the tables an amused group of americans offered her loud applause and a berth on their own yacht oh good lord david groaned im sorry tim look after the bill i said to him then hurried after jackie but she had run from the pub to the quay and by the time i came out into the harsh sunlight she was already swinging herself down to stormchilds deck jackie i called as she disappeared down the yachts companionway god damn it tim leave me alone by the time i had reached stormchilds saloon jackie had already locked herself in her forward cabin i dont want you to leave i shouted through the door i am not going to be part of a killing expedition that is not why i came i want to write a good piece of journalism and i want to help the parents whose kids have run off with von rellsteb but that is all i want to do i do not want to be a part of your violence so from now on ill have to make my own arrangements i could hear a half sob in her voice jackie i tried to open the door but its bolt was too solid to be forced i dont want to kill anyone i said but it sounded a rather feeble defense even to me then throw the guns overboard you know how i hate guns will you throw them overboard just come out and talk to me i said please will you throw the guns away i might if you come out and talk to me i said but my halfhearted concession earned nothing but jackies silence or rather the sounds a girl makes when she stuffs a seabag full of dirty clothes jackie i rattled the door again go away you cant leave i said you havent got any money ive got plastic she shouted at me as though i had insulted her im sorry i said ill make you some tea then well talk about it ok i went back to the galley leaned my hands on the stove and sighed god damn it i thought god damn it then taking my time so that jackie would have a chance to calm down i made a pot of the herbal tea she liked so much i let the concoction steep then poured it into her favorite mug one that showed two cats with twined lovers tails and surrounded by little love hearts i carried the tea to her cabin jackie there was no answer i knocked harder jackie the silence was absolute jackie i ran back through the saloon up the companionway and onto stormchilds deck where i found the forehatch was open and the bird was flown she must have climbed on deck while i was making the tea tiptoed her way aft then climbed to the quay and disappeared i ran through the dockyard but there was no sign of her i even caught a cab and raced to the islands small airport but still i did not find her my shipmate had vanished she was gone theres an obvious explanation for the girls behavior david said to me a week later it had been an awkward week we had spoken about such mundane matters as navigation and watchkeeping but neither of us had spoken about jackies abrupt departure david realizing that he had behaved in antigua with the sensibility of a falling rock seemed to be ashamed of himself for detonating the emotional outburst while i was just plain miserable but now as stormchild slammed into a vicious steep wave my brother at last tried to break the silence that was so painfully between us tell me what is obvious i at last invited him the girl was in love with you thank you david i said with a caustic venom and now please shut up i had waited three days for jackie to return to stormchild but she had not appeared i couldnt raise any answer from her home telephone number and finally believing that action would be a better diversion than anger i put back to sea where i had crammed on all sail to drive the big yacht through the caribbean as though the devil himself was in our wake it was proving a rough passage for the east winds were driving the atlantic waters into the shallow basin of the caribbean and heaping them into steep short waves david and i had rigged jacklines down either side of the deck and i insisted that we wore safety harnesses and lifelines if either of us moved out of the cockpit we had also erected the new spray hood so that the helmsman could crouch behind its viewperspex screens as the seas shattered white at our stem and splattered down the decks like shrapnel now four nights out of english harbour david and i were sharing the sunset watch as he steered stormchild fast toward the panama canal he was also trying to repair the breach that gaped between us i think youll find im right he said mildly she showed all the symptoms i thought you were a vicar not an agony aunt he crouched to light his pipe when at last the tobacco was drawing sweetly he straightened up to steer stormchild into the next steep wave a man in my job is constantly being tapped for help by people having emotional crises so one does learn to recognize the symptoms i was tempted to observe that an emotionally troubled parishioner seeking davids help was the equivalent of a seriously ill patient calling for the services of a mortician but i contented myself with asking him how on earth jackies behavior had suggested to him a bad case of love i would have thought i continued sarcastically that if the girl was in love with me shed have stayed on board shed hardly have run away from me love is very mysterious david said as though that explained everything he was in a confident mood sure that his diagnosis was unassailable as you just observed he went on the girls reaction to the situation was extraordinary which would suggest to any reasonably intelligent person that she was seeking a reason any reason to escape from what she saw as an intolerable and increasingly irksome dilemma what in hells name are you going on about pour me another irish whiskey dear boy and i shall tell you i poured him the whiskey choosing a moment when stormchild was between whitetopped crests here i served him the whiskey in one of the plasticspouted childrens training cups which saved us from spilling precious jamesons across the deck as i told you the american girleven now david found it hard to articulate her nameis in love with you i saw it in her face the moment i met you both on antigua there is a mooncalf quality about the young when theyre in love and she had it doubtless she is searching for an authority figure which is why she finds older men attractive i daresay her father died when she was young he abandoned the family ah there you are you dont have to grow a beard and call yourself sigmund freud to pluck the bones out of that one shes after a father figure isnt she you of course being a man of honor did not return her schoolgirlish crush which frustrated her and being an innocent child and uncertain how to surmount the obstacle of your indifference she made the wise decision to cut her losses and skedaddle it was clearly too embarrassing a matter for her to explain calmly so instead and quite sensibly in my view she seized upon the first convenient excuse to make her admittedly embarrassing and hasty exit my reverend brother smiled very smugly at me quod erat demonstrandum i believe i stared past the streaming drops on the spray hoods screen to the ragged turmoil of the sea beyond she wasnt in love with me david i said after a long pause i was in love with her david smiled as if i had made a fine joke then he suddenly realized that i might have spoken the truth and he looked appalled instead oh dear was all he could say im besotted i confessed im the mooncalf not her david puffed fiercely at his pipe for a moment i thought i had silenced him then he glowered at me from beneath his impressively bushy eyebrows the girls young enough to be your daughter you think i dont know that for christs sake i exploded at him jackie was just twentysix one year older than nicole indeed jackie had not even been born when joanna and i had married i blame myself david said with a noble air of abnegation you why are you to blame i encouraged her to accompany you did i not but only as someone to spare you the cooking and cleaning chores good god man i didnt think youd make a prize fool of yourself well i did i said bitterly then its a good thing shes cut her losses and run david said trenchantly you said yourself that this was meant to be an adventure and certainly not some halfbaked romance can we shut up about it i begged him old enough to be her father david abjuring tact would now try to jolly me out of misery with mockery october falling in love with april my cradlesnatching brother shut up we sailed on in silence as davids pipe smoke whipped back in the winds path he looked very selfsatisfied and very selfrighteous i probably looked miserable i could not shift jackie out of my head and all i could think about was the desperate hope that she might be waiting for us in colón harbor at the atlantic entrance to the panama canal we reached colón two weeks later dropping our sails as we passed through the breakwater entrance then motoring through a downpour of rain toward the yacht moorings thunder bellowed across the sky and lightning stabbed viciously above fort sherman as soon as the customs and immigration launch had dealt with us i insisted on unlashing stormchilds dinghy dragging the outboard motor up from its locker in the engine room then going ashore to the panama canal yacht club i told david with a remarkable lack of conviction that i wanted to speak with the weather service he gave me a disbelieving look but did not try to dissuade me nor did he suggest that i might use stormchilds radiotelephone to get a forecast the thunder echoed back from the hills as the little dinghy buffeted its way through the filthy waters the yacht club was the rendezvous for small boat crews but jackie was not waiting there and the only mail for stormchild was a good luck message from betty which contained the reassurance that all was well at the boatyard at that point i could not have cared if the boatyard staff had gone mad and burned the place to the ground i cared for nothing but jackie i rang her home number and at last heard her voice but only on a newly installed answering machine hi this is jackie potten and id really like to talk with you but i cant take your call right now so please leave a message after the beep oh and have a nice day this is tim i said and i would really like to talk with you were going through the panama canal tomorrow then heading south to puerto montt but you can leave a message for me at the balboa yacht clubi fumbled to find the number of the yacht club which lay at the canals pacific endthats and well be there tomorrow evening so what is the forecast david boomed at me when i returned i couldnt get through to the weather people i lied it seems the rain has tied up the phone lines david made a mocking noise but was mollified when i presented him with a bottle of brandy i had bought ashore its something i said to celebrate our first trip through the canal it was a trip i would normally have enjoyed an extraordinary passage past basking iguanas and through the massive waterchurning locks where local linehandlers especially hired for the transit skillfully held stormchilds gunwales off the towering walls we followed a vast german bulkcarrier through the locks and stormchild bucked in the merchantmans wake as though she was stemming a north sea storm david let loose a cheer as we cleared the final lock then uncorked the brandy no message waited at the balboa yacht club and the only response from jackies telephone was the sprightly machine that wished me a nice day so david and i in a wet wind and on a gray sea sailed on we sailed into sickening calms and contrary currents against which day by day and inch by inch we made our slow way out into the vast and empty pacific until a week from panama a real wind at last plucked us from our lethargy and bent stormchilds sails toward the sea water hissed at our stem and broke into a creamy wake astern the wind carried us into the chill airs brought north by the humboldt current ten days out of panama i put away my shorts and took out long trousers and three days later i dragged my heavy foulweather gear out of stormchilds wet locker where i also discovered jackies oilskins i pushed them into a kit bag that i stored under the bunk she had used and which was now once again given over to ships stores for days i had been finding her belongings scattered about the boat her sprouting seeds had gone mad luxuriating like a tiny forest in their plastic home until i had tossed the whole mess overboard i had discovered her bikini in a wash bag and that like her oilskins i stored aboard i found an unused sound tape for her recorder a pen her awful felt hat and a pathetic pair of pink socks chuck em david robustly encouraged me when he saw me holding the little socks with the reverence that a catholic might yield to a scrap of the true cross theyre not mine to chuck you are master under god of this ship which gives you inalienable rights under international law over all persons and objects and smelly socks found in your domain allow me to lighten your ship tim if you lack the resolve he plucked the socks from my hand and hurled them far into the wind i saw the flash of bright pink wool floating briefly amongst a mess of white foam on a waves grim face then the socks were gone forever the next morning i hurled the silly mug with the loving cats overboard though i took a perverse comfort from wearing the scarf jackie had knitted me we thumped on curving round the bulge of a continent then steering stormchild hard to the south i saw our first albatross vast serene and riding the sky like an angel there were whales in the graygreen sea and strange stars above us as we left the northern hemisphere behind and slashed on into the southern emptiness mile after lonely mile we went with neither a sail nor a ship in sight nor even an aircraft above us this was one of the empty seas as empty as when alexander selkirk who would be transmuted by genius into robinson crusoe was marooned on an island in the middle of its desolation the further south we sailed the worse the weather became we seemed to have entered a region of perpetual cloud that shadowed the sea with a sinister slaty cast squalls hissed across that gray dark sea the wind flecked the water white and lifted spindrift that permeated every inch of stormchilds cabins david and i when on watch crouched behind the spray hood and tried not to move our heads too much because the skin of our necks unused to the confining stiffness of the oilskins collars had been chafed to rawness my mood already tormented by jackies disappearance was further soured by the weather my only escape from doomladen misery lay in sailing stormchild as efficiently as possible taking pleasure in a skill well done i could lose myself behind the wheel imagining that my endless path through the heave and pattern of great waves could last forever there was too much cloud for celestial navigation and i could not be bothered to use the satnav yet i knew we were closing on an unseen coast because of the increasing numbers of mollymawks gray gulls terns and storm petrels that came near stormchild one day miraculously the sun shone but the weather stayed cold and when i dipped a thermometer into the sea the temperature measured a mere six degrees centigrade which meant we had plunged into the very heart of the icy humboldt current which drags tons of antarctic meltwater north into the pacific i dug out the red white and blue chilean courtesy ensign i had bought in colón and stored it in a ready locker of the cockpit that night the phosphorescence made a dazzling path behind stormchilds transom a school of chilean dolphins embroidered that starry wake by weaving trails of shattered light around it yet the beauty of the moment was deceptive for the weather was becoming ominous and the seas still heavier so far in the nine thousand miles of stormchilds voyage i had escaped all the bad storms but that night almost as though the genesis community was aware of our coming and had summoned the spirits of the deep to stop stormchild a black gale came hurtling out of the northeast the barometer plummeted and the sea its current fighting against the wind became frighteningly steep and confused the dolphins flicked one last dazzling curve in stormchilds wake then left david dragged from his bunk helped me shorten sail we were both swathed in oilskins and sea boots and had our lifelines clipped to steel rings bedded in the cockpits sole an hour later we took in all but the storm trysail and jib yet still the wind rose and by midnight we had reefed down to just the triplestitched scrap of storm jib which dragged us scudding through the maelstrom of vicious sea and shrieking wind stormchild rode the storm beautifully she thumped up those bastard seas slashing through their confused summits before plunging down into the dark troughs at times a cross sea would jar the boat sideways and the cockpit would fill with a seething swirl of freezing water but always stormchild held firm on course to meet the next windhaunted crest the gale seemed to increase its fury once when a flicker of lightning sliced the sky i saw that david was praying a few moments later when the wind was a deafening and demonic screech he manfully went below and somehow heated soup which he brought precariously back to the cockpit rarely had food tasted better the boat bucked and shuddered in the worst of the seas but as dawn approached i sensed that the anger was at last dying from the wind first light showed us mad waters blown white by the storms anger but already the madness was settling and slowly as the gray day lightened and the wind became tired we could at last stow the storm jib set headsails and turn our weary boat toward the hidden shore if all i hear about patagonia is right david remarked ominously then that little blow is a mere promise of what is to come indeed but shes a wellnamed boat he said with great satisfaction and indeed she was for stormchild had worn the gales quick savagery with an easy confidence i knew there was worse to come much worse for we were approaching a coast renowned for killing ships yet our baptism of tempest augured well i fear the galley is painted with spilled tomato soup david confessed but otherwise there was not a great deal of damage a seam in the storm jib had begun to tear its lockstitches apart some illstowed wineglasses had shattered and an errant wave crashing on our stern had carried away one of the two life buoys but otherwise stormchild had indeed lived up to the promise of her name that evening as we sipped our whiskey and as stormchild hissed and bubbled her quick wake across the long exhausted swell of an ocean after storm the far peaks of chile showed like jagged clouds above the eastern horizon we had come to our landfall to the high snowcapped andean mountains that lay behind the patagonian coast david stared at the mountains through binoculars then raised his plastic cup in a heartfelt tribute to my navigation well done my good and excellent little brother well done i said nothing at first instead i just stared through redrimmed eyes at the pink sparks of sunreflecting snow in that far distance and i thought with what innocent delight jackie potten would have greeted this landfall its a funny old world i said at last and raised my beaker in response to my brothers compliment the sea was darkening into night mirroring the skys gloom to leave those high brilliant snowwhite peaks suspended like shards of rosy light in the dusky air i watched till the last light drained away and we could see nothing but the strange southern constellations hanging high between the scudding clouds we hove to not wanting to make an unfamiliar coast in the darkness stormchild as though impatient with our caution fretted all night in the short steep waves until the creeping dawn silhouetted the far peaks black and foreboding and at last under the mountains ominous loom we loosened stormchilds sheets untied her wheel and plunged toward the land part two water pounded against stormchilds steel cutwater then shredded into a thousand icecold missiles that rattled down her decks and shattered loud on her spray hood for hours we had been enduring such hard cold frightening and wearying work we were fighting against a head wind and a hostile sea laboring not merely to make progress but simply to hold our own against the malevolence of an ocean that assaulted us in closeranked attacking ridges scummed and ribbed with white water the crests of the ridges were flying maelstroms of windwhipped spray that mingled with a pelting rain that slashed diagonally out of low dark clouds the wave ridges were coming at an angle so that stormchild fought her way up their long cold slopes only to corkscrew off their peaks before running fast into their deep graygreen troughs on the ridge tops the foam was sometimes so shattered into spray that i could scarcely see stormchilds bows the wind banged and shrieked and moaned in the rigging while green water seethed and broke dirty white in the scuppers and cockpit drains this as joanna would have enjoyed telling me was sailing jackie potten had not been waiting for me in puerto montt i had dared to expect her yet at the same time had known that i would be disappointed i telephoned her in kalamazoo only to have her irritating answering machine wish me a good day i had also telephoned molly tetterman and had once again reached nothing more than a tape recorder youre not pining for the girl are you david had asked me scornfully thats none of your business oh pardon me for living he said huffily our friendship had been strained both of us knew it and neither of us really knew how to restore it david wanted me to forget jackie to dismiss her as though she had never existed while i was missing her i tried to convince myself that my hopes of any attachment to jackie had always been as futile as they were unrealistic but loneliness nevertheless filled me with a corrosive selfpity the only feeling countering that poison was the growing excitement of sailing ever nearer to nicole each time i woke for another cold spell of watch duty i would feel a small frisson of exhilaration at the realization that every bitter lurch of the hull and hammering blow of the sea marked a moment that took me ever closer to my daughter or rather each moment should have been taking me closer had it not been for this damned head wind and its pounding sea we were one week and four hundred miles south of puerto montt as with two reefs in the main and the numbertwo jib winched tight as a board we were trying to weather cape raper i could see the lowering cape with its lighthouse way off on stormchilds port bow though our view of the high cliffs was intermittently obscured by the thrashing rain once managing to steady my binoculars on the cliffs i saw a wave break on the rocks and spume its white water a hundred feet into the air where it was snatched into oblivion by the howling wind cape raper was the most westerly point of the chilean mainland and because it was the one part of that wild coast where there was no inside channel we were being forced to pass it at sea once past the cape we would still have to cross the infamous golfo de penas the gulf of sorrows before we could once again take advantage of the sheltered channels behind the barrier islands though sheltered was hardly the right word because the waterways between and behind the barrier islands were scoured by vicious tides prey to violent williwaws and desperately short of good holding for stormchilds triple anchors we had already sailed the best part of a hundred miles in such channels protected from the ocean storms by the wooded chonos islands but now thanks to cape raper we had to face the great gray open ocean that heaved at us like moving mountain ranges seaward of us and having just as uncomfortable a passage as stormchild was a big ruststreaked and heavilyladen freighter that must have been carrying limestone north from the patagonian quarries smoke from the freighters stack streamed ahead in the spray and rain then i lost sight of her as stormchild plunged off a wave crest to plummet down into a dark trough david sharing the watch with me gripped a safety bar tight there was a wariness in his eyes almost as though in the great wilderness of wind and water he was perceiving the wrath of god we were both dogtired both sore both of us bruised and suffering from the minor injuries of hard sailing fingers pinched in winches palms skinned by ropes and small cuts abraded by salt water but at least stormchild was taking the seas well she sailed sweet and true despite her crews weariness our last proper rest had been in the fishing town of puerto montt where we had cleared customs and received our ninetyday entrance visas then obedient to chiles cruising regulations we had sought a sailing permit from the armada the chilean navy we had been told to expect a stultifying bureaucracy but the demise of military government had left the whole process perfunctory youre supposed to radio us every day and tell us your position a blackuniformed armada officer captain hernandez told us in perfect english but i wouldnt bother because i dont think anyone really cares where youre going where are you going by the way for a heartbeat i had considered lying in case the genesis community had contacts within the armada but hernandezs friendly manner made the thought instantly ridiculous so i had told him of our plans to explore the archipiélago sangre de cristo good god why birdwatching i lied for it did not seem entirely sensible to admit that we risked an armed confrontation with a group of survivalminded environmentalists who i believed had murdered my wife and were even now holding my daughter against her will weve come to see the greenbacked firecrown hummingbird david convincingly embellished my lie im hardly an experthernandez seemed to find nothing particularly strange in the idea of men sailing thousands of miles to spot a birdbut you might have better luck farther south still im sure half the joy of birdwatching lies in the search yes as captain hernandez began to prepare our official papers i wandered to the wall opposite his desk to examine the large scale charts that were pasted together to make a continuous map i peered very closely at the archipiélago sangre de cristo and particularly at the isla tormentos and saw that someone had inked a small square mark on the shore of the island exactly where i had presumed any settlement might have been built i tried not to betray any particular interest as i turned towards hernandez are we likely to find any fishing villages in the islands im thinking of places where we can find provisions hernandez banged his rubber stamp on our permit then offered me a dismissive shake of his head theres no fishing village for a hundred miles only a community of hippies on tormentos theyre an odd lot they sail off and make a damn nuisance of themselves to the japanese but they keep well out of our hair no bird fouls its own nest eh indeed hernandez had crossed to the wall of charts and tapped the inked mark thus confirming my suspicions of where the genesis community was hiding i doubt if the hippies will be of much use to you if you run short of supplies he said scathingly they seem to live how do you say low on the hog for all we know they may all be dead by now the winters there are hard very hard not that you need worry theres plenty of fresh water in the islands and as many fish as you can catch he ceremoniously presented me with stormchilds sailing permit and wished us both luck we went back to stormchild where i copied onto my own chart the location of the genesis communitys settlement at last after all the supposition and imaginings we had a destination i had found nicole and now one week later we were being buffeted by the great seas and drenched by the rain and whiplashed by the salt spray as we struggled against a pernicious south wind to round cape raper and gain the gulf of sorrows beyond which we would discover whether the hippies low on their hog still lived i was nearing nicole as we crossed the gulf of sorrows the wind and seas became atrocious we had come to patagonia in its summer season but the weather was like a bad northern winter and our journey had deteriorated into a sodden hell squall after squall savaged across the water the wind rarely dropped below force seven and never once veered from due south and thus it took us three days to claw our way southward across the gulf it was three days of hard tacking into a scouring soaking dispiriting bitch of a wind and the misery worsened when i could not find the entrance to the channel that would eventually lead us to the desolate straits and to the isle of torments for two whole days we beat up and down that windshredded coast till at last a tuna boat radioed us directions we escaped the great ocean waves into a network of channels that were bounded by sheer black cliffs which during a rare moment when the clouds lifted i measured with the sextant and found to be over four hundred feet high the great rock faces cast the narrow seaways into a perpetual gloom through which waterfalls plumed and fell in white smoking streaks sometimes it rained so hard that it was difficult to tell where the waterfalls began and the sky ended and always there was a pervasive mist that permeated stormchilds cabins so that every surface on the boat became damp and slimy with mold even the air seemed sodden we motored south in this gloomy dank world into which the ocean waves reached to swell and suck green water against the broken black rocks the tides had a rise and fall as fierce as any in the english channel yet these tides seemed to follow no set pattern by which we could forecast their surge for the moons metronomic tug on the water was confused into craziness by the complexity of the coasts labyrinthine channels in places where boulders protruded close beneath the waters surface the confusion hatched whirlpools and tidal rips that waited in vicious ambush the whirlpools were glossy silent greenblack slides inviting a boat to destruction while the rips looked as though a demented blender was thrashing madly just beneath the waves to explode white spray fifteen or twenty feet into the rainfilled wind we dared not risk sailing blind into such dangers by traveling at night so instead we would pick what seemed like a sheltered cove and try to find a lodgement for our heavy anchors which usually just dragged across rock or snagged in the thick floating beds of kelp one of us would then have to use the dinghy to carry mooring lines ashore which because there were rarely shelving beaches inevitably meant a dangerous scramble across slippery fissured weedslick rocks and an inevitable soaking as a wave surged icecold water up the boulders whichever of us did that singularly unpleasant mooring duty would then row frantically back to stormchild to be revived in front of the saloons small diesel heater christ but im too old for this sort of caper david said one night as he shivered half naked in front of the heaters feeble warmth we used to do it for amusement remember we used to do a lot of things for amusement that we cant do now he said gloomily then he turned a dinghysailors accusing eye on me isnt yachting supposed to be fun isnt that what you cruising sailors always tell me how you relish the adventures of far waters i do assure you tim that however wet and cold i make myself in the holy ghostthe holy ghost was davids irreverent name for his beloved racing dinghythere is always a welcoming fire and a decent pint of bitter waiting in the stave and anchor he glanced up at the chronometer mounted on the saloon bulkhead and made a swift calculation of what time it would be at home i suppose theyre just closing up the bar now he said wistfully and john will have a fire going and a decent fug of pipe smoke and were stuck in patagonia even moored with two lines fore and another two aft and with our heaviest anchors clutching what grip they could find we were not at peace if either of us had miscalculated the length of the mooring lines and the tide then dropped or rose too fiercely we would have an unpleasant half hour on deck rerigging the thrumming ropes in the wild wet darkness night winds whistled and howled through the towering gulfs bringing thick mists or flying clouds that poured sudden downbursts of violent rain on stormchilds teak deck worst of all were the rafagasthe sudden gales of deflected wind that spilling and driving themselves down the sheer cliffs would strike the water vertically with the speed and force of a hurricane under the impact of the rafagas the water would be flattened into a white sheet of shivering foam that was as terrifying to watch as it was to endure stormchild was hit twice and both times she was laid right onto her starboard beam as plates and cups spilled in a shattering stream from behind the galley fiddles david and i clutching like grim death to whatever handholds we could seize stared at each other and waited for the inevitable disaster the first time an awful scraping sound just audible over the insane shrieking of the wind betrayed that the big anchors were dragging across rock but then slowly painfully miraculously our boat righted herself in the second knockdown joannas portrait which i had believed to be firmly fixed in its frame had somehow come loose and its glass had shattered on the saloon floor i could not work out whether that omen was good or bad the next morning when i retrieved the big plough anchor i discovered its shank had been bent like a hairpin in the daylight when we were under way the fog would sometimes slam down or else the rain would be so fierce that we could scarcely see stormchilds bow pulpit so we would turn on the radar and try to make sense of the tangle of echoes that confused the screen with its mad green chaos more often than not the echoes were so jumbled that the set was worse than useless and while one of us steered the other would stand in the bows and shout instructions through the wind and fog and rain that formed this patagonian summer below decks stormchild had become a stinking pit of wet clothes mildew spilled food damp bedding and diesel fumes the fumes were my fault i had been carrying a can of fuel for the saloons heater when i lost my balance as stormchild lurched and the diesel oil had soaked into the saloons carpet we had tried to air the saloon but the stench persisted the caribbean world of easy cruising and long drinks under stormchilds cotton awning seemed a million miles away yet the patagonian waters though short on the sybaritic comforts of a cruising life were not without their compensations on our fourth evening in the channels when i thought we could not go on fighting the maniacal tides and winds any longer the weather at last began to relent and the barometer to climb at dusk the low mist lifted from the settling waters to show us a long view toward a wooded slope a quarter mile away then we heard an odd splashing and turned to see a group of sea otters playing in our wake while at our bows and fleeing the intrusion of stormchild into their pristine world a score of steamer ducks paddled wildly at the water with whirling wings on shore were colonies of rockhopper penguins while above us thousands of sooty shearwaters flighted to their roosts from the open sea just before the darkness was complete we saw two sea lions chasing fish the sightings proved that we now sailed in one of the worlds last great wildernesses a wilderness in which we saw no other boats and no other signs of human presence there was a steamer service that ran through the innermost channels to the tierra del fuego but we were well seaward of that boats route the next morning we woke to discover that the weather had indeed relented dawn brought sunlight and a delicate clearing sky the force of the wind had gentled and all about us was the sudden sparkle of light on water a million seabirds and a scenery so majestic that both david and i felt a catch in our throats there are few such moments given to us on this earth moments when we are granted a glimpse of the world as it must have looked at the crowning moment of creation and god saw every thing that he had made david who like me was half bearded now quoted from genesis and behold it was very good we cast off our moorings retrieved our anchors from their clinging kelp and started stormchilds motor the sound of the engine seemed an affront to the pure loveliness of the channels for once we could see clearly and i collapsed the spray hood so that our forward view was unobstructed the cliffs reared up from the green shining water and were topped by long wooded slopes between the cliffs where the turmoil of the restless earth had made steep valleys that dropped like chutes toward the tidehurried water beech trees grew in the long long distance glimpsed between the scattered islands the snowtouched peaks showed the spine of a continent when the channel widened i was able to stop the engine and for the first time in days hoist stormchilds sails so that she glided like some stately pleasure barge across a wide sealake that stretched between a group of wooded islands the wind was fitful but the tide was friendly and pushed us silently along the waterway we rounded a corner of glassy water to find another stretch of wide seaway along which we ghosted between small natural meadows wooded slopes and suntouched cliffs we were like men drunk on beauty dazzled by a place as wild as desolate and for me as close to god as any place on earth birds of prey with massive ragged wings spiraled above the screeedged peaks and beneath the scatter of high white clouds while blacknecked swans swam from a treeedged creek to paddle in stormchilds placid wake white mountain streams cascaded through the trees it was so long as the weather held arcadia discovered the only jarring note was that one of our two rifles now lay beside the binnacle for david knowing we had entered the outer islands of the archipiélago sangre de cristo had insisted on removing the companionway paneling and retrieving the gun we had hidden there though i doubt very much we shall need it david had said as he brought the rifle topsides you think genesis will let us come and go in peace i asked i think that naval fellow in puerto montt was right david said and that the genesis community wont foul their own nest why on earth should they provoke the enmity of the chilean authorities by a gratuitous display of violence so jackie was right after all i asked with as little malice as possible and we dont need guns i pray we dont need guns david said fervently he was staring forward and looking at him i suddenly thought how much this voyage had aged him there was white in his beard and deep lines about his eyes so that for the first time i saw in my middleaged brother the signs of old age and i wondered if i looked the same and whether jackie had been offended by my tactless remark on antigua and the memory of that remark burned shamefully inside me as i thought what fools old men made of themselves because of young women david opened the rifles butt and took out a pullthrough and a bottle of cleaning oil i do pray we dont need guns he repeated but that rather depends on how we respond if we meet hostility i shrugged as though i did not think it an important question though increasingly as the sea miles had slipped beneath stormchilds keel that question had dogged me i had sailed from england with only one clear purpose to find and rescue nicole but as david had just suggested the completion of that simple purpose depended on what kind of welcome the genesis community offered stormchild i suspected that there would be no welcome at all which was why i was glad david was now cleaning the leeenfield though whether he would actually fire the gun was plainly another matter are you suggesting i should turn the other cheek i asked him david tugged a square patch of flannel cleaning cloth through the rifles barrel i think he said slowly that if we are offered violence then we have to withdraw we may have to fire in selfdefense but otherwise we must behave with the utmost circumspection he offered me a wry smile i know its not the most adventurous approach tim but we cant risk causing injury or death i knew david was right but i did not want to admit it back in england i observed caustically you couldnt wait for me to put a bullet between von rellstebs eyes now suddenly we have to be circumspect back in england he said very simply i was wrong youre scared of losing your chance of becoming a bishop are you i accused him nastily he smarted at that looking guiltily offended oh come on david i said youre a blackburn of course youre ambitious and murdering environmentalists would really mess up your chances of sitting in the house of lords and having first pick of the choirboys dont be ridiculous he said huffily and even if i did want a bishopric that has nothing to do with the present circumstances then what does i asked him he sighed the truth tim is that im scared of dying im scared of getting into a fight and leaving betty a widow im not as brave as i was thirty years ago and i promised betty id do nothing stupid i intend to keep the promise i also promised betty id look after you its bad enough that weve lost dickie and joanna without losing you for a moment i said nothing it was unlike david to so openly reveal an affection even toward me and i was touched i was also boxed in for i had not sailed clean across the atlantic and down to the southern hemisphere just to surrender at the first sign of von rellstebs pugnacity if i prove that von rellsteb killed joanna i finally told david then im going to kill him with or without your help no you wont david said very patiently because if we discover any wrongdoing then we will summon the authorities and if the authorities wont help us then we will travel to santiago and enlist the support of the british embassy youre famous and im not exactly disreputable so i assure you the ambassador will listen very closely to us and if the embassy insists to the chilean authorities that the genesis community is sheltering lawbreakers then it wont take long for the armada to get a patrol boat into these waters i shrugged ceding to his argument ok i said no heroics we go we reconnoiter and at the very first sign of hostility we withdraw i spoke sourly but i knew david was right to insist on caution we were two middleaged brothers one of whom wanted to be a bishop and though an atavistic part of me still wanted to tear the genesis community apart common sense suggested we would be hopelessly outgunned and savagely outfought if we took on von rellstebs group with our two ancient rifles david seeing my disappointment smiled if were lucky he tried to console me well find nicole without any complications so rigged with cautious good sense we sailed on we sailed through the scenery of a suddenly limpid and serene paradise the wind was dying and denied its power our sails flapped impotently david went below to make lunch and impatient to make progress i started stormchilds motor by the time we had eaten our meal of pickles cold salted pork bread and margarine the tide had turned against us and stormchild was struggling against a surge of water that poured between two dark headlands which if my chart was correct marked our passage into the desolate straits not long now i said nervously our wake was a slash of reflected sunlight against the suddenly dark water there was no sign of the genesis communitys presence in these waters it seemed as though david and i were the first people ever to invade this wilderness we passed between the twin headlands and the channel widened once more the water swirled darkly past our hull as kelp geese and blacknecked swans paddled desperately away from our intrusion david dividing his attention between the birds and the chart suddenly pointed to a long hilly stretch of land that lay beyond a low rocky promontory and said that unless he very much missed his guess those spiky hills were part of the isla tormentos i stared at the jagged skyline and thought of nicole in a burst of sudden incoherent and utterly unexpected joy i was near to rescuing my daughter and surely all the old love that had been so strong between us would revive when we met and my heart was so full of love and hope that i dared not express myself for fear of weeping nicole nicole i had crossed a world to find her and now she was so close and i felt nothing but a welling of love and expectation david sensing my feelings stayed silent we turned eastward to cross a wide stretch of open water then turned southward again into the desolate straits proper in one of the pilot books david had brought from england i had read that the straits took their name from the false hope they offered a mariner they seemed to promise a sheltered deepwater route clear down to the land of fire while in reality they were merely a long inlet that stretched into the very heart of the isle of torments and once in that stony heart came to a blind and bitter end a skipper thinking to save himself a hard outer passage but finding instead that he had wasted a days sailing only to reach a dead end would call these deceptive straits desolate indeed yet here the channel ran straight and inviting stormchilds engine purred sweetly driving her across the now mirrorsmooth water on which our wake fanned in gorgeous silver ripples to port a black cliff spilled a thin stream of falling white water while to starboard a slope of sundrenched trees ended at a beach of white stones the landscape dwarfed our boat and overwhelmed our senses itll be nice to see old nickel again david awkwardly broke our silence he had always been fond of nicole it had been david rather than joanna or myself who had taught nicole to sail and who had first discovered her fierce ambition david had harnessed that ambition to dinghy racing and often said that if her brothers death had not skewed her life nicole would have achieved what david himself had so narrowly missed a place on britains olympic sailing team nicole david always maintained was simply the finest sailor he had ever seen shell be surprised to see us i said our conversation was stilted because neither of us could match with words the apprehension we felt for the approaching moment perhaps i said to cover the clumsiness of our feelings we should take in the sails we stowed the canvas i was becoming increasingly nervous as we came closer to the bay which had been marked as the site of the genesis settlement on the charts in captain hernandezs office fine on stormchilds starboard bow we could see a rocky headland crowned by a row of windsplintered pine trees and if the captains chart was right the genesis community lived just beyond that promontory david propped the rifle against the folded spray hood then stooped to light his pipe i hope we dont have to use violence he said nervously then laughed dear lord but i sound just like the american girl dont i the thought of jackie gave me a sudden and astonishing pang but then even jackie vanished from my thoughts as stormchild cleared the pinetopped promontory and there like an evanescent dream given unexpected shape and solidity was the bay where the first von rellsteb had made his settlement oh god i murmured and it was a prayer of thanks as well as a plea for help for sunlight was dazzling us where it reflected from a windowpane for suddenly in one of the last wildernesses of earth we had found the straight lines of human habitation there was smoke above a roof there was a rank smell that was the stench of people stormchild had brought us to genesis i had always imagined the von rellsteb settlement would be graced by a grand victorian farmhouse with carved eaves turrets and wide verandas common sense had told me that no house built to withstand the patagonian weather could possibly have an exterior as fussily detailed as my imagined victorian mansion but nevertheless the fancy had persisted so that when i did at last see the building i felt an immediate disappointment for it looked like nothing more than a range of overlarge and decaying farm sheds the ugly house and its ragged extensions stood in the shelter of a semicircle of low steep hills and above a lawn that sloped down to the bays shingle beach the house which faced eastward toward the water was made of a limestone so pale that it looked like concrete it was an immensely long and disproportionately low house of only two stories but with sixteen windows on each of those two floors the house might not have looked as grand as my victorian fancy had embroidered it but the first von rellsteb had certainly built large had he imagined a slew of grandchildren pounding down his long echoing corridors the building except for its size was otherwise unremarkable unless one took exception to the bright red corrugated iron roof through which a dozen stone chimneys protruded two of those chimneys showed wisps of smoke betraying humanitys presence the house had two singlestoried wings one to the north and the other to the south those two extensions each added sixty feet to the long facade of the house before they turned at right angles toward the protective western hills presumably making a huge threesided yard at the rear of the house the two wings were built in the same pale stone as the house and roofed with the same ugly sheet metal the only structure that in any way matched my original expectations was a castiron gazebo incongruously like a park bandstand that stood in front of the house to offer anyone sitting in its shelter a long view down the desolate straits the gazebo was an inappropriate touch like a clowns red nose stuck on the waxy face of a corpse and its existence added to the sense of unreality that assailed me as we motored farther into the bay all around the settlement were vegetable gardens which even in this days cheerful sunlight looked forlorn and unproductive while on the steep ridge that lay a half mile behind the buildings was a tall slender radio mast that was strongly guyed against the islands fierce winds what a godforsaken place david said in horror i was thinking of nicole living in this godforsaken place and so said nothing the settlement seemed deserted the only sign that anyone lived in this awful place was the smoke from the stone chimneys nor was there any sign of the catamaran erebus renamed genesis though on the southern side of the bay moored alongside an ancient stone quay there was an equally ancient looking fishing vessel that was painted a lurid limegreen and had a high bluff bow a low gunwale amidships and a stubby wheelhouse astern from which a tall dark chimney stuck skyward for an ensign the fishing boat had a pale green scrap of cloth like that i remembered from the day when nicole had sailed away the trawlers name like the renamed erebus was genesis and had been painted in black untidy letters on her bows the only other boats i could see were a slew of sea kayaks drawn up on the beach i throttled back stormchilds motor as the depth sounder betrayed the bays steeply shelving bottom we could berth alongside the fishing boat david suggested i shook my head ill anchor and row ashore youll stay here gladly david shuddered at the decrepit uninviting appearance of the settlement now that we were closing on the land i could see a row of odd concrete tanks embedded in the sloping lawn in front of the house david had also noticed the ugly containers and was examining them through his binoculars fish tanks he ventured the guess then gave me the glasses as he went forward to stand beside the main anchor i waved to him when the depth sounder showed we were in thirty feet of water the chain rattled and crashed its way through the fairlead as i killed the engine then there was a wonderful silence as the chain at last stopped running and as stormchilds small forward motion dug in the anchor flukes she tugged once then gentled as we swung round so that our stern faced the apparently deserted settlement we were just fifty yards from shore while the house was another hundred yards beyond the small beach as a garden of earthly delights david said it lacks a certain lighthearted elegance wouldnt you say it lacks people too i unlashed the dinghy that had been stored on the after coach roof then splashed the small boat over stormchilds stern i did not bother with the dinghys outboard motor but instead just lowered myself overboard with a pair of oars and rowlocks i also took a handheld vhf radio which david would monitor on stormchilds larger set he asked if i wanted to take the second rifle with me as well but i shook my head i dont want to antagonize anyone if anyones there at all white man come in peace eh david said with a jocularity designed to hide his nervousness yet there was a hint of truth in his jest for we both felt like explorers touching a previously unknown shore in an effort to make contact with some elusive and mysterious tribe wish me luck i said then pushed away from stormchilds side it was odd to look back at my boat she had become my carapace my security and it was almost unsettling to be rowing away from her seabattered hull the woodwork of her cabin roofs looked faded and her paint was grimed with salt yet there was still something very lovely about the big yacht as she sat in that unnaturally placid bay with its long view of the desolate straits a flurry of flightless steamer ducks fled from my dinghy as i neared the shingle beach my heart was thumping and there was a nervous sourness in my belly i had thought that my long solo journeys around the world had cured me of helpless fear yet now i felt a kind of craven panic because i really was rowing into the unknown i felt a temptation to return to stormchild and let genesis come to us but instead i tugged hard on the oars until the dinghys bows grated at last on the beach i stepped out and dragged the small boat safely above the tide line the beach was edged by a seven foot high bluff of stony earth up which someone had once built a flight of sturdy wooden steps i climbed the weathered stairs with a growing sense of unreality i had sailed ten thousand miles to what to nothing to a blast of gunfire to nicole to tears of reconciliation or perhaps if my daughter and i both behaved with true british reticence to an awkward embrace and an embarrassed conversation i reached the top of the wooden steps and started across the springy shortgrassed turf where i was at once assailed by a stench of manure so overpowering that i almost retched at first i thought the smell might be coming from the concrete tanks which i now assumed were sewage settlement chambers but when i reached the odd tanks i saw that one half were empty while the other half held malodorous and curdled mixtures of oil and water the smell distinctly that of sewage did not emanate from the tanks but from the fields on either side of the house and i realized that the genesis community must recycle their own sewage by spreading it as topdressing on the settlements vegetable plots i walked toward the houses central doorway which was framed by a flimsylooking wickerwork porch a domestic touch as odd as the strangely festive gazebo it felt weird to be ashore the land seemed to be rocking like a boat i was nervous yet still no one challenged me indeed no human sound disturbed the days peace a gull screamed startling me then just as i reached the conclusion that the settlement must be deserted the double front doors of the house burst open and two bearded men both wearing identical green garments emerged into the sunlight for a moment we stared at each other i suddenly felt happy i was going to see nicole and in my happiness i felt an absurd urge to offer the two men a deep bow hello i called out instead go away one of the two men replied both men looked to be in their thirties and had springy bushy beards the one who had spoken sported a black beard while his companion had a brown beard streaked with gray neither man appeared to be armed which was reassuring my happiness ebbed as swiftly as it had bubbled up i started walking toward the two men and an unseen hand immediately slammed the doors of the house shut i heard bolts slide into place go away the man with the black beard said again listen i said in a very friendly tone ive just sailed ten thousand miles to see my daughter and im not going away just because youre feeling unsociable my names tim blackburn how are you i held out my hand im looking for nicole blackburn is she here they ignored my outstretched hand instead they stood with arms akimbo daring me to push past them perhaps you didnt hear me i suggested politely my name is tim blackburn and ive come here to see my daughter nicole go away the man with the black beard said again i went to walk round them and the second man raised a hand to push me back touch me i told him and ill break your fucking skull my sudden hostility made the man skitter out of my path like a frightened rabbit i walked past him to the odd porch where i tried to open the front doors that proved to be very firmly bolted i turned back to the bearded men is nicole blackburn here neither man answered so i peered through the window nearest the door the glass panes were very grimy but i could just see into a room that was almost empty except for a bare trestle table on which hurricane lamps stood unlit the stone window ledge was thick with dead flies more ominously i noted that the window had stout iron bars set into the stone ledge tim this is stormchild over the handheld radio suddenly squawked in my oilskins pocket david this is tim over tim ive just seen one greendressed fellow run to the hills behind the house he seemed to be carrying a weapon davids voice sounded ominous as though the violence he feared had already started do you hear me over i hear you i told him and ill go gently remember our agreement were withdrawing if theres trouble perhaps the fellow has just gone duck hunting i said then put the radio back in my pocket and smiled at the two bearded men who had edged close to eavesdrop on my conversation wheres nicole i asked them go away ignoring the monotonous order i trudged through the muddy soil toward the northern wing of the house i noticed that all the ground floor windows were protected with the stout iron bars and the thought occurred to me that this would not be an easy building to break into i turned to follow the northern wing where it bent back toward the encircling hills the singlestoried extension was windowless though here and there and looking menacingly like loopholes apertures had been crudely hacked through the limestone blocks i peered through one such aperture but could see nothing but darkness inside my two bearded companions followed a dozen paces behind me but no longer tried to stop me from exploring the settlement i walked past rows of carrots some small bean plants potatoes and a wilting patch of red beets the gardens stretched to the very edge of the escarpment which formed the near slope of the semicircle of hills toward which david had seen the gunman run i walked to the rear of the buildings and saw that the long house and its two wings did indeed form three sides of an open courtyard i took out the radio and pressed my transmission button david theres a courtyard behind the house im going to have a shufti i cant see your gunman so i assume hes holed up on the ridge line no one will talk to me and the house is locked so i dont know whether nicole is here or not well probably lose radio contact when im in the courtyard but if im not on the air within fifteen minutes then youd better break out the guns and all of you should come and look for me out i thought it would do no harm if my unfriendly guardians got the impression that stormchild was crammed with armed men ready to turn their dungridden paradise into a killing ground i moved into the bare dank courtyard nothing grew in that depressing space not even a blade of grass there was a childs sandpit in one corner which held some very old and faded plastic toy buckets and spades near the damp sandpit were a rusting iron swing a wooden rocking horse a doll without its head and a heap of broken rusting lobster traps a cat hissed at me from the roof of one of the two low wings of the house from within the yard the two wings of the house looked like rows of stables each with a dutch door in one of the stable compartments were two huge vats and a stench so vile that the homemade manure smelled sweet by comparison there were bundles of otter pelts hanging on hooks above the vats and i assumed that this was the settlements tannery but a tannery why would environmentalists be skinning sea otters you must go away the man with the black beard was clearly becoming ever more uncomfortable with my brazen snooping wheres nicole i asked him cheerfully and as before received no reply is caspar here i asked instead but with the same result i walked to the back door of the house which not surprisingly was locked as firmly as the front entrance i peered through a barred window to see a kitchen equipped with an ancient woodfired stove bunches of herbs hung from the ceiling beams i walked on to the next window and saw racks of guns that looked like assault rifles some of the spaces in the wooden racks were ominously empty i strolled past a vast and disorganized woodpile evidence of the communitys reliance on timber for their heating and cooking i heard a child cry inside the house the first sign that people other than my bearded followers were present at the settlement but when i shouted a greeting through one of the dusty windows no one answered i explored the southern wing hens lived in two of the stablelike rooms but otherwise i saw nothing alive except the vituperative cat that spat at me from the corrugated ruststreaked roof at the corner of the building i stopped to stare at the crest of the escarpment where the radio mast was built but i could not see the gunman david had spotted and whom i assumed must now be hidden among the tangle of rocks that crowned the ridge just to the north of the radio mast was an earthfaced dam which suggested a reservoir had been created in a saddle of the escarpment presumably to control the flow of water from the hills to the settlements vegetable gardens i walked to the buildings southern flank and there i stopped in astonishment a dozen young people were struggling toward the settlement with a big handcart that was stacked high with freshly cut logs the clumsy cart was being maneuvered along a muddy path by a disconsolate group of women and children who all wore drab and uniformlike gray overalls the work party was escorted by two bearded men who like the two guardians who still dogged my every footstep wore green trousers and jerkins the woodcutting group who were still a hundred paces from the buildings saw me and froze one of the women gaped in such abject terror that i thought she would faint i walked toward them the man with the black beard tried to call me back while the small children clung in terror to their mothers gray trousers i could not see nicole among the women who all looked lank unhappy pale and illfed one of the frightened children began wailing hello i called aloud its all right im a friend go away one of the greendressed men seized an ax from the stalled woodcart and started toward me go away i stopped some fifty paces from the big cart my name is tim blackburn i shouted and ive come here to find my daughter nicole do any of you know where i can find her none of the group answered the grayuniformed women huddled together and seemed to shiver with a collective fear of my appearance they looked to me like zombies and i recalled jackies assertion how utopian communities were very often based on one mans idealism which to preserve itself degraded into a fascist system of discipline these people the zombies in gray and their bearded guards in green seemed evidence that von rellstebs community was an example of that sad fate the axman who had a ginger beard walked confidently toward me as though he planned to split my skull open is caspar von rellsteb here i asked him youve got to go the axman like the blackbearded man had an american accent wheres nicole blackburn i asked him patiently go away im fed up with all of you i said dismissively and tried to walk toward the frightened women the gingerbearded man immediately swung his ax at me his swing was wildly violent and came nowhere close to me instead the energy of the blow unbalanced my attacker so that he tottered helplessly backward i took two quick steps toward him and brought the toe of my right sea boot hard up into his groin his breath whooshed out his eyes opened wide the ax dropped into the mud then he followed it with a sudden scream of pure agony the other bearded men looked as terrified as the women and children i picked up the fallen ax wheres nicole i demanded of all and any of the greendressed men go away the man with the black beard sounded scared the man i had kicked was sobbing and whimpering on the ground david who could now see me again from stormchilds cockpit was insistently demanding to be told what was happening but the only answer i offered him was a cheerful wave then because the men were evidently defeated i tossed the ax into the mud and walked toward the graydressed group im nicole blackburns father i told them again and in as comforting a voice as i could manage but before i could say another word one of the greendressed men ordered them to run go he shouted run quick go he flapped his hands at them as though he drove a flock of hens and the women with one last look at me obeyed they fled toward the southern hills the children clinging to their mothers and screaming as they ran i turned back to the men are you all mad go away one of them said ill search your house first i said and began walking toward the big sprawl of buildings a rifle fired it was not david on board stormchild who had opened fire but rather the gunman who was hidden at the crest of the western escarpment the sound of his gun echoed and reechoed around the wide bay while his bullet thudded into the ground just five paces in front of me at that range it was horribly good shooting and i hoped it had only been intended as a warning shot calculated to stop me in my tracks if so it worked i stopped tim davids voice squawked from the radio listen i was not replying to david but rather turning to appeal to the bearded men but my words were interrupted by a second rifle shot and this time the bullet whacked into the damp earth even closer to me go the man with the black beard said wheres my daughter i shouted at him and i took a threatening pace forward but immediately the gunman on the hill fired a third round and this bullet hissed menacingly close to my head i froze for gods sake what is happening david asked plaintively over the radio i thumbed the transmit button they wont talk they wont say where nicole is and the gunfire is calculated to make me leave i think that might be a very good idea david said in a dispassionate voice because ive spotted another gunman in the house itself hes on the top floor lefthand window i suggest you withdraw tim weve done what we could now lets do as we agreed like hell i was feeling stubborn stupidly stubborn i put the radio back into my pocket and looked defiantly at the blackbearded man i have sailed ten thousand bloody miles to see my daughter and im not leaving without speaking to her where is she the mans only answer was to raise a hand in an evident appeal to the gunman hidden on the escarpments crest who now switched his gun to automatic fire and loosed a whole clip of bullets at me the sound of the shots crackled in the still air as the bullets churned a patch of nearby ground into a morass the rounds came so close that i instinctively twisted away and half fell david thinking that my fall was evidence that i had been shot fired back the old british army rifle made a much louder report than the gunmans assault rifle and long before the echo of his first shot had faded from the bay david fired again the effect was extraordinary the three men who had been confronting me turned and fled even the man with the ginger beard limped away still sobbing and gasping the gunman on the hill began placing single shots very close to me it was impossible to see where that gunman was hiding because the top of the escarpment was an horrific tangle of rocks and crevices i decided he was not trying to kill me but only to drive me away the genesis community just wanted to expel me and under the encouragement of their marksmans wicked aim i turned and walked toward the beach the hidden gunman seeing my retreat instantly ceased fire david after his first two warning shots had also ceased fire i took out the radio as i walked its been a bloody washout i reported to david just get back here he said and i could hear the nervousness in his voice i reached the bluff above the beach i hesitated there for a few seconds one part of me desperate for news of nicole wanted to go back and hammer at the door of the house but when i turned to stare at the ugly building i saw that david was right and that there was indeed a gunman on the upper floor the man had opened a window and was mutely watching me the message of his unmoving menace was very clear that i should go away i went away i climbed down the steps and started hauling the dinghy toward the water and as i did one of the gunmen opened a furious fire david responded i stared in horror at stormchild expecting to see the bullets chewing up her hull and deck but stormchild was untouched the water around her unscarred by bullets david standing in the cockpit was working the leeenfields bolt furiously his shots echoed flat and hard from the far hills i left the dinghy and ran halfway up the wooden steps to see what had caused this sudden firefight then crouching so that i was hidden from both genesis gunmen i very cautiously peered over the bluffs edge a single figure dressed in one of the drab gray boiler suits was running frantically toward the beach it was a young woman who had run from the woodcutting group and now struggled with extraordinary clumsiness toward the sea for a second i dared to hope it was nicole but then i saw this girl had hair as black as night while nicole was fair the fleeing girl tripped and fell and i was sure she must have been hit but then she struggled up again david kept firing then the second genesis gunman the one in the house saw the girl and opened fire he had seen her too late and the range was too great the girl was already close to the concealing bluff she took one panicked look behind her then half jumped and half fell over the earthen cliff for a second i thought she had knocked herself unconscious but then she struggled up and ran toward me i shoved the dinghy into the water david was now firing at the house and his shots dissuaded the gunman in the upper window the farther gunman the one on the high ridge had also ceased fire but only i suspected because he was reloading anchor i yelled at david get the bloody hook up the girl her eyes huge and terrified swerved into the shallow waves toward the dinghy she stumbled and fell fulllength into the cold sea she was gasping as she struggled up and scrambled clumsily over the dinghys bows i clambered after her grabbed the oars and rowed hard toward stormchild the girl sensibly was curled on the dinghys floor and hidden from the genesis gunmen the one on the ridge had opened fire again but the range was too great and his bullets went wide the man in the house could have shredded the dinghy with his fire and i flinched as i saw his guns muzzle appear at the windowsill but then it jerked back as a bullet from davids gun slapped a puff of stone dust and chips from the wall near the window stormchilds anchor windlass was thumping away clattering the pawldragged chain over the fairlead david who was now standing in stormchilds bows fired again at the house i knew he was not firing to kill but only to scare and his tactic seemed to be working i rowed to stormchilds far side over you go i told the girl she obediently tipped herself into stormchilds scuppers then slithered into the cockpit as she wriggled under cover i heard a curious clinking noise and i at last understood why her escape had been so clumsy she was wearing leg chains i followed her on board tying the dinghys painter to the nearest stanchion the girl quivered on the cockpit floor anchors clear david shouted at me he had already started stormchilds engine so all i needed to do was ram it into gear bullets whiplashed overhead one clipped the backstay but did no apparent damage david fired back the anchor chain was still clanking aboard but the anchor was hanging clear of the seabed as stormchild gathered speed the water at her stern churned white i knew this would end badly david shouted at me it hasnt ended yet i said then ducked as a stream of bullets whimpered overhead it was the gunman on the escarpments crest who was firing but i suspected we were in much more danger from a group of armed men who were running toward the shabby trawler someone must have already been aboard the trawler because black smoke had started to pour out of its slender funnel theyre going to chase us i warned david david stowed the anchor while i pushed stormchild to her top speed behind us the decrepit greenpainted trawler clanked away from the quay david came back to the cockpit and winced as someone on board the ancient fishing vessel fired a clip of bullets toward stormchilds stern forget the trawler i told david and take our guest below use the hacksaw on those chains and give her something to eat chains his eyes widened as he saw the leg irons good lord above david took the girl into the saloon as a last hopeless clip of bullets from the hills hissed overhead then we were hidden from that landbased gunman as stormchild reached the tip of the pinetopped headland where a sudden tidal surge carried her out of danger at the speed of a racing dinghy whipping round a mark i spun the wheel amidships and with stormchilds big turbocharged engine at full throttle and with her hull borne along by that enormous tide we traveled quickly away from the trawler the fishing boats stack was spewing a filthy plume of greasy smoke evidence that her old engine was working at maximum effort a rifle fired from the trawler and the bullet clanged off stormchilds transom a second bullet drove a jagged splinter of teak up from the coaming that was good marksmanship too good and i snatched up davids discarded rifle and fired two quick bullets at our pursuer the rifles butt slammed into my shoulder for gods sake whats happening with each rifle shot david could sense potential scandal a man of god caught fighting a private war in chile im discouraging the ungodly i fired again hows the girl she seems to be in shock david went back below the gunman on the trawler splashed a clip of bullets into stormchilds wake i fired one more time then turned back to stormchilds wheel the tide swept us on i was tempted to escape the trawlers laborious pursuit by turning into one of the hightwisting chasms that opened off the wide waterway but i did not know which of the chasms were dead ends or which held shallows that might ground us so it seemed wiser to retrace our steps and hope to outrun the trawler in our wake theyre calling us on channel sixteen david shouted up to me saying what that were kidnapping this girl then tell them to fuck off i told him impatiently david doubtless told them to desist from their transmissions but however politely he phrased his request its only effect was to provoke another flurry of automatic fire from the trawler i returned the compliment the old leeenfield was a wonderfully rugged and reliable weapon but at that moment i would have given a fair chunk of money to have been equipped with an automatic rifle half the trick of winning firefights is to scare the other side with as much noise and mayhem as can be created and a singleshot boltaction rifle was a poor producer of mayhem and noise but like david i had always been a fair shot with a rifle and my slow deliberate fire unsettled the genesis gunmen whose aim was made inaccurate by the labored shuddering of the panting trawler be careful david kept appearing in the companionway to counsel me dont kill anyone in the end it was not my marksmanship that saved us but rather stormchild she was by far the faster boat our enemies shots were falling short or going desperately wide and after a few minutes their firing became sporadic their shots echoed forlornly from the cliffs and bluffs that edged the channel those shots did no damage and soon as stormchild went even farther ahead they ceased altogether our pursuers still did not abandon their attempts to reach us on the radio i took out my handheld set and switched it to channel to hear their message genesis calling stormchild the voice intoned genesis calling stormchild over i assumed they had read our boats name through binoculars genesis this is stormchild over i responded were requesting that you heaveto the voice was toneless the girl you have on board is a member of our community and needs medical help do you understand me over wheres nicole blackburn i asked were requesting that you heaveto the voice said again and im requesting that you fuck off i said out and i switched off the little radio my parting insult produced a last fusillade of rifle fire but the bullets just plopped exhaustedly in our wake five minutes later the trawlers oilburning engine slowed to a dispirited clank and i saw the craft turn away we had escaped it had been a tense few moments but as far as i could tell no one in genesis had been hurt and we were also safe i went down to the saloon to fetch a thermos of coffee and saw that david had cut off the girls shackles and that she was now wrapped in one of our blankets and sitting in front of the saloon heater her soaking wet gray suit was hanging over the back of the chart tables chair the girl who looked to be in her midtwenties was glassyeyed pale shivering and terrified like a creature dragged back from the grave hello i said as cheerfully as i could she offered me a scared look but said nothing david his back to the girl offered me a helpless shrug as though suggesting that the girls wits had fled david was a good pastor but not a sensitive one he offered his parishioners a robust certainty of salvation but left betty to deal with their emotional crises davids solution to a broken heart was a good brisk walk followed by a stiff whiskey which worked with some people but not with most and was certainly not going to work with the waiflike creature who now shivered in stormchilds saloon give her some hot food i suggested ill come down when i can by dusk we were thirty miles north of the isla tormentos our pursuers had long disappeared and their final plaintive radio transmissions had subsided into a crackled silence as the sun shadowed the ravines with a purple haze i nosed stormchild into a narrow passage edged with towering black rocks we seemed to be at the very bottom of the tide for thick weeds and bunches of mussels showed high above the waterline at the channels edges i crept forward fearing to hear the scrape of steel on rock as our keel touched bottom but at last the channel widened into a deep sheltered cove where i was able to rig our mooring lines and drop our anchors i shut off the engines and suddenly the world was a place of blessed and wonderful silence there was not even a wind moaning in the chill still air the cliffs soared above us making an amphitheater of sky in which a thousand thousand seabirds wheeled i was tired and cold but before going below i paddled the dinghy around stormchilds hull to inspect her for bullet damage there were some holes in her stern and some long shining scratches on her flanks but otherwise our escape had been miraculously unscathed i painted the damage over with white paint because steel rusts with an appalling swiftness if it is not protected from the salt air then i went below to find that our guest was now fully dressed in a pair of my trousers and one of davids thick sweaters she was also weeping hysterically her thin shoulders heaving and her breath gulping as she huddled on the cabin floor beside the starboard sofa has she said anything i asked not a word tim not a whimper david had been unsettled by the girls tears so to relieve him i gave him the rifle and told him to go topside and keep watch youll get no sense out of her he warned me go i said just go he went and i sat down beside our guest to discover just what she might know about my daughter the girl when i crouched beside her on the dieselreeking carpet flinched away as if she thought i was going to hit her its all right i crooned its all right im not going to hurt you were friends its all right she made a noise halfway between a choke and a sob but she calmed somewhat as i droned on as softly and reassuringly as i could she was a darkeyed blackhaired girl who i guessed had once been pretty but now that prettiness had soured into a narrow hurt face with sallow skin against which her sunken eyes were so big and dark they looked like bruises her hair hung lank her teeth looked caried and in desperate need of cleaning her bare ankles protruding from the legs of my thick flannel trousers showed horrid patches of open sores where the steel shackles had abraded her skin whats your name i asked her she opened her mouth but only succeeded in making another of the pathetic grizzling sounds i raised a hand to stroke her hair but she immediately flinched away and made another terrified noise im not going to hit you i said its all right and i put my hand very gently on her shoulder and pulled her toward me and after a moments initial resistance she fell against me and began to sob with huge racking heaves of her thin shoulders i stroked her long hair which was sticky with seawater and kept asking for her name but she made no response and i began to suspect that she spoke no english and then more alarmingly i feared that she had somehow lost her tongue or vocal chords and could only make the pathetic glottal noises that intermittently punctuated her sobs i stroked and soothed her for a full ten minutes before she startled me by suddenly finding her voice and when she did manage to speak she did so with an abrupt and astonishing clarity berenice she said my names berenice berenice i repeated the name then remembered that jackie pottens friend had been called berenice tetterman and i softly pushed the girl away from me so that i could look into her bruised eyes youre berenice tetterman i said and you come from kalamazoo in michigan i know your friend jackie shes been looking for you so has your mother my words only provoked another flood of tears but mixed in with the sobs were enough words to confirm that our tattered fugitive was indeed berenice tetterman she told me how guilty she felt about everything and how she thought her mother might be dead so i kept repeating that everything was all right now that she was safe and her mother was alive berenice clung with dirty chipped nails to my sweater her face buried somewhere in my chest and slowly slowly calmed again she even managed to blurt out a question that seemed immensely important to her are either of you ill no of course were not i said in the tone one would use to dismiss a childs ridiculous fantasy of gremlins under the bed or ogres in the night garden she pulled away to look into my face you promise cross my heart and hope to die i said very solemnly were both quite well because he says that people are dying everywhere he says the aids virus is like the black death berenices eyes had widened into terror as she spoke and then she began to cry once more but this time without the awful animal intensity that had made her earlier sobbing so distressing these new tears were ones of exhaustion and sadness but no longer of despair david dropped down the companionway all quiet outside he reported i cant believe theyll find us in this cove i said but i reckon we should keep watch through the night dont you he nodded ill keep watch until midnight you until four then me again sure i was stroking berenice tettermans tangled and saltridden hair has she eaten i asked david she had some toast and coffee why dont you make us all some soup i suggested david switched on the lights in the galley while i went on stroking berenices hair and slowly so very slowly drew her story out from the thickets of her terror her first fear had been the risk of catching the awful contagion with which caspar von rellsteb had terrified his followers he had somehow persuaded berenice and the others in the settlement that the outside world had been so stricken with the aids virus that normal life in socalled civilization had become impossible he had persuaded his disciples that their only safety lay in clinging to his barren island he had succeeded in using the fear of aids as a superbly effective means of control so effective that even now faced with our robust denial of von rellstebs terror stories berenice half suspected we were deceiving her david found a news magazine that had been jammed into a drawer to stop the cutlery rattling look through that he told her i think youll see the world is still fairly normal she leafed through the stained damp pages which told of wars and hostages and terrorism but not of a worldwide plague as awful as those that had decimated medieval europe slowly her look of fear was replaced by one of puzzlement we never see magazines or newspapers she explained because caspar wont let us he says we mustnt contaminate ourselves with things from outside we have to stay pure because were going to change the world she was crying very softly again some of us wanted to leave a long time ago when we first came here but he wouldnt allow us one girl tried and she died then the aids came outside who died i interrupted her what girl died berenice was puzzled by the swiftness and intensity of my question she was called susan do you know nicole blackburn i asked anxiously berenice nodded but said nothing was nicole at the settlement today i asked berenice shook her head but again said nothing and i sensed that the urgency of my questions was somehow frightening her so i made myself sound calm and reassuring again im nicoles father i explained and ive come looking for her do you know where she is berenice seemed scared of answering shed be at the mine if she was anywhere she finally said then launched herself into a long and involved explanation about how she and the others were not really allowed to visit the mine although i went there once she added when they wanted us to clean off a boat it isnt really a mine at all she explained lamely only a limestone quarry with a few shafts but there are some old buildings there as well and nicole lives at the mine i asked the crews dont really live thereberenice frowned as she tried to frame her explanationbut nicole does most of the crews come to the settlement when theyre ashore but not nicole she stays with the boats you see and they shelter at the mine because they had real bad trouble with southerly gales at the settlement the anchorage at the mine is much safer and theyve got an old slipway there so they can haul the boats out of the water if the weather gets really awful david brought us each a mug of oxtail soup and a hunk of hot buttered bread and i remembered too late that both berenices mother and erstwhile best friend were vegetarians which meant this girl could very well be an herbivore as well but she made no objection to the oxtail she gulped it down as though she had not eaten in weeks between spoonfuls she told us how strict the division was between the genesis communitys yacht crews and the settlements workers the workers as jackie potten had envisaged were virtual slaves to the privileged crew members the distinction was even sartorial for the yacht crews wore the genesis green while the workers were given the more utilitarian gray clothes hes real strict about that berenice said sadly she began to tell us about the daily chores of the settlement but i was not listening instead in a state of half shock i was assimilating a very unpleasant truth the same truth had also occurred to david who now watched me with a troubled expression we had both traveled to patagonia in the belief that nicole was being victimized by von rellsteb but from berenices description it was clear that our preconceptions had been horribly wrong and that nicole far from being one of von rellstebs victims was one of his privileged crew members and nicole i finally asked berenice wears green of course berenice nodded upon which answer hung a slew of other messy deductions too messy to think about and ill find nicole at the mine i asked grimly unless shes at sea berenice said dubiously but we dont really know whos at sea and who isnt most of the time but nicole does more sailing than most of the others shes the skipper of a boat you see and they say shes the best sailor of them all better even than caspar i smiled as if acknowledging a compliment to my family while inside i was trying to come to terms with the destruction of one of my most comforting beliefs nicole was not being held prisoner she was not a victim but a free agent she had her own boat she could come and go where she pleased and it had never pleased her to find me david realizing how hard it was for me to come to terms with berenices news took over the questioning by asking how many seagoing yachts the genesis community operated four berenice said two catamarans and two like this one she waved around stormchilds cabin i saw one of the catamarans a week ago but i dont know if its still here david pressed her for more details of the small fleets activities but berenice knew remarkably little about the movements of the four boats only that they sailed away to make a better world and that only those community members who wore green were allowed to crew the yachts how many people are in genesis david asked when it was clear berenice could tell us nothing more about the four yachts theres thirtyone of us at the settlement and i suppose there must be at least another thirty in the crews and there are fourteen children at the settlement tears came to berenices eyes at the mention of the children are you a mother i guessed at the reason for her tears i had a baby berenice said then her voice choked in a pathetically childlike tone but it was stillborn she began to cry the tears streaming silently down her cheeks we waited until she managed to sniff the tears away the children have to work she went on mostly they collect seaweed and mussels and they help with the woodcollecting were always cutting wood and we have to go farther and farther away to find decent trees she shivered suddenly im so tired of cutting wood but caspar says that since i cant breed children im no good for anything except fetching and carrying dear god david said in distaste has nicole had a baby i had to ask i dont think so she sniffed back her tears and tried to drink more of the soup lisl did whos lisl i asked shes caspars girl berenice said as though it was an important piece of information shes german too she was the one who made me wear chains she gestured at the leg irons that david had slung into a corner of the saloon was that a punishment david asked yes for what i burned a stew berenice said but in a voice that seemed genuinely penitent for such a grievous offense she might have fled the genesis community but she was still thinking like one of the group for she hastened to justify her punishment food is very precious you see so one of the first rules we learn is never to waste any it was mutton she explained as though that made her offense worse so you cook for the group i asked i do everything i work in the gardens clean the buildings collect shellfish tan the pelts pelts david interjected they hunt sea otters berenice explained and sell the fur in tierra del fuego at first the fur was just for us because its so cold but now they sell it as well some bloody conservationists i said angrily wondering how selfstyled ecologists could hunt and kill harmless and playful sea otters he wanted to start a fish farm but it didnt work and we used to do experimentsberenice pausedbut they failed what experiments david asked with a note of dread expecting like me to hear of some awful cruelty imposed on man or beast but the experiments had merely been efforts to determine a bacteriological method of destroying oil spills at sea the experiment had been tried in the forlorn concrete tanks in front of the house but the tests had failed and the experiment had petered messily out i wondered whether enthusiasm for the experiment like genesiss ecological idealism had been abraded and destroyed by the hardships of surviving the patagonian winters but berenice despite her desperate eagerness to escape from the settlement still seemed proud of the communitys achievements the yacht crews she said had destroyed drift nets crippled japanese whaling ships and had even made commandostyle forays into the malaysian province of sabah to spike hardwood trees threatened by the timber industry spike david asked they hammer metal spikes into the trunks of trees marked for felling and when the chain saw hits the spike it breaks the saw and they have to stop cutting the tree berenice concluded the explanation very lamely what happens i said laconically is that the chain saw rips itself into steel fragments that very often blind the log cutter and are quite likely to kill the poor sod but it stops the forestry berenice said earnestly oh whoopee i said why did you run away today david who rightly thought my disapproval of genesiss methodology was a waste of our time asked berenice the girl tried to frame a sensible answer but the best she could offer was a jumble of reasons the horrors of life in the settlement the eternal cold and damp how all the luxuries were reserved for the genesis crews how tired she was how she no longer cared whether she lived or died how she hated the sight of cochayuyo which she said was a stringy red seaweed that was the settlements staple food she explained how when she had seen stormchild anchored in the bay she had decided then and there to run away yours was the first strange boat id ever seen in the bay she said with a touching wonder the chilean navy never visits david asked they did at the beginning berenice said but i havent seen a patrol boat in over two years now she hesitated there was another boat i think she spoke very nervously then stopped altogether go on i encouraged i didnt see it she spoke defensively go on i said again i only heard paul talking about it paul i asked hes in one of the crews hes the nicest of them she paused then evidently decided to plunge ahead paul said an australian yacht arrived at the beginning of the summer and that it had three people on board but they were all carrying aids and i asked though i knew the answer already they took the boat to the mine berenice said in a very soft voice thats what i heard but i dont know if its true and the crew was killed david asked sternly no berenice looked shocked at the accusation they put the crew into the sick bay but they died there she looked from davids skeptical face to mine they had aids again she looked at our doubting faces thats what paul said anyway her voice tailed away into a silence broken only by the hiss of the cabin heater and the tiny lapping sounds as the small waves rippled down stormchilds hull what was the name of the australian boat david asked very gently naiad berenice said it was a catamaran my suspicions about the naiads fate made me wonder why david and i had not been killed the moment we appeared that morning berenice had already told us that caspar had not been at the settlement when we arrived and i suspected that in his absence no one else had dared initiate the killing i also suspected that such a decision was reserved to von rellsteb for surely as captain hernandez had suggested in puerto montt the genesis community would need to take great care not to foul their own nests they could afford to offend many people but not the country that gave them refuge but that carefulness would change now for berenice was offering us knowledge that von rellsteb would surely do anything to keep from the ears of the authorities which meant that if the genesis community found stormchild all three of us would be dead meat the boat belongs to nicole now berenice said suddenly the boat i asked naiad she said very fearfully then after a long pause its called genesis now because they all are nicoles is genesis four some of us were surprised that she kept that name because she fell out with caspar fell out i asked it was after the australians died berenice frowned as she tried to remember the details then she shrugged helplessly thats why nicole stays at the mine instead of at the settlement paul told me that caspars frightened of nicole but i dont know if thats true there was another long pause before in a very timid voice she asked whether we were going to take her away from the archipiélago sangre de cristo of course we are i promised then after a pause i asked where we would find the limestone mine she shook her head but said nothing david guessing the purpose of my question frowned disapproval he i was sure wanted to sail north and fetch help from the authorities but i still had questions that needed answers wheres the mine berenice i insisted its at the very end of the estrecho desolada but you mustnt go there you mustnt the terror that had erupted in her voice was quite genuine if you go theyll catch me and theyll punish me just take me away please she began to cry again and out of the sobs came an incoherent wailing that seemed to be about her dead baby and about her mother then she began to shake in huge racking sobs so i laid her down put her head on a cushion and draped a blanket over her shivering body then released from the need to soothe and calm her i stood and stretched my legs and arms to fetch the cramp out of my muscles i think david spoke softly to me that we now have more than enough evidence of malfeasance to demand action by the chilean authorities and we should certainly have this girls affidavit delivered to the australian embassy in santiago malfeasance i mocked david who as a justice of the peace liked to use legal terms you think ive just sailed ten thousand fucking miles to find evidence of malfeasance yes he said very sharply thats what we agreed tim we agreed to reconnoiter we have weve even succeeded in finding ourselves a firstrate witness what more can we possibly hope to achieve our clear duty now is to fetch competent help what you do is your business i told him but im going on watch i picked up the rifle that was propped at the foot of the companionway sleep well i said we have to alert the authorities david insisted we were lucky today tim because we got out alive but we cant rely on our luck holding we have to go for help ill wake you at four i still would not face his truth because i had truths of my own to digest so instead i went topside to where a million stars burned cold above a wilderness and where in the nights sharp darkness i mourned i sat in stormchilds cockpit with the loaded rifle across my lap and i reflected how easily the world divided itself into the exploiters and the exploited and how that crude division was mirrored by the green and gray uniforms of genesis and nicole my beloved nicole wore green nicole did not have to eat the awful cochayuyo nicole did not have to work for long cold wet hours in the shitstinking mud of the vegetable gardens nicole did not have to wade thighdeep in icecold waters to gather mussels and seaweed nicole did not have to cut wood nicole did not sleep on an ironframed cot in a damp dormitory that stank of drying diapers instead nicole wore green and was trusted to sail in far waters nicole probably knew of murders no worse and i could not face that last suspicion but at least i now knew and now accepted that nicole was not a victim she was part of the control system she was an exploiter i had been wrong about her i was not sailing to rescue her from von rellsteb but from herself highminded crap i accused myself aloud when that neat thought occurred to me i was sitting dryeyed and bitter in stormchilds cockpit with my gloved hands resting on the wood and metal of the old rifle high above me seen through the wide chimney of the cliffs a myriad of stars shone bright in the cloudless sky the moon was hidden by one of the hills yet it shone a silver light onto the edge of the western cliffs and a little of that light seeped down to shimmer the black water in the narrow entrance channel nothing stirred in the night until someone woke below and stormchild moved as the person walked about the saloon i saw a crack of light show between the companionway washboards then heard the hiss of the stove it had to be david who had woken for i was sure berenice would not have the courage to light the stove and make herself coffee i waited listening to the domestic sounds of spoon and cup and kettlewhistling then as the light snapped out i heard davids footsteps climb the companionway couldnt sleep he explained brusquely brought you a coffee he put the mug beside me then settled on the opposite thwart im sorry he said as curtly as he had explained his presence he radiated embarrassment why are you sorry i asked him youre wondering about nicole arent you he had not i noticed described what worried me but he knew well enough shes my daughter david i said of course i worry about her then thats why im sorry he was silent for a long time water rippled on the hull and the air was cold enough to mist our breath ive been thinking timdavid broke the silencei guessed you might be too upset to be clearheaded so i decided to make a few decisions on my own good splendid i was hardly making it easy for him what we have to dohe spoke with the forced enthusiasm of a scoutmaster addressing a particularly obdurate troopis sail north get ourselves to santiago and enroll some firstclass assistance there frankly weve exhausted our options here and i dont relish our chances of stirring up real action in puerto montt but ive no doubt our embassy in santiago will listen to us and im sure the australian government will want to hear the story that girl told us tonight so first thing in the morning i think we should up anchor and sail north dont you agree i never thanked you for making the coffee i said so thank you david sighed but was determined to stay reasonable you have something else in mind tim i was just wondering i said mildly what we planned to do about nicole shell have to take her chances with the rest david said awkwardly i turned my head to look at him what does that mean i asked it means nothing david said he like me was skirting around the mine field of nicoles character i am sure david said heavily that nicole has done nothing and therefore has nothing to fear from the authorities she sails a stolen yacht i said and ill bet you next easters collection that the australian crew was murdered oh come david was offended we dont know that and we certainly dont know if nickel was involved indeed we dont i said which is why i want to find her before i condemn her i paused to stare up at the cold stars i dont believe shes a killer i said at last i think von rellsteb is but not nicole i really cant believe shes a killer not my daughter so there cant be any harm in summoning the authorities can there david asked but i want to find out exactly what she is i went on as though david had not spoken i just want to see her before i loose the dogs on her its not a question of releasing the dogs david said very awkwardly then fell into a moody silence the thin moonlight showed a pale mist seeping off the black water so that stormchild seemed to float in a silver vapor beneath a canopy of silent starlight the peace was broken by a bird roosting somewhere on the cliffs above making a brief raucous protest there was a flap of wings another indignant squawk then silence again hows the glass i asked suddenly david paused wondering what trick i was playing then decided to take my question at face value its still rising i suspect were in for at least one more day of fine weather i rested my head on the safety rail if we really intended to run for santiago david were too late of course were not to reach santiago i interrupted him icily we would have to sail to valparaíso which would mean weathering cape raper we have now been holed up in this cove for nine hours which means that the genesis boats will already be ahead of us and they know damn well we need to clear the cape so theyll be waiting for us there i know we can sail far out to sea and thus try to evade them but what im telling you is that theyve already positioned themselves between us and the authorities and getting past them will be risky we cant be certain of that he said stiffly i turned my head to look at him you want to bet your life on that uncertainty there was no answer i shrugged the settlement will have radioed the mine and whatever boats were there will have left to track us down they know we sailed north so thats the direction theyll pursue and theyll know that their catamaran is far faster than stormchild so theyll be hoping to overtake us long before todays dawn what they dont know is that were holed up here and that consequently theyve overshot us ah david suddenly brightened youre suggesting we sail south to puerto natales instead good idea therell be a police post there ill be bound and we can talk to the embassy by phone not as effective perhaps as bashing on the ambassadors door but if we make a fuss theyre bound to listen no i said im not proposing that we sail to puerto natales but to the mine there was a seconds silence before david exploded in protest youre a fool tim we dont even know if nicole is there she probably isnt i admitted but maybe she is berenice saw a catamaran a week ago and we know nicole sails one of their two catamarans but even if she isnt there its the place where i can find out about her life the mine is nicoles refuge her bolthole and thats where ill either discover her or her belongings and in any casedavid entirely ignored my explanationthe mine is at the very end of the straits and well be bottled up there like a mouse trapped in a wellington boot my dear tim i entirely sympathize with your concern but i must insist that we behave sensibly we did agree to be prudent didnt we the prudent behavior i said very irritably was never to have come here at all but having come this far im not going to go for help to the chilean authorities not before i know what kind of future im making for nicole by bringing in the chilean police david was silent for a long time his pipe glowed intermittently as he puffed smoke into the rigging and when he did finally speak his voice had become calm and reflective as though he knew he could not dissuade me by argument so would now try a more subtle approach go to bed tim in the morning well decide how to escape this trap i did not move the point is i said instead that i came here to find nicole and to talk to her and it seems very stupid to get this close then just run away we are not running away david said very firmly were simply fetching competent assistance if you discover a wasps nest in your garden shed you dont go after it with bare hands besides just what chance do you think we have of escaping from the dead end of the desolate straits well be trapped there come tim be realistic i wasnt thinking of using the desolate straits i said very mildly i rather thought we might try the canal almagro instead there were a few seconds of silence as david recalled the chart then his protest was loud enough to disturb some of the nesting seabirds youre crazy not if the weather holds i said gently and you said yourself that the glass was rising its madness tim david said earnestly madness the almagro channel was the deep and winding fjord that pierced the pacific coast of the isla tormentos and which very nearly cut the island in two on our best chart the fjords dead end looked to be only two or three miles from the limestone working and it would thus carry us very close to the genesis communitys innermost lair but it was a passage full of danger the danger was not from the gunmen of genesis for they would surely not believe that anyone would be foolish enough to use the fjord but rather lay in the entrance to the canal almagro which was narrow rockbound and exposed to the full impact of the massive pacific rollers the fjords entrance would be impassable in rough weather but there was just a chance that if this fine spell lasted then the perilous entrance might prove navigable and it was a chance that seemed worth taking if i was to discover more about my daughter i wont let you do it david said in his most authoritative manner its far too dangerous youre not thinking straight shut up i interrupted him with a savage firmness i am master of this vessel i command here this is not a democracy and later today if the weather holds stormchild will sail to the almagro channel if you choose not to stay aboard then ill find a place to put you ashore i stood id be grateful if you woke me in two hours time whatever you say david said unhappily i went to my sleeping bag but could not sleep berenice was sobbing in the cabin that had been jackies quarters david under the lights of heaven sat guard in the cockpit and i lay awake waiting for dawn and for nightmare i took stormchild out of her refuge before first light there was still scarcely a breath of wind so we ghosted with an idling engine through a lightening mist that pearled our rigging with silver beads of water just as we emerged from the sheltered channel i was alarmed by a heavy splash and i whipped round in fear that our enemies had been waiting in ambush for us but it was only a sea lion plunging off a rock the mist became thicker as we nosed into the main channel which i was forced to navigate by instinct and radar david had agreed to accompany me into the almagro channel he came under protest and on the firm understanding that i would turn back at the first sign of real danger he had also insisted that when i explored the limestone mine i would use the utmost circumspection so that our enemies would not suspect our presence on the island i had solemnly promised that i would indeed be prudent two hours after dawn the mist was gone shredded by a rising wind that blew us toward the open sea as we neared the ocean the swells began to make themselves felt in the rockbound waterways the water surged in great billows between the high walls gurgling and pouring over black boulders then sucking and draining as the troughs followed i hoisted the sails and as stormchild emerged into the open sea the rising wind caught us and carried us fast to where the great waves rose and fell on the rugged cliff faces of the outermost islands birds screamed at us i killed the engine hardened the sheets and felt the exultation of a sailor released from rockbound channels into open water we sailed five miles offshore then turned stormchild south david cooked bacon and eggs while berenice who was now wearing jackie pottens oilskins came to the cockpit and stared in wonder at the open sea and sky there were no other sails in sight and i suspected that our enemies had gone far to the north leaving their back door unguarded i told berenice what we planned to do she looked terrified at the thought of going back to the isla tormentos but i explained that she would not have to go ashore ill walk to the mine i told her and you can stay with david ill only be gone a few hours are you looking for nicole she asked me timidly yes or for news of her she might be there berenice said though without any conviction her voice was dull i paused to tack ship for a second the headsails banged like great guns then stormchild settled on the port tack a wave shattered on the stem to spray foam down our canted deck i sheeted in the staysail then glanced at berenice you dont like nicole do you i had guessed as much the previous night from the hesitant way in which berenice had spoken of nicole berenice seemed taken aback by my challenge but she did her best to meet it without causing me offense shes very fierce she finally said in a pathetic voice she always was i said soothingly shes very competent and she doesnt have a lot of patience with people who arent as skilled as she is im not surprised she had a fight with caspar von rellsteb i waited a second then decided it was worth asking again what the argument had been about was it about the australian catamaran i guessed i expected no answer but to my surprise berenice was suddenly loquacious it wasnt about that she said but because nicole thinks we ought to be more active she says its really counterproductive for all of us to be isolated in south america she thinks that there ought to be genesis communities all over the world i smiled that sounds like nicole i said ready to organize everyone and take over the world nicole thinks we arent achieving enough berenice said weakly then in a rush of frankness she admitted that many in the group believed nicole was right and that von rellstebs dream had failed it was meant to be different when we moved down here she said we were going to be strengthened by isolation at least thats what caspar said and we were going to sail out like oldfashioned warriors to put right all the worlds wrongs but it just didnt work she frowned things are so difficult even to organize a meal is hard and we were supposed to be doing these experiments on degrading oil spills but they all went wrong and then he got angry and somehow nothing works any more we just survive most of us just go from day to day and hope nothing awful happens but even organizing a meal is hard i was appalled at the hopelessness in her voice why the hell didnt you run away sooner or protest why didnt you rebel because if we tried anything like that berenice said limply we were punished not by nicole she added for my benefit because nicoles usually at sea shes by far the most committed of all the crews i mean if anyones doing any good it has to be nicole that at least was some good news about my daughter and it made me dare to hope that perhaps i had let my suspicions of nicole run away with me in the night perhaps in the welter of disappointment and failure that dogged the community only nicole was achieving anything worthwhile perhaps i thought i had no need to explore further because if berenice was right then nicole was not tarred with the brush of von rellstebs violence grub up david appeared with baconandegg sandwiches and i made berenice repeat her description of nicoles activism it doesnt surprise me that shes the most effective david said proudly and again i felt the hope that my daughter was struggling to distance herself from von rellstebs brutality and failure berenice wanted to know about jackie i told her what i could though had to invent an anodyne answer when berenice asked why her old friend had abandoned stormchild in antigua i think she just wanted to find a newspaper that would commission a story about genesis i lied berenice accepted the answer at its face value then after thinking for a few seconds her face brightened do you think shell come here to find me on her own i mean good god no david said hurriedly she hasnt got the means to come here has she tim not unless a newspaper funds her i said and bleakly wondered just how the idealistic jackie would survive in this maelstrom of failure and violence by mid morning the wind had freshened into the south and stormchilds heavy bows were chopping with a perceptible shudder into each new wave i feared that the rising wind might already have made the fjords entrance impassable while david was clearly pessimistic of our chances because the ocean swell was huge and while such big seas were harmless in the open water they would be killers where they crashed against the cliffs of the barrier islands to bounce back in complex and tumultuous cross patterns of surge and trough stormchild would have to be steered through those clashing tons of water and through the cold lash of the wind that would be trying to hurl her against the northern cliffs of the fjords entrance the rising wind reflecting like the water off the cliffs would be as tricky to negotiate as the sea i would use the engine to make the passage but i still faced an immensely difficult piece of seamanship once inside the fjord we would have a fifteenmile journey to where we could anchor for the night in the darkness just before dawn i planned to go ashore i hoped to approach the mine in the mists of early morning make my reconnaissance then sneak back to the boat unseen and unheard by genesis yet the whole plan if it could even be distinguished by the word plan depended on successfully negotiating the narrow sea gate where the wind and waves waited in awful ambush there david said somberly in the early afternoon and he handed me his binoculars and i saw in the great line of cliffs a place where the spray was being shattered high into the freshening wind beyond that shimmering curtain of broken foam was a dark cleft in the rock i was looking at the seaward face of isla tormentos and at the desperately narrow crack in its stone coast i let stormchild fall off the wind then turned the key to put power into the boats starter motor go go i murmured encouragement to the big diesel as the starter motor thumped the engine into life i suddenly knew this was madness but i would not turn back beyond the shadowed rockbound gut and beyond the storm of breaking waves lay nicole and my confused hopes of her innocence and my equally confused fears for her guilt and so we plunged toward the rocks god help us david who would have hated me to know he was nervous could not resist the prayer i knew he wanted to turn back but for the moment his pride would not let him make that confession instead he just closed his eyes and talked to god berenice her knuckles blanched white clung to the safety rail that ran just beneath the collapsed spray hood i stood behind the wheel my legs braced against the boats savage roll and tried to make some sense of the titanic battle of ocean waves that barred our passage to the fjords mouth the pattern of that battle began in a simple enough fashion the great swells born deep in the pacific traveled for thousands of miles to hammer themselves into oblivion against the patagonian rocks that oblivion was not instantaneous when one of the massive waves struck the cliff it dissipated some of its energy as airborne spray but far more of its energy was bounced outward as a reflected wave that went headtohead with the next thunderous roller if the cliffs were irregularly shaped as these were then that pattern of wave reflection became tangled and unpredictable except i had to predict the pattern or else stormchild would be tossed aside by one of those waves and splintered into shattered steel against the spraydrenched cliffs turn back for gods sake tim david at last gave way to his fear you agreed we wouldnt take any risks turn for the love of christ turn just pray i shouted at him pray and a second afterward it was too late for anything but prayer for if we had now turned broadside to the swells the suction of the waves would have dragged us down into the roots of the cliffs there to be overwhelmed as thousands of tons of pacific rollers hammered themselves to death around us where the reflected waves struck the incoming seas there were huge eruptions of foam that were like the explosions of gigantic artillery shells the noises of the coast were deafening the hammer blows of water striking rock the seething clash of seas in turmoil the racing of our engine the crack as the wind took our foresail aback and over it all like the screams of devils waiting to pluck our souls to hell the shrieking seabirds who swooped on long thin wings through the windwhipped mist of spray and air the islands cliffs appeared like gigantic ramparts crowned by wheeling seabirds i whooped defiance then more sensibly looked to make sure that my companions were wearing their lifelines the boat itself was battened down with every hatch dogged shut and every item on deck doublelashed down though such precautions were mere cosmetics for surely nothing on gods earth or in gods sea could save us if i had calculated this approach wrong a wave lifted stormchilds stern and i felt the raw power of a whole wide ocean surge us forward i raced stormchilds engine in an attempt to keep her speed high a mass of water slammed us from the left breaking white foam as high as the radar aerial on the mast the water crashed into the cockpit and swirled down the scuppers i glimpsed the cliffs wet rock face off to port and instinctively gave the boat some starboard rubber but too much for a reflected wave thumped us on the port bow and berenice screamed because it seemed as if i was now steering the boat straight for the sawedged crags on our starboard bow i snatched the wheel back but the helm suddenly felt loose and soggy and i knew that the surging sea was overtaking us and stealing the power from stormchilds big steel rudder then just as the great sea crashed past and just as it seemed that we must be thrown against the starboard rocks the deck seemed to drop away to port like a falling airplane and stormchild slid hard into a trough and there steadied on her keel the rudder bit the engine raced and inch by inch we fought our way into the rocks gut behind us a new sea threw its shadow across our deck the wave that had first carried us then overtaken us broke against the cliffs ahead drenching us with water and deafening us with the sound of its destruction yet through the welter of its windborn foam i could just see a smooth greenhearted black path the path led to safety and i pushed on the wheels spokes as though i could personally force stormchild into the islands calm heart the wave that had been thrashing at our stern now picked us up and threw us forward the rudders power vanished again we had become a steel missile that was being hurled by a massive force into a rock cliff berenice crouched david stared wideeyed and i felt the wheel quivering in my hands for a few seconds we ran in the center of a whirlpool to starboard a thousand tons of water shattered into flailing scraps above us the wet sail flogged to port a sudden dark hole appeared at the base of a wave to reveal a black jagged rock thick with seaweed and mussels i heard berenice scream in terror then suddenly there were cliff faces to left and right a smoothly heaving sea beneath us and a maelstrom of foam behind us we had made it piece of cake i said wondering if i would ever manage to uncurl my frozen fingers from the wheels spokes nothing to it david said but in a voice every bit as shaky as mine im sorry if i panicked you didnt i said he laughed nervously i did tim i did and im already terrified of going back out again thatll be much easier i said dismissively which it would so long as no gale was blowing and so long as we shot the entrance at what passed in these seas for slack water i throttled back the racing motor the swells heaved down the channel while behind us the breaking waves roared and growled and clawed at the fjords narrow entrance but we had escaped their fury and were now running into the heart of an island where my daughter and all her secrets lay hidden berenice became demonstrably more nervous as we sailed further up the fjord and closer to the limestone workings i asked her if anyone from the genesis community ever visited the fjord and she shook her head but then added that such a visit was not implausible theyve got two crosscountry motorbikes she explained the bikes dont always work and theyre usually short of gasoline but sometimes they ride all over the island i still doubted that the genesis group would think it worth their while to patrol the seaward coast of their island they had seen us flee northward and would surely assume we had kept going toward puerto montt or valparaíso i did my best to reassure berenice of her safety but she was almost catatonic with fear as stormchild nosed ever farther into the islands heart we used the engine for though there was plenty of wind the fjords steep sides either cheated us of the winds power or else made its direction so fickle that the sails would have been aback as often as they might have offered help the soft beat of our engine echoed back from massive black cliffs that were slashed by high white plumes of narrow waterfalls sometimes the fjord opened unexpectedly into wide lakelike basins that were dotted with treecovered islands and more than once we had trouble deciding which waterway from such a lake was the main channel the charts were no help they merely confirmed that the canal almagro existed but no one it seemed had ever surveyed its tortuous course its possible i told david that were the first boat ever to come here thats a thought david said with pleasure at my request he had broken out the second rifle from its hiding place in stormchilds bows but now kept a nervous eye on the depth sounder he also noted that the glass was dropping its not desperately worrying he said in a voice that belied his apparent confidence but neither is it entirely reassuring in any normal circumstance the fjord with its bays and anchorages would have offered the perfect shelter from a sudden gale but any such gale would so heap the seas at the fjords narrow entrance that we ran the risk of marooning stormchild inside then if the genesis community did discover our presence our boat would be like a rat trapped in a barrel we could not risk such a fate so we agreed that should the weather threaten to lock stormchild inside the fjord while i was making my reconnaissance of the limestone workings david would take the boat back to sea and wait for a message from the handheld vhf radio that i would take ashore david even though we had run the major risk of negotiating the fjords entrance was still opposed to my reconnaissance you have no certainty that nicole will be there he protested nor that youll find any news of her and youve got no certainty to the contrary i said for gods sake david just let me alone for one day i promise that if i find nothing or if what i find is bad then ill sail north with you and well call in the cops but no heroics david warned me this is just a reconnaissance and you are not going to take any risks is that a promise scouts honor i said and gave him the sea scouts salute i know you tim david said in a slightly despairing voice youre in a stupidly heroic mood you think you can swan across the island find nicole rescue her then come back here and open a celebratory bottle of champagne well it wont work no battle is won by irresponsibility of course it isnt i agreed but without the fervor my brother demanded of me tim please david said in exasperation we agreed that at the first sign of violence we would withdraw and yesterday we were fired on but did we withdraw did we act upon our agreement no we did not you pulled captains rank and here we are taking yet another risk so i want your promise that you will try no heroics no stupidity i want your promise you have it i said and meant it too it was almost dusk as stormchild reached the fjords blind end where the water widened into a large rippled pool that was surrounded by gently sloping hills the shingle beaches were edged by belts of woodland where ferns moss and wild fuchsia grew in livid green tangles beneath windstunted beech trees streams tumbled white and cold from the hills a kingfisher flashed bright across the gray water as stormchilds anchor rattled down to bite on the bed of a lagoon where i guessed no ship had ever anchored before the wide lake that terminated the fjord had no name printed on our chart even the lake was not shown so i inked in its rough outline and then added a name of my own devising lake joanna the evening light was gray and wintry all day the clouds had been gathering in the west threatening wind and rain but suddenly as stormchild tugged at her bedded anchor flukes the setting sun emerged from a chasm of smoky vapor to cast a redgold wash of fierce light across our anchorage the sunlight made the small mountain streams look like rivulets of molten gold spilling toward a cauldron of liquid silver above which uncountable seabirds flew on gilded wings toward their nests i waited until the glow faded and until the spilling streams of gold had turned back to cold white water again then i went below it was my turn to cook then david would keep watch through the dark hours of the night before in the first gray light of dawn i would go to journeys end i had been at sea too long the backs of my legs felt as though they were sinewed with barbed wire while the breath rasped in my throat and a stitch agonized at my waist i had plenty of strength in my upper body from wrestling with stormchilds wheel and hauling on her lines but my stamina and my leg muscles seemed to have atrophied from the long weeks of being penned up in a small boat it was dawn and i was climbing the steep slope above the trees that edged the fjords beach i was carrying one of stormchilds rifles and a bag which held spare ammunition my rigging knife a torch binoculars the handheld radio and a few rations i also had forty feet of halfinch nylon line looped round my upper body for berenice had warned that there were places on the island that were inaccessible without a climbers rope behind and beneath me below the trees and scrub which had soaked me with their dew as i struggled through their entanglement in the nights last darkness i could just see stormchild in the battleshipgray mist that steamed off lake joannas sheltered surface it was my first sight of my boat this day for i had woken and eaten breakfast in the dark then exchanged my sea boots for an old pair of walking boots and had put on two sweaters and an old waxedcotton shooting coat that offered some rudimentary camouflage before still in darkness david had rowed me ashore we had used a lantern to search the beach till we found a distinctive palecolored rock which was the size and shape of a dinner plate and we had agreed that should david be forced to move stormchild to sea or to a different anchorage he would leave me a note hidden under the stone otherwise he expected to see me at dusk if i came back after nightfall i was supposed to signal my whereabouts with the torch david had stood on the beach offering me instruction after instruction all very prudent and laborious and afterward he had rather formally shaken my hand and wished me good luck but no heroics tim no heroics i had agreed now six hundred feet above stormchild and beneath a lowering gunmetal sky i paused to catch my breath the ground was uneven tussocked and burrowed by nesting birds while the rifle seemed to weigh a ton i glanced up at the sky wondering when the rain would come the wind had suddenly sprung cold and fierce if i had not known this to be the southern hemispheres summer i would have thought a fall of snow was imminent it took me another half hour to reach the crest of the ridge once there i stopped panting and sweating and took out the small handheld radio the set was tuned to channel a vhf frequency that had once been used for contacting marinas and boatyards in british waters and which i doubted anyone other than david would be monitoring im on your skyline i told him david answered immediately shore party shore party this is stormchild stormchild took your time strolling up that hill didnt you can you see anything over nothing facing me was not as i had hoped a long shallow slope leading down to the mine workings but rather a wide bleak saddle that looked suspiciously marshy i took the binoculars from my bag and searched the high plateau but nothing moved there except the long grasses that rippled under the winds cold touch whats the glass doing i asked david shore party shore party this is stormchild the barometer is still dropping it is now showing thirty and a half inches i say again three zero point five inches over you mean a thousand and thirtythree millibars i teased him i mean thirty and one half english inches and not some ridiculous french standard of measurement david was incorrigibly oldfashioned in such matters over the glass had read millibars when i woke which meant that it was dropping more steeply than i had hoped that drop indicated that a depression threatened us a threat heralded by the freshness of the wind that i thought was probably stiffening if the glass goes on falling at this rate i advised david then youd better think of making it to sea shore party shore party this is stormchild i agree ill read the glass again in one hour and then decide may i now suggest you conserve your battery power out i dutifully switched off the little radio shoved it deep into my bag and marched on from now on i would be out of sight of stormchild which meant that the vhf radios which worked only on line of sight would be blanketed into silence the upland saddle proved to be more than just marshland it was a stretch of icecold bog land that sucked at my boots and sapped what little strength i had left at times missing my footing on the firmer tussocks i would plunge up to a thigh in the wet peaty mess it had begun to drizzle but soon that drizzle turned into a chill rain that thickened into a miserable downpour that blotted out the horizon like sea fog i had not thought to bring one of my old prismatic compasses but i doubted i would get lost for if the charts were right then the dead end of the desolate straits where berenice assured me the limestone workings were built lay just beyond the saddles eastern ridge which in turn was no more than a mile away yet already the marshland had consumed over two hours of painful wet slow struggle i tried to console myself that some people paid small fortunes to be just so discomfited as they stalked deer on the scottish hills but the consolation did not help at last the going became firmer and the upward slope steeper evidence that i was reaching the far side of the saddle rain was dripping from my hat and my boots squelched with every step the cold was seeping into my bones while my heels had been rubbed into painful blisters off to my left i could see a rocky peak which looked uncannily like one of the granite tors on dartmoor while directly ahead of me the skyline seemed to be crowned with a rampart of ice blocks it was not until i was within a few paces of the blocks that i saw they were actually pale limestone boulders that were scattered along the ridge line above the quarry and where winded sore and tired i collapsed onto the wet turf and stared eastward far off dim through the smearing rain were the slopes of the andes while nearer though still watered into obscurity was the labyrinth of islands and twisting channels that made this coast so tangled and broken it was despite the rain a magnificent view yet beneath me was something that interested me far more the limestone workings i had come at last to genesiss inner citadel the most obvious and the ugliest evidence of the old limestone workings was the quarry itself a vast open scar that must have been a full half mile across and six hundred feet deep and which had been ripped out of the hillside to leave a curving artificial cliff that faced toward the headwaters of the desolate straits trickles of peatybrown water made miniature falls over the cliff falls that tumbled hundreds of feet to the quarry floor which was cut into vast terraces so that it looked like an amphitheater for giants littered with jagged boulders dotted with pools and strewn with shale and the detritus of the explosions that had once ripped the limestone out of the hills belly dark holes in the quarrys sides betrayed where mine shafts had been driven horizontally into the mountain to my left beyond the big quarry i could see a second and much smaller quarry which appeared to face directly onto the straits at the seaward side of the larger quarrys floor where the amphitheater spilled its dark wet litter of shale toward the sea was a group of rusting and ugly buildings the buildings were dwarfed by the quarrys size yet when i examined them through the binoculars and counted the flights of iron steps that zigzagged up the flank of the largest structure i realized just how huge the old sheds were the largest one a great gaunt structure seemed big enough to house an airship the buildings were grouped together sloping roof touching sloping roof presumably so that the men who had once lived and worked in this godawful place would never have needed to expose themselves to patagonias merciless weather i raised the glasses a fraction to see a covered loading ramp sloping down from the large building toward the stone pier that jutted into the desolate straits the profits from limestone must have been huge to have made it worthwhile to bring in all that corrugated iron and timber and machinery i could see no one moving around the buildings or on the hugely stepped floor of the quarry no boats broke the windchopped surface of the straits beyond though the lip of the quarry hid the closest stretch of water from my high viewpoint the limestone works seemed deserted indeed they looked as though they had been deserted for years and i felt a twinge of anxiety that berenice might have invented her story of nicole using the mine as her sanctuary there was only one way to find the truth and that was to descend into the quarry i meant to keep my promise to david so before making any move i used the binoculars to search the lip of the small quarry then to painstakingly investigate the larger quarry and all its buildings again i stared hard at every door and window yet i saw nothing threatening and the only movement in the quarry was the rippling of the rainspeckled pools under the winds lash still i waited as the rain pelted onto the empty landscape i had a flask of cold tea and a great slab of fruitcake that i consumed as a second breakfast while i watched the old workings for any signs of life i was soaked and chilled to the bone yet i endured the discomfort for a full hour seeing neither man nor beast the only oddity apart from the fact that the quarry and its buildings existed at all was a tractor that was parked beside one of the ramshackle sheds but even with the binoculars it was impossible to tell whether the machine had been abandoned fifty years before or just left there a few hours ago after a further half hour during which i became increasingly certain that the limestone works were deserted i picked up my gun and bag and walked down the righthand edge of the quarry it should have been a moment of heightened apprehension even drama for years i had dreamed of finding my daughter and now miraculously half a world away from home i was carrying a gun into the heart of von rellstebs mad empire nicole might be just a mile away from me and even if she was at sea i still hoped that i would find some evidence that she was innocent of anything worse than a fanatical desire to cleanse the planet i tried to buoy up my anticipation to tell myself that i was on the brink of a dreams fulfillment but i was too wet and too cold and too aching and too tired to feel the proper apprehension so numbed by cold i stumbled downhill i splashed through peaty streams and tripped on thick tussocks of springy grass my throat was sore and i prayed that it was not the first symptom of a cold there was still no movement by the huge sheds which as i came closer appeared more and more dilapidated whole roof sheets of corrugated iron had been ripped away by the winds to leave rotten holes in which only the beams were left exposed other iron sheets half loosened by the storms creaked and flapped in the wind rainwater poured off the sloping roofs cascading through the broken sheets into the shadowed shed interiors where there was paint on window frames or doors it was peeling and cracked the place looked as miserable and deserted as an abandoned whaling station on a remote antarctic island i stopped a quarter mile from the rusted sheds and again examined them through my binoculars but still i saw nothing to worry me i gazed for a long long time but saw no one move across the sodden quarry floor or past one of the windows the quarry and its old works seemed as empty as the backside of the moon i reached the bottom of the hill now i was just a hundred yards from the sheds still nothing threatened me if an ambush had been set then the ambushers were being as silent as the grave but i felt no instinctive apprehension of danger i only felt the anticipation of disappointment for it seemed ridiculous that i might find anything of value in this rusted derelict place i looked at my watch and reckoned i had time to search for three or four hours and still be back at the fjord long before dusk and the thought of returning to stormchild made me long to sit in front of her saloon heater with a hot whiskeytoddy that tantalizing vision made me wonder whether stormchild would be waiting when i returned the rain was falling more heavily and the wind blowing more strongly than it had at dawn the gale david feared might be swirling its way toward the coast and david might already have taken stormchild to safety on the last of the mornings ebb tide i hoped he would be there nonetheless for i was soaked through the rain was leaking down the collar of my coat and the temptation of stormchilds spartan comforts was a torment as i paused once more to search the quarry buildings with the binoculars no one moved there nothing threatened and so throwing caution to the wind i splashed through puddles made milkwhite by limestone dust to push open the nearest door that hung ajar off ancient rusted hinges i found myself in an old stable a reminder that these limestone workings must once have been powered by ponies or mules no one waited for me no one shouted a warning i seemed utterly alone as i walked past the old stalls and under the cacophony of the metal roof being tortured by the rising wind water dripped and trickled onto the cobbled floor some of the stalls still had their iron feeding baskets while in a couple there were even frayed head ropes hanging next to the stables and in equal disrepair were the bunkrooms where the quarrymen had slept the windows were broken and the old wooden floor was rotted and covered with bird droppings a faded calendar was tacked to one wall i gingerly crossed the room treading only where nail heads betrayed the existence of joists under the decaying floorboards and i saw that the yellowing calendar was for the month of dezember the script was a big black ornate german gothic there was a photograph faded almost to invisibility that showed a tram in front of a big stone building while two uniformed men presumably the vehicles proud crew stood with chests thrust out by the trams steps i walked through a door on which the faded word waschraum was painted in the same blackletter as the calendar the washroom consisted of lavatory stalls and two zinclined troughs the lavatories were blackened and broken while the troughs had collapsed under a welter of old water pipes the roof of this room was almost entirely missing and the rain poured in to make a huge puddle on the decayed floor moss and weeds grew thick in some of the broken lavatories while the stalls still bore their prewar graffiti mute witnesses to the lonely frustrations of breaking limestone from this quarry at the worlds bitter end i went through another door and edged carefully down a passage from which a number of small rooms opened to my right some of the rooms still held the rusted metal frames of old cot beds and i assumed that the quarrys managers had once slept here the windows offered fine views of the desolate straits blind end where the deceptive waterway widened into an immense and sheltered pool and in which a great ship could easily have turned its full length before docking beside the quarrys pier berenice had told us how genesis had begun using this anchorage because it was so much more sheltered than the bay at the settlement and i could see the sense of that decision for this great sea pool had to be one of the most secure anchorages i had ever seen it was also an empty anchorage unless i counted a halfsunken rusted barge that lay at the seaward end of the old pier on the southern side of the bay was a stone quay which was backed by a row of low stone buildings beside the quay was a slipway up which two steel rails ran evidence that boats could as berenice had said be drawn safely out of the water in this place but there was no sign of any activity on the quay or on the slipway there were no yachts or dinghies in sight just the wet wind the cold rain and the empty straits the absence of any boats disappointed and relaxed me i was disappointed because their absence surely meant that nicole was not here but it also meant that no one else from genesis waited in this dreadful spot and that therefore i could not possibly be in any danger i decided my enemies must have sailed northward gone to intercept stormchild off cape raper i went through another door and stopped in sheer amazement i was also overcome with sudden fear because i found myself standing on a rickety wooden platform high above a machinery floor the timbers under my feet creaked ominously and it seemed as if one more step would splinter the old wood and tumble me forty feet down to the floor i had entered the largest of all the quarrys buildings the tall gaunt shed which i now saw had been built above and around an excavated pit and it was in that huge stone pit shadowed dark beneath me that the quarrys old machinery rusted into powder the quarry had been dug to produce limestone the great rocks once they had been exploded and dragged out of the mountain had entered the building to my left and then been processed through the massive crushers and grinders beneath me until turned into rubble and powder they had gone spilling down the ramp on my right and into the holds of ships waiting at the pier then carried to europe or to north america or to australia the limestone had been manufactured into cement lime wash or fertilizer there was still something very impressive about the gargantuan and silent machinery and its presence in this lost corner of a vast continent was evidence of a nineteenthcentury determination to conquer the world and all its resources gingerly fearfully i crept down the ramshackle stairs i became more confident when i saw that the old wooden treads were supported by castiron moldings but it was still with a sense of relief that i reached the machinehall floor and could walk among the huge silent engines that were now useless rust in their day they had been engineering marvels massively powerful machines that still bore the proud castiron plaques that boasted of the towns where they had been forged essen dortmund and bochum above the great machines were the giant spindles which had once held the slapping leather belts that had carried power from a bank of huge steam engines built on the pits lip those old steam engines were still there though they had clearly been the first of the machines to fall silent their power supplanted by the row of squat diesel generators that looked as if they had come from some first world war battleship the huge room was like a museum of industrial ingenuity a great rusting museum when i kicked a rusting bolt with my right boot the sound echoed forlornly in the huge dank space how very clever you are to find us mr blackburn the voice said when the bolts last echo died away oh my god jesus christ i blasphemed twisted down and huddled into a rustflaked corner of a machine where i unslung the rifle from my shoulder my heart was thumping like a runaway jackhammer i could not see the speaker and the echoes of the great room made it hard to tell from where he had spoken but i recognized the voice it was caspar von rellsteb von rellsteb i shouted of course who else did you expect to find here santa claus perhaps he paused and though i looked frantically around i still could not see him von rellsteb as if comprehending my panic laughed or perhaps you expected to find nicole and the pirated genesis boats hidden here is that what berenice told you she has spun that yarn before last year she hitched a ride on a visiting australian yacht and told a wonderful tale of enslavement and of a worldwide aids epidemic and of pirated boats that we hid at the very end of the desolate straits such an imagination for a little american girl eh von rellsteb laughed again her imagination brought the chilean police here and we had two or three weeks of unnecessary trouble before they realized the poor girl was simply unstable we offered to fly her home to her mother but at the last moment she chose to come back to us i sometimes regret she made that choice but we think of all our communitys members as family and as in every family love cannot help but take the good with the bad isnt that so mr blackburn i worked a round into the leeenfields chamber the rifles bolt made a very loud noise that echoed menacingly in the tall dripping windchilled chamber i heard von rellstebs footsteps grate somewhere close by but the acoustics of the shed made it almost impossible to detect just where he was he sighed your caution is misplaced mr blackburn do come out im entirely alone and i have no weapons but i need to apologize to you my people were stupid to have fired on you when you visited the settlement two days ago it was purely a reaction of fear and nervousness our little community lives a most sheltered life here and any incursion from the outside world tends to unsettle us i slipped off the rifles safety catch was von rellstebs voice coming from the right i peered that way and saw nothing did you hear me mr blackburn i apologize most profoundly and am only glad that no one got hurt at the settlement were reevaluating our policy on guns so i hope it will never happen again please do come out please i straightened up then edged very cautiously round the ponderous rockcrushing machine that had sheltered me i still could not see von rellsteb i thought how furious david would be for i had done everything i had promised him i would not do and everything that he had warned me against which meant that all our careful planning had been shot to hell good morning the voice said behind me and i whipped the rifle round to see von rellsteb standing just thirty feet away he smiled then spread his empty hands to show that he was indeed unarmed good morning he said again and with an intonation that chided me for not responding to his first friendly greeting i still did not respond but just watched him he was wearing red and black oilskins sea boots and a black woolen hat into which he had crammed his long gray hair he seemed amused by my wary scrutiny if i was going to kill you he said i would already have done so please put your gun down i fear that berenice has filled your head with the most nonsensical fancies no doubt she told you that nicole might be found here is that right i said nothing i was again struck by the intelligence in his face and i had the weirdest and most uncomfortable impression that he was reading my thoughts youve come to see nicole of course he went on as though my silence was an agreeable response to his remarks and i know shes delighted that youre here it was the greatest pity that she wasnt at the settlement when you visited two days ago but shes waiting there now you lying bastard i blurted out oh mr blackburn a look of injured sadness crossed von rellstebs sensitive face what has berenice told you that nicole and i have arguments that nicole has taken refuge here while the rest of us live at the settlement what nonsense nicole very nearly wrote to you after she received the letter you gave me in florida but in the end she decided that our policy of separation should be preserved but when she heard you were here she was excited so excited and she still is in fact shes waiting at the settlement right now von rellsteb looked at his wristwatch if we hurry we might reach the farm by midafternoon and we can have tea with her nicole is very fond of her afternoon tea its a rather english trait and one that the rest of us often tease her about i aimed the rifle at his long thin face say a prayer you smug bastard would you rather i brought nicole here i will of course if you insist his germanaccented voice implied i was being unreasonably difficult and his selfpossession and charm were beginning to make me doubt my own reason fetching nicole will take time he went on calmly as though i was not threatening him with a rifle and frankly i cant do it in much under five or six hours he paused to let me admit the force of his objections but i said nothing which prompted von rellsteb to offer me a disappointed smile youre lucky shes here at all he went on because she was planning to spend some days on the lower islands to conduct some seismic studies for the government thats a great nuisance when we first came here we were welcomed by the chilean authoritieshe laughed confidingly as though he was about to make a private jest that only he and i might understandor rather by the old general el presidente pinochet he liked all things german you see so i was definitely flavor of the month von rellsteb enlarged his explanation by clicking his heels together and putting a forefinger like a moustache on his upper lip he chuckled now we must make ourselves welcome in more useful ways and the ministry of the interior believes there may be silver deposits in the archipelago and they asked us to make the survey so naturally were complying but to be really honest with you mr blackburn im not sure we want to find any mineral deposits because exploiting the discoveries is certain to threaten the ecology of the islands so i rather think that nicole is falsifying the returns he chuckled a small deception but one that is surely justified by the scenery of these islands its magnificent scenery isnt it does the chilean government supply you with the necessary explosives for seismic tests i asked i had hoped the mention of explosives might unsettle von rellsteb but he seemed entirely unfazed by my suspicions the ministry of mines issues us with the necessary operating permits of course but in fact we fetch our dynamite from commercial suppliers in valparaíso he looked at his watch again im enjoying talking to you but if im to fetch nicole i really should leave radio the settlement i said i was staring at him through the open ring battle sight of the rifle alashe smiledi came here in a sea kayak and didnt think to bring a radio ive got one i said splendid but i fear it wont transmit from this rock pit von rellsteb gestured about the high walls of the machine hall which would indeed block any transmission but if you want to climb the outside stairs to the roof you can talk to the settlement they monitor channel the reception is sometimes a bit erratic but if you persevere you should succeed please he took a pace backward and courteously invited me to walk to the staircase i did not move von rellsteb smiled and still held his hand toward the stairs nicole might very well answer herselfhe enticed meshe often takes a radio watch about this time of day i still did not move nor did i lower the rifle though in all honesty von rellsteb had completely unsettled me he had thrown all my accusations and suspicions out of gear had berenice fed david and me with fantasy it seemed impossible that von rellsteb meant me harm for he was facing me unarmed and he seemed utterly unworried by the threat of my gun and still he smiled at me so that i was beginning to feel mesmerized by the piercing blue eyes in his kindly face everything he said was so plausible and i felt my defenses against him weakening please he said again and gestured to the staircase then as though an idea had suddenly struck him he tapped his hands lightly together but this is ridiculous your boat must be moored nearby so why dont you just sail to the settlement its ten miles up the straits thats all this old mine is such a very uncomfortable place for a family reunion my boat isnt in the straits i said my left forearm bracing the barrel of the leeenfield was beginning to ache von rellsteb stared at me with a disbelief that slowly turned into genuine admiration are you moored in the almagro channel he waited a second and when i gave no answer he shook his head no you cant be its never been done i still said nothing my lips felt dry despite the rain which whirled about the great rusting machines under the broken roof von rellsteb shook his head in astonishment did you sail up the fjord is that what you did i dont believe it can be done he gave me a very suspicious look you cant have dared the fjord ive never risked it nor has nicole for that matter and there isnt much she wont dare in a boat there cant be more than five feet of water in the entrance to the almagro channel theres over fifty feet i said scornfully and thus i betrayed stormchilds whereabouts to my enemy thank you mr blackburn von rellsteb smiled then abruptly stepped into the shelter of the closest crushing machine as he shouted to his hidden troops hes in the almagro channel johnny come with me lisl hes got a rifle so be careful von rellsteb was still shouting instructions as he ran away but he switched into german and it took me a few seconds to make the linguistic transition i thought he told lisl to finish me off then to meet him at the farmhouse i had pursued von rellsteb to the corner of the rockcrushing machine intending to cut him down but suddenly the whole high shed echoed with the terrifying sound of automatic gunfire and i saw flecks of brilliant metal appear on the rusting flank of the machine beside my head it took me a full astonished second to realize that the bright flecks were the strikes of bullets and that the stinging on my cheek was caused by flakes of rusting metal struck off the machine then i desperately threw myself sideways onto the wet floor scrabbling in panic for the shelter of the neighboring engine while all around me the air rang with the ricochet of bullets the stuttering crash of the gun and the shout of laughter from the stairway above me i had a glimpse of a gunman firing at me the muzzle flames making a pale bright aureole around the guns muzzle then i saw it was not a gunman at all but a redhaired girl with a long fierce face she had to be lisl who i remembered berenice had said was caspars lover i tried to bring my rifle to bear on her but she saw the movement and whipped her fire toward me i wriggled desperately into cover a second gunman opened fire from my right but his bullets went high and he stopped firing almost immediately the clangor of the bullets striking the old machinery was much louder than the firing of the guns i heard people shouting i thought i identified three voices one belonged to lisl while the other two were mens voices somewhere in the huge machine hall a door slammed hollowly then i heard the scrape of a huge bolt from what von rellsteb had shouted i gathered he must be going to the fjord where with one of his gunmen he would lead the attack on stormchild i had to get out which meant that i had to know where my enemies were so i could get past them i knew lisl was above me on the rickety staircase she had stopped firing presumably to reload at least one of the other gunmen was to my right and the third voice had also seemed to come from that direction so i should go left toward the landward end of the crushing shed where the raw limestone had been fed into the huge hoppers except my small glimpse of the great machinery room had suggested that the only escape route from the crushing shed was at its eastern end where the huge ramp angled down toward the sea so i had to go to my right i knew i could not stay where i was because my enemies knew where i was hiding and it could only be moments before they surrounded me so run yet somehow my tired legs would not move i was terrified and angry at myself for being gulled by von rellsteb the bastard had lied so smoothly and i had not been able to resist his flattery boasting of my achievement i had betrayed stormchilds whereabouts so to save david i should run i knew i had to run i heard a footfall way off to my right then outside the shed the sudden roar of motorbike engines i had forgotten about the scrambling bikes and i cursed myself for thus forgetting because until now i had stood a chance admittedly very remote of escaping this place and reaching stormchild before my enemies but that chance had evaporated with the sound of the bikes as they roared off i had to forget stormchild for the moment my task was to escape this trap and of all the traps components i most feared lisl in her aerie because to her i was like a mouse under the eye of a hovering falcon i peered up through a spoke of the nearest machines huge driving wheel and saw her as a brighthaired shadow in the upper doorway i raised my rifle but she saw the movement and opened fire i flung myself to the left astonished that there was any strength remaining in my legs then cannoned off the machine to go in the opposite direction i ran across the open passage lisl was following my abrupt motions with her guns barrel hosing bullets across the vast room but she was too slow and i was safe under cover again i crouched short of breath terrified watching the eastern end of the shed where a flood of rainy light showed where the loading ramp spilled its way out of this death trap then i saw a man run across that patch of light and i pulled the trigger much too late and heard my bullet ricochet off metal to crack against a ceiling girder i ran again and once again lisl saw me a second too late bullets flicked and shrieked and sang and banged through the shed i sheltered beside a different kind of machine one that had a crawlspace beneath it the dank space was no more than a foot high but it offered me a chance lisl would be watching for me in one place but the crawl space would let me appear in another the crawl space was filthy with rustcolored puddles i hung my bag with its few precious implements about my neck took a breath then wriggled my way under the giant machine the first few feet were easy enough though i could feel the stinking water soaking through my trousers but once i was deep under the great mechanism some bolts on its underside snagged on the rope that i still had wrapped about my torso i dared not use great force to tear myself free for any noise might betray my predicament instead i slowly edged backward and forward freeing myself of the obstruction inch by cold inch i heard voices echoing the slap of feet again but my enemies preferred to stalk me rather than rush me presumably for fear of my rifle lisl worried by my silence or perhaps just trying to flush me out of hiding fired some shots that rang like bells as they smacked into the iron frame of the machine above me when she stopped firing i could hear the spent bullets rattle down into the mechanisms rusting bowels i paused watching the passage into which i would emerge i could see no one there i twisted my body till it was sideways onto the passage rolled out scrambled to my feet and ran in panicked desperation toward the ramp it took my enemies a second or two to see me and another two or three seconds to react then lisl opened fire and her bullets flicked and smacked and whined about me i knew i did not have time to hurl myself over the ramps lip so instead i dived into the shelter of a stone wall that hid me from her deadly perch where is he one of the men demanded last hopper this side lisl shouted then her germanaccented voice was abruptly filled with panic i said this side this side her panic was justified for the man had mistaken her instructions and now stepped into view just paces from me he was facing a hopper on the halls far side and had his back to me but lisls panicked voice whipped him round and his eyes widened with terror as he saw me he was a broadshouldered man with a huge and springy beard of tangled brown hair that blossomed wildly across his broad chest i felt a sudden wild hope that the bearded man would have the sense to leap back into hiding thus saving me the need to shoot him but instead he raised his hands and i saw he was carrying a submachine gun i was swinging the rifle toward him i had never shot at anyone in all my life but he was beginning to flinch as though he feared the noise his own gun would make and i knew that i had about one second to live if i did not squeeze my trigger first so i squeezed my trigger he fired too my shot missed so did his the man was screaming as he fired not because he was hurt but to disguise his fear he had fired too soon and his bullets went to my left and kept going away from me as the recoil of the small gun pounded him around i worked the leeenfields bolt and heard my ejected cartridge tinkle as it clattered across the stone floor i raised the rifle taking better aim then before the bearded man had managed to control the swing of his guns shuddering recoil and he was forcing the barrel back toward me the world was reduced to noise just noise a splintering thunder of cartridges and of metal striking stone and i was probably shouting as loudly as my enemy then i fired again and the man just leapt backward as though he had been yanked off his feet by a hidden steel cable and then there was a sudden silence rainwater dripped on the floor the wind fretted and creaked at a sheet of corrugated iron the man i had shot took a breath that sounded like the workings of an ancient bellows i worked the rifles bolt i had fired three bullets or was it four i knew i should count the magazine down so as not to be trapped without ammunition i was sure it was three my breath was coming in panicked gulps i could see the bearded mans legs protruding from behind a wooden hooper he was wearing a green jerkin brown corduroy trousers and old climbing boots with worn vibram soles one of his legs was jerking spasmodically his breathing sounded awful like bubbles and scraping gravel and unimaginable pain i thought i was going to be sick i had a sudden vivid memory of the mans blood pulsing bright in the air as he jerked backward chris is hit lisls voice was shocked where is he another voice shouted the man called chris suddenly screamed it was a terrible scream i moved i ran out from the wall i turned and looked up lisl was leaning over the balustrade i brought the rifle up and stared at her through the open battle sight she was turning her gun toward me then seeing me and fearing my shot she leaped backward like a scalded cat i turned and ran the few steps to the great ramp that sloped down to the pier and the sea wooden steps ran down beside a huge metallined chute that had once carried the crushed lime to the waiting ships and now i hurled myself onto its metal lining and slid down as though it was a giant slide in a childrens playground except that this slide was rusted and bolts snagged me and i part rolled and part slid and sometimes scrambled my way down to the bottom i heard something break in the bag of supplies that i still carried about my neck the man called chris still screamed behind me the sound of his agony faded as i escaped or almost escaped for a sudden whine and whipcrack told me that i was being fired at the sound of the gun echoed down the ramps tunnel the bullets missed then bruised and bleeding i spilled over the ramps end onto the flagstoned surface of the old quay i looked up one side of the chute to see another bearded man running down the steps with a gun in his hand i aimed fired and missed the man suddenly realized how vulnerable he was and turned i fired again but the range was long i was firing uphill into shadows and the man was running fast i fired a third time missed yet again and saw the man make an ungainly leap off the stairs and into cover i ran down the quay the rain bounced to make a fine spray on the flagstones beneath me on a small shingle beach where they were concealed from the sea by a ridge of rocks were four sea kayaks two of the slender craft were singleseaters while the others had two small cockpits apiece six paddles lay alongside the kayaks i jumped down painfully turning an ankle as i landed the slender craft were made of fiberglass i walked past their sharp prows firing into their bellies a bullet apiece was enough to make sure that the kayaks could not be used in a hurry but i had to change magazines to finish the job and the delay betrayed my whereabouts to my enemies suddenly their bullets began whipping at the quays edge above me chipping scraps of stone that dropped around me i slung the kayaks six paddles far out into the water where with any luck they would float away six paddles for six canoeists if i had understood von rellstebs parting instructions then he had taken one other person to help capture stormchild which left four at the mine one of whom was screaming with a bullet in his guts was nicole here no i could not believe my daughter would conspire for my death though now still shivering from the gunfight i did not really understand anything except that i had sailed ten thousand miles to discover nightmare another bullet flicked overhead i wondered if one gunman was trying to trap me on the small beach while the others came down the ramp to finish me off i looked to my right and saw that i could stay in the shelter of the stone quay all the way to a jumble of dark rocks which lay at the base of a broken and torn cliff the rocks extended far along the shore and i guessed that once i was in their cover i would be safe i limped to their shelter it was low tide and the stones were slippery with rain and weed but i found a deep cleft that offered me complete protection from any gunmen in the buildings and deep in the clefts protective shadow i paused to catch my breath and to plan my next move i was sobbing not with pain but with a kind of selfdisgust then i forgot my misery for far above me and muffled by distance and half drowned by the rush of wind and rain there was a sudden shot the screaming of the man called chris abruptly ended oh my god i murmured in prayer i had caused a mans death i had not meant it to be like this mingled sweat and rain were running down my face i refilled the leeenfields empty magazine my fingers were cold and clumsy or perhaps they were shaking because i had killed a man i was shivering they would be coming for me these people were ruthless christ they took no prisoners and left no wounded not even their own i knew i must do something i had to think von rellsteb had been waiting for me expecting me that was the premise from which to start i had to work out what they wanted and therefore what they might do and only then could i decide what i should do except that whenever i tried to think logically the panic and adrenaline distracted and unnerved me making me so jumpy that i twisted and almost fired when a kelp goose paddled into view at the seaward end of my hiding place i tried to relax but i was shivering uncontrollably they had been waiting for me they knew i would come to the mine and not to the settlement why they had known i would come to the mine but they had not foreseen everything they had expected stormchild to sail up the desolate straits presumably passing the settlement in the darkness and they had taken care to have their kayaks hidden so that on stormchilds arrival we would have assumed that the limestone workings were abandoned and once we had gone ashore they would have attacked us because they wanted us silenced and doubtless because they wanted our boat that was obvious they wanted stormchild they wanted stormchild yet von rellstebs plans to capture her had gone awry when i chose to use the almagro channel but once my presence in the limestone workings had been detected von rellsteb had quickly regrouped his forces and had then dealt brilliantly with me which meant that by now unless david had put up a stout fight or had already taken her to sea stormchild was probably captured david and berenice likely dead but i could not think about those possible disasters not while a different disaster still threatened to overwhelm me i was still not thinking straight i was shaking and cold and blaming myself i had been so certain the genesis boats would sail north to pursue stormchild but von rellsteb had known i would come for my daughter i had done everything he had expected me to do except for one thing he had expected me to die and i was alive now it was time to defy von rellsteb it was time god help me to fight for david for myself and for nicole it took me about ten minutes to realize that i had trapped myself between a shedevil and a cold flooding sea i had thought myself entirely safe in the cleft which hid me from every landward vantage point but i had forgotten the tide the straits agitated by a strengthening wind were rising fast and the icy flooding water would very soon force me out of my hiding place and into the waiting sights of lisl and her gunmen i knew they would be watching for me they must have realized i was hidden somewhere in the bleak tangle of rocks on the foreshore and that if i did not break cover soon i would drown or else die of hypothermia in the rising waters the wind suddenly seemed bitterly cold it was blowing ever more strongly gusting close to gale force as it flecked the water behind me white the deterioration of the weather gave me hope that david would have decided to take stormchild out through the fjords gut into the wide safe ocean and would already be beating his way offshore and waiting for my radio signal the thought of the radio made me remember how something had broken during my panicked and bruising descent of the old lime chute i opened the bag and fished out the small handheld radio which to my relief proved to be intact it had been the righthand barrel of my binoculars that had broken i shook the scraps of broken lens and the useless prism out of the barrel and pushed the now halfuseful glasses back into the bag then in desperate hope i switched on the radio and tuned it to channel stormchild stormchild this is tim do you read me over i released the transmitter button and heard nothing but an empty hiss from the speaker a small red light glowed to show me that the radios battery was still strong but rather than waste its electricity in vain i switched the set off i was shadowed by the cliffs and high hills so only some freak meteorological condition might have bounced my signal to wherever stormchild was if indeed stormchild still floated or was in friendly hands that knew which channel to monitor i put the radio in the bag then ate my last piece of hoarded fruitcake which i washed down with the dregs of the cold tea the incoming tide was surging up to my feet and i knew i must move very soon i peered over the rocks to stare at the limestone workings i saw no movement there but that did not mean my enemies were not scanning the shrinking shoreline for a sign of me i ducked down again slung the bag and rifle on my shoulder then crawled under the cover of the seaweedstinking rocks to the base of the cliff i had decided that lisl and her companions would expect me to break cover along the shore scrambling over the slippery rocks to put more distance between myself and their guns but i had seen another route out of my predicament and that route lay directly upward in my younger days i had been a halfway decent rock climber i had never approached the finest standards but i had been good when we were schoolboys david and i had often hitchhiked on holiday weekends to the lake district or snowdonia and equipped with a secondhand rope and some scavenged pitons we would tackle some dangerously severe climbs i had been the daring one indeed one word of caution from david had usually been sufficient to send me up some dizzyingly fearful crag while he cringed below later on an army climbing expedition to the dolomites i had suffered a crippling bout of vertigo that had persuaded me to abandon rocks in favor of seawater these days not all the tea in china could have persuaded me onto some of the frightful rock faces i had so blithely climbed as a youth yet the cliff above the rocky shoreline offered me the only sheltered and unguarded route out of my flooding hideout so it was time to swallow my fears and start upward the cliff even though it was running with rainwater was not a difficult climb but its broken stone made me nervous and my stomach churned sourly as i moved steadily up it was not the holds that unnerved me they were firm and wide but every time i looked down i saw the sea foaming white in the fissures of the rocks and each such pulsing surge opened the pit in my belly like a greased trapdoor i forced myself to ignore the seething sea and the clutching wind and just to keep climbing steadily i edged northward as i went going still further from the gunmen aiming to reach the hill above the quarry from there i would find a safe place in which to plan my next moves a good soldier when in doubt always goes for the high ground but that maxim was also appreciated by my enemies and they had an easier route than i to that high ground my first intimation that they were not looking for me from the buildings but had reached the cliff top before me was when some stones and turf clattered down the rock face to my left i froze i could hear the voices of a man and a woman above me and i supposed that lisl and one of the genesis gunmen were patroling the cliffs edge in search of me and judging by the loudness of the two voices i had only a few moments before they found me to my right i could just see the smaller quarry that i had first glimpsed from the high ridge above the main workings this smaller excavation was about a hundred feet deep and half as wide across the smallness of the quarry suggested that it was the place where the first von rellsteb to colonize this coast had begun his search for limestone which beginnings he had later abandoned for the more promising deposits to the south whatever the remains of his first diggings provided me with almost perfect cover and trying hard not to make any noise i edged my way toward it i was aiming for a ledge which ran round the quarrys face like a balcony the ledge was wide enough to have trapped soil washed from the hill above and a thick canopy of scrub stunted beech trees wild fuchsia and giant ferns offered me a perfect hiding place i glanced up saw nothing of my pursuers and risked a swift scramble across the soaking rock face but the risk proved too great a shout from above betrayed that i had been seen i heard lisls voice call out in triumph then a bullet hissed and cracked through the rain not far from my right ear i swore in panic then scrambled over the ledges lip and wriggled deep into the base of the soaking bushes where i burrowed like a desperate animal into the heart of the undergrowth a nesting bird squawked away in panicked wing beats i thrust myself into the wet leaves trying to flatten myself against the cliff face in the hope that i was somehow rendering myself invisible i may have been hidden but my enemies knew they had me trapped they could shoot me whenever i broke cover they began firing down at the ledges thick foliage in an attempt to flush me into the open i was temporarily safe from their efforts because a slight outcrop of the rock above offered me protection but that same rock bulge also prevented me from firing back at my enemies i shivered the gunfire snapped angrily its sound diminished by the rising wind the bullets flicked the leaves and cracked into stone ricochets whined down to the base of the quarry which except for a small rainflecked pool was as thickly overgrown with scrub as the ledge on which i had trapped myself i seemed to have a talent for being on low ground with an enemy above me but i had escaped before and i would have to escape again the trick of this escape i decided was to persuade lisl and her companion that they had killed me i had been sitting with my knees drawn tight against my body so that no part of me showed under the overhang i stayed in that cramped position but slowly very slowly and very awkwardly i unlooped the nylon rope from my torso near me was the relatively thick trunk of a stunted beech tree about which i threaded the fortyfoot length of line with a small silent prayer that the beech roots had enough grip in the ledges damp and friable soil to hold my weight i then wrapped the two ends of the line round my waist fastened them in place with bowlines and concealed the knots beneath my jacket what i planned depended on my enemies not knowing that i had fashioned this lifesaving tether then with the knotted rope hidden at my waist i slithered toward the lip of the small quarry once over that lip i would be hidden from the view of anyone at the top of the cliff the greatest immediate danger was that my enemies would see the movement of the leaves and bushes as i pushed through them but the wind was heaving the branches and i moved with exquisite care the rain sheeted down blinding me and i hoped my enemies too as i wriggled i shoved the telltale double strand of palecolored rope under leaves and bushes to further conceal it when i reached the lip of the ledge i peered over to discover that the artificially made rock face was an almost sheer drop of forty feet though i could just see a jagged sloping ledge some eight feet below the lip that ledge would have to be enough for my survival i closed my eyes for a few seconds i was praying unlike my brother i did not often pray because i believed gods usefulness like that of any other piece of emergency equipment decreased according to how often he was used this moment poised above the cliff face was one of those rare occasions when i needed divine aid so i uttered a fervent prayer that god would hold me in his precious hand for the next few terrifying seconds then slowly i raised my face until i could see the heads of my enemies the two of them seemed to be lying fulllength at the lip of the cliff to peer down into the quarry lisl was recognizable from her bright red hair while her companion had a shaggy black beard and tied around his forehead a bright yellow headband the two were some sixty feet above me and perhaps fifty feet to my right i lifted the rifle then began to stand upright i was on the very edge of the quarry its lip and sheer drop just an inch behind my boots as i stood i twisted my upper body to the right so that i could aim at the blackbearded man i stood fully upright the two had still not seen me the thick wet ferns reached up to my waist hiding the twin strands of line that hung beneath my jacket the two heads were outlined against a dark gray sky in which the rain slashed silver o god of sailormen i prayed be with me now and then i fired a chunk of rock spat off the cliffs rim just a few inches from the mans unkempt beard he gasped and jerked back i worked the bolt fired again worked the bolt and fired a third time i was no longer aiming just snapping shots wildly at the place where the two heads had flinched back then blessedly they both pushed the barrels of their assault rifles over the cliff and without exposing themselves to take aim blindly ripped off two full magazines of bullets in my general direction god was indeed keeping me safe for the unaimed bullets whipped far above my head the crack of the two genesis rifles was snatched into the wind and rain i waited till the last ejected cartridge had flickered bright in the days gloom then i screamed i screamed as though the devil had taken my soul in his bare claws and was tearing it from my guts i screamed in an awful agony and as i made that dreadful shriek into the sky and at the wind i watched the cliff top and sure enough the yellow headband suddenly appeared there then lisls face showed alongside the bearded face and i had already thrown my arms up in the air letting the rifle tumble and fall into the void behind me i followed it still screaming and anyone watching me must have thought that i had been hit by a bullet and was now falling backward spreadeagled off the rock face and into the deep quarry as i fell out of my enemies sight i scrabbled to get a grip on the doubled rope to soak up some of its impact and i also twisted around so that my belly and not my spine would take the force of the lines tightening the rope snaked above me and i had a sudden terror that the line must have come free from the stump i was certain i must have fallen more than the six feet i had bargained for but then abruptly and with a sickening shock the rope snapped taut being nylon the doubled line stretched but still the force was worse than a kick to the belly i had been screaming as i fell but the wrench of rope in my belly drove the wind clean out of me so that my tormented dying shriek was abruptly and very convincingly choked off in the sudden silence the rifle clattered and banged its way to the bottom of the quarry i struck the cliff swung hit the rock again then hung motionless i dangled like a dead thing hooked in the gut and strung up to be voided of blood except i was alive and i was hurting i felt as if the rope had ripped my stomach muscles clean out i wanted to be sick my vision had sheeted red and i was choking but i dared not make a sound or else my enemies would know i was alive and would climb down the cliff to kill me so i hung and i choked back the sobs as i tried to drag a desperate breath into my aching lungs i could hear nothing except the thumping of blood in my ears and a small slight whimpering noise that i suddenly knew was coming from my bilesour throat so i clamped my mouth shut then from above me the man in the yellow headband whooped in joyous triumph way to go did you see that oh shit that sucker just learned to fly fuckin a the sucker was trying to find a grip on the cliff face i had levered myself upright by pulling on the taut rope then i felt with the tips of my boots until i discovered the small ledge beneath me and by pushing up with my toes on that ledge i was able to take some of the weight off the rope that was threatening to cut me in two i managed to take in a deep and tentative breath the absence of any sharp pain in my chest persuaded me that at least no ribs were broken but i still feared i might have torn some muscles the pain was excruciating but i had to ignore it because i needed to get down to the floor of the small abandoned quarry before either lisl or the triumphant man thought to clamber down the upper cliff to search for my corpse i found a finger hold for my left hand then untied one of the bowlines i was unsupported now and a slip on the wet rock would finish what my enemies thought they had already accomplished i tried not to think of the void below as slowly and agonisingly i lowered myself until i could get a finger hold on the ledge with my right hand i looked for holds lower down but the rain and the hurt were blurring my vision and i dared not wait for my sight to clear trusting that the holds were there i pulled the long rope free it came reluctantly constantly snagging on some obstruction on the upper ledge and once it stuck so hard that i thought i might need to use my rigging knife to cut myself free but i gave the line one last hard smooth tug and it slithered loose i dared not pull too hard or fast for fear that the sudden movement in the ledges foliage would betray my continued existence nor did i dare leave the rope in place in case my enemies explored the ledge i could hear nothing from the cliff top the end of the rope at last fell over the rim of the quarry and collapsed on me i let the rope dangle from my waist as i edged downward with only my toes and fingers touching the wall the rock wall was sheeted with running water my fingers were numb blood was seeping from a cut on my left hand i looked down blinking my eyes to clear my vision and i could just see the stock of my fallen rifle showing at the edge of a bush if it had fallen another four feet to the right it would have plunged into the small pool the rest of the quarry floor was thickly covered with scrub and my immediate concern was to reach that shelter undiscovered a stone fell from above suggesting that one of my enemies was scrambling down the upper and easier cliff face to make certain i was dead i looked left and saw no quick route down to the quarry floor then i looked right and saw just four feet away a buttress of rock that resembled an oversized and crooked drainpipe clinging to the quarrys face i made a desperate lunge risking the emptiness below and somehow gripped the top of the buttress then half fell and half shimmied down to the base of the wall the pain was making me gasp i knew i was going too fast and that i risked making a terrible noise as i crashed into the shrubbery on the quarrys floor but when i tried to slow my descent i only ripped the skin off my right palm my boots juddered on the rock then branches whipped at me and gasping and whimpering i rolled off the rock onto a pile of stones that were covered by a thick umbrella of beech scrub i felt a horribly sharp blow on my left wrist and heard a distinct snapping noise at the same instant but i dared not move to investigate the damage instead i lay like a dead man i was winded and bruised but i was making neither noise nor movement i hurt all over i hurt so much that it was impossible to distinguish any particular pain in my left wrist and thus tell if it was broken i kept my eyes tightly closed as though to open them would reveal unwilling news about my injuries rain smashed into the leaves above me gurgled down stone gullies around me and hissed on the black pool behind me chunks of stone were cascading down the cliff evidently dislodged by my pursuers as they scrambled down to the ledge i was sure they would not risk the climb to the quarry floor they merely wanted some confirmation that i was indeed dead and even if they could not see me they would surely assume from the stillness and silence at the bottom of the pit that i had fallen to my death i waited the stones stopped bouncing and falling at last faint through the rain i heard lisls voice way above me is that his gun yeah silence again perhaps he fell in the pool lisl again the sucker couldnt fly and the sucker sure couldnt swim after that fall in fact if you think about it that sucker isnt much fucking good for anything anymore the bearded man laughed i counted a minute then another then a third i counted to twenty minutes and still i did not move nor did i hear any movement above me but i had to assume that my enemies might have the patience to outwait me i counted a further twenty minutes marking the seconds with a childish chant i had learned as a sea scout one coconut two coconut three coconut and so on up to sixty coconuts then back to the first coconut again and i remembered the damp hut where as a boy i had been taught bowlines and sheepshanks and the rudiments of seamanship and then i started counting off another coconutmarked minute of my life surely they had abandoned me for dead by now yet still i waited the rain was remorseless and i lay under its chill onslaught for a full hour before bruised and cramped and cold and wet and hurting i slowly rolled over and stared upward the skyline was empty i could hear an engine throbbing somewhere in the distance it was too deep a throb to be one of the motorbikes and too heavy a sound for the tractor i had seen and i wondered if the genesis community kept a generator in the old mine buildings i stood it took me a long time because i ached all over no one responded to the rustle of leaves and the clatter of stones dislodged by my boots as i struggled upright it seemed i was alone and for the moment at least safe i looked fearfully at my left wrist only to discover that it was my expensive wristwatch that had taken the full force of the blow and had been broken beyond repair i took it off and tossed it into the black pool my stomach was still a belt of agony the pain lessened if i bent double so crouching like quasimodo i forced my way through the undergrowth to retrieve the rifle it seemed undamaged but i dared not fire a shot to test it at the seaward side of the quarry was a smaller rock face no more than twenty feet high that formed the outer wall of the small excavation it was hard to climb and even harder because of the pain in my stomach muscles but i inched my way up and at last i hooked an elbow over the crest and could stare down into the desolate straits the engine i was hearing belonged to the fishing boat which had vainly pursued stormchild two days before and which now had steamed up the desolate straits and was berthed alongside the pier black smoke drizzled from her tall chimney the sea kayaks that i had holed with bullets were now piled on her deck outboard of the trawler was a catamaran while in the center of the waterway a stained and weathered sloop lay hoveto i fished out what was left of my binoculars and trained the single lens on the boats the sloop turned as i watched and with a burst of troubled water at her stern began motoring down the straits toward the far settlement i panned to the catamaran daring to hope it was nicoles boat but instead i saw that it was the old catamaran in which von rellsteb had come to my english river so long ago i recognized neither of the men on board who now cast off from the trawler and their engines going turned to follow the sloop the trawler alone was left lisl was standing on the pier by the fishing boats gangplank from where she stared toward the factory ramp down which i had tumbled it was evident that she was waiting for something or someone above her the gulls wheeled and screamed in the rain the desolate straits looked gray greasy and cold while the colors of the far hills which only two days before had seemed so bright and heavenly were now dulled by the rain into a dun drab i shivered i assumed that obedient to von rellstebs parting instructions the genesis crews were retreating to the settlement there they could rendezvous and assess what damage if any stormchilds visit had caused them if von rellsteb had captured my boat then that damage would have been minimal whereas if david was still free and threatening to carry berenices testimony to the authorities von rellsteb would urgently need to start his pursuit and i wondered if the departure of the two yachts was the commencement of that urgent pursuit it did indeed look as though every genesis boat and every genesis crew member was being committed to stormchilds chase for as far as i could tell they were leaving the mine workings unguarded that implied there was very little at the workings worth protecting but it also indicated that lisl believed me to be dead that misconception was my one small advantage over genesis i watched lisl stamp her feet against the cold then panning my broken glass right i saw what it was she waited for two men were struggling toward the fishing boat with the body of the gunman i had wounded and whom i suspected the genesis group had themselves finished off now one man held the corpse by the shoulders of its coat while the other grasped the dead mans ankles the cadavers bearded head hung backward so that its long hair brushed at the piers stones and its huge beard jutted pugnaciously toward the rain clouds lisl seemed to shudder and back away from the bodys passing the two men very nearly dropped the corpse into the water as they shuffled across the makeshift gangplank but at last they had the body safe aboard and lisl still keeping her distance from the dead cast off the trawlers mooring lines the engine smoke thickened as with an awful wheezing and clanking the decrepit vessel steamed away up the wide straits when the fishing boat disappeared i rolled over the lip of the quarry no one shot at me it seemed that no one had been left behind to guard the mine against my ghost i lay panting and pained on the thin turf then slowly when my stomach muscles uncramped i gathered my strength stood up and using the rifle like a crutch i limped toward the mine buildings where i still had a daughter to find it was in the low stone buildings which were built into the hillside at the back of the quay that i found the first signs of nicole the buildings were singlestoried and crouched against the spite of the sea wind like a row of cornish fishermens cottages the buildings were locked but not locked well enough and inside i discovered crude and uncomfortable living quarters some effort had been made to decorate the five bedrooms one boasted a livid mural showing a humpback whale venting beside an iceberg while a second was decorated with a painted effigy of an indian god its colors bright as the sun but mostly the rooms were as characterless and cheerless as an army barracks i wondered which of the beds nicole used though the barrenness of the small bedrooms suggested that they were used only when the severity of the weather drove nicoles crew out of their boat and into the shelter of the cottages stone walls there was a small kitchen equipped with a woodstove a cupboard which held nothing but packets of dehydrated stew and a battered enamel washing bowl in which a large evillooking spider lived there was also a wooden table six chairs and a wall that was covered with peeling paper or so i thought until i pushed back the kitchens shutters and saw that the peeling paper was in fact rows of curling photographs i had found nicole i felt the sudden catch and choke of incipient tears for there was my daughters face among the genesis crews nicole i whispered her name aloud like an incantation nicole nicole i even reached up a tentative finger and stroked one of the photographs suddenly it was all worth it the voyage the cold the pain and the fear for here she was my daughter and i had found her or rather i had found her face among the photographs which showed a variety of genesis activists in some of the pictures they were attacking fishnets with grapnels and cutting gear while in another a genesis group in an inflatable boat was taunting a french naval patrol vessel which had presumably been guarding frances nucleartesting site in the pacific the pictures were amateurish like fading holiday snapshots and somehow that suggested that the genesis ecoterrorists were a group of energetically carefree young people enjoying a most innocent and happy vacation whenever two people were photographed together they inevitably had their arms about each others necks and in almost every snapshot they seemed to be shouting goodnatured insults at the camera the pictures i saw were all of the same crew nicoles nicole herself appeared in a dozen of the photographs and in all but one of those she was either smiling or laughing one photograph had been taken while she took a bucket shower on her catamarans foredeck she had been naked and had clearly not known that she was being photographed for the next picture showed her indignant but goodhumored face as she attacked the photographer in a half dozen of the pictures she was shown with a thin flaxenhaired boy who had a blunt face that reminded me uncannily of my dead son the more i looked the more the boy in the pictures looked like dickie it was unsettling for there was something about the way in which nicole and the blond boy had been photographed together that suggested they were lovers i tried not to follow those insinuations instead i gazed for a long time at those pictures of my daughter and i wondered just what thoughts and dreams moved her in this new life none of the happy photographs revealed the answer to that question but there was a clue in the one unsmiling picture of nicole that picture had been taken in an inflatable boat which had been thrashing through a choppy sea beneath a threatening sky nicole sitting in the bows of the rubber boat had just turned to face the photographer and the camera had caught her face in a grim and taut expression that put me in mind of berenices timid description of my daughter as fierce i had a horrible feeling that the grim face was the real face a face that betrayed no forgiveness nor any love the picture worried me not two hours before in the wake of von rellstebs ambush i had been determined to take my revenge but now i felt an immense hopelessness because at last i knew just why i had sailed ten thousand miles the confusions dropped away i had not come to take revenge for joannas death though revenge would indeed be sweet nor had i come merely to find nicole but rather i had come for love i had come to see the remorse on my daughters face i had come to hear her speak my name i had come to hear her say that i had not sent her brother to his death i had come to wipe away her tears i had brought her my forgiveness and had never thought she might not want it i had come to hug and to be hugged to love and be loved i had come to fill the void in my life that had been left by a bomb in the english channel i had come for the worst of all sentimental and selfpitying reasons but now staring at my daughters snarling face i knew i had wasted my time standing there before the photographs i knew that the very best thing i could do was to creep away i did not want to know the truth any longer because the truth would be very hard and very hurtful it would be better to remember nicole as she was in the smiling photographs to remember her as a cheerful hardmuscled and tough activist who sailed the far seas to save dolphins and to raise the worlds consciousness by sacrificing her own comforts that no doubt was how she thought of herself and that was how i should think of her if i pursued her further and if i caught her then i might discover that she had become someone who believed she knew better than the world and who was therefore beyond the worlds rules and beyond its condemnation i might find that my daughter had become the tyrant of that one unsmiling photograph i took that picture down tore it into scraps and decided to abandon my hunt i would leave nicole to life as we must all in the end leave our children i smiled at nicoles happiness in the other photographs chose two of them as keepsakes and then i left i made a desultory exploration of the remaining buildings but by now i was merely indulging my curiosity and did not expect to find anything useful nor did i though in one room that was stacked with coiled ropes i found an empty cardboard box that was lined with plastic sheeting and which carried the label dynamite the sight of the box encouraged horrible thoughts so i closed the door of that room and tried to forget what i had seen in the next room i found a pile of rusted anchor chain while in a cupboard there was an ancient woodenhandled whaling harpoon with a corroded but still wickedlooking barbed head these were the old nineteenthcentury storerooms in the same room as the harpoon was a barrel of nails that had rusted into a solid mass and boxes of hambro line that fell to pieces the moment it was touched in yet another room was a cache of empty liquor bottles which had faded labels of longforgotten brands of whiskey rum and aquavit ancient solaces against the awfulness of a job at the earths end the final rooms closest to the old boat lift were unused and held nothing but broken barrels the bones of a rabbit gull feathers and hopelessness i left the quay crossed the twin rails of the boat lift and climbed the hill to the mine buildings where von rellsteb had ambushed me the buildings were empty now i lifted the tarpaulin off the tractors engine only to discover that the ancient cylinder block was a mass of rust there was nothing more to find or nothing more that i cared to find and so in the teeth of a rising wind i left the mine and with the rifle slung on my shoulder i climbed beside the quarrys northern rim a small blackfeathered and badtempered bird of prey screamed at me from a nesting ledge as i began to slog my way up the sodden hillside once or twice i looked behind me but the desolate straits stayed empty the genesis crews either were in pursuit of stormchild or were celebrating her capture and i was alone in a wilderness doomed to a long cold soaking walk in the dying light and then to a freezing night i had stuffed my bag with some packets of the dehydrated stews i had found in nicoles kitchen but without a stove the result would be about as appetizing as pigswill i looked behind again and saw that the gray water of the straits even though sheltered on all sides by high hills and wooded bluffs was being whipped into whitecaps by the wind while the rain which had now fallen all day stung my face with a new and even colder spite i felt empty and drained my quest was over and i was tired and hungry i had also chosen the wrong route home for this northern flank of the quarry was much harder going than the southern flank down which i had approached the buildings the northern slope was striated with rock ledges broken by small ravines and made treacherous by slides of scree that forced me to make wide and wearying detours near the top of the slope was the largest and steepest field of scree i had yet encountered and one which forced me to make a long detour to my right ahead of me now was the jumble of rocks that i slowly recognized as the distinctive peak which only that morning had so strongly reminded me of dartmoors granite tors i was now so tired that i began to hallucinate that i was back on that devon moor and that if i could just keep walking i would soon come to the hikers inn at postbridge where a huge fire would be blazing in the hearth and where i could buy a pint of beer and a deep dish of steak and kidney pie it was only when i stumbled on a burrow or when the torn muscles of my belly gave a foul twinge that the comforting hallucination snapped away and i knew i was alone wet and hungry on a patagonian island the torlike stones barred my path westward i rested for a time at their base sitting with my back against the rocks and staring at the desolate straits which were now so far beneath me that low clouds wispy and gray broke my view of the windfretted water at last fighting the temptation to remain in the small shelter of the high rock wall i tried to go around it but a steep slope of scree fell away to the north just as it did to the south so moving like a somnambulant creature in a nightmare i clambered slowly up to where the wind and the rain shrieked their cacophony across the tors summit the climb was simple yet as my head poked over the crest the force of the wind almost stole my breath away i dragged myself over the edge banging the rifles butt on the rock as i clumsily moved and then i went utterly still for a second i thought i was dreaming then for another second i hoped i was dreaming then i retched emptily a body lay in a cup of the rock for a few seconds for a few whirling seconds of madness i thought the body was nicoles then i saw that this woman had hair as black as the feathers of the bird of prey that had screamed at me on the lower slope it was that black hair which was long and gleaming from the rain that told me this corpse was that of a woman because her flesh had been stripped by scavenging birds and animals the carrion eaters had left some sinews between the yellowing joints but otherwise she was nothing more than discolored bones in a bleak place she had been flensed i fell to my knees my sore belly heaved with a last lunge of sour vomit i wanted to weep but instead i shuffled forward and made myself examine the skeleton there was a ring on one bone finger i did not touch it there was also a necklace which i similarly left alone the womans clothes had either been torn by carrion eaters or else had decayed in the weather for her sweater and jeans were now nothing but faded and threadbare scraps that clung to her yellow bones the only undecayed object in that high place was a common sack that was still hooked into the bony grip of her dead skeletal hands one of her leg bones was broken suggesting she had been unable to reach the shelter of the mine and instead had died of exposure in this high bleak place i pulled the sack out of her dead grip making her bones rattle as the frail cloth came free the first thing i found inside the sack was a blue australian passport in which was written the dead womans name maureen delaney and her age twentythree the passport photograph showed a round girlish face that smiled at the world with an astonished happiness there was a stub of pencil in the sack but no sheet of paper or notebook so i leafed through the passport until i found some faint penciled letters on a blank page that told me how wrong i was this girl had not died trying to reach the mine but escaping from it she had crawled up here and died because such a fate was better than staying in the mine maureen delaney had been murdered the blank page in the passport was headed naiad and under that boats name was a brief and pathetic message they killed john and mark there were four of them two germans an american and an english girl they let others rape me and rape me the words were illwritten and very eloquent as eloquent as any voice that speaks from the grave it is november maureen delaneys message continued they say theyll kill me the girls wont help me i turned the passports stiff page to find some words addressed to her mother i closed my eyes as though i could stop the tears i tried to persuade myself that there might be another english girl in the genesis community or that this australian girls dying testimony was mere imagination but i had deceived myself for long enough and there could be no more deception maureen delaneys companions had been murdered and she had been driven to this cold lonely death which was as bad as murder and my daughter had been a participant for what for a boat i assumed for possession of naiad because like all terrorists my daughter believed that the foulest means were sanctified by the nobility of the cause i turned back the passports pages until maureen delaneys smiling suntanned face again stared into mine she looked i thought enthusiastic like someone who had taken life with both hands as a gift she must have been an adventurous girl independent and tough for she had sailed far seas keeping the winds tune and knowing the seas measure but then she had been raped and killed with my daughters compliance i imagined the australian girl begging for help and nicoles cold face turning away and that thought made me want to put the leeenfields cold muzzle in my mouth and blow my brains out but instead i put the murdered girls passport into my pocket it would have to go to the australian embassy i emptied the last contents of the sack and found the useless remains of a box of matches and then evidence that maureen delaney had planned to take revenge on her tormentors at the bottom of the sack were six sticks of dynamite each one wrapped in a sheet of old pinkish greasy paper that bore the trademark nobel maureen delaney had never found her revenge instead after escaping from the buildings by the quay where presumably she had stolen the sticks of explosive she had fallen and died in this high place i said a prayer for her it was inadequate but my memorial for maureen delaney would be more substantial than prayer to which end i put the six sticks of dynamite into my bag in the cottages standing in the kitchen where nicoles photographs decorated the wall i had persuaded myself that it would be best if i sailed away from the isle of torments i had persuaded myself that i did not need to know what nicole had become i had hoped that stormchild would still be free and that i could have sailed away in her and never looked back but i could no longer do that i had found nicole and what i had found was evil david would doubtless say i should give that evidence to the authorities and let the blackuniformed men of the chilean armada scour out this nest of killers but one of the killers was my daughter and a dead australian girl had given me six sticks of dynamite so i changed my mind again i would not after all walk away in the solace of ignorance instead as best as i could i would be a good environmentalist i would clean up the mess i crossed the marshland in the dusk it still rained and in places that rain had puddled into the tire tracks left by the two crosscountry motorbikes i followed the tracks as far as the crest above the fjord there the thickly ribbed tire marks slewed abruptly northward almost as though von rellsteb and his companion had reached this high vantage place and stared down to see that their hunt was over i too gazed down the long damp slope to see that stormchild was gone lake joanna lay empty while the land on either bank of the fjord stretched away in broken and deserted folds toward the ocean i slid down the hill to the tree line then charged recklessly through the undergrowth not caring what noise i made no one waited in ambush at the hills foot i had half expected to find two discarded crosscountry motorbikes but there was only the empty grayblack water that was being stirred into restlessness by the wind and pelting rain i looked round the rainsoaked beach until i found the pale platelike rock under which david had agreed to leave me a message if stormchild had been captured then i knew there would be no such message and thus i lifted the stone with a sense of doom which evaporated into instant relief when i saw the piece of white card that david had protectively wrapped in a clear plastic bag the existence of the message meant that stormchild was safe because david clearly scared of the deteriorating weather had taken her back to sea hours my brothers message was written with ink in block capitals and began with a typical punctiliousness the glass is still falling alarmingly so i propose to take advantage of the ebbing tide and take stormchild to sea to save your radios batteries i shall listen for your transmissions on the hour every hour for precisely five minutes on our agreed channel if i have not heard from you within seventy two hours i shall assume that you have neither read this note nor ever will and i shall go north for help in the meantime i have left you a cache of supplies which i have concealed in the woodland you will find the cache eleven paces due east of this rock god bless you d the last two sentences had been written in pencil just as had the postscript which david had evidently scribbled after he had brought the message ashore hours tim i have just made my first confirmed sighting of a greenbacked firecrown hummingbird the bird had a disappointingly dun plumage so was probably a female but it was still a thrill to see you might care to look for yourself mine was feeding on the wild fuchsias which are growing among the trees just above your cache i saw no hummingbird i did not even look for a hummingbird i could not have cared if a whole troupe of hummingbirds had joined wing tips and hummed hallelujahs around my head i just wanted to find davids cache which consisted of ten cans of baked beans ten cans of corned beef six kendal mint bars a small cooking canteen a box of earl grey teabags a waterproof container of matches a canopener a groundsheet and a sleeping bag all crammed into a rucksack it was a sensible cache though i wished he had included one of the cheap spare quartz watches that i had stored aboard stormchild for the day when all my expensive chronometers gave up their ghosts david was very sensible in restricting the times when he would keep a radio watch for me but i no longer had a watch and did not know when the hour was on the hour but at least i had food i opened a can of baked beans and not bothering to make a fire to heat them ate them greedily above me a hint of thunder boiled in the low dark clouds with the very last of the days light i took from my pocket the photographs of nicole i stared into her face trying and failing to understand her i tried to remember her as a child but it was as if a veil had drawn itself between those memories and this moment i did not know my daughter anymore i did not understand what strange sea change had been wrought in her by her brothers death nor what she had become in the years since my daughter was a stranger i put the photographs away night fell in a rage of wind and rain lightning flickered briefly to the south except for my brother my whole family was gone to death or to evil and i was alone that knowledge made me feel as though i had passed through a dark gateway into a place where hatred ruled and where any life left to me was bleak and profitless i crouched in the trees like an animal i was dirty soaked tired bleeding and very dangerous and i had seventytwo hours in which to teach the genesis community that they were not above the law i had seventytwo hours to destroy them just as they had destroyed my family i had been so reluctant to face that truth but now i would ram it down their throats i slept with the australian girls legacy of dynamite beside me i woke long before dawn i tried to reach stormchild on the radio but there was no answer and i dared not drain the battery by leaving the small set switched on in hope of catching any possible transmissions that david might make instead i pulled his rucksack onto my back picked up the rifle and started walking part three it took me most of the daylight hours to cross the isla tormentos i was unsure of my way for i was not returning to the limestone workings but rather trying to reach the farm settlement i had no map no compass and the sun was hidden all day so i trudged through the unending rain guided only by guess much of my journey was through marshland for i was using the low ground to avoid the eyes of any genesis sentinel i pushed through stands of woodland that were so thick with undergrowth they rivaled a tropical rain forest for impenetrability i waded rainswollen peatcolored streams that were rich with trout and staggered through deep sloughs under the protests of screaming birds my blistered feet hurt like hell so that i hobbled rather than walked twice denied the cover of low ground by rising floodwaters i was forced up onto the hills and both times i found the fresh tracks of the crosscountry motorbikes evidence that von rellsteb and his companion had returned this way proof if i needed further proof that they had failed to capture stormchild that failure would be worrying von rellsteb he probably believed me to be dead but that would be no consolation for his fear that stormchild was sailing north to carry berenice and her damning tales to the chilean authorities with my body left to be found and the australian girl still missing somewhere on the island the last thing von rellsteb needed was any official interest in the isla tormentos and he would be doing everything in his power to intercept stormchild in the heavy seas off cape raper it was that supposition which led me to believe the farm settlement would be largely unguarded if the community believed i was dead and knew stormchild was at sea then they would certainly not be guarding their house against an attack from the landward flank on that assumption i made my plans to make their settlement uninhabitable without food and shelter the group would be shattered i planned to destroy von rellstebs legacy i would murder his dream i would finish him as he had tried to finish me and i no longer cared what risks i ran in that destructive revenge because i had nothing left to live for i was not entirely bent on suicide before attacking i planned to wait through the rest of davids seventytwo hours in hope of contacting him on the radio if i succeeded in reaching stormchild i would persuade david to rescue me when my harrowing of the settlement was finished i had decided not to tell my brother what i planned for fear that david would summon the authorities before i succeeded instead i would merely tell david i was in safe hiding then arrange a rendezvous with him somewhere in the desolate straits but if i could not reach stormchild on the radio then damn the consequences because i had nothing left to live for i had reached the protective escarpment that curled about the western flank of the settlement at nightfall the last few miles were hard going for i had entered a nightmarish landscape of rocks small gorges sudden streams and cold black lakes above which the settlements crude radio mast acted as a landmark beckoning me on i approached the crest of the escarpment very cautiously skirting around a windfretted reservoir that was held back by the earthen dam which controlled the water supply no one challenged my approach once slipping off a wet rock my right foot dislodged a crashing fall of scree but there were no guards posted on the high ground to hear the shattering landslide splash into the lake by dusk i had found a hiding place it was a deep crevice beneath the rocky peak on which the radio mast had been built the crevice was a crack in the rock eighteen inches high and four feet deep six people could have hidden in its black shadows and from its eastern lip i could stare straight down the steep escarpment across the vegetable plots to genesis community i made myself at home in my refuge by spreading out the groundsheet unrolling the sleeping bag and stowing my precious food and explosives deep in the dry heart of the rock i then crept down to the reservoir and had a skimpy wash in its icy water i had no razor so my incipient beard bristly and uncomfortable had to stay back in my aerie i made a supper of cold baked beans and corned beef as i searched the bay with my half binocular neither the catamaran nor the sloop were there only the decrepit fishing vessel which suggested the faster yachts had indeed gone north to search for stormchild they would be having a lively time of it for the wind was whipping over my rock and shrieking an eldritch sound in the guy ropes of the radio mast while the landscape beneath me was being beaten by a cold windblasted rain that kept the genesis community indoors just before darkness i saw two of the graydressed women hurry with sacks to one of the outhouses but i saw no one else darkness came and i watched the dim candle lights flicker in the windows of the big house until one by one they disappeared and the settlement was swallowed into the wild patagonian night after the last light had disappeared i tried to reach stormchild by radio i counted the seconds and once every minute for an hour and a quarter i switched on the small set and sent an identifying message but i heard nothing in reply it could have been that david and stormchild were too far away or perhaps the hills of the island were blocking my signal or maybe the radio was not working i finally abandoned my efforts and sheltered from the relentless rain by the tons of rock above me i tried to sleep but the best i could manage was a shivering night of intermittent and hallucinatory dozes i was filled with misery my feet were in agony but i dared not take off my boots in case i could not pull them on again over my blistered bleeding feet an hour before dawn i finally abandoned any pretense of sleep and once again tried to radio david and once again i failed to reach him i went back to the eastern side of my rock and as the gray light seeped into the bowl of the mountains i watched the settlement stir a wisp of smoke showed at a chimney the rain still fell and the wind gusted to make the damp landscape a place of cold misery i shivered yet in truth i was so damp and so cold that by now i had almost ceased to notice any further discomfort during the night my socks had become soaked with blood that now seeped over the edge of my boots i contemplated making no hostile move that morning i needed more rest and i still had time to reach david if it was necessary i planned to spend all day trying to raise him on the radio but instead in the mornings early gray light and just as the first workers went into the fields everything changed for just after dawn the most astonishing mournful and trembling sound echoed across the sky like a great shuddering lament my first prosaic thought was that a lovesick bull sea lion had bellowed his frustration to the new day but then i realized that this sound was too great for any animal it was a foghorn minutes later like the arrival of some phantasmagorical spacecraft from another world a ship appeared she was a real civilized proper merchant ship i took out my half binocular to see the name san rafael painted on her bows she looked huge though in truth she was nothing more than a small coaster perhaps two hundred feet long and five hundred tons in displacement but in that bay where i had thought to see nothing bigger than stormchild the san rafael loomed like a leviathan she was a smart ship beautifully painted in a dark blue and gray livery with the colorful chilean ensign painted on her funnel i guessed from the derricks on her foredeck that she was a supply vessel for the oil and gas rigs that edged the land of fire and she looked just the kind of sturdy efficient vessel that such a job would need she had a high bluff bow a cargo deck amidships and a galleried layer of living quarters behind the bridge at her stern a wisp of steam from her turbines drifted across the water as the radar aerial on her short mast whipped busily around bilge water spewed from a vent on her starboard side above which men in blue donkey jackets leaned on her varnished rails to gaze at the isolated settlement the arrival of the san rafael had thrown the genesis community into turmoil the few graydressed women who had already started work in the gardens fled in panic toward the house while a man in green stared in apparent shock at the cargo boat that now seemed to fill the bay i shared the mans evident astonishment for the ship was a stunning reminder that there was a real world somewhere out beyond the tidescoured channels a world where people lived by rules and read newspapers and watched television and drove cars and did their shopping i stared at the wondrous ship wondering whether i should try to contact her by radio and ask her to pass a message on to stormchild but even as i was trying to compose a suitable explanation for such an odd request i saw that the san rafaels crew was lowering a ships boat i trained my makeshift glass on the coaster the lens skidded across the group of men at the ships side down the flank of the coaster and at last steadied on the small ships tender that proved to be a motorized launch about seventeen feet long the launchs coxswain a cigarette dangling from his lip threw off the falls fore and aft then accelerated the small boat away from the san rafaels hull toward the beach the launch was not bringing supplies to the settlement she carried neither crates nor fuel drums but instead she was evidently disembarking two passengers those passengers swathed in yellow rain slickers huddled nervously together on the boats central thwart i could see nothing of the passenger sitting on the port side of the launch but there was no mistaking the face of the person to starboard and upon seeing that face my heart leapt from its suicidal selfpity into a sudden and very unexpected joy the face was so very solemn but it was also so very full of life and enthusiasm and happiness jackie potten had come to chile to fetch her pulitzer i switched on my small radio if i was to talk to the san rafael i would have to call her on channel which was the only frequency i would expect them to monitor but someone else had already sequestered that channel i heard a mans voice haranguing the san rafael in quick agitated spanish i could distinguish the ships name in the mans excited torrent of words but nothing else though i hardly needed to know spanish to understand what was being said the man was attempting to persuade the san rafael to take the visitors away but even as his protests became frantic the small launch kept determinedly on toward the beach as it neared the shore i saw jackie stand precariously to take a photograph of the settlement two greendressed men had run to the bluff above the beach and now waved vigorously at the launch in an evident attempt to make it turn round a third man this one carrying an automatic rifle appeared at the back door of the house and began running toward the hills where i lay sheltered and i realized that the arrival of jackie and her companion had prompted the same precautions that had attended my own arrival at the settlement most of the group stayed protected in the house while a cordon of men tried to make the unwelcome visitors leave i presumed the gunman on the hill was the precaution of last resort while the gunman in the houses upper window was posted to dissuade any of the graydressed community members from trying to escape the greendressed man began to climb the lower slopes of the hill i saw that if he kept on his present course he would take up a firing position just twenty or thirty yards away from me the man wore a yellow headband and had a bushy black beard and i guessed he was the same man who had tried to kill me from the cliffs top at the limestone working he was panting as he climbed the steep slope i had forgotten to switch off my radio and suddenly the small set squawked and i frantically turned down its volume but the bearded man who was probably being deafened by his own hoarse breathing had not heard the sudden burst of noise i put my ear close to the speaker to hear a new voice transmitting i suspected the new speaker was lisl for she spoke in german genesis one genesis one she called this is the settlement over the catamaran replied after a few seconds the reception was very faint indeed almost inaudible but i was fairly certain that it was von rellsteb himself who acknowledged the settlements transmission we have more visitors lisl said laconically and still speaking in german two women then see them off i thought i detected a hint of panic or anger in the guttural voice von rellsteb had gone to sea to intercept what he supposed was stormchilds dash for help but now he was discovering that more unwelcome outsiders had descended on his community the san rafael brought them lisl went doggedly on and my german was not good enough to fully understand all her next words but i thought she said that the coasters captain had informed the settlement that the two women had insisted on staying until the ship returned to collect them they mustnt stay von rellstebs voice betrayed a terrible anxiety have you found the english boat lisl asked no good luck lisl said tonelessly there was no response and in the silence i wondered if i should risk talking to the san rafael i decided against trying for almost certainly the settlement was monitoring channel and any transmission would betray my presence so regretfully i switched my radio off beneath me the man with the yellow headband had found a firing position on a big flattopped boulder close to the concrete dam he was some twenty yards to my right and well positioned to fire down on any unwelcome visitors i looked back to the beach to see that the san rafaels launch had reached the shingle two greendressed men were trying to push the boat away but jackies companion literally jumped at them forcing the two men backward jackies companion appeared to be a very heavy woman and a good deal older than jackie indeed i realized with a pang the larger woman was probably someone of my own age jackie jumped ashore the launchs coxswain hurled two kitbags onto the shingle then with a farewell wave he reversed his boat off the beach for a few seconds the bluff hid the confrontation between the visitors and the bearded men from my sight then the older woman appeared at the top of the wooden stairs that led from the beach the two men were either trying to drag her back to the sea or at least steer her away from the house but the woman would have none of their interference she pushed one man aside with a forearm tackle that would not have disgraced a secondrow forward playing rugby at cardiff arms park and shoved the second one back with a thump from her weighted kitbag jackie coming behind snapped a photograph of the two discomfited men then ran to catch up with her companion who was now striding purposefully past the gazebo and the concrete tanks toward the front door of the house i caught a clear glimpse of jackies face in my half binocular her expression which blended anxiety and eagerness was achingly familiar then she her companion and the two men were all hidden from me by the house itself i rested my head on my arms god damn it i had thought myself recovered but one clear glimpse of jackies face had sent a shudder of longing through me and i was suddenly overwhelmed by images from our all too short time together i remembered her apprehensive excitement as she climbed into the camels seat on lanzarote her shyness when she had shown me her bikini and her horror on antigua at the mention of guns i recalled the guilty glance i had stolen of her as she had exercised naked on stormchilds foredeck oh god damn it i thought i was still in love even though under the blowtorch of davids scorn i had tried to forget her david that thought made me switch the radio to channel this is tim calling stormchild i hissed the words scarce above a whisper tim calling stormchild over i was watching the man with the yellow headband who was lying behind a makeshift breastwork of loose stones that he had piled as a firing rest on the edge of his flattopped boulder the wind must have swallowed my voice for the man did not look round this is tim calling stormchild i hissed into the microphone but there was still no answer come on you old fart i said cheerfully talk to me but insulting the airwaves made no difference for there was no reply and alarmingly the small red battery light had begun to blink so to conserve what little power was left i switched the set off jackie and her companion both dressed in their distinctive yellow slickers now appeared at the corner of the settlements southern wing they were clearly behaving as i had behaved when i had first come to the settlement they had found the front door locked so now they were working their way round the edges of the buildings the two men followed forlornly just as they had followed me the older woman marched resolutely across the courtyard toward the back door i watched through my monocular expecting to see her try the door and find it locked but instead and as much to my surprise as to hers the back door of the house was suddenly snatched open and an apparent flood of genesis people ran into view the redhaired lisl led their charge the genesis people who were all wearing green spread into a line the older woman hesitated while jackie a pace or two behind her companion seemed to have a greater appreciation of the sudden danger she twisted round just as the two men who had followed her from the beach attempted to snatch her none of the genesis people was using a gun presumably for fear that the sailors on the san rafael would hear any shots the san rafael was still in the bay she had recovered her launch and the water at her stern had just begun to foam white as she got under way the long low house hid the small drama from anyone aboard the san rafael but i could follow every move jackie trapped by the two men freed herself by hurling her heavy kitbag at her closest attacker it hit the man in the chest jarred him backward and jackie began running her companion was also trying to run but the older woman was so heavy that her flight was more of a lumbering waddle while jackie lithe and fit easily dodged her pursuers after a few sprinted yards jackie slowed and turned to shout encouragement at her companion but she was too late for the older woman had already been swamped by a welter of greendressed bodies jackie hesitated and i silently screamed at her to keep on running then she must have realized that she could achieve nothing by continued hesitation so she turned and ran like a frightened hare toward the hills three of the men chased after her i thought it would prove a desperately close chase but jackie was far fitter and faster than her pursuers she twisted among the vegetable patches leaped an irrigation ditch sprinted beside a stand of pea plants then was on the lower slopes of the escarpment and climbing fast her three pursuers had begun their chase just ten paces behind her but by the time she reached the slope beneath the dam they were already thirty yards back and still losing ground one of the men stopped altogether and bent over to catch his breath jackies companion was being dragged to the southern wing of the house evidently to be locked into one of its stablelike rooms while lisl whom i supposed von rellsteb had left in charge of the settlement was watching the pursuit of jackie the san rafael oblivious to the furor its arrival had initiated was gaining speed as she steamed out of the bay jackie glanced behind to see her pursuit was fading and so slowed down herself she veered to her right jumped the small conduit that spilled from the dam to carry water to the house and then began climbing the steepest part of the escarpment toward the radio mast she did not know it but she was heading almost directly toward the man in the yellow headband who to prevent her spotting him had shrunk back behind his breastwork the two men who had kept up the pursuit of jackie now stopped they like their companion were winded but they also must have realized that the man in the yellow headband was perfectly situated to ambush the fugitive i slid my rifle forward i was reluctant to fire for the shot would betray my presence but i nevertheless slid the safety catch off and was ready to pull the trigger if the man aimed his rifle at jackie she thinking herself safe had reached the crest of the ridge where she turned to look back for some news of her companion but the older woman had long been thrust inside the stablelike buildings jackie who must have been wondering into just what hell she had precipitated herself turned away and began walking along the rough stony track which led beside the reservoir and directly beneath the big flat rock on which the gunman was perched and from where the gunman sprang his ambush he did not use his assault rifle the san rafael had only just disappeared beyond the wooded promontory and any gunshot might still have brought the chilean vessel back to investigate so the bearded man abandoned his rifle on the high rock and instead leaped down in an attempt to flatten jackie with his body weight she must have sensed something or else she heard his movement above her because she broke into a sudden run leaving the man to sprawl on the path behind her the man fell heavily but immediately scrambled to his feet and lunged after her with a demonic burst of energy jackie responded by cutting to her right and scrabbling at a steep stony slope that would surely have defeated her heavier pursuer except that the man just managed to leap up catch her right ankle and pull her back down the slope i heard her scream as she was dragged down ive got her the man shouted triumphantly bring her down one of the two men who had abandoned the chase but who were still on the escarpments face called back and when he heard no reply he shouted again stephen stephen are you ok ill bring her down in a minute ive got her dont worry the two men waited a few seconds then assured that stephen did have the fugitive in his control they turned and scrambled back down the escarpment one of the men raised a thumb toward lisl who understanding the gesture waved in reply stephen the man in the yellow headband had meanwhile forced jackie to kneel down on the path beside the reservoir he was standing close in front of her with his back toward me and so he saw nothing as i slid from my crevice i carried the rifle but very carefully so that its metal bound butt did not clash against the rock jackie and her captor were scarcely more than thirty yards from me but neither of them saw me and neither of them heard me jackie who was facing me was too terrified to take notice of anything except her captor who with one hand in her hair seemed to be holding her down on the path i saw her twist violently to free herself of his grip but the man cuffed the side of her head with his free hand he hit her hard and she called out in pain the man said something but i could not distinguish his words the wind gusted about the rocks bringing snatches of rain in its cold grip i slithered down a rock slope loosening a fall of pebbles with my right foot but neither the man nor jackie heard the small avalanche for a few seconds a dip of land took me out of their sight and ignoring the pain in my feet i ran swiftly across some flat boulders before stopping to peer over a rock barrier to see that jackie was still kneeling in front of the man who now tentatively took his hand away from her hair stay he snapped at her as though she were a dog i was now twenty feet away the mans back was still toward me as i gathered myself to attack the man was fidgeting and i thought he must be trying to disentangle a length of rope with which he planned to tie jackies hands but then because he moved slightly to one side i saw that he was fumbling to lower his trousers and i understood why he had wanted jackie to kneel in front of him jackie understood too better than me probably and once again she hurled herself to one side in a frenetic attempt at escape and this time she very nearly succeeded except that the bearded man hurled himself fulllength after her and managed to wrap his arms round her legs come here you bitch i heard him shout then he twisted round and his eyes widened in desperate fright he had heard my boots as i scrambled over the rock barrier he turned and he saw a revenant come from the grave he had seen me fall to my death just the day before but now like an apparition ripped from his deepest nightmare i was reborn i was charging over the rocks stumbling on loose stone but the man did not see my clumsiness only my face and he must also have seen my gun and remembered that his own was fifty paces away and lost he tried to get up and run but jackie tripped him he scrabbled to free himself of her half stood staggered two desperate paces but then i had pounded past an astonished jackie and my boot lashed out to catch him in the base of his spine he yelped in pain and toppled forward his skull cracked audibly against rock and i saw a spurt of blood splash on stone but he was still conscious and still ready to fight as he twisted round and balled his fist to lash up at me but then he froze in terror because the muzzle of a leeenfield no mark i rifle was about one half inch from his left eyeball try it stephen i said please he gave an infinitesimal shake of his head but whether to indicate that he was not going to attempt an escape or whether the response was just pure fear i could not tell remember me i asked him pleasantly im the sucker who couldnt fly and couldnt swim either but i can come back from the dead and i can kill no he said no please his fly was undone and showing a length of filthy underpants i jerked the rifles muzzle a fraction of an inch and suddenly a stream of yellow piss overflowed from the underpants to soak his trousers oh stephen i said in offended remonstrance then i put on the guns safety catch and reversed it so that i was threatening him with the guns brass butt instead of its muzzle zip your nasty self up i said as nicely as i could he needed two hands to do up his fly and while he concentrated on the damp zipper i thumped him over the head with the rifle butt i hit him too hard he saw the blow coming and tried to twist away which evasion only added desperation to my blow and so the brass cracked on his already bleeding temple with a horrid thud he did not immediately flop back unconscious instead he groaned and twitched but i could see the whites of his eyes and knew he would live more to my purpose i knew he was conveniently out of commission for a few minutes hello jackie i called over my shoulder there was no answer nor did i dare look round in search of one for i had to concentrate on stephen that was my excuse though in truth i was almost frightened to look at jackie for fear of being disappointed or overwhelmed or embarrassed whatever i bent over the stricken stephen whose face had gone horribly white a fresh trickle of blood instantly diluted by rain water spilled from a rapidly swelling bruise on his left temple and i felt a horrid fear that i might have hit him too hard and that he was dying after all but then he gave an awful groan that convinced me he still had a deal of life left in him i shrugged the nylon rope off my shoulder and swiftly lashed his ankles together then heaved him onto his belly dragged his ankles up toward the small of his back and tied his wrists he was now trussed as neatly as a dead stag but i still had to gag him i tried to rip a length of cloth off his green clothes but the stitches would not rip and i had left my rigging knife in my hiding place so i just wrapped the free end of the rope round and round his bearded face forcing the line between his teeth so that the only sound he could make was a choked gargle fuck you stephen i said cheerfully and patted his head as i stood up he gargled helplessly and i decided he was not going to die yet hello jackie i said again and this time i did turn round to smile at her she was still kneeling on the path from where she stared hugeeyed at me youll notice i didnt shoot the scumbag i said but please dont think thats because ive developed moral objections to shooting scumbags because i havent but because the bastards are pretty sure im dead and a gunshot would rather give the game away it might also bring the san rafael back here and frankly i dont want that i want to be left alone to make these bastards regret they were ever born hello she burst into tears she had no makeup she was soaking wet she was crying and she was spattered with mud and i thought she was beautiful we cant stand here and chat all day i went on weve got to hide then fetch scumbags gun and im afraid weve got to take scumbag with us because soon his friends are going to come looking for him and i cant have him telling tales about me i know youve got the most intense reservations about guns but would you very kindly carry this one for me it wont go off i held the rifle toward her she hesitated take it i snapped and she guiltily reached out and took it tim she said as though she did not really believe her eyes its me i said then i bent down and pulled stephen into a sitting position before not without difficulty hoisting him onto my shoulders i could have released his ankles and forced him to walk but i could not afford the time to let him struggle and it was simpler just to carry him by the way i said to jackie when i had settled stephen comfortably on my shoulders it really is wonderful to see you again she immediately started crying again it took me ten minutes to get stephen up to my crevice in the rocks once in my deep hiding place i pushed him deep down under the threatening overhang of wet rock shoot the bugger if he gives you any trouble i told jackie then went and retrieved stephens assault rifle that turned out to be an american m with two spare magazines i wriggled back into the crevice where a shivering jackie had already taken shelter and where stephen still inextricably knotted in my extravagant lengths of nylon rope lay terrified in the deepest part of the narrow cave far beneath us in the big courtyard of the farm settlement the worried genesis people gazed up at the ridge line they probably think stephen is taking a good long time to rape you i told jackie but in a few minutes itll dawn on them that something has gone wrong and then theyll start looking for him but i think well be safe here as long as we keep our heads down tim jackie said she was still shedding tears ive been meaning to apologize to you i said because i had decided that on the childish principle of eating the vegetables first i might as well eat my humble pie quickly i should have told you about the guns on stormchild it was stupid of me im sorry i really am i dont blame you for jumping ship because i really should have been honest with you it wasnt the guns jackie said then after a sniff she must have decided that her words had not made much sense that wasnt why i ran away she explained oh i said feebly and i knew i would have to make a much more embarrassing and comprehensive apology in anticipation of which i felt my face reddening i was tempted to drop the whole subject but somehow it seemed important to clear what was left of our relationship and so i took a deep breath then launched myself into remorse im also sorry about what i said to you on antigua about wishing youd stay with me i never meant to upset you but sometimes we say things that are stupid and im sorry the apology sounded lame but it had been heartfelt and the best i could achieve under these weird circumstances jackie stared at me with her huge and solemn eyes i didnt think it was stupid she said it was a stupid thing to say i insisted because all it achieved was to drive you away from me so it was clearly out of place and im really very sorry my embarrassment had made me turn away from her as i spoke i was watching lisl and two men walk toward the escarpment all three carried rifles by the way i glanced at jackie where the hell did you hide that day on antigua i looked everywhere for you i even took a taxi to the airport in an attempt to find you i was on that dutch boat you remember the couple we ate dinner with on your birthday she sniffed i waited with them until you sailed away then i flew home im sorry tim she sounded close to tears im the one who should be sorry i said very robustly because i should never have been so clumsy as to say what i did i frowned at stephen who was listening avidly to this exchange of mutual selfblame his eyes wide above the loops of gagging rope seemed to express incredulity for what he heard stilli went on talking to jackieit really is good to see you again i missed you i missed you too she said my heart skipped a beat but i was determined not to make another fool of myself so i did not respond to her words which i was fairly sure were nothing but an expression of politeness im rather in the habit of missing things at the moment i told her instead davids taken stormchild off to sea and if i dont get him on the radio soon hes going to sail off and ask for help hes got your friend with him berenice berenice tetterman jackie asked in utter astonishment the very same she ran away the bastards shot at her but missed and we took her on board but thats her mother who was with me jackie paused to take breath molly came because i couldnt persuade any newspaper to send me down here so molly sold her car and we used the money to fly to santiago and then we had to find our way down here and it was really hard because the car didnt fetch a lot of money and quiet i said im talking too much she said in bitter selfreproach no i pointed down the escarpment to where lisl and her two companions were climbing toward us there had been little chance of jackies voice carrying that far down the slope but i wanted jackie to be aware of the danger if were quiet and still i said they wont find us then tonight well rescue molly if shes still alive alive jackie said you mean she could not continue i mean theyre a murderous bloody bunch but i dont think theyll kill molly because they know the san rafael is coming back for you both but they are killers ive got proof of it i also killed one of them i didnt really i just shot him and they did the rest but i suppose its the same thing i stopped talking because jackie was looking so very miserable im sorry i said after a while but you really dont understand how bad these people are and nicoles one of them nicole jackie stared at me with huge eyes you found her i shook my head shes at sea i sounded bleak maybe she isnt like the others jackie said tentatively she is i said in fact she may be one of the worst im sorry tim god im so sorry jackie rested her face on her forearm and i thought she was praying but then she spoke in a muffled voice im sorry for everything i really am quiet now i warned her and i touched jackies elbow to reinforce the warning and she raised her tearstained face to see that lisl had climbed onto the dams embankment not forty yards from our hiding place stephen lisl peered into the rain seeking her lost gunman stephen lisl shouted again as her two companions joined her on the dams wall stephen they all shouted together make one little sound stephen i spoke very softly and ill dig your eyes out with a marlinespike stephen who was staring at us from the caves recess made a gurgling sound which i took to mean his eager agreement to stay silent good boy i said encouragingly jackie had gone very white lisl was close enough for us to hear the click as she cocked her rifle she raised it in the air and fired off a whole magazine of bullets then waited for any response from the missing stephen the rain billowed across the reservoir but no reply came to lisls shots she swore then scrambled up to the flattopped rock that stephen had used as his bastion she found no sign of him there nor from her new vantage point could she see any evidence of him fuck him she snapped to her waiting companions then she jumped down to the path and turned back toward the house i sympathized with her reluctance to search the torn landscape for such a search could have taken all day and still have missed hundreds of hiding places such as the one where jackie and i now sheltered youre just going to abandon him one of the men with lisl called after her for christs sake paul hes got a gun how the hell could anything have happened to him hell turn up with the girl in his own time now come on the three of them scrambled back down the hill and jackie let out a long deep sigh of relief im afraid theyve got an awful lot of guns i told jackie but you really should understand that i wouldnt be alive today if i hadnt brought a gun myself i mean i know just how much you disapprove but the thing is that shut up tim jackie said with a brusque and intense passion so i shut up jackie added nothing to her bitter command but instead just stared into the wind and rain so filling her silence and needing to make my peace with this girl i tried to explain myself one more time i dont like guns any more than you do i said not really but if some murderous thug is having a go at me i really do shut up tim please jackie sounded very weary as though i bored her and i suddenly realized that i was merely compounding the mistake i had made on antigua because my very apologies were a stratagem of love and by making the apologies i was offending her just as i had offended her by the more honest and outright declaration so i finally shut up properly and i stared at the house and i thought how lonely life was going to be after all i told you that it wasnt the guns that made me run off jackie said suddenly i know that i said miserably it was the other thing and i felt curdled with shame at the memory but i made myself define the thing exactly as though by eating the last bitter crumbs of the humble pie i could destroy its memory it was my wanting you to stay with me yes she said flatly that was exactly it i stared above the settlement to where the empty waters of the desolate straits lay gray and cold rain swept in spiteful veils across the distant hills and over the slatecolored tideway im sorry i said bleakly i had already apologized more than enough but i had not realized till now just how deeply i must have offended jackie in the crowded antigua street it frightened me you see jackie said in a voice so soft that i almost did not hear and when i turned to look at her i saw that she had begun to cry because i wanted to say yes you wanted to i began to echo her words but she cut me off by shaking her head to indicate that any interruption now might make her lose the thread of her explanation i wanted to say yesshe went on more stronglybut it terrified me tim i didnt know if i could make a decision like that so quickly do you know what i mean so i thought ive got to get away from you to give myself space at least i thought that once your brother arrived because hes a bit overpowering but i couldnt really explain it to you i wanted to say something but could find nothing to say so kept quiet so i ran away jackie went on because everything was confusing especially with your brother there and i felt in the way and i thought that if i could just give myself a bit of space id find out what i wanted she stared brighteyed and serious at me and i wondered if ever anywhere on gods earth a stranger situation had been found for two people to fall in love and suddenly i began to dare that we were indeed falling in love jackie took my silence for an encouragement to speak on i mean its a big decision isnt it you wanted me to give up my career right and live on a boat thats kind of a drastic life change and if im going to make that kind of emotional commitment then i want to be sure that ive considered that commitment properly and youd want me to do that too wouldnt you oh yes of course i said realizing i had forgotten just how much this girl could talk when she was nervous or no perhaps i went on and i saw the astonished stephen was still listening to our every word jackie shook her head in selfrecrimination i should have explained it all to you on antigua but you always seemed so selfsufficient and i thought youd probably be glad to get rid of me in the end you see i thought you were just trying to be nice to me and that youd change your mind when you really thought about it you thought what i asked in astonishment that you didnt mean what you said and that if you had a few weeks without me youd think better of it i mean i couldnt blame you if you did because jackie i put a finger on her lips to stop her talking she must have thought we were in danger for she stared at me with very wide and very frightened eyes i kissed her tears i love you i said and i think i was close to crying myself only now it was happiness that filled me and so i kissed her again and i felt relief surging through me as strongly as a flooding spring tide swelling over shoals to render them harmless and i felt the same relief flood into jackie as i put my arm about her shoulders and held her close stephen gargled at us i think he was attempting to be the first to congratulate us on our new found happiness but i kicked him with my heavy right boot anyway just to shut him up oh tim jackie took a deep breath does that mean were sharing a boat now i asked her i guess it does she smiled coyly whoopee i said and just hoped i could get the boat back by midday the settlement was sufficiently worried about the missing stephen to send two men to search the islands interior on the crosscountry motorbikes while another four men all armed with assault rifles combed the ravines and rock piles of the high plateau but no one thought to explore the escarpments crest immediately above the settlement where the three of us lay concealed instead the searchers all went further west presumably on the assumption that stephen must have pursued jackie into the wild landscape that led toward the distant ocean the search parties had a miserable time of it because the rain was an unending drumming thrashing tempest that slashed across the high country and beat the reservoir into frenzy and drowned the vegetable fields at the escarpments foot we kept dry in our crevice and i told jackie all i had learned about the genesis community from berenice and from my own exploration of the limestone workings i told her about the australian boat and about the corpse i had found in the high rocks under the cold wind i showed jackie the passport then ungagged stephen to discover if he knew anything about the australian girls death when stephen had finished gasping and making a fuss about his strained jaw muscles i unfolded the blade of my rigging knife and pressed its sharp tip into the soft tissue under his left eyeball my father was a surgeon i told stephen and he taught me that the medical term for what im tempted to do is enucleation he whimpered which i decided was a request for further information enucleation i told him is the operation of removing the eyeball he whimpered again which i translated as an indication that he understood me so unless you want me to begin my new career as an ophthalmic surgeon right here and now stephen talk to me what he told us about the australian boat confirmed berenices story the catamaran naiad had come unexpectedly to the settlement and von rellsteb desperate to acquire a fourth yacht had invited the three australians to a meal at the mine once at the mine the two men had been shot and the girl tossed into a storeroom did you rape her i asked stephen he hesitated a split second too long so i drew blood with the knifes blade he gave a small scream that was echoed by jackie you bastard i said to stephen and nicole was she there he nodded tell me i said and i put the point of the stainless steel blade into the newly drawn blood tell me about nicole i ordered him at the time of naiads arrival stephen said nicole had been the navigator for the second genesis boat and stephen had been a member of that same crew but nicole he claimed had been a difficult shipmate she was not only a more competent sailor than their skipper but she was also full of more energy and anger and resolve nicole stephen said always wanted to sail the extra mile or take the extra risk she was desperate to take over command of genesis two and the arrival of the big australian catamaran had seemed a heavensent chance for von rellsteb to prevent a mutiny thus the naiad had been pirated and given to nicole so who killed the australians i asked stephen he stared dumbly at me who i insisted even though i knew the answer she did he almost whispered the accusation the others hesitated so she snatched the gun oh sweet jesus jackie murmured in a stricken voice i stared hatefully at stephen wanting to murder him for being the messenger of such news but then i decided i had better drain the cup to its bitter dregs so asked him which boat had sailed to europe two years before again his hesitation was just a fraction too long indicating not only assent but guilt genesis two i asked your boat yes and nicole was with you he nodded in terror and you placed a bomb on my boat it would have taken a nerveless creature not to feel terror at the tone of my question or perhaps it was the cold sharp steel that pricked at his eye socket that made stephen shudder and begin to breathe in short urgent gasps as though he suddenly had to cram a lot of oxygen into what was left of his miserable life jackie fearing what i was about to do turned away it wasnt me stephen managed to say was it nicole she and her lover he was gabbling now eager to prove that he was cooperating with me eager for my approval eager to save his sight and his life her lover i remembered the photographs in the radio room at the mine which had showed nicole with the tall blond young man who had looked so uncannily like her brother and i wondered what strange beasts prowled in our lusts when we let them through the gates of inhibition and fed them with our angers is he fairhaired stephen nodded hes called dominic and hes her navigator now they thought that if you died then they would inherit your boatyard and they could start their own group in europe nicole wanted to prove she was better than caspar you see but she needed a base to work from so she picked your boatyard caspar didnt mind because he always found nicole difficult so he said we could take genesis two to europe but only on condition that nicole called her new group genesis and acknowledged him as its founder it almost never happened because we arrived a day late and we thought youd be gone and the weather was bad but nicole pressed on she never gave up never i stared into stephens terrified face hating him except it was not this little creep but nicole it had always been nicole i had tried to persuade myself that she had been duped by von rellsteb while in truth she had been the instigator of all the evil why was i so surprised fletcher had told me that the vast majority of murders were committed inside the family and that money and inheritance were motives for murder as old as man and from the first moment when i had suspected inheritance as the motive of joannas murder i must have known it was nicole and no one else von rellsteb could not have profited from my death unless nicole wished him to i had tried to convince myself that von rellsteb had manipulated nicole but i should have known better nicole had never been manipulated by anybody it had been nicole all along nicole had killed her own mother and tried to kill me i didnt plant the bomb stephen said in a low pleading voice of course not i said tiredly it had been nicole probably with her lover who had stolen up the river in that rainslatted darkness it did not matter how only who and it could only have been nicole for only nicole would have known that joanna and i sailed to guernsey every easter and only nicole would have known just where to find slipslider and only nicole would have remembered exactly how to get inside the boat to plant the bomb had she heard my voice that night had she heard her mother and i talking had she seen us at that moment when i switched on the yards floodlamps it wasnt me it wasnt stephen whimpered and as i thought about nicole crouching on my boatyards pontoons my imagination balked how could she have done it did she think that by saving seals and staunching oil spills and harassing nuclear tests she could atone for murdering her parents what ungoverned engine of hatred or envy or passion had driven her to such an act was it just for money if nicole had asked us we would have helped her but she had wanted to take all there was and without strings so she had killed and if i had not stayed behind to sell stormchild nicole would be leading her own environmental crusade from my boatyard tim jackie said very tentatively it wasnt me stephen cried oh shut the fuck up i told him he had been there he had been on the boat that had crept up the river to commit murder this green creep this selfrighteous rapist had helped sail the boat that took my daughter to kill my wife fuck you i said tiredly then pulled the rigging knife away and folded its blade hurting stephen would achieve nothing instead i listened as jackie questioned him about genesis she had a journalists curiosity and a dogged patience and elicited a sad but oddly familiar tale of idealism soured and high hopes broken most of the genesis activists like stephen himself had joined von rellsteb in canada or on americas west coast where convinced that emotional indignation was a valid replacement for informed thinking and fired by the chorus of environmental doomsayers they had been attracted to von rellstebs venomous gospel that only by the most ruthless measures could a polluted world be restored for a time fueled by youthful enthusiasm von rellstebs disciples were convinced their efforts were making a difference every presscutting that described a drift net sabotaged or a tree saved encouraged them yet as they came to realize they were only doing what a hundred or a thousand other such groups were doing von rellsteb easily persuaded his followers that their unique contribution to the environmental crusade should be a paradigm wilderness community that would be a forerunner of a new and ecologically sound world the genesis community would show the way to a better planet they would live in peace and organic harmony hurting not a tree nor a beast and loving each other freely patagonia had been the setting for this new eden but under the environments hammer blows of cold rain wind and scarcity the communitys passionate idealism had first decayed into petty jealousies and afterward into an authoritarian hell peace was enforced with punishment the trees were cut for fuel and beasts killed for fur and free love had turned to institutionalized rape yet none of the communitys leaders and not even the majority of its members would confess to failure for to do so would have been to admit that they were as fallible as other humans instead they had persevered in their losing battle clawing small victories from decaying morale they harassed the drift netters and nicole stephen told us was even now patrolling the southern seas to discover which tuna fishermen still killed dolphins nicole will never give up stephen added with a grudging admiration and he confessed that he had proved too feeble to join her crew nicole wanted only the hardest and most fanatical people on her boat genesis four stephen told us was crewed by the communitys hardliners who almost alone now were still fulfilling some of von rellstebs original aims the other members of the community had given up the fight some had weakened and died to be buried at the foot of the escarpment while a very few had tried to escape only to discover that their paradise was too remote and too far from other human traffic to make such escape possible i listened to the hopeless tale and when jackie was finished and stephen had no more answers to give i cut a strip of cloth from his jerkin and gagged him once again then we lay in silence and stared down at the world von rellsteb had made this was his green dream this was the harbinger of the new pure unindustrialized unpolluted clean and lovely world where man would live in loving tune with primal nature except nature had other ideas and so jackie and i were staring down at a rainpounded shitstinking failure of flooded vegetable plots and broken hopes this then was the ecoparadise a place of misery and filth with my daughter at its evil heart this was caspar von rellstebs fiefdom his achievement and tonight under the cloak of darkness i would destroy it the rain smashed down flooding every hollow in the uplands and spilling a myriad of rivulets across the escarpments edge this was an earthdrowning rain a cataclysm of water a planetdrenching misery we waited as the wan wet light faded jackie huddling close beside me for warmth told me about her vain attempt to find a newspaper that would send her south to explore the genesis story three major papers had been interested but each had insisted that a more experienced reporter be assigned to the story so she and molly tetterman had decided to go south themselves they had flown to santiago then already worried that their money would run out they had bought secondclass rail tickets to puerto montt the train tickets only cost nine eightyfive us jackie explained and the airfare would have been seventytwo dollars each so we went by train and then we went to the steamship company and they agreed to bring us here and collect us on their way back from puerto natales they were really great i thought they were going to charge us a fortune because the san rafael had to steam miles out of its way to get us here but they really seemed to want to help us theyre kind of curious about what goes on here i asked when the san rafael was arriving to collect them and jackie said in ten or eleven days depending on the weather and then i thought to ask if by any chance she was carrying a watch and she was and she was sure it was accurate and it showed us that the time was just three minutes short of the hour i climbed to the very top of the rock where under the guyed mast and in the windwhipping lash of the rain i took out my handheld radio i knew that the higher i was the more chance david had of hearing me i switched the radio on and tried to ignore the ominous message of its blinking battery light i tuned the set to channel then pressed the transmit button stormchild stormchild i said this is tim this is tim over i waited the red light seemed to be blinking more feebly and i assumed that each wretched blink was draining yet more power from the already weak battery rain was seeping inside my collar for fucks sake davidi let my tension showtalk to me a very offended voice suddenly answered this is stormchild this is stormchild theres no need to use offensive language tim weve been keeping a radio watch for you but weve had to stand well offshore because of the weather and theres a bit of westerly in the wind as you must have noticed so i didnt dare come too close to the coast david wittered on giving me his news telling me how risky it had been leaving almagro channel and i could not interrupt him because so long as he had his transmit button pressed he could not hear my transmissions so all i could do was wait until he shut up the small red light on my radio winked tiredly and still david explained why it had taken him so long to hear my transmissions but at last he handed the airwave back to me david i need you at the settlement david i say again i need you at the genesis settlement not at the mine but at the settlement come here now this radio is on the blink i cant transmit much longer just come here do you read me over all i heard in reply was a hiss and a broken jumble of davids voice and when the jumble ended i pressed my transmit button david just come here just come here just come here to the settlement the red light was flickering then disappeared altogether and when i released the transmit button i could hear nothing at all from the sets small speaker the red lights disappearance showed the radio was dead and i could only pray that with its last weary gasp it had sent the precious message and that david would obey my summons i went back to my hiding place where as the light faded and the rain drummed on i opened a tin of baked beans for jackie a can of corned beef for myself and nothing at all for stephen our enemies were ever more worried about their missing gunmen and sent two new and bedraggled search parties up into the rocks but the new searchers still did not look right under their own noses and so discovered nothing by now i thought lisl would be getting close to panic stormchild was still on the loose an unwanted visitor was prowling the island and she had lost a man and his rifle i hoped her nerves were shredding before the light faded altogether and after the last searcher had gone back down the escarpment i took jackie to the sheltered lee of the rock smiled at her then told her it was time she learned to fire a rifle her eyes widened tim she began in a very determined voice shut up i said in an even more determined voice then i showed her how to cock the m where its safety catch was and how to fire it in single shots and how to select automatic fire im surprised they didnt teach you how to do this in sunday school i said facetiously doesnt every little american girl learn how to shoot now i went on before she could answer the gun isnt loaded so pick it up and show me how you fire it i couldnt even touch it she stared with revulsion at the gun which now lay on the rock between us but you can touch it i said and fire it and thats exactly what youre going to do tonight no i cant she shuddered anyone would have thought i had asked her to eat a steak listen i said i need some help tonight im going down to the settlement and i want them to be looking in the wrong direction in other words i want you to distract them so show me how you select singleshot fire instead of automatic tim i cant for christs sake i said im not asking you to kill anyone you dont even have to point the gun at anyone you just point the damn thing at the stars and shoot the sky all i want you to do is make a noise with it have you got scruples about making a noise she reached out a tentative finger and touched the gun it did not bite her just make a noise she asked just make a noise i reassured her she actually succeeded in picking the gun up you know i wont be able to kill anyone tim i dont mind making a noise with it but i wont point it at anyone she paused her eyes huge in the damp dusk and i felt a pang for the passions of youth i told you i said i just want you to make a noise ok she said bravely i gave her a kiss and once i was sure she understood just how to fire the rifle i spent the last of the seeping daylight making a weird contraption from parts of the dead radio from the batteries of the flashlight i still had in my bag and from five tins of baked beans jackie watched me with a puzzled expression what is it she asked a vegetarian nonlethal bomb i told her then i pushed the strange contraption into my bag with all but one stick of the australian girls dynamite the sun sank behind the clouds and slowly almost imperceptibly the foul murk of day became the fouler blackness of wet night until shrouded by the darkness i wormed my way out of the rock crevice jackie gave me a kiss i promised i would be back within the hour and then armed and dangerous i went to make my mischief the first mischief was simply done i climbed to the rocks peak where i sawed through the guy wires that held the makeshift aerial upright i cut two of the twanging wires and the gusting wind did the rest i heard a splintering torment then the mast and its aerial crashed down the precipitous slope for a few seconds the night was filled with the tumble and protest of breaking wood then there was silence tim jackie called are you all right never better the aerials coaxial cable was still trapped on a snag of stone and just to make sure that the toppled aerial was useless i slashed the cable through now whatever else might happen in this nights darkness the settlement couldnot talk to von rellsteb then after calling another farewell to jackie i clambered from the rocks and slithered down the escarpments steep face i carried the leeenfield some of davids waterproof matches and one stick of dynamite i had left jackie with the rest of the explosives my vegetarian bomb the m and stern instructions that should i not be back within three hours she was to go north find another hiding place somewhere on the coast then use the gun either to signal david as stormchild sailed past or if stormchild failed to appear to alert the san rafael when that vessel returned i reached the foot of the ridge and began to trudge through the waterlogged vegetable fields my feet hurt but i had no choice but to endure the pain i was also soaked through the escarpments steep slope cheated the wind of much of its force but the rain still fell on these lowlands with the same malevolence with which it crashed among the high rocks i slipped and fell a dozen times and tried not to remember the feces that were spread on these damp fields i cursed when i stumbled into a flooding drainage ditch i shivered chilled to my bones the only lights in the wet darkness were the dim yellow gleam of candles that flickered weakly behind the settlements barred windows for the moment i was keeping well clear of the house preferring to begin my work at the stone wharf where the trawler was berthed astonishingly the fishing boat was unguarded it seemed that after the mysterious events of the day the community had retreated into the safe haven of their big house so for the moment i had the night to myself i used the heavy rigging knife to slice through all four of the trawlers mooring lines the last warp parted with a drumming twang to recoil viciously into the darkness where the fishing boat was already drifting away on the strong ebb tide i could have simply let the tidal current sweep the old boat far away but i wanted to start a campaign of fear so i took the tin of waterproof matches from my pocket and with it the single stick of ancient dynamite with its woven fuse and praying that the fuse would not burn too swiftly i knelt down clumsily struck a match in the teeming rain and sheltering the fluttering fire under the wing of my coat i held the dynamites fuse into the red flame for a second the fuse did nothing and the match assailed by the winds gusting almost went out but then and with an appalling swiftness the fuse began to fizz bright sparks the fuse was only five inches long and it seemed that three of those inches turned to instant ash as soon as the flame took hold but i steeled myself to keep hold of the pinkish stick as i stood turned estimated the distance to the drifting trawler then threw i saw the burning fuse arc through the darkness above the black water then drop accurately down beyond the trawlers gunwale i heard the dynamite thump and roll on the wooden deck then i dropped flat on the quays wet stones i covered my head with my arms closed my eyes tight and waited nothing happened and i supposed that the ancient dynamite had been made useless by its exposure to the weather which was a damned shame for i had predicated much of this nights mayhem on the efficiency of alfred nobels invention and in my disappointment and as i tried to work out an alternative course of action i raised my head to watch the fishing boats dark shape drift away in the pouring night the boat blew up give nobel a prize i thought because the stick of old explosive had worked its blast thumped outward with an appalling breathstealing force a force so great that for a few seconds it seemed as though the rain had been blown clean out of the sky but then the circle of bright explosive light contracted and the hissing rain came back the explosion scything across the trawlers deck had lifted one of the huge fishhold hatches and slammed it into the canted windows of the wheelhouse a bright flame streaked up past the air up past the boats derricks past its aerials up to where the rain slanted silver and sharp from the low clouds another and darker flame was flickering amidst the smoke that was boiling up from the trawlers deck that smaller flame was dark red but suddenly it ran and spread to outline the boats tarred rigging in fire the sea was illuminated for twenty yards around the burning boat while in a much wider circle scraps of burning debris dropped from the sky i slithered away wriggling far beyond the light of the burning boat before i stood wiped myself and the gun clean of mud then began walking back toward the escarpment to my right the settlement was in tumult lights showed in almost every window most of the lights were candles but there were a few powerful flashlights and two of those stronger lights now bobbed across the front stretch of grass as too late the genesis activists ran around the bays edge to discover what had happened to their precious boat i had thought that the rain might be strong enough to extinguish any fires that the explosion might have started the very best effect i had dared hope for was that the dynamite might blow in the wheelhouse and shatter the steering lines but the trawlers old timbers had been so soaked in oil and tar that they were like an incendiary mixture and now they blazed to dazzle the night they rippled fire across the bay and flickered a scarlet flamelight against the house front and across the wet fields and against the rocks that edged the bay and up to the low hurrying clouds the night was suddenly shining but i was already a shadow in the margins of the lowlands i heard them lamenting their loss but there was nothing they could do soon i thought their laments would turn to radio appeals for help but they could not summon their leader nor could they use their boat to escape they were trapped and i had just begun to play hows stephen i asked jackie giving you grief youd like me to kick his head in hes real quiet jackie gazed wideeyed at the flamelit scenery it had taken me the best part of a half hour to climb back up the escarpment yet still the burning trawler was shuddering the water with the red reflections of its flames the boat had gone aground close to the wooded promontory where she now slowly burned down to her waterline and from where her death streaked the black sea with bands of red fire and cast deep shadows into the settlements courtyard and into the tumbled rocks by the beach and into the woods above the burning boat it was still raining and the flames gave a dark crimson sheen to the spreading puddles that made such a misery of the settlements vegetable gardens i now wanted to add to that misery i had used one stick of dynamite on the boat i needed another later in the night which left me with four sticks which i now made into a single bundle tied with a strip of green cloth i had cut from stephens trousers getting cold are you i asked him he made an odd guttural noise from inside his gag he was shivering the flames though burning over half a mile away were just strong enough to reflect off his eyeballs he watched me cut three of the four fuses off their sticks then i fashioned the three into one long fuse which i spliced onto the fourth i hoped that i had quadrupled the time between lighting the fuse and the resultant bang of the bomb with which i planned to attack the old earthern dam i doubted whether the bomb would be powerful enough to destroy the dam but with luck it would do enough damage to the spillway to make the settlement an even more uncomfortable place to live and discomfort was the major weapon i was using to drive von rellstebs followers out to where the world might hold them accountable for their actions when the bomb was finished jackie and i slithered down from the rocks to the path beside the dam i left her crouched by a pale boulder while i walked along the paved pathway which ran across the dams top the dams purpose was not to conserve water for water was the one commodity that was never scarce in this land but rather to save the fields from perpetual flooding by diverting the escarpments watershed westward instead of eastward the dam also served as a gigantic header tank for the settlement for which simple purpose it had no need of complicated sluicegates or turbines instead of such refinements i suspected that the dam simply leached its water into pipes buried deeply enough in the earthen wall to make sure that they were never blocked by ice in the wintertime some of the pipes would feed the conduits that irrigated the vegetable plots while others went to the house to make sure that the reservoir never overflowed to cascade an unwanted rush of water down to the settlement there was a spillway at the western end of the reservoir which drained the lakes excess water into the islands inner tangle of wetlands the whole nineteenthcentury arrangement was a lowtechnology water control system of admirable simplicity and efficiency it was also i suspected fairly resistant to sabotage that resistance was provided by the dam itself which was a massive wall of earth doubtless reinforced with buried boulders that helped protect the pipes i suspected i could not reach those pipes so instead i planned to lower the sill of the dam the sill was ten feet wide and had a central pathway which was paved but the paving stones were old mosscovered cracked and uneven and it was no trouble to lever one whole slab free then using my knife i clawed and scratched and dug my way down into the dams sill i dug like a dog desperately scrabbling soil aside as i delved ever deeper into the cold damp and hardpacked mix of shingle and soil the burning trawler gave just enough ambient light to let me see what i was doing when i had excavated as far as my arms could reach i put the bomb into my newly made burrow then taking care to leave the fuse exposed i swept loose soil and shingle over the bundled dynamite finally leaving a space just large enough for my hand and a match i pulled the flagstone back over the halffilled hole are you ready i called to jackie go for it she shouted back and i reflected that for a girl who went loosekneed at the sight of a gun she was remarkably sanguine about dynamite i glanced toward the settlement the trawlers flames were at last losing their battle with the deluge of rain and sea but just enough flickering light remained to show me the house and its encircling wings i could see no flashlights there indicating that the genesis people knowing their fishing boat was lost had withdrawn once more into the protection of the buildings where doubtless they were frantically and helplessly trying to reach von rellsteb on the radio so now was the perfect time to feed their panic i struck a match in the space i had left under the stone the flame struggled then caught and i touched it to the stub of fuse that suddenly hissed and spat sparks at my knuckles the fire darted into the loose soil and i hoped to god that there was enough oxygen to keep the fuse burning right down to the old explosives i ran jackie reached a hand toward me and i threw myself down behind her rock and put an arm about her hold tight i said in unnecessary warning then the fire bit into the explosives and the settlements troubled night became a whole lot worse the dying light of the burning trawler was just sufficient to show us what happened at first i thought the whole energy of the explosive had been wasted into a onehundredfoot column of flame which belched straight into the sky like an incandescent geyser smoke boiled after the spear of flame then magically the smoke seemed to evaporate leaving nothing except the memory of that startling stab of fire that had pierced the wet sky and momentarily blinded us both damn i said softly thinking that the bomb had failed i heard splashes as lumps of soil and scraps of stone pattered down into the reservoir to break the complex geometric design of the radiating ripples that had been generated by the explosive percussion in the dam damn i said again because i had just used four sticks of dynamite to achieve nothing more than pretty patterns on a lake no listen jackie said excitedly i listened and above the sound of wind and rain i heard an odd grinding noise which became yet louder and louder and which seemed to come from the very heart of the mountain beneath us and which suddenly turned into a titanic belch that in turn gave birth to an obscenely vast bubble which shattered the black surface of the reservoir hard by the sill itself then extraordinarily it seemed as though the hardpacked soil at the very center of the dam was being turned into a shivering and gleaming liquid jackie and i huddled together in the rain watched as the apparently solid wall began to quiver and glisten as the water infiltrated the bombloosened mass of earth for a second a smooth shining firetouched lip of water trembled and glittered at the outer edge of the liquefying dam then the whole vast agglomeration collapsed the bomb had done better than i had ever dared anticipate i had hoped that the explosion might bite a chunk out of the dams sill and that the consequent erosion of the spilling water would do the real damage by widening my small fissure into a gaping breach but instead the whole construction now seemed to shatter and collapse over the escarpments edge in a single thunderous avalanche of earth rocks and water bloody hell fire i said in delighted awe jackie was gripping my hand with a strength i would not have credited in her the water deluged to the bottom of the escarpment fed now by a veritable niagara of draining floodwater that slid across the dams shattered brink spray bounced high to meet the rain as what was left of the old earthern dam wall was torn away in chunks the size of houses the floodwaters churned across the fields drowning the vegetables and pouring like a tidal wave toward the house the released lakewater smashed into the courtyard and flooded into the settlements lower story as still more water poured in a smooth rush across the rim of the hills the turbulent flood touched red and silver by the flames spread across the plain below lapped against the big house and reached with greedy shining streams toward the sea the flashlights appeared again but only to bob helplessly above the inundation arent you proud of me i asked jackie im proud of you she said then touched my unshaven cheek with the tips of her fingers be careful tim ill be careful i promised for now it was time for me to go down the escarpment again but this time to visit the flooded settlement itself jackie was not coming with me instead she would stay safe on the high ground where in exactly thirty minutes she would create a diversion by firing her rifle she would not fire at the settlement but into the sky where she could be fairly certain that she would not be shooting any people bunny rabbits or roosting sea gulls i sent jackie safe on her nonviolent way picked up my bag with its bakedbean bomb shouldered my rifle and went back down the hill i waded through the glutinous slough that i had fashioned from the settlements vegetable plots water still gushed from the destroyed dam not with the terrible force that had followed the explosion but still in a strong enough flow to make a curling silver stream that twisted through the mud to make a pool of the courtyard i could hear children crying as i neared the house i could also hear molly tetterman hammering on the door of her flooded prison she was stridently demanding to be released but i decided she was safer where she was and left her in miserable ignorance while i prowled round to the front of the house no one challenged me as i splashed nearer and nearer the pale building the yellow light of candles and lanterns shivered behind the windows of the upper floor but the flooded lower story was pitch black the trawler had at last burned out and the troubled night had slid back into its impenetrable darkness as i took the last remaining stick of dynamite out of my bag then i sidled along the front wall of the house and waited children cried above me i heard a mans angry voice demand that the damned kids be quiet a woman protested against the mans anger and was immediately hushed then lisls voice strident and loud demanded silence listen she ordered and for a second i thought she wanted everyones attention for some important announcement but instead she wanted everyone to listen for any more sounds of trouble in the surrounding darkness they did not have to wait long jackie fired she told me later that she had fired the rifle so high into the air that the bullet had probably clipped an angels wing but more to my purpose the crack of the gun was an unmistakable sound in the wet night and i heard feet stampede across the upper floor to the windows that faced inland jackie fired again and sure that my enemies had been safely diverted to the back of the house i struck a match lit the last fuse then rolled the dynamite up against the front door before running desperately out onto the soggy lawn to put as much distance as possible between my body and the explosion i ran twenty paces then dropped quiet lisl shouted again for the brace of rifle shots had prompted a babble of excited voices which in turn had started all the infants bawling again look for the muzzle flash i heard lisl shout i could also hear the fuse of my dynamite spitting angrily but i saw nothing for i had my eyes closed and my face pressed hard into the damp ground the dynamite blew i felt the thumping breathsnatching hot billow of the expanding gasses wash over me then my head and shoulders were bombarded by scraps of soil when i raised my head i saw that the trellised porch had vanished and the double front doors had been turned into a gaping and smoking hole desperate children were screaming like tortured banshees in the upstairs rooms i worked the leeenfields bolt putting a round into the chamber then turned the safety catch off this side a voice shouted and a flashlight stabbed toward me in the rainy darkness i fired not at the light itself but into the window above it i merely wanted to scare not to kill i heard window glass crash and tinkle as the light was jerked back inside the room i ran toward the house the door frame was a smoking mess that led into a hallway inches deep in floodwater light filtered down a stairway to show me bare walls on which paint of a horrid institutional green peeled sadly i pushed into a room to see the same drab paint the place reminded me of the english boarding schools where david and i had learned the merits of acute discomfort i went back into the hall splashed past the the splintered front doors that were lying across the foot of the stairs and found the kitchen water and mud silted the floor but the twin woodburning furnaces of the long black range were both alight making the big room wondrously warm i doubted if these twin fires were ever extinguished for the furnaces probably supplied all the heat and hot water for the entire settlement i almost burned my hand trying to open the nearest furnace door and had to snatch off my woolen hat to use as a hot pad the heat seared at me from the open door i found a candle on the table lit it from the stoves flames then my business properly lit i set about making the room uninhabitable i started by hanging my bag which held my vegetarian bomb on a beam close to the kitchen door i carefully arranged the bags contents then i extinguished the settlements fires i used an old castiron skillet to scoop muddy water from the floor and pour it onto the precious flames the burning timbers hissed in protest water beaded and scurried across the stoves redhot iron as i went on ladling yet more water into the two furnaces the kitchen filled with steam and smoke i had flooded the valley disabled the radio now i would deprive them of heat and cooking short of burning down the house i could think of few things more calculated to destroy morale in this uncomfortable place once the fires were doused i used the rifles butt to sweep plates bowls and cups off the dresser i smashed the crockery into piles of creamy fragments then yanked down the bunches of herbs that hung from the ceiling beams i upset huge boxes of stringy red seaweed that like the herbs i trampled into the floodwaters i bashed a metal chimney pipe clean off its stove then used the rifles brassbound butt to hammer through the old lead pipes that brought water to the kitchen i stove in the windows then opened a cupboard and spilled more of the settlements invaluable supplies onto the flooded floor i tipped over a whole barrel of flour then hammered at a basket of eggs every few seconds i suspended my activity to listen for the footsteps that would presage a counterattack by the genesis people yet the group was so frightened or else so disorganized that i had virtually finished the wrecking of the kitchen before i at last heard the sound of feet on the stairs i froze then heard the scrape of the fallen doors being moved and afterward a cautious splashing in the hallway i stepped silently back into a large scullery a scrap of mirror hung by the door and i saw myself reflected in the tarnished glass and for a second i did not recognize my unshaven face it was so smeared with mud that it looked as though i had used a whole tin of army camouflage cream my bloodshot eyes stared grimly back at me then i looked away from the glass raised the rifle and waited to see who had come to investigate two people stepped through the door one was a bearded man dressed in faded green the other a thin frightenedlooking girl in a baggy gray sweater and lank gray trousers she hung back behind the man who was carrying a rifle he stared appalled at the destruction i had caused while his companion began to whimper neither of them saw me in the dark recess of the scullery drop the gun i said or youre dead the bearded man twisted toward me i fired i did not aim to kill instead i just filled the room with the noise of the leeenfield and my bullet buried itself harmlessly in the opposite wall the girl screamed i worked the bolt and the bearded man dropped the rifle into the floodwater as though the gun had suddenly scalded him i stepped out of the scullery my name is tim blackburni held the gun on the manand i came here a few days ago seeking news of my daughter nicole no one had the courtesy to give me that news so ive come back to find it for myself the bearded man his hands in the air stared at me with a look of pure horror the girl had cringed back toward the door lift the flap of the bag above your head i told the man do it very gently and dont dislodge the bag just look under the flap quickly now the man very timorously reached up and lifted the canvas flap of my old fishing bag the rooms single candle flickered but it gave more than enough light to let the man see what lay under the bags flap and what he saw terrified him he saw my contraption which consisted of the flashlights two batteries and one of the printed circuit boards i had taken from the dead handheld radio i had also ripped out some of the radios connecting wires and managed to fasten them to the batteries which like the circuit board hung ominously over the lip of the bag the wires were anchored inside the bag by my unconsumed tins of baked beans the contraption was entirely useless yet to the bearded man who had already witnessed three explosions this night the device must have looked as devilish as any terrorists lethal concoction its going to explode very soon i told him and when it does therell be nothing left of this house do you understand me he made a strangulated noise then nodded so youre to go upstairs i told him and move everyone out of the house youre all to go down to the beach and shelter under the bluff otherwise that bomb will likely kill you that bag is stuffed with semtex and ive equipped it with a trembler switch so that even i cant take it down and defuse it do you still understand me he nodded again if i had told him that the old fishing knapsack was in reality a multipletargeted independent reentry vehicle equipped with thirty three thermonuclear warheads he would probably have nodded and dont try to radio von rellsteb for help i told him because ive dismantled your aerial now go upstairs and tell lisl to get everyone out of this house quickly go the two of them fled and i picked the mans discarded m out of the mud above my head there were sudden screams then a stampede of footsteps on the stairs proof that the threat of the baked bean bomb was working somewhere in the darkness and sounding as if it had been fired from much closer than the escarpments crest jackies gun suddenly cracked three times and i smiled to think how adventurous she was becoming the candle on the kitchen table flickered in the draft from the broken windows while upstairs a baby cried the kids i thought were in for a very rough night but better these few hours of cold misery and hunger than a lifetime of enslavement to von rellstebs green tyrrany i moved to the kitchen door and saw that a flood of people gray and illdyed green were scrambling down the stairs across the broken doors and out into the rainy darkness some carried their children while others had snatched up blankets a few greendressed men carried guns but they were too intent on escape to use them most of the fugitives glanced at me but they did not speak they just fled from my threat in the certain knowledge that their house was about to be destroyed just as their fishing boat and their reservoir had vanished on this night of nightmare lisl was the last to flee she gave me a cool look but otherwise offered no defiance i waited till she was gone and the house was empty and until the only sounds were those of the rain falling and the wind sighing and of molly tetterman demanding her release from her damp prison cell none of the genesis people had thought to free molly tetterman but she wasnt in any danger so i was happy to leave her in her makeshift cell so now other than the imprisoned molly i had the house to myself i had captured von rellstebs sanctuary which with two guns on my shoulder i went to explore i edged past the shattered and scorched front doors and climbed the stairs the stairway walls had once been decorated with a dark paper that had since been embellished by the genesis children with chalk pictures of spouting whales soaring albatrosses and waddling penguins the top of the stairwell had a fine castiron balustrade doubtless one of the many thousands that had been used in the nineteenth century as ballast for empty ships outbound for the southern hemisphere and which to this day so handsomely decorate australian balconies the stairs themselves were made of mahogany a reminder that although the exterior of the house might have been remarkably plain the first von rellsteb had clearly spent money on its interior perhaps so that when he drew his tasseled velvet curtains he could pretend that a wilderness did not press dark against his windowpanes the upper landing opened onto a main corridor that stretched dimly on either hand i walked slowly down the lefthand corridor pushing open doors to peer into the abandoned rooms some of those rooms were still lit by candles and lanterns and their stark bleakness was another forcible reminder of the boardingschool dormitories of my youth these bedrooms contained very little beyond cold metal bunks fitted with thin mattresses some betrayed a more cheerful touch with homemade rag rugs or curtains fashioned from threadbare bolts of cloth yet the most comfortable aspect of these sleeping quarters were the ubiquitous otterfur coverlets on the beds and i assumed that the sheer misery of the patagonian cold had driven these selfstyled enviromentalists to slaughter one large room was a nursery and had homemade toys on the floor bright yellow curtains and two decrepit sofas but despite those efforts at domesticity the effect of the living quarters was gruesomely cheerless i found three bathrooms all with oldfashioned wooden stands on which chipped enamel bowls rested big zinc baths hanging from their walls and tin lavatories that stank because their contents were being saved to fertilize the vegetable fields the bathrooms unlike the bedrooms had no fireplaces or indeed any other means of being heated in one bathroom rainwater was dripping to puddle on the ancient cracked linoleum and i shuddered to imagine how in winter these washrooms would be skimmed with ice the corridor ended in a window which looked out on the northern hills i peered into the darkness where jackie with an unexpected eagerness was still banging shots into the night i half smiled at her enthusiasm then turned and walked in the opposite direction past the stairhead and past more spartan rooms my candle guttered but its flame cast just enough light to show me that the shorter southern corridor ended not in a window but at a handsome mahogany door i pushed the door handle down to find it locked i took the leeenfield off my shoulder aimed it at the lock and fired in the cinema such a violent act would have sprung the door open with the facility of an exploding bomb but my shot simply seemed to have jammed the doors mechanism even more firmly i kicked at the recalcitrant lock with my right heel but only succeeded in shooting a pang of agony into my already pained foot then fired a second shot into the tangle of splintered wood and bright bulletgouged brass the second bullet like the first mangled the mechanism most spectacularly yet was no more efficient in opening the wretched door than the first shot it took me six bullets and a bruised shoulder to finally smash the door open but at last on unoiled hinges the mahogany swung back and i found myself in the rooms that were evidently reserved for the privileged crew members of genesis it was like passing from a slum to a palace whatever lavish comforts and decencies might have mitigated the rigors of this awful place had been put into these rooms in truth anywhere other than in patagonia these luxuries would have looked tawdry but here on this barren far island of the worlds most bitter shore the furnishings of these last rooms suggested an air of the most voluptuous carnality and it was no wonder that the fanatical nicole had spurned such hedonism to house her crew in the more spartan buildings at the mine the floors in von rellstebs rooms were covered with a profusion of faded oriental carpets that lent the rooms a feeling of instant opulence the damp wallpaper was hidden by closely hung paintings and prints most of which showed romantic german landscapes heavy with gloomy crags turreted castles and plunging waterfalls i suspected that the paintings like some of the oil lamps that stood on the unwaxed tables must have been brought to the house by the first von rellsteb to settle in patagonia between the landscapes hung prints of german cathedrals and etchings of famous germans i recognized blucher frederick the great martin luther and goethe while a plaster bust of beethoven frowned from the mirrorcrowned mantelpiece fringed velvet tablecloths were draped over some of the pieces of furniture while the ancient horsehair armchairs and sofas were carefully protected by the remnants of lace antimacassars the furniture had doubtless been intended to convey a sense of germanic respectability but now its very incongruity somehow made it seem salacious a reminder that in frontier territories the first buildings to be lavishly furnished were almost always the brothels after them came the lawyers offices but it was always the whores who had the first carpets the two bathrooms that served these privileged rooms were decently equipped with clawfooted tubs and mahoganyseated commodes the bedrooms were cozy all with beds so stacked with mattresses that they looked as high as haystacks one of the smaller rooms was the settlements radio room von rellsteb would never have allowed his farm workers near the transmitters and had taken care to install the equipment behind locked doors inside the radio room was a board hung with keys one of which i supposed would unlock the stable where molly tetterman was still imprisoned molly i decided would have to wait as i explored these unexpectedly luxurious quarters of which the final room was by far the most lavish it was a bedroom with windows facing east toward the sea and south toward the wild moors and from the luxury of its furnishings i guessed that this was where von rellsteb and lisl stayed when they were in the settlement the room was dominated by a vast carved wooden bed on which a grubby white eiderdown floated like a cloud a cavernous wardrobe stood next to a tilesurrounded fireplace that still held the warm remnants of a log fire beside the bed was an antique mahogany dressing table with a huge oval mirror if it had not been for the rain that dripped from my soaking clothing onto the rugs and for the two guns on my shoulder i might have thought myself in some victorian mansion in respectable frankfurt i put my candle into an elegant brass holder on a bedside table then paused to listen jackie clearly reveling in her sudden discovery of guns ripped a whole clip of bullets into the air but otherwise i heard nothing to alarm me i knew that some of the genesis refugees were armed but i was trusting that they were now so cowed by the nights disasters that they would not dare come back to the house i also knew their supine inactivity would not last forever and i therefore could not risk spending too long exploring the house yet the temptation to ransack von rellstebs own quarters was too great and so i hung the m from my shoulder tossed the leeenfield onto the bed where it was swallowed in the fluffy billows of the great eiderdown and then began a feverish search of the big room i found very little one drawer of the dressing table had a scrapbook of newspaper cuttings which told of genesiss triumphs over their polluting enemies but the cuttings were few and the victories hardly worth remembering there were oilskins in the wardrobe and a pile of sweaters in another cupboard while a small bedside table held a tiny cache of coins and jewels which looked like some tawdry pirates hoard it was all so pathetic somewhere in the night a gun fired three deliberate shots i could not tell whether it was jackie or one of the genesis people so i edged to the eastern window taking care not to silhouette myself and stared into the darkness at first i saw nothing then with a horrid shock i saw a flicker of light out in the bay my first thought was that the burning trawler had drifted off the rocks then i realized this new light was too white to be the remnants of any fire then i wondered if stormchild had returned to the bay and if i was seeing a glimmer of her cabin light because the light was certainly made by a ships lantern of some kind but then i forgot the strange light in the bay because something heavy thumped on the bedrooms floor behind me i turned in panic to see a tin of baked beans rolling across the carpet toward me bang said caspar von rellsteb and laughed he leaned in the doorway dressed in wet oilskins and with an amused expression on his thin face he carried a rifle as did lisl who stood beside him she also carried my old fishing knapsack which she scornfully dropped on the floor so that another of the baked bean tins rolled pathetically clear then a smile on her face she turned her guns muzzle toward me put the gun down she ordered me but do it very slowly i very slowly unslung the m and placed it on the floor kick it toward me von rellsteb said i kicked the assault rifle toward him it skidded against a rug then disappeared under the bed the leeenfield on top of the bed was concealed by the folds of the eiderdown but i was too far from the bed for the hidden gun to be of any use to me i had been trapped by my overconfidence now von rellsteb had the advantage and i did not see how he could lose it i should have killed you in florida he said in an oddly friendly voice your daughter was angry that i hadnt she wants to inherit your boatyard you see she still does in fact though ive told her that youve probably changed your will by now even so she was right i should have killed you was he trying to shock me by talking so casually of nicoles wish to kill me i refused to rise to his bait preferring to keep my voice very calm as though we merely talked about the weather was that why you agreed to meet me there did you lose your nerve he shook his head i met you out of mere curiosity mr blackburn you said you had important news remember and i wanted to hear it i was wasting my time but it was still interesting and your letter was very pathetic you bastard i said in impotent anger he mocked me with a grimace of feigned sympathy i think you have had your revenge here tonight a pity it will take us weeks to clear up the mess but in the meantime we shall feed your body to the hawks its no good shooting me i said defiantly because the authorities know im here oh my god i am so very frightened von rellsteb laughed the authorities you hear that lisl perhaps we had better surrender immediately my boat will be in puerto natales by now i plowed on in the face of von rellstebs mockery then tried a little of my own you probably thought it was going north i smiled as though i pitied him his misconception actually von rellsteb put a scornful english accent on the word i think your boat is on its way here i suspect it has been hiding offshore for the last two days i said nothing how the hell did he know these things and once again just as i had when we confronted each other at the mine i wondered if this devil was a mind reader von rellsteb laughed mr blackburn what vhf channel would you monitor if you knew you were dealing with the owner of an english boatyard which channel does your daughter prefer when she wants a measure of privacy he shook his head as though he was disappointed in my stupidity i have been monitoring channel ever since you first arrived in our waters i thought you might use it to try and reach nicole but instead i heard your friend answer your transmission last night we couldnt hear you i imagine because you were using a lowpower transmitter whatever your friend is now innocently sailing toward us and i assure you we will prepare a suitable welcome for him you i think will be dead by then but first tell me are you responsible for the dreadful mrs tetterman being here i tried to look very vague who von rellsteb was silent for a second then shrugged as though he did not really care whether i told the truth or not how did you escape at the quarry it was my turn to shrug i flew lisl fired a burst of three or four bullets that missed my right shoulder by a whisker the room was suddenly echoing with noise and stinking with the acrid smell of the guns propellant how did you escape she asked harshly when you saw me fall i confessed i had a rope round my waist i then climbed to the quarry floor and waited you out nicole inherited your cunning von rellsteb said with a touch of genuine admiration and perhaps also your daring she is very brave too brave i have always thought that one day she will come too close to a japanese fishing boat and they will ram her of all of us you see she has caused the most damage to the japanese nets there are also timeshe smiledwhen i am tempted to hope that she will come too close to a japanese fishing boat she wants to take over from lisl and me but luckily for us nicole does not how do you say own the farm which is why she went to england she wanted her own farm he was watching me very closely but you already knew that how does it feel to have a daughter who wants to kill you who killed her own mother she meant to get you both of course he was trying to rile me but i said nothing that was not defiance but helplessness my heart was thumping in my chest my stomach was bitter with defeat my knees were weak and my mind a blur of hopeless schemes i could jump to the window i could leap to the hidden gun on the bed i could grow wings and fly away the truth was that i was going to die and von rellsteb was enjoying the infliction of that truth why i finally managed to find my voice though it was a very weak and plaintive voice why do you do this youre supposed to be preserving life not taking it now youre being very boring and entirely predictable von rellsteb said do you think that by enticing me into a sophomoric discussion of my motives you will gain time or perhaps you imagine you can persuade me to let you live maybe i should let you live until nicole reaches us she is coming you know i talked to her on the radio not three hours ago and told her you were here would you like to wait for her yes i pleaded i think not von rellsteb enjoyed thus contradicting my hopes because my people are waiting outside in the rain and i would like them to come inside and get warm which means i have to kill you before they return most of them are loyal but some of them are still naive enough to be shocked by murder he aimed the rifle at my face and i saw lisl half smile in anticipation of my death then jackie who must have climbed the stairs to stand in the doorway that i had blown open with the leeenfield ordered von rellsteb to put the gun down von rellsteb stiffened in shock while an astonished lisl half turned toward the sudden threat put the guns down jackies voice was hysterical ill shoot von rellsteb heard the desperation in that threat and he must have realized that jackie was almost helpless with nervousness his eyes flicked toward me and i could see what he was thinking that he could step out of jackies line of sight then shoot me but to do that he would leave lisl exposed shoot him if he moves a finger i called to jackie and i wished she would shoot anyway but i knew she would not it was a miracle that she had even managed to aim her gun toward von rellsteb but she was about as likely to pull her trigger as eat a pork chop her sudden appearance had gained me time but it would be my responsibility to talk jackie and me out of this unexpected standoff you cant kill me i said to von rellsteb so you might as well drop your gun both of you why cant we kill you von rellsteb despite having jackies gun aimed at his back evidently found my defiance amusing because the san rafael is coming back herei was snatching arguments out of the thinnest airand the women who arrived on the san rafael will tell the crew that you murdered me and thatll be the end of you you are telling me the game is up von rellsteb mocked me with his use of the stilted cliché of course the games up you fool i snapped not really von rellsteb said happily i shall radio the san rafael and tell them that their two passengers have decided to join our little band of conservationists and that therefore they have no need to go so far out of their way i think they will be grateful to be spared the expense of the fuel dont you he smiled i also think mr blackburn that if your very nervous rescuer truly planned to kill me then she would have fired at me alreadyhe paused to make certain i was directly in his rifles sightsso fare thee well mr blackburn fare thee well and the gun fired jackie screamed terribly lisl began to turn i threw myself backward instinctively falling away from the expected bullets von rellsteb pitched forward jackie still screamed i fell against the wall and bounced back towards lisl the sound of gunfire was obscenely loud echoing off the walls and filling the house bullets were chopping across giltframed pictures and churning the walls horsehair plaster into dust and ruin picture glass shattered bright mingling with the blood that was spurting vividly across the room it was von rellstebs blood because it had been jackie who fired she had fired her rifle on automatic and by luck more than judgment her aim had been perfect so perfect that her stream of bullets had literally exploded von rellstebs chest she had turned his torso inside out so that blood and bits of lung tissue and shards of bone and strips of heart were spraying across the carpeted floor and jackie was screaming with horror lisl was falling as she turned she was smothered in blood but it was not her blood she had caught her dying lovers last heartbeat and now she was twisting her rifle toward jackie whose own gun was now empty i threw myself forward my movements were stiff my clothes were heavy and waterlogged my joints ached i moved like a man underwater lisl saw my movement and began to swing her gun back toward me i heard jackie scream again and lisls gun jerked once more toward her i had sprawled on the beds thick and fluffy eiderdown that was drenched with von rellstebs blood i scrabbled for the leeenfield lisl was ignoring me aiming at jackie and then the heavy rifle was in my hands and i could not remember if the safety catch was on or off but i didnt have time to find out so i just pointed the barrel and pulled the trigger and the muzzle was still caught in the eiderdown so that the expanding gasses and the speeding bullet exploded a blizzard of duck feathers and the bolt would not work because it was also trapped in the thick folds but i managed to force the bolt to ram another round into the chamber and i fired again but lisls face had already disappeared in a bright eruption of blood where the first bullet had struck her the second bullet banged through her gullet jerking her head forward and back and then she slumped into a sitting position with her blood pouring thick and shining to make a puddle between her legs oh my god jackie was panting oh my god the room stank of blood and cordite feathers floated in the dusty air lisls red hair had been made a brighter red by her dying blood in which two drifting feathers had stuck to give her an oddly festive look for a second i thought she was still alive as her hands twitched and i almost fired again until i realized that i was merely watching her fingers contract into the claws of death they twitched curled then she was still jackie was sobbing helplessly i disentangled the leeenfield and worked another round into the chamber there were yet other gunmen at large and i had already foolishly allowed myself to be ambushed once von rellstebs dead body voided a long fart lisls body slumped sideways the room looked and smelled like a slaughterhouse bile was sour in my throat i slid off the bed and stood up oh my god jackie recovered her breath choked breathed again then staggered into the room i tried to warn you they were comingshe was speaking very fast as if she would lose track of her words if she spoke slowlybecause i saw their boat come so i kept firing the gun oh my god she had gasped the words out like a small girl delivering a very important message she did not wholly understand then she vomited the candle guttered outside the window a baby was crying it was still raining i stepped over the horror and gathered jackie in my arms and genesis was almost but not quite finished by dawn the unhappy genesis survivors were back in their ruined house they had no fight left as a group they had believed that their aims could best be achieved by violent confrontation yet when their methods had been used against them they had collapsed like a pricked bubble except that nicole had not collapsed and if von rellsteb had told me the truth she was even now sailing back for her vengeance one other genesis boat had returned in convoy with von rellsteb and now rode at anchor beside his catamaran in the settlements bay that left two genesis boats still at sea nicoles catamaran and the second sloop i did not fear the sloops return for like the other crews i suspected their hostility would crumble when they saw the full measure of their communitys defeat but nicole everyone assured me was made of grimmer stuff von rellstebs radio operator a glum californian confirmed that he had reached nicoles boat on his single sideband set but claimed to have forgotten to ask genesis four for a precise position report i did not believe him and encouraged by the leeenfields blackened muzzle he confessed that nicoles catamaran was hurrying home but was still some three or four days from making a landfall in the wet dawn i disabled the two genesis yachts by cutting their running rigging and emptying the oil from their engines i then ran the engines till the pistons seized hauled in the yachts anchors shot the guts out of their radios then left them to drift until they beached themselves close to the burnedout trawler once the boats were finished i wrapped the bodies of von rellsteb and his lover in sailcloth and dragged them through the cloying mud to one of the tanning sheds i assumed the chilean authorities would want to see the two corpses not that i cared because i would be long gone jackie aghast at having killed went to the seas edge in the dawn and sat for a long time with her head in her hands i thought she might have been praying and perhaps she was but when her prayers were done or her thoughts finished she came and held me very tight she said nothing and when i tried to speak she just hushed me she just wanted to be touched molly tetterman released from her prison took it upon herself to organize the dispirited genesis survivors molly could no more resist organizing other people than a bee could desist from making honey for while she believed herself to be a nurturing earth mother she was in truth a feminist sergeantmajor who discovered in the sodden wreckage of the settlement a challenge worthy of her talents and thus she cowed drilled and bullied the genesis survivors into making some small efforts for their own comfort she rescued food from the ruin i had made of the kitchen and handed out warm clothes from von rellstebs wardrobe she harassed the men into cleaning up the muddrenched rooms and used her gentler talents to comfort the scared children molly in brief was just what a shattered genesis community needed and just what i needed for her bundles of energy freed me from the need to make a similar effort molly looked after the settlements survivors while i crippled their boats and wrapped their dead then in midmorning i limped through the remains of the vegetable plots toward the escarpment stephen i remembered was still imprisoned on the ridge jackie caught up with me beside a pond that had been a cabbage patch before i released the reservoir where the dam had been there was now nothing but a smooth high valley that hung above the coastline a small stream spilt over that lofty rim to glitter in the wan morning light what do you think of molly jackie asked in a tone of voice which implied that she expected to hear my heartfelt expressions of admiration she overwhelms me i said but im glad shes here because she can look after this place till the authorities get here once david arrived i proposed to contact the chilean authorities on stormchilds radio and tell them about the murder of the australians and about the body they would find in the high rocks above the limestone quarry and about von rellsteb and lisl they would not however find me because as i told jackie i intended to take stormchild and intercept nicoles return it took me most of the scramble up the wet escarpment to outline those plans once at the top i released the freezing stephen from the rock cleft he was pathetically grateful but less so when i unceremoniously kicked him over the escarpments brink to tumble him helplessly down the steep slope toward the flooded settlement jackie and i stood together on the rocky summit beside the wreckage of the radio mast the wind whipped at our coats and drove cold rain toward the empty bay where the burnedout trawler lay like a black scar against the rocks suppose the missing genesis boats get back here before the authorities arrive jackie asked nervously ill leave you these two guns personally i doubt that youll need them i suspect nicole will follow me and the other boat will know the games up they wont fight you it took a tired jackie a moment before she realized that i planned to sail without her you dont want me to come with you she asked with a hurt intonation more than anything in the world i answered truthfully but youre not coming why not her voice was guarded because nicole isnt like the rest of genesis shes not going to collapse at the first hurdle shes fighter and her boat is crewed by the most fanatical of all von rellstebs recruits i dont think shell give in without a fight but what does she have to gain by fighting you jackie asked nothing now i said because its all over but she may not see it that way shes obsessed she lives in her own world where everyone else is out of step i paused i hope im wrong about her but she could be a very angry and very lethal young woman right now so why are you going to find her jackie asked because shes my daughter because no one else will help her and because ive come all this way to find her so it seems stupid not to take the last few steps the wind lifted jackies fair hair which was still bleached from the sun and salt of our atlantic crossing i think itll be safe for me to come she insisted with a gentle defiance nicole must know that the genesis experiment is finished and that theres no point in fighting anymore she looked worriedly up at me besides you cant sail stormchild on your own not in these waters of course i can i said with a confidence i did not altogether feel and david will help me and even as i added those words glorious and sudden and with her great sails white as innocence stormchild appeared in the desolate straits david noticing the empty quay motored stormchild to the berth vacated by the burnt trawler he looked exhausted he was so tired that he could scarce raise the energy to berth the yacht properly its one thing to sail across an ocean he explained to me but trying to stay safe off a lee shore is no joke ive hardly slept in two nights or days he fastened the last fender to protect stormchilds hull from the stone quay then stumbled ashore his eyes were red and his face deeplined berenice tetterman had already jumped ashore and was running toward her mother who in turn was hurrying toward her daughter they met they clasped they wept and i felt tears in my own eyes as i realized i would probably never again feel a daughters clasp lucky molly i thought and i tried not be jealous mother and daughter hugged each other both talking at the same time neither listening but both happy and both crying david embarrassed as ever by a display of sentiment turned to stare at the burnedout trawler the beached yachts the flooded fields and the gaping hole in the escarpments ridge where once there had been a dam what happened here he asked at last i described the nights events as we walked toward the house he grimaced when i told him of jackie pottens return and seemed to flinch when i told him i hoped to marry her he sighed when i described my bombs and shuddered when i claimed to have shot both von rellsteb and lisl i took the blame entirely on myself so that the authorities would not give jackie a hard time david suddenly alert smelt something wrong in my story they were both armed of course i wouldnt have shot them otherwise they were shooting at you i nodded automatic weapons too and all i had was the good old leeenfield so you shot them both from the front it was an odd question but also a very shrewd one i hesitated before answering no well yes i shot von rellsteb in the back but not the girl so von rellsteb wasnt shooting at you what are you i asked counsel for the prosecution the police are going to ask a lot of very awkward questions david said and i just want to make sure you dont tell them lies i wont tell them anything i said im sailing away from here and i dont intend to summon any help until im well offshore david who had been walking beside me toward the house suddenly checked theyre already on their way tim i called them last night i stared at him in horror you did what i called the armada last night good god man what else was i to do you summoned me here with a radio message that was virtually inaudible for all i knew it was a trap so of course i reported the matter to the authorities the armada should be here later today oh god i blasphemed does it matter david asked of course it matters i retorted angrily because once the authorities are here theyre going to stop everyone leaving theyre going to want statements and fingerprints and god knows what else were going to be tied up in chilean red tape and that means i cant head off nicole not unless i leave now where are you going david shouted after me i had begun running back toward the quay im going to find nicole i turned and explained to him because i want to see her alone before she goes to jail i havent come this far to run away from her whatever she might be what do you mean david caught up with me i mean i said that nicole is a killer she planted the bomb on slipslider david not von rellsteb it was always nicole oh my god david was stricken his face went white so im going to find her i turned away no david pulled me back then gestured at the flooded fields and at the the scorched facade of the house youve done enough tim theres no need to do more theres no need to risk more i shook my head with exasperation you dont understand david nicole is in hell and only one person can go down and save her now thats me i love her and i can offer her salvation of a kind but what i cant do is walk away from her youre not god david said i have to find her i said and touch her before they put her in chains is that so bloody bad david held my shoulders with his strong hands we agreed he said urgently that if we found evidence of wrongdoing then we would leave it to the authorities the chileans will let you see nicole youll have your chance with her i shook myself free i make my own chances david you arent thinking straight he took hold of me again you mustnt do this tim no good will come of it let the competent authorities deal with it the competent authorities i said will clap her in jail and maybe even put her to death do they have the death penalty here i dont know but whatever happens to her i first want to go down to her hell and take her hand and bring her back to the light doesnt your faith approve of that or dont you believe in hell anymore i believe david said simply then frowned at me you want me to come with you dont you i ignored his question maybe ill offer to take her to face british justice i said instead of chilean and maybe she wont want anything you offer david said then he shook his head in a sudden horror you mustnt go tim its too dangerous i smiled i dont want you to take risks david i want you to stay here ive always thought you should stay here relief showed on his tired face truly we dont want to risk the bishopric do we i teased him then turned wearily toward stormchild the reason i wanted you to stay here david i told him is because theres still one other genesis boat at sea and just in case it does get here before the authorities it might be a good idea if you were here to hold the fort molly tetterman seems a very competent lady but i have a suspicion youd be a more convincing threat with a gun i think you should stay with me david said trenchantly i know you do but i wont i grinned at him then stepped down onto stormchilds deck we both went down to the saloon where i helped david collect and pack his belongings he would deal with the chilean navy then go to santiago and tell the australian embassy about the pirating of the naiad i gave him maureen delaneys passport then warned him that he would have to field the attentions of some very curious reporters if you play it canny i told him you can probably persuade one of the newspapers to pay your fare home in return for some exclusive information is that how it works he asked though very distractedly david was not worried about the newspapers but about me he thought i was sailing to my death and he did not know how to stop me jackie will help you deal with the press i told him this is rather going to be her moment all those selfimportant papers who turned her down are now going to be begging for her story only if they can find me jackie said she had boarded stormchild and now crouched at the head of the companionway im going with you tim no i insisted jackie half smiled then produced one of the guns i had left in the cockpit it was an m and with a newfound confidence she switched it to automatic fire and aimed it at the array of instruments that was mounted above the chart table one squeeze of the trigger and stormchild would be without radios log depth sounder satnav and chronometer im coming with you tim jackie said or youre not going at all put the gun down i said please well i sighed then said what i had been wanting to say all day dear jackie i said please sail with me we sailed just after midday sliding away from the settlement and past the burnedout trawler and out into the swirling eddies of the desolate straits no armada patrol ship had yet arrived we left david with all our guns except one leeenfield that i stored in a cockpit locker then after molly had embraced jackie and enjoined me to look after her we cast off our lines we used the big engine pushing it to the limit in my hurry to escape to the open sea before the armada arrived in the desolate straits by midafternoon i had found a narrow channel that according to the chart led to the ocean and i plunged into its shadows i doubted any patrol ship would find us now and the clouds were too low for any helicopter to be useful we had escaped unseen and now hurried between dank dark cliffs that funneled the gusting wet wind and echoed back the rhythmic pounding of our big engine i gave jackie the helm while i went below and at last took off the walking boots and peeled away the bloodencrusted socks i hobbled into stormchilds tiny head showered then used an old cutthroat razor to hack off my stubble i bandaged my feet pulled on some reasonably clean and dry clothes then heated myself a tinned steak and kidney pie and made jackie a vegetable omelette i carried the meal to the cockpit where i scoffed down the pie drank a bottle of beer stole some of jackies omelette had another beer made myself two cheese sandwiches because i was still famished and then after wolfing down a tin of peaches slathered with evaporated milk i brewed a pot of tea strong enough to scald the barnacles off a battleships bum oh christ i said but that does feel better jackie went below to wash and change and i sat alone in stormchilds cockpit as the engine took us seaward as we neared the ocean the narrow channel became choppy and where rocks reared up from the sea bed the water ran in slick fast kelds to betray the presence of tidal rips jackie joined me on deck where with our oilskin hoods over our heads we watched sea otters kingfishers fur seals and geese i looked round the galley jackie suddenly said in a rather ominous tone so i couldnt find my sprouting kit your what my sprouting kit you know the thing that makes fresh sprouts from seeds and beans it disappeared in a freak wave i said i tried to save it but alas tim she said sweetly you are so full of it your eyes are brown i laughed i could feel the tremor of the ocean in the way that stormchild was breaking the channels chop now we were getting close soon i knew we would hear the crash of the surf battering against the rocks and then under the days gray shroud of rain and cloud we would be at sea at our stern the faded red ensign slapped in the gusting wind when it was all over i promised myself and the last questions had earned their horrid answers i would let that ensign go into the deep waters and i would buy another flag to mark a new beginning in the late afternoon as the first shearwaters flighted back from the sea to their nests stormchilds cutwater thumped into the open water that first big cold wave exploded white on stormchilds bows and ran green down her scuppers to port and starboard the massive rollers broke ragged on black rocks under a sullen rain as stormchild like a tiny projectile arrowed straight from the channel into the vast oceans wastes the seas streamed at us in battalion formation row after row of them huge and ponderous each shuddering our boat and making its engine labor and so while jackie took the wheel i hoisted stormchilds sails and immediately the yacht stiffened and when the motor was switched off settled comfortably into the oceans own undying rhythm by dusk it had stopped raining and the far sun was staining the chasms of a ragged cloud bank with a scarlet touch the wind was gusting strong and cold from the south while the endless seas like restless mountains of liquid slate heaved stormchild high as they roared blindly beneath her keel we had left the land far behind way beyond our sight as now alone on a tremendous sea we reached toward the dying sun to find nicole i had learned the genesis transmission schedule from von rellstebs radio operator so i knew on what channel and at what times the genesis four would listen and so at nightfall i went below and turned on stormchilds big radio jackie at the wheel peered anxiously down the companionway as i tuned the radio and at last pressed the transmitter button stormchild calling genesis four this is stormchild calling genesis four over nothing a great wave rolled past stormchilds flank and i heard the sea scouring down the scuppers stormchild calling genesis four this is stormchild calling genesis four over still nothing i sat at the console smelling the pervasive smell of the diesel oil that still reeked in stormchilds saloon carpet stormchild calling genesis four this is stormchild calling genesis four come in please over were the chileans listening was the armada monitoring all the medium and high frequency channels in an effort to find us and intercept us if they thought i was trying to help my daughter evade their countrys justice then the chilean navy might very well have a lean gray patrol vessel somewhere in this wilderness of sea and wind yet i reasoned the armada would surely talk to me on the radio if they had intercepted this transmission and so far neither they nor genesis four had replied perhaps no one was listening i pressed the key again stormchild calling genesis four this is stormchild calling genesis four over we hear you said the voice from the speaker and it said nothing more just those three words we hear you but it was my daughters voice curt and toneless and i stared at the radio as though it had just transmitted the word of god nicole i transmitted in wonderment nicole but there was no reply and i realized that though my daughter might listen to me she had nothing to say in return so be it i closed my eyes pressed the key and spoke i began by saying that i loved her it sounded stilted so i said it again and afterward i told her i knew what she had done not just to her mother but to the crew of the naiad and i said that the evidence of her deeds had been given to her uncle david who was making sure it reached the proper authorities i then explained that the genesis community had ceased to exist its leaders were dead its members were homeless and its settlement was destroyed you can sail back there now and youll find the chilean police and navy waiting for you or you can rendezvous with me and well either go back together or sail to the falklands im not offering you freedom just a choice between british or chilean justice i would also like to meet you and tell you that i still love you even if i hate what youve done my words still sounded lame but the truth so often does limp off the tongue in times of crisis just when we most need to speak with the tongues of angels we stumble with uncertain words im sailing southward now i told nicole and ill clear the cape in six or seven days if you meet me ill escort you to wherever you want to go and ill do my best to find you an honest and good lawyeri pausedand i love you nicole i waited but there was no reply nicole i begged the sky but still no word came back i left the radio switched on and its speaker turned full up as i went back to the cockpit but no voice broke the hissing silence if nicole was going to accept my offer then she was accepting it in silence she said nothing jackie asked only that she could hear me jackie bit her lip then gave me a decisive look ive been thinking about it tim and i know its going to be all right nicole must know shes got nothing to gain by hurting you she knows its over doesnt she yes and shes not a fool tim jackie said passionately she probably wont even look for us i mean the only choice youve offered her is between a british and a chilean jail so shes much more likely to sail west isnt she to try and lose herself in the pacific she might i admitted she very well might but somehow i did not think that nicole would resist this final confrontation and i suddenly wished i had not let jackie share it with me i wished i was not driven to the confrontation myself for by facing my daughter i risked my new happiness in exchange for an old relationship that could never be restored in the early hours of darkness the wind backed into the east a sure sign that it would freshen jackie and i took in two reefs and i was glad we did for within the hour the wind was shrieking in the rigging as we slogged southward on a long port tack every slam of the bows reverberated through the steel hull and rattled the crockery in the galley and shivered the floating compass card in the cockpits binnacle white spray slashed back to spatter on the spray hood i sent jackie below to rest and noted that instead of finding a snug refuge in the forward cabin she took her bag into the aftercabin where my own things were stored yet she must have found it hard to sleep for shortly after midnight she came back on deck the ship was dark as sin for i was sailing without any navigation lights and the stars were cloudshrouded so that the only illumination in our whole world was the tiny unobtrusive red glow of the instrument lights jackie groped her way to my side then snapped her lifeline to the dring at the base of the wheels pedestal as her night vision came she saw the sliding avalanches of white water that rushed beside our gunwales and the sight made her tremble doesnt it frighten you she asked and i realized that this was her first experience of cold galeforce sailing i smiled in the darkness oh lordi quoted her the fishermens ancient prayermy boat is so small and thy sea is so big protect me thats nice she said softly besidesi gave the wheel a twitchyou should be cautiously afraid of the sea a wise old fisherman once said that a man who isnt afraid of the sea will soon be drowned for hell go out on a day when he shouldnt sail but those of us who are afraid of the sea only get drowned every now and again she laughed then was silent for a good long while perhaps the mention of drowning had put the thought of nicole into jackies mind for she suddenly asked just where i thought we would meet nicole if we met her at all i know just where shell met us i said because i had thought this whole rendezvous through and i knew the exact place to which nicole was even now racing in her fast catamaran shell be waiting at the horn the horn jackie echoed the two words and i heard the wonder in her voice as though she could not truly believe that we were really going to that hell of a seaway where the big ships died and where the ghosts of sailormen never rested we were sailing to cape horn there are plenty of terrible seas on earth i would not lightly sail the agulhas current off the african coast again for there the sea shudders in a perpetual rage and its sudden watery chasms can break the steel spines of the hugest vessels i would not willingly sail the north cape again for there the ice storms howl out of a white desert and the rigging freezes and even boats seem to get tired of fighting the savagery of that weather yet neither of those places nor even the storms of the tasman or the shallow hell of a north sea winter storm can rival the bitter fame of cape horn now racing southward with two reefs tied in our mainsail jackie and i were already in the capes feedchute far beyond our eastern horizon the tip of south america bent ever more sharply toward the atlantic thus forming the northern lip of a funnel that compressed and savaged the great pacific waves that had been fetched across fifteen thousand miles of roaring ocean and which were there forced to squeeze themselves into the shallow gap between cape horn and antarctica that gap was the drake passage the coldest roughest and most savage waterway on earth a sober man a prudent man would have taken the straits of magellan but i would round the horn as i had first rounded it eighteen years before back then fighting for a record i had creamed past the horn running west to east and cutting the corner close enough to see the flag flying at the small naval post that the chileans maintained on the isla de hornos my boat had flogged through windlashed spray plunged through the horns steep seas then disappeared northward toward plymouth home and the ephemeral glories of a world record now with jackie i would visit the cape again but this time to save a soul each cold morning i searched the sea for a sign of a strange sail that waited to intercept us but all that week as stormchild neared the horn we sailed alone the wind was cold and unrelenting the seas gargantuan and dark and the horizon empty then at dawn on the seventh day just as i was beginning to believe that nicole had spurned my offer of help i saw off to our south a scrap of something pale against the dark water and hideous black clouds i seized the binoculars and trained them forward but could make out no details of the far off boat yet i knew i had seen a sail which waited to meet us at the very place where stormchild must turn eastward to run the treacherous waters of the drake passage i could not be certain yet but a pursuit that had begun with a photograph in an english sunday newspaper seemed about to end in the biggest seas god makes jackie who had the eyesight of a starving hawk came up from the galley and took the binoculars from me its a catamaran she said after a while then she clung desperately to a stay as a huge sea thundered and foamed under stormchilds counter the seas here were vast carrying an oceans pent up violence into battle against two continents genesis four if the strange catamaran was indeed genesis four sailed northwest to meet us and a half hour after i had first spotted the strange sail i could make out the twin hulls flying across the crests of the waves to spew a double cocks comb of high white spray in her wake the far boat was quick as lightning and as mute as the grave i attempted to talk to the catamaran on the vhf but there was no reply i went back topside and tried to calm the idiot excitement that was fusing my emotions i did not know if i was glad or miserable only that my daughter was close and i felt full of love and forgiveness i wanted to cry but instead i hunched down from the freezing wind and felt stormchilds steel hull tremble nervously in the pounding seas those seas were building as they came to their battlefield the wind was also veering to the west piling up the seas higher and bringing wicked squalls of black rain which when they struck blotted the distant catamaran from our view the wind as well as veering was rising and the glass was falling which meant the weather would probably turn even nastier another reef jackie shouted at me ill drop the main altogether i shouted back for the last few minutes stormchild had been heeling so far over that her port gunwale had been permanently streaming with green water and her boom despite being close hauled had sometimes drawn a gash of white foam in the flanks of leeward waves i should have reefed a half hour before but now i would lose the main entirely and depend on our number three jib to pull us through the drake passage jackie took the wheel while i wearing twin lifelines struggled to kill the big mainsail and it was a struggle for we were suddenly in a place of shortening and steepening seas that made stormchilds motion violently unpredictable i staggered about the deck to gather in the billowing wet canvas spray was being sliced and shredded from the wavetops to mingle with the cold sleety rain that whipped eastward in the rising wind i tamed the cold sail tied it down then fearing the rising malevolence of the seas i bolted the stormplates over the coach roof windows i havent seen the catamaran for twenty minutes jackie shouted when i returned to the cockpit and the strange boat had vanished somewhere in the welter of spray and rain go to i shouted to her i was turning stormchild back to the southeast to the course we had been running when the catamaran first saw us for a second i was tempted to try stormchilds radar but i knew the stormlashed seas would clutter the screen and hide the catamaran among a chaos of confused echoes bounced back from the sharp wavepeaks instead i stared south wondering whether after all nicole and i would now miss each other because of this rising gale that screamed across the sea to make the windward slopes of the waves into maelstroms of foam and broken white water those waves monstrous after their fifteenthousandmile journey were crashing in from our starboard side to give us a roller coaster ride when we were on the wave crests it seemed as though we were surrounded by stinging whips of foam that streamed past our bows and smashed home on our starboard flank and filled the sky with white droplets thick as fog beneath us the troughs sometimes looked like sudden holes in the ocean with streaked glossy sides of darkest green and it seemed inevitable that we would soon topple sideways into one of those great water caverns and there be buried by a collapsing wave but stormchild always slid past them to plunge down the next waves slope she left a quick white wake that broke into creamy bubbles before it was overwhelmed by the gray spill of broken foam from the wave crests in the troughs the winds noise would be noticeably muted but then we would see the next crinkling heaving swelling and overpowering wave coming to assail our starboard flank and it seemed impossible that the tons of water would not break to smash down on our mast and sail and deck but instead we would heave up to the windblown summit from where i would stare anxiously ahead for a glimpse of my daughters boat if indeed it was nicole we had seen and not some other catamaran thrashing up this lonely coast after an hour in which no other sail appeared i decided that the strange sail had indeed been some other ocean voyager and not nicole at all i took the wheel from jackie who eschewing a chance to shelter from the winds cold blast by going below stayed with me in the cockpit i had collapsed the spray hood to save it from being destroyed by the winds fury so that the two of us stared with saltstung eyes into the blinding spray as we searched the mad chaos of wave tops for another sight of the catamaran it seemed to have got much colder and despite the season freezing rain was now mixing with the spindrift i had a towel scarf tight round my neck my oilskin hood was raised and its drawstrings tied but even so trickles of near freezing water were finding their way through the defenses to run chill down my chest jackie must have been similarly afflicted but she made no complaint neither of us spoke and i think we were both so frozen and so tired that we were beginning not to care about the missing boat i even wondered if the strange sail had been an hallucination brought on by the strain of endlessly fighting the cold my muscles were cramped and stiff my thought processes glazed and my corrections to stormchilds helm were sluggish and clumsy jackie shouted something the wind snatched her words away and it took me an immense effort of will to turn my head thus dislodging the temporarily satisfactory arrangement of towel sweaters and oilskins just to stare blankly at her she was gazing forward her mouth open her eyes huge i turned to follow her gaze then swore because like a shark slicing in to attack or like a weapon aimed at our heart the strange catamaran was riding up the southern flank of the wave on which stormchild was poised the catamaran was sailing under a scrap of storm jib and a closereefed main but was still traveling at racing speed she was so close that i could see the pattern of her blue and yellow curtains through her small cabin windows i could even read the name naiad that had been painted over but which still showed as ghost lettering under the hulls pale green paint i gaped at the boat aware of my racing heart then suddenly the catamaran turned north to run past our flank and i saw four figures in her cockpit and i knew that one was my longlost child nicole i waved like a mad thing nicole i shouted and my voice was lost in the appalling sound of wind and sea and rain and flogging sailcloth my god jackie screamed and i suddenly realized that the flogging sound was not sailcloth but bullets that were smacking across our jib i did not move i was staring at the figure who stood at the catamarans wheel and who suddenly pushed back her oilskins hood to reveal her bright corngold hair and blue eyes nicole i shouted as the catamaran its twin wakes spewing quick foam slashed up the waveslope we had just sailed down the wheel spun neglected in my hands so that stormchild bridled jarred sickeningly then fell off the wind as the catamaran finally vanished across the crest behind us my last glimpse was of nicoles figure tall and straight and the name genesis four painted in crude black letters on the catamarans starboard transom jackie pummeled my arm there were two of them firing at us two of them i had not noticed the gunmen only nicole why shoot at us i wondered why i was their best hope in a world that would hate them i was their last chance of love and they wanted to kill me tim jackie shouted at me trying to snap me out of my reverie go below i told her get on the vhf channel tell her weve come to help her tell her i love her i did love her too and suddenly my memory registered that nicole had not just looked at me as her catamaran sliced past stormchild but that she had smiled at me oh god i said the prayer aloud but could not finish it i was shaking i was thinking of nicoles smile it had been one of recognition almost pleasure sweet jesus but what evil was in us i had thought to meet her and to sail with her to where we could talk but my child had no time for remorse or reunion she wanted me dead and i did not know why was it because i had destroyed genesis or was she so steeped in blood that my death meant nothing more to her i did not know i only knew that i was in the worst sea on earth and pursued by madness stormchild was lying on her side shaking and pounding in the seas her head had fallen off the wind and her one sail was dragging her further round so i snatched the wheel back and hardened her up into the wind and sea we were in the foamribbed trough of a wave then as the hull began to move again we labored slowly up the next vast slope and i glanced behind just in time to see the vengeful menace of genesis fours twin prows sharp as lances spear up over the crest behind then drop to slide down the wave in stormchilds wake i heard a popping noise and looked up to see another line of ragged holes rip and tear across stormchilds jib why i wondered then i thought to hell with the why jackie and i would be dead within minutes if i did not do something the catamaran was twice as fast as stormchild and carried twice as many guns it was no good leaning on sentiment now i had to fight back and so i whipped a lashing onto the wheel slithered across the cockpit then yanked up the locker lid to find the gun a bullet clanged off our gunwale and whined up to the clouds i turned worked the rifles bolt aimed at the catamarans closest hull and fired nicole had been overtaking stormchilds starboard flank her boats superior speed gave her the weather gauge and she could choose her angle and come as close as she liked yet suddenly as i returned the fire and worked the rifles bolt to fire again my daughter showed a scrap of good sense and veered her course sharply away from stormchild and my rifle theyre not answering the radio jackie shouted then gave an involuntary scream as a bullet ripped through the coach roof there were two gunmen in the genesis fours cockpit i recognized one of them as dominic nicoles blond lover and he seemed to smile as he opened fire again i heard the sharp crack as his bullets struck our steel hull then i saw a jagged rent splay open in the metal boom above my head another strike of bullets whipped foam from the dark heart of the wave beyond the cockpit i fired back but the leeenfield was a slow clumsy weapon compared with the assault rifles in nicoles boat stormchild her wheel lashed now slashed through the broken crest of another wave the genesis four had gone past us and was now racing far ahead of our slower hull her two gunmen ceased fire and i knew we would have a few moments peace because nicole sailing ahead of us into the shrieking gale would not dare jibe her boat but would instead have to tack the genesis four back into our path i guessed we would not see her for fifteen minutes i went below the cabin was unusually dark because of the stormshields on the windows and in that unnatural gloom i could see three sparks of daylight where bullets had punched through the hull i had a sudden terror that jackie had been hit and whirled round to see her hunched over the radio consoles i shouted her name she did not move then i saw she was wearing earphones so as to hear better through the gales turmoil they wont answer she at last saw me and took off the earphones are you ok she nodded im ok we wont see them for at least ten minutes i promised jackie because even nicole isnt crazy enough to jibe a boat in this bitch of a wind i took the microphone and pressed its transmission button nicole nicole there was silence except for the seas maniacal fury thundering beyond our steel hull stormchild shuddered in a wave slid through a screaming horror of foam then jarred sickeningly into a trough nicole i called nicole for gods sake this is your father im trying to help you nothing emptiness silence i glanced back up the companionway to where the rain slanted down out of a grayblack sky at times as stormchild rolled off a wave i would see a vast cold sea toppling behind us and against it the bombriddled ensign would look shatteringly bright nicole i pleaded into the radio but she was not listening or maybe she was listening but just refusing to talk to me and i knew i had just ten minutes to touch some old nerve of affection in my daughter or else she would come back she would kill us and then she would sail away to take her chances among the far anonymous pacific islands nicole i said to her i love you i love you i love i stopped because a terrible harsh battle percussion was filling stormchild and i twisted aghast to see more holes being punched in the far side of the saloon and i knew that nicole had done the unimaginable she had jibed her boat in this awful gale she was a better sailor than i and she had a crack crew and she had turned her boat in front of this shipkilling wind and she had done it to prove she was a better sailor than i and that was why jackie and i had to die in this awful place suddenly it was all so clear we had to die so that my daughter could prove she was a better sailor than her father a bullet ricocheted into the galley another clanged through the stoves stainlesssteel chimney water pulsed through the bullet holes as stormchild dipped to the wind jackie screamed i ran topside and clipped on my lifeline i worked the rifles bolt but the leeenfield was puny against our enemys automatic fire and stormchilds slow hull was no match for the speed of my daughters twin keels and my seamanship god help me was not a patch on hers at that moment as i watched the slicing hulls come straight at us i knew that nicole was going to kill us she would do it to prove she was the better sailor and so she was i thought as i stared at the approaching boat that flicked so lightly through the spume and sea scum the two gunmen were using the cabin top as a firing step the third crew member was by the sheet winches while nicole bareheaded and happy stood tall at the helm beneath the strange seagreen ensign of genesis nicole did indeed look happy she had taken our measure and now she would win because she was more daring than her father the genesis four was sliding toward us down the face of a wave stormchild was on the opposing face we would meet in the trough once again nicole held the weather advantage but this time throwing caution to the wind she would use it to come so close that her gunmen could not possibly miss they would pour their fire into stormchilds cockpit riddling it with ricocheting bullets to overwhelm our cockpit drains with blood jackie terrified of the clangor of bullets down below had come to crouch beside me she frowned at my gun perhaps wondering why i did not fire it but i knew the rifle would not help me now genesis four seemed to leap through the water eager to bring us our death i laid the gun down in the cockpit and smiled at jackie hold tight i told her for i had chosen to outdare my daughter i stood up straight not caring about the gunmens bullets and i stared at my daughter if i did not beat her now then jackie would die and i would die and stormchild would sink to join the legions of cape horns dead hold on i shouted to jackie and with fingers numbed by the cold i unlashed stormchilds wheel christ but the catamaran was close jackie held my arm and i could feel her shaking and shivering and no wonder for the catamaran was scarcely forty yards away now nicole braced at its wheel was aiming to slide her starboard hull just inches from our starboard gunwale and at that range despite the jarring of the seas pounding genesiss last gunmen could not miss nicole doubtless expected me to turn away and run downwind and when i did she would follow i could see her winchhandler poised to loosen the jib sheets and i knew that the moment i turned to run the catamaran would pounce on us like a striking snake and then we would die and nicole would take her chance for freedom in some far warm sea but there was another way and i chose it i dropped the wheels lashing and when genesis four was just twenty yards away i spun the spokes to drive stormchilds tons of steel straight at the speeding catamaran i saw nicoles eyes widen in alarm she shouted in anger and snatched at the wheel to turn away but she was too late the two gunmen clutched for support at a handrail on the cabin roof and one of their two guns skidded into the scuppers and bounced overboard then i was shouting at jackie to hold on for her dear sweet life someone screamed i think it was my daughter because she knew i had beaten her stormchild slammed into the turning catamaran we smashed her starboard hull breaking it into splinters of fiberglass a wire stay whipped skyward the catamarans mainsail was suddenly demented filling a noisy sky with its maniacal thrashing then inevitably the genesis fours mast began to topple i saw dominic whirl round face bloody as the catamarans severed backstay whipped its frayed metal strands across his eyes the mast was cracking and falling and still stormchild was driving into the catamarans belly like a great killing axe i heard the tortured screech of steel on steel as our sharp bows slammed into the main beam that spanned the catamarans twin hulls i staggered with the impact while jackie her fingers hooked like claws clung to my arm stormchilds forestay snapped slashing our jib into the shipkilling wind a sea thundered across our joined decks sweeping gear off genesis fours scuppers and filling stormchilds cockpit with a crashing icy whirlpool our bows churned sickeningly in the wreckage of the catamaran i was sobbing for my daughter for what i had done the great sea turned us broadside thrusting our stern eastward our bows were trapped by the catamarans broken hulls i threw off stormchilds jib sheet as the two boats screeched on each other but our boat was afloat and the genesis four was breaking apart already the catamarans cockpit was awash and her starboard hull under water a blue and yellow curtain floated free of the shattered saloon stormchilds mast was swaying horribly but her backstays and shrouds were holding it upright and the damage would have to wait lifebuoys i shouted at jackie i could see two yellowjacketed bodies clinging to the catamarans wreckage and i could see a third person in the foamscummed water beyond i could not see nicole the catamarans mast had collapsed to trail the reefed mainsail and a tangle of lines in the foaming sea nicole i shouted then hurled a life buoy into the wreckage i slashed with my knife at the bindings of stormchilds life raft and jackie helped me push the big canister overboard another thunderous sea crashed cold across the two boats and when it had passed i saw that the two men who had been clinging to the wreckage were gone i pulled the life rafts lanyard and watched as the bright orange raft began to inflate another toppling sea hammered like an avalanche at our beam stormchilds tortured bows were still buried in the genesis four but the lurch and twist of the awful sea loosened and prized us free then the gale snatched at our jib which still writhed at the end of its halyard and which now turned us fast downwind i sliced through the line which tethered the life raft to stormchild thus leaving the bright orange raft for my daughter engine i shouted at jackie then i hurled the last buoy overboard and slapped my lifeline onto a jackstay to work my way forward jackie turned on the ignition and above the throb of our automatic bilge pumps that were dealing with the water let in by the bullet holes i heard the harsh banging as the starter motor turned over a wave broke on our counter swamping the cockpit and crashing white down the companionway the engine would not start and the wind and sea were carrying us so fast that already the wreck of the genesis four was hidden by a spumefretted wave crest jackie advanced the throttle turned the key again and this time the motor caught and throbbed she let in the clutch then staggered to the wheel to turn stormchild back toward the wreckage but a great sea heaped and windwhipped slammed us back and almost threw us on our beam ends jackie sensibly let the boat run while i terrified that our mast would be lost sawed with my rigging knife at the jib halyard the cut halyard snaked up through the masthead block to release the jib that sailed away like a demonically winged monster the forestay was streaming ahead of us carried almost horizontal by the force of the rising gale which now leeched the ocean white and bent stormchilds tall mast like a longbow i unhanded the mainsails halyard took some bends off the cleat carried the halyard forward and shackled it to the foreplate then i went back to the mast and winched the halyard tight so that i had juryrigged a new forestay in harbor that simple process might have taken three minutes but in that insane sea it took closer to half an hour just to shackle the halyard to the foreplate took immense concentration as the sea tried to snatch me off the foredeck and over the collisionbent bars of the pulpit the wind screamed and plucked at me but at last the halyard was secure and the mast safely stayed and i could crawl back to the cockpit to discover that the wind and sea had taken us yet further from the wreckage of genesis four which was now totally lost in the white hell of sleet and waves behind us i throttled the engine to full brutal power and cursing the bitch of a sea that fought us i thrust stormchild straight into the throat of cape horns malevolence it took us an hour to find the wreckage of genesis four and even then we discovered nothing but scraps an oar that still had the name naiad burnt into its blade a plastic bottle a sail bag a broken pencil we found stormchilds life raft but there was no one inside we circled the pathetic wreckage enduring the shrieking wind and the flogging seas and the demonic rain but though we found lumps of foam torn from the catamarans hulls and though we found our life buoy we could not find nicole or any of nicoles crew my daughter was gone she was drowned she was gone to the cleansing sea and it had been i who had killed her and it was i who now wept for her as a small child nicole had been graceful she had grown up willful but joanna and i had been proud of her we had loved her and we had thought that our old age would be blessed by her but then her brother had been killed by terrorists and nicole as if to even the score had become a terrorist herself her cause was different from the cause of those men who had murdered her brother but her evil was the same and now she was dead at last i turned stormchild away from nicoles killing place a new black squall of sleet and rain clawed across the broken water to overtake and drive us eastward i set the storm jib on the staysail halyard and then we ran the shattering seas of the horn in a full gale that blew us through the night so that it was full darkness when we struck the first atlantic waves and turned our scarred and battered bows north toward the falklands jackie shared the night watch huddled beside me in the cockpit not talking but just watching the skirl and rush of the seething waters and in the dawn as the tired wind calmed we saw that the sea was weeping much later months later when stormchild was tied fore and aft in a warm lagoon jackie asked me what we had achieved in that storm off cape horn she asked the question on a night when our mooring lines led to bending palm trees that were silhouetted against the stars of a lambent tropical sky we were alone and patagonia seemed a long way off indeed so far away that we rarely talked of it but that night under the indolent stars jackies thoughts strayed back to nicole and to genesis and in an idle voice she asked me just what we had achieved we were good environmentalists i assured her we cleaned up some pollution for the genesis community was indeed gone though it was hardly forgotten for its misdeeds and its subsequent destruction had made headlines round the world jackies account of the settlements harrowing was never published she had written and rewritten the story and in despair of ever capturing the truth she had torn up version after version until she had finally abandoned her efforts and allowed herself to read the story of the genesis community in the words of other men and women those other journalists had desperately sought jackie and me but we had escaped their questions and thus the fate of nicole and of her crew remained a mystery to the press though the consensus was that they had simply drowned when genesis four foundered off the horn a few of the more vivid tabloids insisted that nicole still sailed the murderous seaways and any mysterious happening anywhere in the oceans renewed the speculation that genesis four still floated but the responsible press had long abandoned its search for my daughter even the chilean government which for a time had made threatening noises about my disappearance now seemed content to put the whole episode behind them molly tetterman had taken most of the genesis communitys survivors back to their families in north america where molly became something of a celebrity as the battling mother who had rescued her child from the grasp of evil she wrote to us of her frequent appearances on television talkshows and even said that a network wanted to make a miniseries about her adventures we wrote back wishing her luck but heard nothing more of the project david wrote to us with news of the boatyard of the church and of his hopes that his brief brush with fame might help his chances of a comfortable bishopric betty wanted to know when jackie and i would be married soon i wrote back to them soon there seemed to be no hurry jackie and i drifted through warm seas lazy and happy now jackie leaned against me in stormchilds cockpit beyond our private coral reef the warm waves broke their sound a quiet murmur of pleasure in the darkness i sipped whiskey jackie had refused a similar nightcap indeed she had even shaken her head to my offer of wine with the dinner i had cooked at twilight upon which refusal i had accused her of returning to her teetotaling ways she denied it so i had inquired whether this was some new and ghastly selfinflicted dietary prohibition but she had just smiled tolerantly at my question now in the placid caribbean night she reached up to touch my cheek tim she asked very solemnly jackie i answered just as solemnly do you know why i didnt drink today because youre an american i declaimed and therefore believe death to be optional or else its because youve just read one of those earnest health articles in a vegetarian magazine which claims that drinking nineyearold cotes du rhone gives you terminal zits and unsightly hemorrhoids or perhaps youre going to become unbelievably boring and tell me that alcohol is a drug and that each of us has a societal responsibility to shut up jackie said very firmly shut up i shut up she took my hand and kissed it youre going to be a father again she said softly and i leaned my head on stormchilds rails and let my tears dissolve the stars
