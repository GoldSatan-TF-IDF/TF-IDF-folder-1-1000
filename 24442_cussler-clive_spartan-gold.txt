ltd and last but far far from least janet for her hints and insights prologue grand st bernard pass pennine alps may agust of wind whipped snow around the legs of the horse known as styrie and he snorted nervously sidestepping on the trail before the rider clicked his tongue a few times calming him napoleon bonaparte emperor of the french pulled up the collar of his greatcoat and squinted his eyes against the sleet to the east he could just make out the jagged sixteenthousandfoot outline of mont blanc he leaned forward in his saddle and stroked styries neck youve seen worse old friend an arabian napoleon had captured during his egyptian campaign two years earlier styrie was a superb warhorse but the cold and snow disagreed with his disposition born and bred in the desert styrie was accustomed to being peppered by sand not ice napoleon turned and signaled to his valet constant who stood ten feet behind holding a string of mules and behind him trailing for miles down the winding trail were the forty thousand soldiers of napoleons reserve army along with their horses mules and caissons constant untied the lead mule and hurried forward napoleon handed over styries reins then dismounted and stretched his legs in the kneedeep snow lets give him a rest napoleon said i think that shoe is bothering him again ill see to it general at home napoleon preferred the title of first consul while on campaign general he took in a lungful of air settled his blue bicorne more firmly on his head and gazed up the granite spires towering above them lovely day isnt it constant if you say so general the valet grumbled napoleon smiled to himself constant whod been with him for many years was one of the few underlings he allowed a small measure of sarcasm after all he thought constant was an old man the cold went right through his bones napoleon bonaparte was of medium height with a strong neck and broad shoulders his aquiline nose sat above a firm mouth and a square chin and his eyes were a piercing gray that seemed to dissect everything around him human and otherwise any word from laurent he asked constant no general général de division or majorgeneral arnaud laurent one of napoleons most trusted commanders and closest friends had the day before led a squad of soldiers deeper into the pass on a scouting mission however unlikely they were to encounter an enemy here napoleon had long ago learned to prepare for the impossible too many great men had been toppled by the mere act of assumption here though their worst enemies were the weather and terrain at eight thousand feet the grand st bernard pass had for centuries been a crossroads for travelers straddling the borders of swit zerland italy and france the passs home the pennine alps had seen its share of armies the gauls in bc on their way to trample rome hannibals famous elephant crossing in bc charlemagne in ad returning from his coronation in rome as the first holy roman emperor laudable company napoleon thought to himself even one of his predecessors pepin the short king of france had in crossed the pennines on his way to meet pope stephen ii but where other kings have failed in greatness i will not napoleon reminded himself his empire would grow beyond the wildest dreams of those whod come before him nothing would stand in his way not armies not weather not mountainsand certainly not some upstart austrians a year earlier while he and his army were conquering egypt the austrians had brashly retaken the italian territory annexed to france in the campo formio treaty their victory would be shortlived they would neither expect an attack this early in the year nor would they imagine any army attempting to cross the pennines in winter with good reason with its towering walls of rock and snaking gorges the pennines were a geographic nightmare for solitary travelers let alone an army of forty thousand since september the pass had seen thirty feet of snow and temperatures that routinely dipped below zero drifts standing as tall as ten men loomed over them at every turn threatening to bury them and their horses even on the sunniest of days fog cloaked the ground until midafternoon windstorms frequently arose without warning turning a calm day into a howling nightmare of snow and ice that left them unable to see a yard in front of their feet most terrifying of all were the avalanchescataracts of snow sometimes a half mile wide that roared down the mountainsides to entomb anyone unlucky enough to be in their way so far god had seen fit to spare all but two hundred of napoleons men he turned to constant the quartermasters report here general the valet pulled a sheaf of papers from inside his coat and handed it to napoleon who scanned the figures truly an army fought on its stomach so far his men had consumed bottles of wine a ton of cheese and pounds of meat ahead down the pass there came a shout from the outriders laurent laurent at last napoleon murmured a group of twelve riders emerged from the blowing snow they were strong soldiers the best he had just like their commander not a one rode hunched over but all were erect chins held high majorgeneral laurent trotted his horse to a stop before napoleon saluted then dismounted napoleon embraced him then stepped back and gestured to constant who hurried forward and handed laurent a bottle of brandy laurent took a gulp then another then handed the bottle back napoleon said report old friend we covered eight miles sir no sign of enemy forces the weather improves at the lower elevations as does the depth of the snow it will only get easier from here good very good one note of interest laurent said placing his hand on napoleons elbow and steering him a few feet away we found something general and would you care to elaborate on the nature of this something it would be better if you saw it for yourself napoleon studied laurents face there was a glint of barely contained anticipation in his eyes hed known laurent since they were both sixteen serving as lieutenants in the la fère artillery laurent was prone to neither exaggeration nor excitability whatever hed found it was significant how far napoleon asked four hours ride napoleon scanned the sky it was already midafternoon over the peaks he could see a line of dark clouds a storm was coming very well he said clapping laurent on the shoulder well leave at first light as was his custom napoleon slept five hours rising at six am well before dawn he had breakfast then read the overnight dispatches from his demibrigade commanders over a pot of bitter black tea laurent arrived with his squad shortly before seven and they set out down the valley following the trail laurent had broken the day before the previous nights storm had dumped little new snow but fierce winds had piled up fresh driftstowering white walls that formed a canyon around napoleon and his riders the horses breath steamed in the air and with every step powder billowed high in the air napoleon gave styrie his head trusting the arabian to navigate the path while he stared fascinated at the drifts their facades carved into swirls and spirals by the wind a bit eerie eh general laurent asked its quiet napoleon murmured ive never heard quiet like this before it is beautiful laurent agreed and dangerous like a battlefield napoleon thought except for perhaps in his bed with josephine he felt more at home on a battlefield than anywhere else the roar of the cannons the crack of musket fire the tang of black powder in the air he loved all of it and in a matter of days he thought once were out of these damned mountains he smiled to himself ahead the lead rider raised a closed fist above his head signaling a halt napoleon watched the man dismount and trudge forward through the thighdeep snow his head tilted backward as he scanned the drift walls he disappeared around a curve in the trail whats he looking for napoleon asked dawn is one of the worst times for avalanches laurent replied overnight the winds harden the top layer of snow into a shell while the powder underneath remains soft when the sun hits the shell it starts to melt often the only warning we have is the soundlike god himself roaring from the heavens after a few minutes the lead rider reappeared on the trail he gave laurent the allclear signal then mounted his horse and continued on they rode for two more hours following the snaking course of the valley as it descended toward the foothills soon they entered a narrow canyon of jagged gray granite interlaced with ice the lead rider signaled another halt and dismounted laurent did the same followed by napoleon napoleon looked around here his majorgeneral smiled mischievously here general laurent unhooked a pair of oil lanterns from his saddle if youll follow me they set off down the trail passing the six horses ahead of them the riders standing at attention for their general napoleon nodded solemnly at each soldier in turn until he reached the head of the column where he and laurent stopped a few minutes passed and then a soldierthe lead riderappeared around a rock outcropping to their left and plodded back through the snow toward them laurent said general you might remember sergeant pelletier of course napoleon replied im at your disposal pelletier lead on pelletier saluted grabbed a coil of rope from his saddle then stepped off the trail following the path hed just carved through the chesthigh drifts he led them up the slope to the base of a granite wall where he turned parallel and walked another fifty yards before stopping at a rightangle niche in the rock lovely spot laurent what am i looking at napoleon asked laurent nodded to pelletier who raised his musket high above his head and slammed the butt into the rock instead of the crack of wood on stone napoleon heard the shattering of ice pelletier struck four more times until a vertical gash appeared in the face it measured two feet wide and almost six feet high napoleon peered inside but could see nothing but darkness as far as we can tell laurent said in the summer the entrance is choked with brush and vines in the winter snowdrifts cover it up i suspect theres a source of moisture somewhere inside which accounts for the thin curtain of ice it probably forms every night interesting and who found it i did general replied pelletier wed stopped to rest the horses and i needed to well i had the urge to i understand sergeant please go on well i suppose i wandered a bit too far general when i finished i leaned against the rock to collect myself and the ice gave way behind me i went a little ways inside and didnt think much of it until i saw the well ill let you see it for yourself general napoleon turned to laurent youve been inside yes general myself and sergeant pelletier no one else very well laurent i will follow you the caves entrance continued for another twenty feet narrowing as it went until they were walking hunched over suddenly the tunnel opened up and napoleon found himself standing in a cavern having entered ahead of him laurent and pelletier stepped aside to let him through then raised their lanterns shining the flickering yellow light on the walls measuring roughly fifty by sixty feet the cavern was an ice palace the walls and floor coated in it several feet thick in some places in others so thin napoleon could see a faint shadow of gray rock beneath glittering stalactites hung from the ceilings so low they merged with the floors stalagmites to form hourglassshaped ice sculptures unlike the walls and floor the ice on the ceiling was roughened reflecting the lantern light like a starfilled sky from somewhere deeper in the cave came the sound of dripping water and more distant still the faint whistling of wind magnificent napoleon murmured heres what pelletier found just inside the entrance laurent said moving toward the wall napoleon walked over to where laurent was shining his lantern on an object on the floor it was a shield roughly five feet tall two feet wide and shaped like a figure it was made of wicker and covered in leather painted with faded red and black interlocking squares its ancient napoleon murmured at least two thousand years is my guess laurent said my history isnt what it used to be but i believe its called a gerron it was used by persian light infantry soldiers mon dieu theres more general this way winding his way through the forest of stalactite columns laurent led him to the rear of the cavern and another tunnel entrance this one a rough oval four feet tall behind them pelletier had dropped the coil of rope and was knotting one end around the base of a column under the glow of the lantern going down are we napoleon asked into the pits of hell not today general laurent answered across laurent aimed his lantern into the tunnel a few feet inside was an ice bridge not quite two feet wide stretching across a crevasse before disappearing into another tunnel youve been across napoleon asked its quite sturdy its rock beneath the ice still you cant be too safe he secured the line first around napoleons waist then his own pelletier gave the knotted end a final tug and nodded to laurent who said watch your footing general then stepped into the tunnel napoleon waited a few moments then followed they began inching their way across the crevasse at the halfway point napoleon looked over the side and saw nothing but blackness the translucent blue ice walls sloping into nowhere at last they reached the opposite side they followed the next tunnel which zigzagged for twenty feet into another ice cavern this one smaller than the first but with a high arched ceiling lantern held before him laurent walked to the center of the cavern and stopped beside what looked like a pair of icecovered stalagmites each one was twelve feet high and truncated at the top napoleon stepped closer to one then stopped he narrowed his eyes it wasnt a stalagmite he realized but a solid column of ice he placed his palm against it and leaned his face closer staring back at him was the golden face of a woman chapter great pocomoke swamp maryland present day sam fargo rose from his crouch and glanced over at his wife who stood up to her waist in oozing black mud her bright yellow chest waders complemented her lustrous auburn hair she sensed his gaze turned to him pursed her lips and blew a wisp of hair from her cheek and just what are you smiling at fargo she asked when shed first donned the waders hed made the mistake of suggesting she looked like the gortons fisherman which had earned him a withering stare hed hastily added sexy to the description but to little effect you he now replied you look beautifullongstreet when remi was annoyed at him she called him by his last name he always responded in kind with her maiden name she held up her arms coated to the elbows in slime then said with a barely concealed smile youre crazy my face is covered in mosquito bites and my hair is flatter than paper she scratched her chin leaving behind a dollop of mud it simply adds to your charm liar despite the look of disgust on her face sam knew remi was a trouper without peer once she set her mind on a goal no amount of discomfort would dissuade her well she said i have to admit you do look rather dashing yourself sam tipped his tattered panama hat at her then went back to work scooping mud from around a length of submerged wood he hoped was part of a chest for the past three days theyd been plodding through the swamp searching for that one clue that might prove they werent on a wildgoose chase neither of them minded a good goose chasein treasure hunting it came with the turfbut it was always better to catch the goose in the end in this case the goose in question was based on an obscure legend while the nearby chesapeake and delaware bays were said to be home of nearly four thousand shipwrecks the prize sam and remi were after was land based a month earlier ted frobisher a fellow treasure hunter whod retired not long ago to concentrate on his antique shop in princess anne had sent them a brooch with an intriguing provenance the pearshaped gold and jade brooch was said to have belonged to a local woman named henrietta bronson one of the first victims of the notorious outlaw martha patty aka lucretia cannon according to legend martha cannon was a tough ruthless woman who in the s not only stalked the wilds of the delawaremaryland border with her gang robbing and murdering the wealthy and poor alike but who also ran a hostel in what was then called johnsons corners today reliance cannon would lure travelers into her establishment and feed entertain and tuck them in to bed before murdering them in the middle of the night she would drag the bodies into the basement take anything of value then stack them in the corner like cordwood until shed accumulated enough to warrant a wagon trip to a nearby forest where she would bury them en masse horrific as that was cannon would later commit what many considered her most heinous crimes cannon established what many local historians had dubbed a reverse underground railroad kidnapping freed southern slaves and keeping them bound and gagged in the inns many secret rooms and its makeshift earthen dungeon before sneaking them in the dark of the night to cannons ferry where they would be sold and loaded onto ships headed down the nanticoke river bound for georgias slave markets in while plowing a field on one of cannons farms a worker uncovered several partially decomposed bodies cannon was speedily indicted on four counts of murder found guilty and sentenced to prison four years later she died in her cell by what most agreed was suicide by arsenic in subsequent years both cannons crimes and her ultimate demise grew in myth ranging from the claim that cannon had escaped from prison and went on murdering and robbing far into her nineties to tales that have her ghost still roaming the delmarva peninsula waylaying unsuspecting hikers what few people disputed was that cannons lootof which shed reportedly spent only a fractionhad never been recovered estimates put the treasures presentday value somewhere between and sam and remi had of course heard the legend of patty cannons treasure but lacking solid leads theyd consigned it to the someday file with the emergence of henrietta bronsons brooch and an exact datum with which to begin their search theyd decided to tackle the mystery after a detailed study of the pocomokes historical topography and mapping cannons alleged hideouts in comparison to where the brooch had been found theyd narrowed their search grid to a twosquaremile area most of which lay deep within the swamp a labyrinth of mossdraped cypress trees and brushchoked bogs according to their research this area which in the s had been dry ground had been home to one of cannons hideouts a tumbledown shack their interest in cannons treasure had nothing to do with the moneyat least not for their own benefit upon first hearing the story sam and remi agreed if they were ever lucky enough to find the treasure the bulk of the proceeds would go to the national underground railroad freedom center in cincinnati ohio an irony they felt sure would outrage cannon if she were still alive or if they were lucky it would outrage her ghost remi what was that poem the one about cannon sam called remi had a nearphotographic memory for details both obscure and pertinent she thought for a moment then recited hush your mouth go to sleep old patty ridenour take you back deep got a gang of seven taking slave and free riding day and night on her coalblack steed thats it sam replied around them the exposed roots of the cypress trees jutted from the water like disembodied talons of some great winged dinosaur the previous week a storm had blown across the peninsula leaving behind mounds of branches like hastily constructed beaver dams overhead the canopy was alive with a symphony of squawks and buzzes and fluttering wings occasionally sam a parttime birdwatcher would isolate a trilling and announce the birds name to remi who would humor him with a smile and a thats very nice sam found the exercise helped his by ear piano playing something hed picked up from his mother for her part remi had a nice touch with the violin which she put to good use during their frequent impromptu duets despite his engineering background sam was an intuitive rightbrain thinker while remi a boston collegetrained anthropologist historian was firmly grounded in logical leftbrain thinking while the dichotomy made them a balanced loving pair it also led to vigorous debates ranging in topic from what had started the english reformation to which actor made the best james bond to how to best play vivaldis concerto summer most often the debates ended in laughter and an ongoing but goodnatured disagreement bent at the waist sam probed underwater with his fingers sliding along the wood until he touched something metal something with a ushaped hasp and a square body a padlock he thought visions of an ancient barnacleencrusted hasp swirling through his mind got something he announced remi turned toward him muddy arms hanging by her sides hah sam pulled it from the water as the mud slid off and plopped back into the water he saw the glint of rust and silver then some raised letters master lock well remi said her voice tinged with skepticism she was used to sams sometimes premature excitement ive found my dear a vintage master padlock circa he replied then hefted from the water the piece of wood it had been attached to along with what looks like an old gatepost he dropped it back into the water and then straightened up with a groan remi smiled at him my intrepid treasure hunter well its more than ive found sam looked at his watch a timex expedition he wore only on expeditions six oclock he said shall we call it a day remi ran her cupped hand down her opposite forearm shedding a layer of goop and gave him a broad smile thought youd never ask they gathered their packs and hiked the half mile back to their skiff which theyd tied to a grounded cypress stump sam cast off and pushed the boat into deeper water wading up to his waist while remi yanked the engines starter cord the motor growled to life and sam climbed in she turned the bow into the channel and throttled up the nearest town and their base of operations was snow hill three miles up the pocomoke river the bb theyd chosen had a surprisingly decent wine cellar and a crab bisque that had put remi in culinary heaven at the previous nights supper they motored along in silence lulled by the soft gurgle of the motor and gazing at the overhanging canopy suddenly sam turned in his seat looking to the right remi slow down she throttled back what is it he grabbed a pair of binoculars from his pack and raised them to his eyes fifty yards away on the bank there was a gap in the foliageanother hidden inlet among the dozens theyd already seen the entrance was partially blocked by a tangle of branches piled up by the storm what do you see she asked something i dont know he muttered i thought i saw a line in the foliage a curve or something didnt look natural can you get me over there she turned the rudder and aimed the skiff at the mouth of the inlet sam are you hallucinating did you drink enough water today he nodded his attention fixed on the inlet more than enough with a soft crunch the skiffs nose bumped into the mound of branches the inlet was wider than it looked nearly fifty feet across sam looped the bow line around one of the larger limbs then slipped his legs over the gunwale and rolled into the water sam whatre you doing ill be right back stay here like hell before she could say more sam took a breath ducked underwater and disappeared twenty seconds later remi heard a splash on the other side of the branches followed by sam sucking in a lungful of air she called sam are you im fine be back in a minute one minute turned into two then three finally sam called through the foliage remi can you join me please she could hear the mischievous lilt in his voice and thought oh boy she loved her husbands adventurous impulses but shed already started imagining how good a hot shower was going to feel what is it she asked i need you to come here sam i just now started to dry off cant you no youre going to want to see this trust me remi sighed then slipped over the side into the water ten seconds later she was treading water beside him the trees on either side of the inlet formed an almost solid canopy over the water enclosing them in a tunnel of green here and there sunlight stippled the algaefilmed surface hi nice of you to come he said with a grin and a peck on her cheek okay smartypants what are we he rapped his knuckles against the misshapen log he had his arm draped over but instead of a dull thud she heard a metallic gong what is that not sure yet part of itcant be sure what part until i get down there and get inside part of what get inside what this way come on taking her by the hand sam sidestroked deeper into the inlet and around a corner where the course narrowed to twenty feet he stopped and pointed to a vinecovered cypress trunk near the bank there you see it she squinted tilted her head left then right no what am i looking for that branch sticking out of the water the one that ends in a t shape okay i see it look harder squint it helps she did narrowing her eyes until slowly what she was seeing registered on her brain she gasped good lord is that a it cant be grinning from ear to ear sam nodded yep it is that my dear is a submarines periscope chapter sevastopol ukraine hadeon bondaruk stood at the floortoceiling windows of his study and stared out at the black sea his study was dark lit only by dimmed ceiling lights that cast soft pools into the corners of the room night had fallen over the crimean peninsula but to the west over the romanian and bulgarian coasts backlit by the last remnants of the setting sun he could see a line of storm clouds moving north over the water every few seconds the clouds would pulse from within shooting veins of lightning across the horizon it would be here within the hour and god help those foolish enough to be caught afloat in the midst of a black sea storm or bondaruk thought god not help them no matter storms and disease and yes even war were natures way of culling the herd he had little patience for people who didnt have the sense or strength to protect themselves against the violence of life it was a lesson hed learned as a boy and one that hed never forgotten bondaruk had been born in in a village south of ashgabat turkmenistan high in the kopet dag mountains his mother and father and their parents before them had been farmers and shepherds living in that gray geographic area between iran and what was then the soviet union and like all natives of the kopet dag they were tough selfreliant and fiercely independent claiming neither country as their own however the cold war had other plans for bondaruk and his family with the iranian revolution of and the deposition of the shah the soviet union began to pour more troops into the border area north of iran and bondaruk then nineteen saw his villages independence stripped away as red army bases and antiaircraft missile sites began cropping up in their once peaceful mountain home the soviet troops treated the kopet dag natives like backward savages moving through villages like a scourge taking food and women shooting livestock for sport and rounding up iranian revolutionary elements for summary execution never mind that bondaruk and his people knew little of the outside world and world politics their muslim religion and proximity to iran made them suspect a year later a pair of tanks appeared on the outskirts of the village along with two companies of red army soldiers a squad of soldiers had been ambushed nearby the night before the commander told bondaruk and the villagers eight men their throats slit and their clothes weapons and personal belongings stripped from them the village elders had five minutes to produce those responsible lest the entire community be held responsible bondaruk had heard stories about turkmen resistance fighters in the countryside being aided by iranian commandos but to his knowledge none of the villagers were involved unable to produce the guilty parties the village chieftain pleaded with the soviet commander for mercy and was shot for his trouble over the next hour the tanks rained shells down on the village until it was in ruins and burning in the commotion bondaruk was separated from his family and he and a handful of boys and men retreated higher into the mountains far enough away to be safe from the soldiers but close enough that they could watch through the night as their home was razed to the ground the next day they returned to the village and began looking for survivors more dead than alive were found including bondaruks family who had taken shelter in the mosque only to have it collapse and crush them alive something inside him changed as though god had pulled a dark curtain on his old life he gathered up the strongest and most eager villagers men and women alike and they all took to the mountains as partisans within six months bondaruk had risen not only to a position of leadership among his fighters but also to that of a legend among the rural turkmen people bondaruks fighters would strike in the night ambushing soviet patrols and convoys then disappear back into the kopet dag like ghosts within a year of his villages destruction bondaruk had a bounty on his head hed come to the attention of the soviet leadership in moscow which was now embroiled in not only a tense standoff with iran and a fullblown war in afghanistan but also a guerrilla conflict in turkmenistan shortly after his twentyfirst birthday bondaruk received word that iranian intelligence operatives had put out the word that his kopet dag fighters had an ally in tehran if only he would sit down and listen which he did in a small café outside ashgabat the man bondaruk met turned out to be a colonel in the elite iranian paramilitary organization known as the pasdaran or the guardians of the revolution the colonel offered bondaruk and his fighters weapons ammunition training and essential supplies for his war against the soviets wary bondaruk had probed for a loophole in the dealthat one condition that would simply change the heel on their necks from that of the soviets to the iranians there was no condition he was assured we are of common ancestry and faith and cause what more of a bond did they need bondaruk accepted the offer and over the next five years bondaruk and his fighters under the guidance of the iranian colonel slowly wore down the soviet occupiers as satisfying as that was for bondaruk it was his relationship with the colonel that had the most effect on him the colonel it seemed had been a teacher of persian history before hed been called to serve the revolution the persian empire he explained stretched back nearly three thousand years and at its height had encompassed the caspian and black sea basins greece north africa and much of the middle east in fact bondaruk was told xerxes i xerxes the great who had invaded greece and crushed the spartans at the battle of thermopylae was born in the very same mountains bondaruk called home and was said to have fathered dozens of children in the kopet dag this was a thought that was never far from bondaruks mind as he and his guerrillas continued to harass the soviets until finally in over a decade after theyd entered the kopet dag the red army withdrew from the border shortly after that the soviet union collapsed with the fight over and no inclination to go back to being an ordinary shepherd bondaruk aided by his iranian colonel friend moved to sevastopol which had with the collapse of the soviet empire become the wild west of the black sea basin once there his natural leadership ability and comfort with brutality and swift violence secured him a place first in the ukrainian black market and then in the ukrainian krasnaya mafiya or red mafia by the time he was thirtyfive hadeon bondaruk was in control of virtually every organized criminal enterprise in ukraine and a millionaire many times over with his position and power and wealth secure bondaruk turned his attention to an idea that had been lingering in the back of his mind for many years had xerxes the great truly been born and raised in the kopet dag mountains in his very homeland had he and xerxes as boys separated by centuries walked the same paths and marveled at the same mountain vistas could he himself be descended from persian royalty the answer did not come easily taking five years millions of dollars and a dedicated staff of historians archaeologists and genealogists but by the time he turned forty hadeon bondaruk was sure of it he was in fact a direct blood descendant of xerxes i ruler of the persian achaemenid empire from there bondaruks curiosity quickly grew into an obsession with everything persian he used the full force of his wealth and influence to assemble a collection of persian artifacts from the drinking cup used at the wedding celebration of cyaxares to a stone dais used for zoroastrian rituals during the sassanid dynasty to the jewelencrusted gerron shield carried by xerxes himself at thermopylae and his collection was nearly complete save one glaring omission he reminded himself his personal museum which lay in the bowels of his mansion was a marvel he shared with no one partially because no one was worthy of its glory but mostly because it was not yet complete yet he now thought soon he would remedy the issue as if on cue the door to his study opened and his valet entered pardon me sir bondaruk turned what is it a call for you mr arkhipov send it through the valet left gently closing the door behind him a few moments later the phone on bondaruks desk trilled he picked it up tell me you are calling me with good news grigoriy i am sir according to my sources the man runs an antique shop in the area the website where he posted the picture is a wellestablished forum for antique dealers and treasure hunters and has anyone shown any interest in the shard some but nothing serious so far the consensus is that its simply a broken piece of bottle nothing more good where are you new york waiting to board my flight at this bondaruk smiled always taking the initiative i like that its why you pay me the russian answered and if you manage to secure this piece therell be a bonus in it for you how do you plan to approach the man this antique dealer the russian paused for a moment and bondaruk could almost see that familiar cruel smile curling arkhipovs lips i find the direct approach is always best dont you arkhipov knew about directness and results bondaruk thought the former russian spetsnaz was smart ruthless and relentless in his twelve years in bondaruks employ arkhipov had never failed in a mission no matter how dirty i do bondaruk replied ill leave you to it then just take care that youre discreet i always am which was true many many of bondaruks enemies had as far as the authorities could determine simply vanished from the face of the earth call me as soon as you have word i will bondaruk was about to hang up when another question popped into his head just out of curiosity grigoriy where is this mans shop anywhere close to where wed predicted very close a small town called princess anne chapter snow hill maryland sam fargo stood at the bottom of the stairs leaning against the banister legs crossed at the ankles and arms folded across his chest remi was running late as usual having decided at the last minute her black donna karan dress was going to be a bit much for the restaurant and returned to their room to change clothes sam checked his watch again he wasnt so much worried about their reservation as he was about his empty belly which had been grumbling loudly ever since theyd gotten back to the bb the lobby of the hostel was quaint almost to a fault done in americana shabby chic and decorated with landscape watercolors done by local artists a fire crackled in the fireplace and over hidden loudspeakers came the faint strains of celtic folk music sam heard the stairs creak once and looked up in time to see remi coming down the stairs in a pair of cream ralph lauren trousers a cashmere mock turtleneck and a russetcolored shawl draped over her shoulders her auburn hair was up in a loose ponytail a few strands touching her delicate neck im sorry have i made us late she asked taking his offered arm as she reached the bottom of the stairs sam stared at her for a few seconds without replying then cleared his throat looking at you i fear time has come to a standstill oh shut up the squeeze on sams biceps belied her words and told him that corny line or not his compliment had been appreciated are we walking or driving she asked well walk its a beautiful night plus you run less risk of another ticket on the way into town sam had let their rented bmw have a bit too much head much to the annoyance of the local sheriff whod been trying to eat his bologna sandwich lunch behind a roadside billboard that too sam agreed there was a slight spring chill in the air but not enough to be uncomfortable and from the bushes along the sidewalk came the croaking of frogs the restaurant a locally owned italian affair complete with a greenandwhitecheckered awning was only two blocks away and it took only five minutes once they were seated they took a few minutes to peruse the wine list settling on a bordeaux from the french region of barsac so remi said how sure are you about this you mean about the youknowwhat sam whispered conspir atorially i think you can say the word sam i doubt anyone cares he smiled the submarine im pretty sure well have to get down there of course but i cant imagine its anything else but whats it doing here all the way upriver thats the mystery well have to solve wont we and what about patty cannon she can wait a couple days well id the sub put selma and the others onto unraveling the mystery then get back to our sociopathic murderous slave runner remi gave it a few moments thought then shrugged why not life is short selma wondrash was the drill sergeantlike head of sam and remis threeperson research team back in san diego selma was widowed having lost her husband an air force test pilot in a crash ten years earlier theyd met in budapest in the early nineties she a university student he a fighter jock on leave despite having lived in the united states for fifteen years selma had never entirely lost her accent after finishing her degree at georgetown and becoming a citizen she went to work for the library of congresss special collections directorate until sam and remi lured her away more than a research chief selma had proved herself a superb travel agent and logistics guru getting them to and from destinations with military efficiency while sam and remi loved the research aspect of their field selma and her team were rabid about it living for that buried fact that elusive lead that unsolvable riddle that always seemed to crop up in the course of a job more times than they could count selma and her team had kept an investigation from going far astray of course job wasnt quite the right word for what sam and remi did for them it wasnt about a paycheck but rather the adventure and the satisfaction of seeing the fargo foundation flourish the foundation which split its gifting between animal protection nature conservancy and underprivileged and abused children had grown in leaps and bounds over the last decade the previous year donating almost five million dollars to a variety of organizations a hefty part of that money had come from sam and remi personally and the rest of it from private donations for better or worse their exploits attracted a fair amount of media attention which in turn attracted wealthy highprofile donors the fact that sam and remi got to do what they loved was a boon neither of them took for granted having both worked hard to reach this place in their life remis father now retired had been a private contractor whod built custom summer homes along the new england coast her mother a pediatrician with a series of bestselling childrearing books following in her fathers footsteps remi had attended his alma mater boston college emerging with a masters in anthropology and history with a focus on ancient trade routes sams father whod died a few years earlier had been one of the lead engineers on nasas mercury gemini and apollo programs and rarebook collector a love affair hed passed on to sam at an early age sams mother eunice lived in key west where despite being almost seventy she ran a charter boat specializing in snorkel ing and deepsea fishing like remi sam had followed in his fathers footsteps if not in his choice of education then in his vocation earning a summa cum laude engineering degree from caltech along with a handful of trophies for lacrosse and soccer while in his final months of study at caltech sam was approached by a man he would later find out was from darpa the defense advanced research projects agency where the government developed and tested the latest and greatest toys for both the military and intelligence communities the offered salary had been far below what he could have earned in the civilian world but the lure of pure creative engineering combined with serving his country made sams choice an easy one after seven years at darpa sam retired with the vague notion of bringing some of his own wild ideas to reality and moved back to california it was there two weeks later that sam and remi met at the lighthouse a jazz club on hermosa beach sam had wandered into the club for a cold beer and remi was there celebrating a successful research trip looking into rumors of a sunken spanish ship off abalone cove though neither of them had ever called their first meeting a case of love at first sight theyd both agreed it had certainly been a case of pretty damned sure at first hour six months later they were married where theyd first met in a small ceremony at the lighthouse at remis encouragement sam dove headfirst into his own business and they struck pay dirt within a year with an argon laser scanner that could detect and identify at a distance mixed metals and alloys from gold and silver to platinum and palladium treasure hunters universities corporations and mining outfits scrambled to license sams invention and within two years the fargo group was seeing an annual net profit of three million dollars and within four years the deeppocketed corporations came calling sam and remi took the highest bid sold the company for enough money to see themselves comfortably through the rest of their lives and never looked back i did a little research while you were in the shower sam said from what i can gather i think we may have a real find on our hands the waiter came deposited a basket of warm ciabatta and a saucer of pasolivo olive oil and then took their orders to start they ordered calamari with red sauce and porcini mushrooms for entrées sam selected a seafood pasta with pestosautéed bay scallops and lobster while remi chose a stuffed shrimpandcrab ravioli in basil white cream sauce what do you mean remi asked isnt a submarine a submarine good lord woman bite your tongue sam said feigning shock where remis forte was anthropology and ancient history sam loved world war ii history another passion hed inherited from his father whod been a marine during the united states islandhopping campaign in the pacific the fact that remi had little interest in who exactly sank the bismarck or why the battle of the bulge was so important was something that never ceased to amaze sam remi was an anthropologist and historian without peer but she tended to take an analytical approach to things while for sam history had always been stories about real people doing real things remi dissected sam dreamed apologies for the gaffe remi said forgiven heres the thing given the size of the inlet theres no way it can be a fullsized submarine plus that periscope looked way too small a mini sub then right but there was a lot of growth on the periscope a few decades worth at least and one more thing as far as i know commercial subsfor surveys or mapping or whateverdont have periscopes so its military remi said has to be so a military mini submarine twentysome miles up the pocomoke r iver remi murmured okay i admit it you got me im officially intrigued sam smiled back at her thats my girl so what do you say after dinner we drive over to princess anne and see what ted has to say hes forgotten more legends about this area than most people will ever know if anyone might have some hunches about what this thing is its going to be him i dont know its getting late and you know how ted hates visitors ted frobisher for all his genius and wellhidden softheartedness wasnt exactly peopleoriented his shop thrived not on his interpersonal skills but on his breadth of knowledge and business acumen sam said smiling a little surprise will do him good chapter after dessert a tiramisu so good it left them temporarily speechless they walked back to the bb grabbed the bmws keys from the room and set off for princess anne heading northwest up highway to the outskirts of salisbury before turning southwest onto highway the evenings earlier clear skies had given way to low rain clouds and a fine steady mist fell on the bmws windshield remi frowned it feels like youre going too fast she enjoyed the bmw but not the latent racecardriver urge it brought out in her husband dead on the speed limit dont worry remi have i ever crashed well there was that time in mumbai oh no if youll recall the tires were almost bald and we were being chased by a very angry man in a very big dump truck plus i didnt crash i just got sidetracked thats one way of putting it an accurate description id say okay then there was the time in scotland okay that was my fault dont feel bad sam that peat bog did jump right in front of us out of nowhere very funny you got us out of it though and thats what counts and he did using a short coil of rope the car jack a stump and a branch for leverage and some wellapplied basic physics they drove in silence watching the darkened countryside slide by until finally the lights of princess anne appeared a half mile down the road named after the daughter of king george ii the townor hamlet as many locals demanded it be calledboasted a population of souls not counting the students who called university of maryland eastern shore their home during their first trip here years ago sam and remi had agreed if not for the cars on the streets and the electric lighting it would take little effort to imagine youd been transported back to marylands prerevolutionary days so quaint were parts of the hamlet of princess anne sam took highway into the middle of town then turned east onto mount vernon road which he followed for a mile before turning north onto east ridge road they were now on the outskirts of princess anne frobishers shop whose second floor served as his apartment was set a quarter mile back from the road down a long driveway bordered by maple trees as sam reached the turnin a black buick lucerne sedan pulled out of the driveway and passed them heading south to mount vernon road as the bmws lights washed over the passing cars windshield sam caught a glimpse of ted frobisher sitting in the passenger seat that was him remi said yeah i know sam muttered distantly what is it dont know something about his face didnt seem right whatre you talking about he looked scared ted frobisher always looks scared or annoyed those are his only two expressions you know that yeah maybe sam muttered swinging the bmw into a precise yturn backing into the driveway then heading after the lucerne oh boy remi said here we go just humor me probably nothing fine but if they pull into an ihop promise me youll turn around and leave the poor man alone deal the lucerne did not pull into an ihop nor did it stay on the main road for very long turning south onto black road after only a few miles the streetlights had long since disappeared leaving sam and remi driving in pitch blackness the earlier drizzle had turned to a steady rain and the bmws windshield wipers beat out a rhythmic squeaking thump hows your night vision sam asked her good why in response sam turned off the bmws headlights and accelerated closing the distance to the lucernes taillights remi looked at her husband her eyes narrowed youre really worried arent you he nodded jaw clenched just a feeling hope im wrong me too youre scaring me a little sam he reached over and gave her thigh a squeeze now have i ever gotten us into trouble well there was the time without getting us back out again no do we have a signal he asked remi pulled out her cell phone and checked the reception nothing damn we still have that map remi rummaged through the glove compartment found the map and opened it after thirty seconds she said sam theres nothing out here no houses no farmsnothing for miles curiouser and curiouser ahead the lucernes brake lights flashed once then again then turned right and disappeared behind some trees sam pulled up to the turn and slowed just in time to see the lucernes taillights turn again this time left into a driveway about a hundred yards down the road he turned off the engine and rolled down the passenger window through the trees they could see the lucernes headlights go out followed by the sound of a car door opening then closing followed ten seconds later by another then a voice hey dont frobishers voice clearly agitated well that settles it sam said yep remi said what do you want to do you drive to the nearest house or wherever you can get reception and call the police im going to oh no youre not sam remi please i said no sam sam groaned remi were wasting time sam knew his wife well enough to recognize the tone in her voice and the set of her mouth shed planted her feet and that was that okay he said but no stupid chances okay that goes for you too he grinned at her and winked am i anything but the epitome of caution then dont answer that in for a penny remi started in for trouble sam finished chapter headlights still off sam slowly steered the bmw up the road trying to avoid potholes until they were within fifty yards of the driveway then shut off the engine sam said will you please wait in the car remi frowned at him hi it seems we havent met she stuck out her hand for him to shake im remi fargo sam sighed point taken they had a brief strategywhatifworsecasescenario talk then sam gave her his sport coat and they climbed out they stepped off the road into the drainage ditch which was shielded by high grass on either side it ran up to the driveway where it was funneled into a culvert hunched over pausing every few steps to listen they followed the ditch to the driveway then climbed up the bank and began picking their way through the trees after twenty feet the trees began to thin out and they found themselves at the edge of a clearing the space was immense perhaps two square acres filled with hulking tubular shapes some the size of garages some the size of compact cars lying at angles like a childs set of pickup sticks as sams eyes adjusted to the darkness he realized what he was seeing a boiler junkyard how and why it was here in the middle of the maryland countryside he didnt know but here it was judging from their size he guessed the boilers had come from a variety of sourceslocomotives ships and factories the falling rain pattered the leaves around them and pinged softly on the steel of the boilers sending echoes through the trees well this is the last thing i was expecting to find here remi whispered me too and this told them something about teds assailant either he knew this area well or hed done some homework before coming here neither thought gave sam much comfort the buick lucerne was parked in the middle of the clearing but there was no sign of either frobisher or the cars driver clearly theyd gone deeper into this maze of boilers but why come here sam wondered the first answer that came to mind chilled him what teds abductor had planned for him was unknown but one thing seemed certain the man wanted privacy or a place to leave a body or both sam felt his heartbeat quicken we can cover more ground if we split up remi suggested forget it we dont know who this guy is or what hes capable of he was about to step out from the trees when an idea formed in his head a buick lucerne buick gmc he pulled remi back into cover and said wait here be right back what just stay put im not going far he took one last look around watching for the slightest movement then seeing nothing dashed out and headed for the lucerne he reached the driversside door crouched down then said a quick prayer and tried the door handle it clicked open the dome light popped on he clicked the door shut again damn at least there was no keys in the ignition chime nothing to do but risk it sam opened the door slid inside shut the door behind him then waited for thirty seconds occasionally peeking over the dashboard nothing was moving he began looking around the cars interior and found what he was looking for almost immediately set into a panel on the dashboard was a button labeled onstar sam pushed it twenty seconds passed then a voice came over the radio speakers this is dennis at onstar how may i assist you uh yeah sam grunted ive been in a crash im hurt i need help sir do you know your location uh no stand by sir five seconds passed all right sir i have your location near black road west of princess anne in maryland yeah that sounds right ive alerted the dispatcher in your area help is on the way how long sam croaked doing his best injureddriver impression six to seven minutes sir ill stay with you but sam was already moving slipping back out of the car and shutting the door behind him using his pocketknife he punched a hole in the left rear tires valve stem he then crawled around to the opposite side repeated the process on the other tire then sprinted back to the trees and rejoined remi onstar remi asked with a smile sam kissed her on the cheek great minds how long until the cavalry arrives six seven minutes itd be great if we were gone before then im not in a questionandanswer mood me neither im in a warm brandy mood ready for a little hideandseek lead on they had little hope of following any footprints in the mud so he and remi dashed across the clearing and began picking their way through the paths and tunnels formed by the boiler graveyard sam found two pieces of rebar and gave the shorter one to remi and kept the longer one for himself theyd gotten only fifty feet or so when they heard a faint voice through the falling rain i dont know what youre talking about what piece it was ted a male voice said something in return but neither sam nor remi could make out the words that thing it was a piece of a bottle nothing important sam turned his head trying to catch the sound and narrow in on where it was coming from using hand gestures sam pointed ahead and to the left under an arch formed by a boiler that had half collapsed against its neighbor she nodded once they were through the arch the voices became more distinct i want you to tell me exactly where you found it the unidentified man was saying the voice was accented either eastern european or russian i told you i dont remember it was somewhere on the river the pocomoke river right ted replied where why are you doing this i dont understand what there was a slapping sound something hard striking flesh ted grunted followed by a splash as he obviously fell over in a mud puddle get up i cant i said get up sam signaled for remi to wait as he crept ahead pressed himself against the wall of the boiler then slid ahead until he could see around the curve there in a space between a pair of pickup trucksized boilers was ted frobisher he was on his knees arms bound behind his back his assailant stood a few feet in front of him a flashlight in his left hand a revolver in his right he was pointing the gun at teds chest tell me where you found it and ill take you home the man said you can forget all about this theres a lie if ever ive heard one sam thought whoever this man was he hadnt brought ted all the way out here only to take him back home and tuck him safely into bed so sorry about all this have a nice night whether or not the man got what hed wanted teds fate was sealed unless they acted quickly sam thought for a few seconds and formulated a rudimentary plan he would have preferred a more elegant solution but they had neither the time nor the resources for that besides simple was often the most elegant he slid back along the boiler and returned to where remi was waiting he sketched out the scene he had witnessed then his plan sounds like youre getting the most dangerous part remi said i have absolute confidence in your aim and my timing that too ill be right back sam disappeared into the trees for half a minute then returned and handed her a rock about the size of a grapefruit think you can climb that onehanded he asked nodding at the rusty maintenance ladder rising up the side of the nearest boiler if you hear a big thump in the dark youll have your answer she leaned forward curled her fist around his shirtfront and drew him in for a quick kiss listen fargo try to look harmless and for gods sake be careful if you get killed ill never forgive you that makes two of us sam hefted his piece of rebar and took off at a half sprint heading back the way he came then veered right and began circling around he stopped to check his watch six minutes had passed since his onstar call he couldnt wait any longer he tucked the rebar into the waistband at his back then took a calming breath and started walking until he came around a boiler and the pool of light from the flashlight appeared in the darkness sam stopped and called out hey there howdy is everything okay the stranger whipped around shining his flashlight in sams eyes who are you i was just driving by sam said i saw the car thought maybe somebody broke down hey how about not shining that in my eyes in the distance came the faint sound of sirens gun raised the man spun back to ted then back to sam whoa fella whats the gun for sam raised his hands and took a careful step forward dont move stay right there hey im just trying to help breath held sam took another step forward closing the gap to fifteen feet be ready remi he raised his voice to make sure he could be heard over the rain and said if you want me to leave no problem remi took her cue and to his right sam saw a shadow arcing out of the dark sky from atop the boiler the stone seemed to hang for an impossibly long time then landed with a sickening crunch on the mans right foot remis aim was deadon though a head shot would have made things much easier it would have also likely killed the man a complication they didnt need even as the man groaned and stumbled backward sam was moving drawing the rebar from his waistband with his left hand as he charged ahead arms windmilling the man was trying to regain his balance and had almost succeeded when sams perfectly timed uppercut caught him squarely in the chin the gun and flashlight flew up and away the former landing with a plop in the mud the latter rolling toward ted from the corner of his eye sam saw remi appear behind ted she lifted him to his feet and together they started running the stranger was lying on his back half sunken in the mud groaning tough customer sam thought that uppercut should have solidly shut off his lights sam switched the rebar to his right hand the sirens were coming closer now not two minutes away sam picked up the flashlight and cast it around until he spotted the mans pistol half buried in the mud a few feet away using the tip of his shoe sam pried it free slipped the top of his foot beneath it and kicked it far into the trees he turned back and shined the light into the mans face the man stopped moving eyes squinting against the glare his face was lean and weathered and he had small mean eyes and a nose that had clearly been broken many times over the white line of a scar ran from the bridge of his nose across his right eyebrow and ended just above his temple not just tough sam now thought but cruel too the eyes told him that much sam said dont suppose youd care to tell me who you are or why youre here would you the man blinked rapidly clearing away the cobwebs then focused on sam and spat out a word russian sam thought though his russian was passable for tourist purposes he didnt recognize the word still it was a safe bet it had something to do with either his mother some form of carnal knowledge or both that had a distinctly unfriendly sound to it sam said lets try this one more time who are you and whats your business with our friend another curse this one a full sentence didnt think so sam said well better luck next time pal with that he leaned forward and swung the rebar in a tight arc tapping the man behind the ear with what he hoped was just enough force rebar wasnt the most delicate of weapons the man grunted and went limp heres hoping we never meet again sam said then turned and started running chapter here ted drink this sam said handing frobisher a snifter of warm brandy what is it frobisher grumbled surprising neither sam nor remi teds adventure in the boiler graveyard had done nothing to improve his disposition then again ted wouldnt be ted if he were sunny just drink it remi said and gave his hand a pat frobisher took a gulp scrunched up his face then took a second gulp sam put another log on the fire then joined remi on the love seat frobisher sat opposite them in a wingback chair wrapped in a flannel blanket and fresh from a hot shower after leaving frobishers mystery man lying in the mud sam had sprinted back to the bmw which remi had turned around and pulled up to the driveway his decision to leave before the police had been an instinctive one though theyd done nothing wrong being embroiled in a police investigation would also entangle them with frobishers attacker sams gut told him the more distance they put between themselves and the man the better with sam back in the car theyd sped back down black road then headed west on mount vernon road thirty seconds later they saw flashing lights come around the corner behind them and pull onto black road at sams direction remi did a quick uturn pulled over to the shoulder and doused the headlights waiting until the emergency respondersa police cruiser and a fire truck it appearedreached the boiler graveyard she then pulled out and headed back toward princess anne forty minutes later they were back in their room at the bb how do you feel sam asked frobisher how do you think i feel ive been kidnapped and assaulted frobisher was in his mid sixties and bald save a monks fringe of silver he wore a pair of ben franklin halfglasses behind them his eyes were a pale watery blue other than being wet and cold and shaken up the only leftover from his ordeal was a badly bruised and swollen right cheek where the man had pistolwhipped him kidnapped and assaulted is better than kidnapped assaulted and killed sam observed i suppose he replied then grumbled something under his breath what was that ted i said thanks for rescuing me i bet that hurt to say remi replied you have no idea but i mean it thanks both of you he drained the last of his brandy then held out the snifter for more remi obliged so what happened sam asked i was dead asleep and i woke up to someone pounding on my door i asked who it was through the door and he said stan johnston from down the road he said cindyhis wifewas sick and their phone wasnt working is there a stan johnston sam asked of course theres a stan johnston the next farmhouse to the north this meant something sam knew judging from the attackers accent it seemed reasonable to assume he wasnt a local which meant hed planned out his raid of teds house going as far as finding out the names of his neighbors for use in his ploy during his time at darpa sam had had enough interaction with case officers from the cias clandestine service to know how they thought and how they worked everything frobishers attacker had done screamed professional but a professional for whom and to what end so you opened the door remi prompted frobisher so i opened the door and he rushes in pushes me to the floor and shoves that gun in my face he starts asking questions shouting at me about some shard of glass it was nothing the punt from a wine bottle he wanted to know where it was so i told him he tied up my hands with some kind of tape then went into the shop rummaged aroundbroke god knows what in the processthen came back with the piece and started asking where id found it where did you find it i dont remember exactly i really dont it was on the pocomoke somewhere south of snow hill i was fishing and you fish sam asked surprised since when since forever you idiot what you think i just sit around the shop all day fondling plates and doodads as i was saying i was fishing and i snagged something it was a boot an old leather boot the shard was inside it you still have the boot what am i a garbage man no i threw it back it was an old rotted boot sam sam raised his hands palms out in a calming gesture okay okay go on he started shouting questions at you and then the phone rang that was me he asked if i was expecting anyone and i said yes thinking he would leave he didnt he dragged me to the car and drove me out to that place whatever it was thats it the rest you know he had it on him sam muttered i shouldve searched him how many times do i have to say this sam the piece was nothing there was no label no writingjust some kind of weird symbol what kind of symbol i dont remember theres a picture on my website i posted it thinking someone might know what it was remi do you mind sam asked she was already up retrieving their laptop which she set on the coffee table and powered up thirty seconds later she said here is this it ted she turned the laptop for him to see he squinted at the screen then nodded yep thats it see its nothing sam scooted closer to remi and looked at the picture as described it looked like the concave bottom or punt of a green wine bottle in the center of the punt was the symbol remi zoomed in until they could make it out sam said that doesnt look even remotely familiar you no remi replied and this doesnt mean anything to you ted no i already told you no strange phone calls or emails about it no one showed any curiosity frobisher groaned no no and no when can i go home im tired sam said ted i dont think thats a good idea what why he knows where you live ah he was just some nut probably high on something its just a piece of wine bottle for gods sake and he has it its over i doubt it sam thought and neither did he think the man was a nut or a druggie for whatever reason someone felt this punt this odd piece of green glass was very important important enough to kill for fortyfive miles away grigoriy arkhipov lay unmoving beneath the lowhanging branches of a tree his face covered in mud eyes tracking the movements of the somerset county sheriffs deputy as the towtruck driver finished hooking up the lucerne in some primitive part of his brain arkhipov wanted to move to act but he quashed the urge and concentrated on remaining still it would have been so easynot to mention satisfyingto take the deputy and the towtruck driver by surprise dispatch them then take one of their vehicles and disappear into the night but he knew that would cause him more trouble than the pleasure was worth a murdered police officer would bring down a manhunt including roadblocks random stops and even perhaps the fbi none of which would help him on his mission hed been awoken from the blow to his head by the glare of white light and the nearby warbling of sirens and had opened his eyes to find himself staring into a pair of headlights hed stayed still certain hed see figures running toward him but when no one came he slowly rolled onto his belly and started crawling away behind the boilers and into the trees where he now lay dont move he commanded himself he would stay here stay invisible and wait for them to leave the rental car had been secured with a false drivers license and a sanitized credit card neither of which would lead the police anywhere the rain had turned the junkyard into a morass so there were no signs of a struggle to pique the polices curiosity at this point all they had was an abandoned car and what they would likely decide was a prank onstar call from some teenagers now that had been a clever trick arkhipov thought as was their ambush of him humiliating yes but the professional in arkhipov appreciated the ingenuity of the thing the sheer nerve of it his foot throbbed with pain but he didnt dare check it until he was alone the mud had absorbed part of the stones impact but his two smallest toes were probably broken painful but not debilitating hed experienced much worse in the spetsnaz a broken bone rarely even warranted medical treatment and afghanistan the mujahideen were savage fighters who liked nothing better than to kill up close and personal facetoface and knifetoknife and he had the scars to remind him pain grigoriy arkhipov knew was a simple matter a thing of the mind and nothing more so who were they he wondered these mysterious rescuers not your average good samaritans that much was certain their actions showed skill and courage and resourcefulness friends of frobishers the man had said it had been a fleeting slip of the tongue that arkhipov was only too happy to exploit it would be enough he would find themhopefully before he had to report this incident to his employer clearly they had close ties with the antique dealer why would they risk their lives otherwise so two plus two equals four if frobisher didnt want to cooperate and tell him where hed found the shard perhaps this other man and woman would be more accommodating and if not well he would simply settle the score and move on ingenious as theyd been in their ambush of him he felt it only fair he find an equally novel way of repaying them chapter pocomoke river what do you think the chances are ted will stay away remi asked giving the outboard motors starter cord a tug sam climbed into the skiffs bow and pushed off the dock with his leg i think i got through to him but with ted you never know that shop is his life after questioning frobisher for another half hour the night before and satisfying themselves theyd gotten the whole story sam had ordered a cot from the reception desk and put ted who was by then more than a little tipsy from three servings of brandy to bed the next morning after breakfast theyd convinced him to take a vacation then made some calls and found a beach house on fenwick island that belonged to a friend of a friend of a friend it was unlikely anyone would trace frobisher to there whether ted would stay there they didnt know but short of tying him up it was the best they could do the question for them was whether to get any further involved par for his personality and his solidly libertarian ideals ted had dismissed their suggestion that he get the authorities involved he had little love or use for the government and asserted the police would simply take a report and file it away which sam and remi tended to agree with they doubted teds abductor had left enough of a trail to follow while they mulled it all over sam had decided theyd continue with their original plan of identifying the mini sub trapped in the inlet then return to their search for patty cannons treasure remi got the engine started then brought the skiff about and pointed the nose downriver the engine puttering softly in the cool morning air what a difference a day can make she said staring up at the sky amen sam replied the previous nights rain had stopped just before dawn giving way to a bright blue sky dotted with cottonpuff clouds along the riverbanks birds chirped and flitted from branch to branch the surface of the water cloaked in a thin mist was flat save a ripple here and there as a fish popped to the surface to catch an unwary fly or water bug say remi said have i already mentioned how proud i am of you for what finding us those croissants this morning no you dummy for last night you were downright heroic yes you mentioned it thanks dont forget though i had some fantastic help couldnt have done it without you remi shrugged and smiled at the compliment you looked rather sexy you know all covered with mud and carrying that rebar around very cavemanish ughugh remi laughed sorry about your sweater by the way her cashmere turtleneck hadnt survived the previous nights adventure having taken on the distinct and irreversible odor of wet goat its just a sweater its replaceablewhich isnt true of everything remi said with an affectionate smile dont i know it sam said i assume youve taken steps to make sure it doesnt happen again hadeon bondaruk asked arkhipov clenched the phone tighter against his ear until his knuckles turned white yes three of my best men are here now im guessing they have an hours head start on us what are their names bondaruk asked as arkhipov had predicted finding the identities of frobishers rescuers had been a relatively easy task after the deputy and the towtruck driver had left arkhipov had half jogged half limped up the road to the nearest farmhouse where he found an old chevy truck parked behind the barn with the keys in it he drove back to frobishers shop and parked the truck behind the garage then went inside and turned the house upside down finding what he needed in ten minutes frobisher had only a few dozen names in his rolodex half of them businesses the other half personal and of these only eight were couples a quick google search gave him what he needed from frobishers house to the princess anne greyhound station was a short fiveminute drive the truck he parked on a side street and the license plates he stuffed into a nearby trash can under some coffee grounds and a bucket of kfc chicken bones twenty minutes later hed recovered his backpack from the rental locker and was checked in to a nearby motel under a different drivers license and credit card sam and remi fargo arkhipov now told bondaruk theyre i know who they are treasure hunters and good ones at that damn this is a bad sign their being there cant be a coincidence clearly frobisher figured out what he had and called them in im not convinced of that ive interrogated a lot of men in my time and i know what lying looks like frobisher was telling the truth im certain of it you might be right but assume he was lying assume the fargos are after the same thing we are and act accordingly yes sir how soon do you leave the boats ready now armed with the fargos names and particulars it had been simple work to track their credit card purchases to the boat rental shop in snow hill it wont take long to catch up to them sam had carefully marked the inlets position on the map so they found it with little trouble the previous nights rain had piled up even more branches at the mouth of the inlet it now looked like a hunting blind a patchwork of crisscrossing branches and leaves both dead and stillgreen alike remi steered the skiff alongside the pile then tied the painter line to one of the sturdier branches they let the boat drift until the painter line was taut and sam was sure it would hold then remi slipped into the water and onto the bank sam swam around to the side handed up to her the two duffel bags containing their gear then accepted her hand and climbed onto the bank himself with a duffel bag over each shoulder sam led the way through the tall grass and shrubbery along the bank veering inland twenty feet until they reached the edge of the inlet to their left through the undergrowth they could just make out the branch pile and the rivers main channel beyond it as it had the day before the inlet had an eerie quality to it a tunnel of green that felt somehow separated from the rest of the world of course sam conceded part of that feeling probably had something to do with the algaedraped periscope jutting from the water only a few feet in front of them like the neck of some primordial sea serpent a little spooky isnt it remi whispered crossing her arms as though warding off a chill more than a little sam agreed then dropped the duffel bags and rubbed his hands together in anticipation never fear the fargos are here just promise me one thing remi said name it after this a vacation a real vacation the destination is all yours mrs fargo the first order of business was to get down there and determine the general condition of the submarine look for any markings they might use to identify it and hopefully find an entrance this last goal sam hadnt yet shared with remi knowing she would forbid his entering the wreck which was admittedly the prudent course but sam was confident that between his diving skills and remis reliability theyd have no trouble handling anything that came up to that end theyd brought along a dive mask a pair of truncated swim fins waterproof flashlights with extra batteries four coils of nylon towinggrade rope and three ratchet blocks to secure the sub in position lest it slip during sams inspection if they even got that far additionally the day before hed asked selma to fedex him a trio of spair air emergency pony tanks each of which contained enough air for roughly sixty breaths or two to five minutes i know that look on your face fargo remi said you want to go inside dont you only if its safe trust me remi i got my adrenaline fix last night im not going to take any stupid chances okay sam slid down the bank into the water then stroked over to where the periscope rose from the water he grabbed ahold of it gave it a tug and several shakes it seemed solid remi tossed him two ends of rope both of which he secured around the periscope remi took the other ends secured each of them to a ratchet block then each of those to nearby trees sam climbed back out and together they cranked the ratchets until the lines were taut sam gave each one a tug its not going anywhere okay im going to have a quick look around three minutes no more do you want me to shhh sam whispered a finger to his lips he turned his head listening five seconds passed and then faintly in the distance came the sound of a boat engine coming this way he said just fishermen probably but after last night one thing that had been nagging at sam was the proximity of their submarine to where ted had said hed found the punt shard it was unlikely the two were connected but not so unlikely that teds assailant might choose to search this area of the pocomoke he crouched beside one of the duffel bags rummaged around and came up with a pair of binoculars with remi on his heels he ran back along the bank to where theyd tied off the skiff they dropped to their knees in the high grass and sam aimed the binoculars upriver a few seconds later a powerboat appeared around the bend of the river it contained four men one at the wheel one on the bow and two sitting on the afterdeck sam zoomed in on the drivers face scarface its him he muttered youve got to be kidding remi replied i wish i was chapter the skiff sam rasped softly come on he slid belly first down the bank and into the water a quarter mile upstream scarface had turned the powerboat into the mouth of another inlet which the man in the bow was scanning through a pair of binoculars sam heard scarfaces voice echo over the water followed by another voice saying nyet great more russian heavies sam stroked over to where hed secured the skiffs painter line quickly undid the knot then swam back and grabbed the bow cleat he glanced over his shoulder scarface was bringing the powerboat about and turning their way sam i see them he wrapped the painter around one fist then accepted remis help up the bank pull he whispered pull hard together they heaved on the painter the skiffs bow bumped against the bank then began inching up the slope the powerboat was three hundred yards away the mens attention seemed focused on the opposite shore but sam knew that could change at any second one stray glance and they were finished pull remi again they heaved back on the painter sam spread his legs and dug his heels into the soil pulling until the tendons in his neck bulged the skiffs nose appeared over the lip of the bank but now free of the water and subject to gravity the electric motor began fighting them the skiff slipped backward a foot one more good pull sam said on three one two three the skiff arced up and over the lip and slid onto level ground in lockstep sam and remi backpedaled dragging the skiff deeper into the grass down sam remi dropped to her belly followed a split second later by sam they went still tried to slow their breathing think we made it remi whispered well know shortly if things go bad i want you to run as fast as you can head for the forest and dont look back no sam shhh the powerboats engine was growing louder by the second seemingly headed straight for their spot then scarfaces voice anything nothing what are they in anyway a skiff about twelve feet long cant be on this side the voice said theres nothing here got to be the other one plenty of side channels to hide in there yeah the engine noise began moving off fading across the water until sam and remi could only hear its distant echo theyve moved into another channel sam said rising to his knees and peeking over the top of the grass yep dont see them theyre gone remi rolled onto her back and let out a sigh thank god sam lay down beside her she laid her head onto his shoulder what do you say he asked stay or go she didnt hesitate weve come this far be a shame to leave the mystery unsolved thats the woman i love sam said what reckless and misguided no courageous and determined remi sang softly you say potayto i say potahto come on back to work sam spit into his mask dipped it into the water then settled it onto his head remi stood on the bank arms on her hips face etched with worry just going to have a look around he assured her ill save the air in case we can get inside this wont happen but if it shifts in my direction while im down there just start working those ratchet blocks until it tips back if i dont come up within say four to six hours you can start worrying comedian hold the fort ill be back sam clicked on his flashlight took a deep breath and ducked beneath the surface left hand extended he finned downward within only a few feet the algaefilled water turned a deep green and visibility dropped to only a few feet sediment and bits of plant life swirled in the flashlights beam leaving sam feeling like he was trapped inside a nightmarish snow globe his hand touched something solid the hull he kept going letting his hand trail over the curve of the hull until finally the bottom appeared in his flashlight beam the keel was perched atop a jumble of sunken logs precariously balanced but stable enough that sam felt a flood of relief knowing the sub wasnt likely to roll over on him he felt the ache in his lungs turn into a burning so he finned for the surface everything okay remi asked once hed caught his breath yep good news shes sitting upright more or less okay going again he ducked back under this time estimating the hulls diameter as he skimmed past it at the keel he turned aft at about the midpoint he encountered a bracket of some sort jutting from the hull and running lengthwise for a moment what he was seeing didnt register on his brain hed seen this before one of the pictures from his earlier research when the answer came sam felt a knot form in his belly torpedo rack he stopped swimming and cast the flashlight along the bottom seeing it with new eyes was one of those seemingly harmless sunken logs something else altogether he kept swimming aft until his flashlight picked out the tapered cigar end of the sub and jutting from its side a horizontal plane when he drew even with it he righted himself and let himself rise alongside the hull until the last piece of the puzzle came into view rising from the back of the hull was another tube about eighteen inches tall and about shoulderwidth in diameter entry hatch sam popped back up to the surface and stroked over to the bank where remi helped him out he shed his fins and mask and took a moment to gather his thoughts well she said theres a manila folder in one of the duffels could you grab it for me she was back with it in half a minute sam flipped back and forth through the loose pages for a couple minutes then plucked one of the sheets out and handed it to remi molch she read what in gods name her words trailed off as she kept reading sam said molch means salamander it was a class of midget torpedo submarine produced by nazi germany in built for the kriegsmarine by a g weser a company in bremen the molch was the brainchild of dr heinrich drager measuring thirtyfive feet long three feet from deck to keel and six feet from beam to beam the molch was designed to carry one crew member and two ge torpedoes on port and starboard racks to depths of feet and distances up to fifty nautical miles at a maximum submerged speed of three knots a moderate walking pace as an offensive weapon the molch like most of germanys other midget subs was largely unsuccessful it was hard to steer almost impossible to dive and with a range so limited it was dependent upon auxiliary vessels for support and deployment are you sure sam remi asked im sure everything fits how in the world did it end up here thats the part that doesnt fit according to everything ive read these things only saw action in holland denmark norway and the mediterranean there are absolutely no records of molches being deployed this far west how many of these things were there almost four hundred and most of those were lost either sunk or vanished they were death traps remi only crazy men volunteered for midgetsub duty you said a oneman crew you dont think wont know until i get in there and that other lovely word you usedtorpedo thats the dicey part my hunch is it got pushed this far upriver by sixplus decades of storm surges probably both the torpedoesif it was equipped with any to start withwere knocked off long ago well thats some small comfort remi replied except for the unlucky fisherman who manages to snag one someday were going to have to tell somebody about thisthe coast guard or the navy how theyll deal with it i have no idea one thing at a time right step one make sure it isnt sitting atop a pair of sixtyyearold live torpedoes chapter using one of the spair air pony canisters sam inspected the bottom beneath the molch from stem to stern lightly tapping on each log with the tip of his dive knife and praying he didnt get a metallic clank in reply their luck held all he heard was the soft thump of rotten wood given the appearance of the logs near the top of the heap many of which still showed some remnants of bark sam suspected the molch had been deposited here recently pushed by the storm out of the main channel and into this inlet if so any torpedoes shed been carrying were likely lost somewhere in the main channel of the pocomoke between here and the bay some twenty miles to the south a sound theory but a theory nonetheless sam reminded himself he finished his survey of the bottom then moved on to his next task though hed seen no external damage to the molchs hull it didnt mean she wasnt flooded and if so they were out of luck small as it was compared to its counterparts the molch was still no lightweight weighing in at eleven tons add to that the volume of water her interior could hold and this midget submarine might as well be the titanic for all the good their ropes and ratchet blocks would do them moving from the aft end forward sam tapped along the hull every few feet with his knuckle listening to the echoes they were hollow damn could they be this lucky he returned to the surface and climbed back onto the bank good news bad news sam said which do you want first good im ninety percent sure the torpedoes arent down there and ninetynine percent sure shes not flooded and the bad im only ninety percent sure the torpedoes arent down there remi thought it over for a moment then said well if youre wrong at least well go togetherand in spectacular fashion sam spent the next hour rigging the lines to the sub checking and rechecking their placement the angles and the anchor points for the three ratchet blocks which theyd spread out in a fan shape along the bank each secured to the base of a fullgrown tree sam had hooked the other ends to the molchs bow cleat around the entry hatch and then around the propeller shaft twice during their preparations they again heard the rumbling of a boat engine and each time crawled through the grass to their vantage point overlooking the river the first boat turned out to be a father and son trolling for pike the second boat just five minutes later was scarface and his crew heading back upriver toward snow hill as before they slowed at the mouth of each inlet on the opposite shore scarface steering while one of the others knelt on the bow and scanned the waterway with binoculars after ten minutes of this they disappeared around the bend sam and remi waited another five minutes to make sure they had truly moved on then got back to work even with the sub full of air rolling her was going to take just the right amount of force applied in just the right way sam scratched out the calculations on his notepad figuring the force vectors and buoyancy variables until certain they were as ready as they were going to get well know as soon as it slides off the logs sam said if it sinks its over opening the hatch will just flood it if it floats were still in the game they rehearsed their plan one more time then took up their positions sam at the center ratchet block remi on the stern block ready sam called ready as soon as you see it drop off the logs start cranking shall do sam started cranking slowly on the ratchet one every second or so listening to the line thrumming with tension and the groaning of steel thirty seconds and forty cranks later there came a soft crunching sound from the water and then as if moving in slow motion the molchs periscope began swinging toward them there was another muffled crunch and sam could see in his minds eye the logs beneath the keel cracking he felt a faint shudder beneath his feet then the line went slack go remi fast as you can together they began working the ratchets after ten seconds sams line went taut again he sprinted to the bow ratchet block and cranked it until the line was shivering with tension sam glanced over to remi and saw her line was also vibrating okay stop remi froze start walking backward into the grass then lie down on your belly and wait till i give you the all clear if any of the lines parted under the strain they would snap back with lethal force sam walked forward hand lightly trailing over the line feeling it tremble he reached the lip of the inlet and looked down gotta love physics sam whispered the molch was lying against the bank at a thirtydegree angle periscope poking into the tree branches and her slimeencrusted entry hatch jutting from the water remi appeared at his shoulder wow she whispered wow is right they added a second line to the one around the hatch then slowly let out the bow and stern blocks doubled up those lines and rese cured them around trees closer to the bank using one of the lines for balance sam gingerly stepped onto the molchs deck it groaned shifted and dipped a few inches but otherwise held would you like the honors sam asked nodding at the hatch sure here sam tossed her the hammer and she grabbed it in midair then stepped onto the deck and knelt beside the hatch she gave each of the hatchs four dogging levers a solid rap then set the hammer aside and tried them they didnt budge three more times she repeated the process before each of the levers let loose in turn sliding aside with a screech remi took a breath looked at sam with wideeyed anticipation then lifted open the hatch immediately she wrinkled her nose and jerked her head back oh god thats awful i guess that answers the question of whether her crews still aboard sam said yeah theres no doubt about that remi replied pinching shut her nose and staring into the open hatch hes staring me right in the eye the body was wearing a kriegsmarine cap and a dark blue jumpsuit then again the word body seemed a woefully inadequate description of what sam and remi were looking at trapped inside the dry airless interior of the molch for sixtyfour years the corpse had undergone a transformation sam could only describe as part liquification part mummification pretty safe to assume he suffocated remi said once he was dead the body would have started decaying but without oxygen the process ground to a halt leaving him halfbaked if you will oh thats lovely dear ill carry the image always the position of the remains which lay sprawled on the deck at the bottom of the ladder with one petrified arm draped over a rung spoke volumes about the mans final hours or minutes trapped inside this darkened cylinder knowing death was tightening its grip on him with every inhalation of oxygen it seemed natural that he would have gravitated to his only exit half hoping for some miracle that he knew in his heart would never come i assume you wont mind staying up here while i poke around sam said be my guest he clicked on the flashlight then slid his legs into the hatch probed with his foot until it found a rung then started downward a few feet from the bottom sam stepped off the ladder opposite the body and used his arms to lower himself to the deck immediately sam felt a gloom wash over him he wasnt particularly claustrophobic but this was different somehow not high enough to allow him to straighten up and barely wider than his outstretched arms the interior had a dungeonlike feel to it the bulkheads painted in a dull gray were festooned with cables and pipes all seemingly going everywhere and nowhere at once how is it remi called down disgusting is the only word to describe it sam knelt down beside the corpse and began carefully checking the pockets all were empty save the breast pocket inside which he found a wallet he handed this up to remi then turned and moved forward according to what few descriptions of the molchs interior he had been able to find the front section of the bow held the crafts main battery and behind this between a pair of trim ballast tanks an operators seat with rudimentary controls for steering navigation speed power and trimming as well as a primitive hydrophone for detecting enemy vessels under the operators seat sam found a small toolbox and a leather holster containing a luger pistol and a spare magazine these he pocketed bolted to the bulkhead beneath each trim tank was a rectangular footlocker in one he found a half dozen water jugs all empty and twice that number of empty food tins in the other footlocker he found a leather satchel and a pair of hardbacked black leather journals he slipped them into the satchel then took one last look around something caught his eye a piece of fabric sticking out from behind the footlocker he knelt down and saw that it was a burlap sack inside was a hinged wooden box the size and shape of a loaf of bread he tucked the sack under his arm and returned to the ladder then handed all the items up to remi and climbed up at the top he stopped and looked back down at the corpse well make sure you get home captain he whispered back on deck sam held the line steady to make remis leap back to the bank easier as he braced his feet his toe bumped the burlap sack from inside came the muted tinkle of glass curious now they both knelt down on the deck remi opened the sack and slid out the box which was devoid of markings gingerly she pried open the brass latch and swung open the lid revealing a sheaf of what looked like aged oilskin remi peeled back a flap for a long ten seconds neither of them spoke gaping at the object catching the sunlight remi murmured it cant be can it it was a bottle a green glass wine bottle sam didnt reply instead using his right index finger to lift the end a few inches out of the box revealing the punt good lord remi murmured the symbol etched into the glass was all too familiar chapter la jolla california that poor man remi said to die like that i cant imagine i dont want to imagine sam replied they were stretched out on chaise lounges in the solarium surrounded by potted palms and flowing ferns the midday sun highlighting every tone of the tuscan flagstone tiles it was one of their favorite rooms in the house not an easy choice by any measure sitting atop the cliffs overlooking goldfish point and the indigo waters of the pacific the fargos home and base of operations was a fourstory twelvethousandsquarefoot spanishstyle house with vaulted maplebeamed ceilings and enough windows and skylights to keep their maintenance man busy for eight hours every month the upper floor held sam and remis master suite and below this one flight down were four guest suites a living room a dining room and a kitchengreat room that jutted over the cliff on the second floor a gymnasium containing both aerobic and circuittraining exercise equipment a steam room a hydroworx endlesslap pool and a thousand feet of hardwood floor space for remi to practice her fencing and sam his judo the ground floor sported two thousand square feet of office space for sam and remi and an adjoining workspace for selma complete with three mac pro workstations coupled with thirtyinch cinema displays and a pair of wallmounted thirtytwoinch lcd televisions mounted on the east wall was selmas pride and joy a fourteenfoot fivehundredgallon saltwater aquarium sam told remi we can always hope he went quickly and peacefully the man in question the poor soul theyd found sprawled at the bottom of the molchs ladder now had thanks to the journals theyd found aboard a name manfred boehm korvettenkapitän commander manfred boehm one of the journals had turned out to be the molchs log the other boehms private diary dating back to the early days of world war ii armed with rough translations courtesy of some software sam and remi had dived headfirst into what quickly began to feel like the last will and testament of both boehm and his submarine which they soon learned had a given name the umunderwater boat molch type thirtyfourth constructed sam had been concentrating on the ums log trying to piece together where it had come from and how it had ended up trapped in an inlet on the pocomoke river while remi worked through boehms diary learning about the man beyond the uniform and rank after packing up the skiff and leaving the molch behind theyd thought it wise to avoid snow hill and maxines bait n boat assuming scarface and his friends would be lurking about awaiting their return instead theyd motored ten miles downriver and put ashore just south of willow grove where highway and the pocomoke ran closest to one another from there theyd first called for a pocomoke city taxi then maxines sam kept his explanation vague and short offering a generous tip for troubling them to come down and collect the skiff his final call went to the bbs manager who agreed to ship their belongings back to california five hours later they were at norfolk international airport boarding a plane bound for home the bottle from the um theyd immediately turned over to selma upon their return but theyd heard nothing from her on the matter since shed locked herself and her assistants boyfriend and girlfriend pete jeffcoat and wendy corden both of whom had heard all the peter pan jokes theyd cared to in the workshop for a marathon sleuthing session that wouldnt end until they had an answer on the outside pete and wendy were stereotypical twentysomething californianstan and lean with easygoing smiles and blond hair highlighted by the sunbut intellectually there was nothing conventional about them each having graduated from the university of southern california in the top percentile pete with a ba in archaeology and wendy with a degree in social sciences whatever sam and remi had discovered there was no doubt the insect symbol on their bottle was a perfect match for the one on teds shard nor was there any doubt about the bottles general provenance the writing on the label was french handwritten french no less the questions seemed to be piling up quickly what was the connection between the two pieces what did the symbol mean had both bottles started out aboard the um and if so how did they get separated and finally what about these bottles was worth killing over what to do about the um itself and the remains of boehm had been nagging at sams and remis consciences since leaving maryland though somewhat of a gray area it could be argued the submarine was in fact an archaeological site which in a sense made them grave robbers they consoled themselves by promising that once they were done with their investigation all of boehms possessions would be returned to their rightful owner whether that be the german government or boehms surviving family or descendants wanting to put as much distance between themselves and the um which it now seemed clear was what scarface was after they had called their lawyer who assured them the submarine would be found by a responsible party and that the proper authorities would be alerted to the possible presence of torpedoes lying along the bottom of the pocomoke he had a wife and son remi said without looking up from the diarys pages frieda and helmut in arnsburg outside düsseldorf thats fantastic then the chances are better than fair hes got family there if so well find them hows the log coming slowly ill have to start mapping some of these coordinates but it looks like the was attached to an auxiliary mother ship boehm called gertrude gertrude did the kriegsmarine name their no it has to be code secret codes lost submarines and mysterious wine bottles sounds like a suspense novel maybe when weve solved the whole puzzle remi laughed i think our plates are full enough someday well have to write all this down you know it would make a great book someday when were old and gray i talked to ted by the way hes sitting tight thank god what did you decide did you ask him about the sub no frobisher clung to his wellordered cocoon of a life and his runin with this mystery assailant was all the adventure he could handle besides sam knew ted once the subs discovery hit the airwaves he would wonder given their proximity if the shard and sub were connected he would contact them if he had anything of value to add here listen to this remi said her finger tracing along the page wolfi gave me two fine bottles of wine today two of three he brought along he said we would celebrate together at the end of the mission wolfi sam repeated do we know who that is no ive been skipping around ill start looking heres more wolfi said i deserved two since i had the harder task i wonder what it was dont know but at least we know where teds shard came from somewhere along the line boehm lost one of the bottles the intercom on the wall above remis head crackled to life mr and mrs fargo despite repeated attempts theyd yet to get selma to call them by their first names remi reached up and pushed the talk button yes selma i uh have something well ive found sam and remi exchanged curious glances in their ten years working with selma theyd never heard her sound anything but decisive and curt is everything all right remi asked uh well why dont you come down and ill try to explain were on our way they found selma sitting on a stool at the center worktable eyes fixed on the bottle of wine before her pete and wendy were nowhere to be seen selmas appearance was a mixed metaphor she wore her hair in what remi had dubbed a modified sixties bob while her hornrimmed glasses which she wore on a chain around her neck when not in use were straight from the s her default fashion usually involved khaki pants sneakers and a seemingly endless supply of tiedyed tshirts selma didnt drink didnt smoke didnt swear and had only one addiction herbal tea which she drank by the potful one cabinet of the workroom was devoted to her tea most of which had names neither sam nor remi could pronounce sam asked her where are pete and wendy i sent them home early i thought youd want to hear this in private you can decide later if you want to tell them okay remi replied please tell me you havent found a bottle full of liquid ebola sam said no then what im not sure where to start wherever youd like sam said gently she pursed her lips thinking for a few moments then said first of all that symbol on the bottom the bug ive got no idea what it means sorry its okay selma go on let me back up lets talk about the box itself the hinges and the latch are brass and the wood is from a species of beech tree found in only a few places in the world the biggest concentration is in the pyrenees mountains of southern france and northern spain as for the wrapping inside that could be a discovery unto itself it may be depending on how all of this dates the earliest european example of oilskin its calfskinsix layers of itsoaked in linseed oil the outer two layers are dried out and slightly molded but the interior four are in perfect condition the glass is fairly remarkable as wellvery high quality and quite thick almost an inch actually though im not inclined to test the theory im fairly certain it could stand up to a fair amount of abuse the label on the bottle handtooled leather glued to the glass as well as bound at the top and bottom by hemp twine as you can see the markings on the label were etched direcly into the leather then filled in with inka very rare ink in fact its a mixture of aeonium arboreum schwartzkopf english please remi said its a type of black rose the ink is a mixture of its petals and crushed beetlea spitting beetle native only to the islands in the ligurian sea as for the details on the label itself selma pulled the bottle closer waited for sam and remi to come over then turned on an overhead halogen task lamp you see this phrase mesures usuellesits french for customary measurements its a system that hasnt been used for a hundred fifty years or so and this word here demisit means halves roughly the equivalent of an english pint sixteen ounces not much fluid for a bottle that size remi said has to be the thickness of the glass selma nodded now lets look at the ink itself as you can see its faded in places so itll take time to recreate the image but do you see the two letters in the upper right and lefthand corners and the two numbers in the lower right and left the fargos nodded the numbers represent a year one and nine nineteen nineteen nineteen remi said selma shook her head eighteen nineteen as for the lettersh and atheyre initials belonging to sam prompted selma leaned back and paused now bear in mind im not certain of this i need to do some more research to make sure we understand i think the initials belong to henri archambault sam and remi absorbed the name then looked at one another then back to selma who offered a sheepish grin and a shrug remi said okay just so were on the same page were talking about the henri archambault correct the one and only selma replied henri emile archambaultnapoleon bonapartes chief enologist unless i miss my guess youve found a bottle from napoleons lost cellar chapter sevastopol the ringnecked pheasant burst from the undergrowth and streaked across the sky wings beating wildly in the sharp morning air hadeon bondaruk waited letting the bird get a good lead then tucked the shotgun to his shoulder and fired the pheasant jerked in the air went limp and started tumbling to the earth good shot grigoriy arkhipov said standing a few feet away go bondaruk barked in farsi the two labrador retrievers whod been sitting patiently at bondaruks feet leaped up and charged after the fallen bird the ground around bondaruks feet was littered with no less than a dozen pheasant corpses all of them having been torn to shreds by the dogs i hate the taste of the things bondaruk explained to arkhipov using the toe of his boot to kick one away but the dogs love the exercise what about you kholkov do you enjoy the hunt standing a few feet behind arkhipov vladimir kholkov dipped his head to one side considering depends on the quarry good answer kholkov and arkhipov had served most of their time together in the spetsnaz arkhipov the commander kholkov the loyal executive officer a relationship that had continued into their civilian life as highestbidder mercenaries for the past four years hadeon bondaruk had been the undisputed highest bidder making arkhipov a wealthy man in the process after reporting to bondaruk their failure to find the fargos kholkov and arkhipov had been summoned here to their bosss vacation home in the foothills along the crimean peninsula though hed arrived the afternoon before bondaruk had yet to mention the incident arkhipov was afraid of no manthat much kholkov had seen proven on the battlefield dozens of timesbut they both knew a dangerous man when they saw one and bondaruk was as treacherous as they came though hed never personally witnessed it he had no doubt of bondaruks capacity for violence it wasnt fear that put them on edge when they were around bondaruk but a hardwon and healthy caution bondaruk was unpredictable like a shark placidly swimming along paying attention to nothing and everything ready to attack in the blink of an eye even now as they talked kholkov knew his boss was keeping a soldiers eye trained on bondaruks shotgun watching the movement of the barrel as though it were the mouth of a great white kholkov knew a little about bondaruks youth in turkmenistan the fact that his current boss had likely killed many dozens of his own countrymenperhaps even men he knewduring the conflict along the iranian border mattered very little to him war was war the best soldiers the ones that excelled and survived usually went about the work of killing the enemy with dispassion its easy to be a good shot with a good gun bondaruk said cracking the breech and extracting the shell custommade by ham brusch jagdwaffen in austria care to guess how old it is grigoriy i have no idea arkhipov replied one hundred eighty years it belonged to otto von bismarck himself you dont say its a piece of living history bondaruk replied as though arkhipov hadnt spoken look down there bondaruk pointed southeast toward the lowlands along the coast you see that series of low hills yes in during the crimean war thats where the battle of balaclava was fought youve heard of the poem by tennysonthe charge of the light brigade arkhipov shrugged i think we read it in elementary school the actual battle has been overshadowed by the poemenough that the average person today has no idea about the story seven hundred british soldierscavalrymen from the th and th light dragoons th lancers and the th and th hussarscharged a russian position fortified by cannon when the smoke cleared less than two hundred of those soldiers were left alive youre a military man vladimir what would you call that foolish or courageous its hard to know what was in the mind of the commanders another example of living history bondaruk said history is about people and legacies great deeds and great ambition and great failures of course come both of you walk with me shotgun cradled in the crook of his arm bondaruk strolled through the high grass casually blasting the occasional pheasant that popped up i dont blame you for losing them bondaruk said ive read about the fargos theyve got a taste for adventure for danger well find them bondaruk waved his hand dismissively do you know why these bottles are so important to me no the truth is the bottles the wine inside and where they came from arent important once theyve served their purpose you can smash them to pieces for all i care then why why do you want them so badly its about where they can take us its what theyve been hiding for two hundred yearsand for two millennia before that how much do you know about napoleon some napoleon was a shrewd tactician a ruthless general and a master strategistall of the history books agree on that but as far as im concerned his greatest trait was foresight he was always looking ten steps ahead when he commissioned henri archambault to create that wine and the bottles that held it napoleon was thinking about the future beyond battles and politics he was thinking of his legacy unfortunately history caught up to him bondaruk shrugged and smiled i guess one mans misfortune is another mans good luck i dont understand i know you dont bondaruk started walking away calling to his dogs after him then suddenly stopped and turned back to arkhipov youve served me very well grigoriy for many years its been my pleasure as i said i dont blame you for losing the fargos but i need your pledge that it wont happen again you have it mr bondaruk youll swear to it for the first time arkhipovs eyes showed a trace of uncertainty of course bondaruk smiled there was none of it in his eyes good raise your right hand and so swear after only a moments hesitation arkhipov raised his hand to shoulder height i swear i will bondaruks shotgun spun in his hands and the barrel spat orange flame arkhipovs right hand and wrist disappeared in a spray of blood the former spetsnaz stumbled backward one step staring for a few moments at the gushing stump before letting out a moan and dropping to his knees kholkov standing a few feet behind and to the side sidestepped his eyes fixed on bondaruks shotgun arkhipov clutched feebly at the stump then looked up at kholkov why he croaked bondaruk strolled up to arkhipovs side and looked down on him i dont blame you grigoriy but life is about cause and effect had you worked more quickly with frobisher the fargos wouldnt have had time to intervene bondaruk shifted the shotgun again leveled it with arkhipovs left ankle and pulled the trigger the foot disappeared arkhipov screamed and toppled over bondaruk broke open the shotgun loaded two more shells from his pocket then methodically blasted off arkhipovs remaining hand and foot then watched his subordinate writhing on the ground after thirty seconds arkhipov went still bondaruk looked up at kholkov do you want his job pardon me im offering you a promotion do you accept kholkov took a deep breath i have to admit your management style gives me pause at this bondaruk smiled arkhipov isnt dead because he made a mistake vladimir hes dead because he made a mistake that couldnt be fixed the fargos are involved now and it is a complication we cant afford youre allowed mistakesjust not irreversible ones ill need your answer now kholkov nodded i accept wonderful lets have some breakfast bondaruk turned and started walking away his dogs trailing behind him then he stopped and turned back by the way when we get back to the house you might want to check the american news sites i heard a local man a maryland state police officer in fact stumbled across a halfsunken german midget submarine is that so interesting isnt it chapter la jolla you cant be serious sam said to selma napoleons lost cellar isnt its just a legend remi finished right maybe not selma replied first lets talk a little history so weve got some context i know youre both generally familiar with napoleonic history but bear with me i wont bore you with his entire personal history so well pick it up with his first command assignment a corsican by birth napoleon won his first acclaim at the siege of toulon in and was appointed the rank of brigadier general then general of the army of the west commander of the army of the interior then commander of the french army in italy for the next few years he fights a series of battles in austria then returns to paris a national hero after spending a few years in the middle east on his egyptian campaignwhich was at best a marginal successhe returns to france and takes part in a coup détat that ends up with him as the first consul of the new french government a year later he takes an army across the pennine alps to wage the second italian campaign remi said the famous painting of him on the horse right replied selma sitting atop a rearing horse chin set arm pointed into the distance the truth is a little different though first of all most people think that horses name was marengo but it was actually known at that time as styrie its name was changed after the battle of marengo a few months later and heres the kicker napoleon actually did most of the crossing atop a mule not quite befitting his image no anyway after the campaign napoleon returns to paris and is appointed first consul for lifeessentially openended benevolent dictatorship two years after that he proclaims himself emperor for the next decade or so he wages battles and signs treaties and so on until when he makes the mistake of invading russia it doesnt work out quite as he plans and hes forced to conduct a winter withdrawal that all but decimates his grand army he returns to paris and over the next two years finds himself fighting prussia and spain not only abroad but on french soil as well soon after that paris falls the senate declares napoleons empire dead and in the spring of he abdicates his rule to louis xviii of the bourbon line a month later napoleon is exiled to elba and his wife and son flee to vienna not josephine right sam asked right pulling a page from henry viiis book napoleon divorced her in because she failed to give him a male heir he married the daughter of the emperor of austria marie louise who managed to produce a son okay go on about a year after he was exiled napoleon escapes returns to france and puts together an army louis xviii flees the throne and napoleon takes over again this was the start of what historians call the hundred days campaignthough it didnt even last that long not quite three months later in june napoleon is routed by the british and prussians at the battle of waterloo napoleon abdicates again and is exiled by the british to saint helenaa chunk of rock about twice the size of washington dc dead center in the atlantic ocean between west africa and brazil he spends the remaining six years of his life there and dies in of stomach cancer sam offered thats the generally accepted theory but there are a lot of historians who believe he was murderedarsenic poisoning so selma concluded that brings us back to the lost cellar the myth dates back to and the alleged deathbed confession of a smuggler named lionel arienne who claimed that in june of eleven months before napoleon died he was approached by an agent of napoleons at a tavern in le havre the soldierwho arienne simply referred to as the majorhired arienne and his ship the faucon to take him to saint helena where they were to pick up cargo then deliver it to a destination to be named after they left the island according to arienne when they reached saint helena six weeks later they were met in a small cove by a lone man in a rowboat who carried aboard a wooden case roughly two feet long and a foot wide with his back facing arienne the major opened the case inspected its contents resealed it then suddenly drew his sword and killed the man from the rowboat the body was weighted with a length of anchor chain then dumped overboard the rowboat was scuttled it was at this point in ariennes telling of the story that the old smuggler was said to have simply diedin midsentence no lesstaking with him any clue as to the contents of the case or where he and the major took it and that might have been the end of it selma said if not for lacanau the name of napoleons private vineyard sam offered correct while arienne and the phantom major were supposedly on their way to helena the vineyard at lacanauwhich the french government had generously allowed to remain as part of napoleons estatewas burned to the ground by person or persons unknown the vines the winery all the casksutterly destroyed even the soil was obliterated dosed with salt and lye as well as the seeds right remi said those too actually the name lacanau was one of convenience in fact the lacanau vineyard grapes came from seeds taken from the corsican regions of the ajaccio patrimonio napoleon had archambault crosspollinate the seeds to create the lacanau strain anyway while he was still in power napoleon ordered the seeds for the lacanau grape to be kept in secure repositories at amiens paris and orléans according to legend while the fires were raging at lacanau the seeds mysteriously disappeared and were assumed destroyed the lacanau grape which grew only in that coastal region of france was gone forever remi said for arguments sake lets say all of this isnt just a folktale what were getting at is this from exile napoleon via secret messenger or carrier pigeon or whatever ordered henri archambault his chief winemaker to produce a final batch of lacanau wine and have it delivered to saint helena then he orders his loyalist operatives back in france to raze the vineyard ruin the soil then kidnap and destroy the seeds then a few months later he orders this major to sail to helena and spiritno pun intendedthe wine away to points unknown remi looked at sam and selma in turn have i got that right sounds about right sam said the three of them paused for ten seconds staring at the bottle on the table with new eyes how much is it worth remi asked selma well the story has it there were twelve bottles in the case the major and arienne took from saint helena and it seems likely that one of the bottles is already broken if the case were intact id say nine or ten million dollarsto the right kind of buyer of course but the case isnt intact so that really brings down the price if i had to guess id say each bottle would be worth between six and seven hundred thousand dollars for a bottle of wine remi breathed not to mention the historical and scientific value sam said were talking about a strain of grape that is in all likelihood extinct so what do you want to do selma asked we have to assume scarface is after the wine rather than the um sam said and he didnt strike me as a connoisseur remi added which means hes working for someone ill make some calls pull in some favors and see what we can find out in the meantime selma call pete and wendy and fill them in remi agreed selma you stay on the lacanau angle we need to know everything about it about the bottle about henri archambaultyou know what to do selma was jotting notes im on it sam said when pete and wendy get here and theyre up to speed turn them loose on napoleon and his mysterious major anything and everything got it theres one thing thats been nagging me though the crushedbeetle ink on this label came from the tuscan archipelago in the ligurian sea sam realized what she was getting at which is where elba is which remi said chiming in is where napoleon spent his first exile six years before arienne claims he and the major arrived at st helena to pick up the wine either napoleon had been planning this since elba or he brought the ink with him to st helena sam said we may never know selma get started on your end okay and you two weve got some reading to do remi replied this bottle was aboard the um left there by manfred boehm we find out where the um and boehm started we find out where the bottle came from they worked on boehms diary and the ums log late into the night remi jotting notes she thought might help them better understand the man sam trying to retrace the ums course backward from its final resting place here remi said straightening in her chair and tapping the diary this is what weve been looking for wolfgang müller listen to this entry august for the first time as brothers in arms wolfi and i ship out together tomorrow i pray god we succeed and prove worthy of our commands brothers in arms sam repeated and the man with the other bottle so müller was also in the kriegsmarineboehm the captain of the um müller the captain of what gertrude perhaps boehms mother ship perhaps remi picked up her cell phone and called down to the workshop selma can you work your magic on something for us we need anything you can dig up on a world war ii kriegsmarine sailor named wolfgang müller in summer or fall of he might have commanded a ship of some kind right thanks true to her reputation selma called back thirty minutes later remi put her on speakerphone found him she said you want the short or long version short for now sam replied fregattenkapitän wolfgang müller born in munich joined the kriegsmarine in standard promotions no disciplinary action in he was assigned to captain the auxiliary ship lothringen home port was listed as bremerhaven her duty area the atlantic according to germanys naval archive database lothringen was orginally laid down as a french ferry named londres the germans captured it in and converted it into a mine layer it was reassigned for special duty in july of but there was no mention of the particulars a mine layer remi said why would they by that time in the war the germans were losing and they knew iteveryone but hitler that was selma said they were desperate the kinds of auxiliary ships they would have normally used to transport the um had either been sunk or converted into troop escorts i also found a website entitled survivors of the lothringen along with a fair number of blogs dedicated to the subject it seems the lothringen was attacked and disabled during a storm by a us navy destroyer in september of off virginia beach about fifty miles south of pocomoke sound remi said right only about half the lothringens crew survived the attack those who did spent the remainder of the war in a wisconsin pow camp called camp lodi the lothringen was towed to norfolk and sold to greece after the war as far as i can tell theres no record of it ever being scrapped what about müller any idea what happened to him nothing yet still looking one of the lothringen blogs run by the granddaughter of a survivor named froch is sort of a diary in itself the entries talk a lot about the weeks leading up to the attack if were to believe the account the lothringen spent about a month undergoing a refit at a secret german base in the bahamas and frolicking with the native girls someplace called rum cay selma did the lothringen have facilities to do refitting not even close the best it could have done was simply strap the um to the deck cover it in a tarp to keep it hidden from prying eyes then transport it across the atlantic that would explain why they didnt do whatever refitting was required at sea remi said true but why didnt they do the refit in bremerhaven before they left maybe they were in a hurry as i said they were getting desperate by that point wait a second sam blurted out then grabbed the s logbook and began paging through it here right here at the beginning of his log boehm mentions a place but only by initials rc rum cay remi murmured has to be it fits selma agreed sam looked questioningly at remi who smiled and nodded back okay selma time to put on your travelagent hat get us on the next flight to nassau will do and a rental car sam added something fast and sexy i like your style remi said with a sly smile chapter nassau bahamas selma had donned her travelagent hat with characteristic proficiency reserving them a pair of firstclass seats on the last redeye out of san diego heading east seven hours and one layover later they touched down at nassau international airport shortly after noon they had less luck with their rental car however ending up with a bright red volkswagen beetle convertible which selma swore was the sexiest and fastest car in all of the bahamas sam suspected remi had bribed their research chief but said nothing until they were pulling out of the parking lot and were passed by a corvette bearing an avis sticker did you see that sam said glancing over his shoulder its for your own good sam remi said patting him on the knee trust me she put her hand atop her white sun hat to keep it from whipping away and leaned her head back basking in the tropical sun sam grumbled something in reply what was that remi asked nothing waiting for them at the four seasons resort reception desk was a message have information call landline asap r rube remi asked sam nodded why dont you go to the villa ill see what he has to say then join you okay sam found a quiet corner in the lobbys seating area and hit speed dial on his satellite phone rubin haywood picked up on the first ring its me rube hang on sam there was a click followed by a hissing squelch as rube engaged what sam assumed was some kind of encryption device how are you great thanks for this i owe you one no you dont haywood and sam went back twelve years since sams early days at darpa having met at the cias camp perry training facility in the wilds of the virginia countryside near williamsburg haywood a case officer in the cias directorate of operations was going through covert operative training sam was there for the same purpose but as part of an experimental program designed to put darpas best and brightest through the kind of realworld scenarios cia officers experience in the field the idea was simple the better darpas engineers could understand what field work was really likehands on and up closethe better they would be at creating gadgets and tools that met realworld challenges sam and rube had instantly bonded their friendship cemented over the six long weeks of training and theyd stayed in touch ever since meeting once a year in the fall for a threeday hiking trip through the sierra nevada everything im going to tell you is unclassifiedat least officially sam read between the lines after receiving his call rube had in turn made his own calls tapping contacts and sources outside the government okay your message said asap yeah the name of the guy you call scarface used a pretty heavily backstopped credit card attached to dummy accounts to rent the boat in snow hill so it took a little digging his name is grigoriy arkhipov exrussian special forces spent time in both afghanistan and chechnya he and his righthand man a guy named kholkov left the army in and went freelance arkhipov youre familiar with but ill email you a picture of kholkov if you havent seen him around yet you will as far as we can tell theyve worked for just one man since a real nasty piece of work named hadeon bondaruk ive heard the name id be surprised if you hadnt rube replied hes the kingpin of the ukrainian mafia and the toast of sevastopol high society he throws parties and hunt weekends at his estate several times a year and restricts his guest list to the überwealthypoliticians celebrities european royalty hes never been charged with a crime but is suspected of dozens of murdersmostly other crime bosses and enforcers who for whatever reason made him mad other than rumors theres not much out there about his past i love gossip sam said lets hear it rumor is he commanded a cell of guerrilla fighters in turkmenistan during that whole russianiranian border mess moved around the mountains like a ghost ambushing patrols and convoys never leaving anyone alive a real samaritan yeah so whats your interest in him i think hes after the same thing we are which is better you not know rube youve stuck your neck out far enough already sam come on just leave it rube please haywood paused then sighed okay youre the boss but listen youve been lucky so far but your luck could run out in a big hurry i know will you at least let me help you i know a guy down there you should see you got a pen sam grabbed a pad from the end table and took down the name and address rube recited i trust him go see him will do and for gods sake take care of yourselves you hear me i hear you weve been through some tough scrapes together remi and i well handle this one how exactly easy were going stay one step ahead of them three hours later sam pulled the beetle off the coast road into a small gravel parking lot and eased to a stop beside a rusted quonset hut topped by a windsock and bearing a faded handpainted sign air sampson fifty yards to the right was another quonset hut this one larger and through the sliding double doors they could see the nose of an airplane on the other side of the hangar was a landing strip composed of crushed seashells this is it remi asked eyes narrowed sam checked the map yep this is it selma swears its the best charter place on the island if she says so are you really going to bring that thing she asked nodding to the toweldraped object lying on the floor between sams feet after hanging up with rube sam had gone to the villa and recounted the conversation to remi who listened carefully and asked no questions i dont want to see you get hurt she said finally taking his hands in hers and i dont want to see you get hurt itd be the end of my world then lets not get hurt like you said well just stay one step ahead of them and if things get too rough well call in the good guys and go home sure we will she replied before coming to the airstrip after leaving the hotel theyd first followed rubes address to a shoerepair shop in downtown nassau where they found that the owner and rubes contact guido was expecting them rubin wasnt sure you would come guido said in slightly italianaccented english he said you were both very stubborn did he now yes oh yes guido walked to the front door flipped over the out to lunch sign then led them into the back room and down a set of stone steps into the basement which was lit by a single hanging lightbulb lying on a bench amid shoes in various states of disrepair was a snubnosed caliber revolver you both have handled guns yes yes sam replied answering for both of them in fact remi was a damned good marksman and had no fear of handling guns but tried to avoid them if at all possible good guido answered no serial numbers on the gun untraceable you may throw it away when you are done he wrapped the gun in a towel along with a box of fifty bullets then handed it to sam one favor if you dont mind name it sam said dont kill anyone sam smiled thats the last thing in the world we want to do how much do we owe you no please nothing a friend of rubins is a friend of mine sam now asked you want me to leave it no i guess not better safe than sorry they got out collected their backpacks from the trunk then went into the quonset hut a black man in his late sixties sat behind the counter on a lawn chair a cigar jutting from his mouth well hello there he said rising to his feet i am sampson owner operator chief bottlewasher he spoke perfect oxford english sam introduced them then said not from around these parts i take it born in london came here ten years ago to live the good life so youre going to rum cay right business or pleasure both remi said bird watching photography you know sam handed over his pilots license and filled out the required forms sampson looked over the forms then nodded overnight probably youve booked a hotel there sam shook his head were roughing it you should have gotten a delivery yesterdaytent potable water camping gear guided by one of her dozens of mental checklists selma had arranged a full load of gear for their trek from the absolute necessities to the whatifs sampson was nodding i did its already loaded he pulled a clipboard off a nail on the wall jotted a note then returned it ive got you in a bonanza g fueled and checked pontoons as requested head over to the hangar and charlie will send you on your way they turned and headed for the door sampson called what kind of birds you hoping to spot they turned back sam shrugged and smiled whatever is native to the island chapter rum cay bahamas comprising as the island did an area of less than thirty square miles finding a hidden base on rum cay might at first glance appear a fairly straightforward task to uninitiated adventurers but sam and remi had been down similar roads before and knew the coastline uneven as it was with hundreds of coves and inlets was in reality at least six times the islands gross circumference originally known as mamana by the local lucayan indians the island was renamed santa maria de la concepción by christopher columbus finally gaining its modern name when spanish explorers found a lone cask of rum washed up on one of its white sand beaches the islands only village of note port nelson lay on the islands northwest coast surrounded by groves of coconut trees with a population that according to the census was somewhere between fifty and seventy soulsmost of whom lived in port nelsonrum cays primary if anemic industry was tourism followed by pineapple salt and sisal all of which have waxed and waned over the decades other settlements long since deserted and overgrown bore exotic monikers like black rock and gin hill formidable reefs coral canyons and plunging seabeds encircle the island making it a favored destination for pirates of oldor so said the brochure remi had picked up in nassau theres even a famous wreck she said as sam banked the bonanza to the right following the contour of the island however unlikely they were to spot their target from the air both thought it prudent to at least circumnavigate the island to get a better feel for what lay ahead blackbeard sam asked captain kidd neither the hms conqueror britains first propellerdriven warship sank in in about thirty feet of water in a staghorn gully near sumner point reef sounds like it may be worth a return trip here rum cay offered a few luxury resorts and even more beach cottage rentals judging by the azure waters lush rolling hills and relative seclusion it struck sam as the perfect getawayfromitall spot theres the airstrip remi said pointing out the window the foot paved runway sat a couple miles from port nelson a truncated white t amid a patch of forest that seemed determined to reclaim it sam could see antlike workers at the tarmacs edge hacking at the foliage with machetes just east of the runway they could see salt lake and a few miles north of that lake george though sam had no fear of using the airstrip they had asked selma to ensure whatever aircraft they rented was equipped with pontoons exploring the island by car would have taken weeks at least and required miles of crosscountry bushwhacking with the pontoons they could hop around the islands shoreline exploring interesting spots as they came across them sam descended to two thousand feet contacted port nelson control which verified their flight plan and permission then banked around the northeast headland and turned south along the coast as the leastinhabited part of the island he and remi thought it the best place to start their search as the western half of the island was well explored and well populatedat least by rum cay standardsany discovery of the secret base would have been noted by now selma hadnt come across any such reports so sam and remi took this as a good sign providing the secret base wasnt simply the concoction of some senile german kriegsmarine that looks like itd make a good base of operations sam said nodding through the windshield at a threequarter moon cove with sugarwhite beaches the nearest structure what looked like an abandoned plantation house sat six miles inland sam banked again bleeding off speed and altitude as he went until they were two hundred feet off the waves then lined up the bonanzas nose on the beach he did a quick visual check to make sure he hadnt missed seeing a reef then eased the craft down flaring at the last moment and letting the pontoons kiss the surface he throttled back to idle letting the planes momentum carry them forward the pontoons hissed as they contacted the shoal sand and they came to a gentle stop six feet onto dry land beautiful landing mr lindbergh remi said unbuckling her seat belt i like to think all my landings are beautiful of course they are dear except for that time in peru never mind remi climbed out onto the beach and sam handed down their backpacks and the duffel bags containing their camping gear sams satellite phone trilled and he answered mr fargo its selma good timing we just touched down hold on sam called remi over and put the phone on speaker first things first youre buttoned up after learning the pedigrees of bondaruk arkhipov and kholkov from rube sam had ordered selma pete and wendy to move into the goldfish point house and set the alarm system which sam had long ago tweaked to satisfy his engineers mind the system he knew would give a cia blackbag team a run for its money and as luck would have it the san diego commissioner of police and sams thriceweekly judo partner lived a half mile from them squad cars were on quickresponse alert for their neighborhood safe and sound selma replied how goes the battle were getting there should have some interesting reading for you when you get home first some good news i figured out what the bug is on the bottom of the bottle its from napoleons family coat of arms on the right side of the coat is what looks like a bee though theres some debate about this among historians most believe it isnt a bee at all but a golden cicadaor at least thats what it was in the beginning the symbol was first discovered in in the tomb of childeric i the first king of the merovingian dynasty it represents immortality and resurrection immortality and resurrection remi repeated a tad conceitedbut then again we are talking about napoleon let me get this straight sam said napoleons signature icon is a grasshopper close but not exactly selma said different branch of the family tree the cicada is more closely related to leafhoppers and spittlebugs sam laughed ah yes the royal spittlebug between the cicada and henri archambaults mark theres no doubt the bottles from the lost cellar good work sam said what else i also finished dissecting the translation of manfred boehms diary theres a line in there about the goats head i remember remi replied both she and sam had assumed it had been a rum cay tavern boehm and his shipmates had visited well i massaged the translation a bit using both high and low german and i think the goats head is a landmark of some kindmaybe a navigation aid problem is i did some digging and i couldnt find anything about a goats head related to rum cayor any of the other islands for that matter well keep our eyes peeled sam replied if youre right its likely a rock formation of some kind agreed and last i owe you guys an apology for an error say it isnt so selma rarely made mistakes and those that she did were almost always minor even so she was a strict taskmastermore so with herself than anyone else i was slightly off in translating the abstract from the german naval archives wolfgang müller wasnt the captain of the lothringen he was a passenger just like boehm another sub captain in fact he was assigned to the midget sub um so boehm and müller and their subs are aboard the lothringen which sails across the atlantic puts in at rum cay for resupply and refit thats the word the sailorfrochused in his blog correct correct refit then a week later boehms boat the um ends up in the pocomoke river and the lothringen is sunk which begs the question where is müllers sub the um according to the german archives its listed as lost according to us navy archives they found nothing aboard the lothringen when it was captured remi replied which means the um probably went down on its own missionsomething similar to boehms mission im betting i agree sam said but theres also a third possibility which is shes still here its the word refit that got my attention the lothringen was what one hundred fifty feet long about that selma replied to refit a ship that big would have taken a fairsized facilitysomething big enough that it would have been discovered by now im beginning to think the refitting they mentioned was for the um and the um and if were right about their mission being top secret they sure as hell werent going to do that in the opennot with us navy pby spotter planes flying out of puerto rico which means remi asked which means we may have some spelunking in our future sam replied they finished unloading the bonanza then staked her tiedowns deep into the sand and started looking for a campsite nightfall was only a few hours away theyd get a fresh start in the morning weve got a competitor remi said pointing down the beach sam shaded his eyes with his palm and squinted well thats not something you see every day a quarter mile away nestled against the tree line along the coves northern arm was what looked for all the world like a hollywood version of a tiki hut complete with a thatched conical roof and plank walls hanging between the huts two front posts was a hammock in it was a figure one foot dangling over the edge rocking the hammock back and forth without looking up the figure raised a hand in greeting and called ahoy sam and remi walked the remaining distance in front of the hut was a fire pit surrounded by waveworn logs for seating welcome the man said he looked distinguished if not a bit weathered with white hair a welltrimmed goatee and twinkling blue eyes dont mean to intrude sam said nonsense wanderers are always welcome and you two certainly look the part have a seat sam and remi dropped their gear in the sand and found seats on a log sam introduced themselves to their host who simply said happy to have you in fact im going to turn the estate over to you time to move on dont go on our account remi said nothing of the sort dear lady ive got a previous engagement in port henry wont be back for a couple days with that the man disappeared into the trees and emerged a few seconds later pushing a vespa scooter theres a fishing pole lures pots pans and all that inside he said make yourselves at home theres a trapdoor wine cellar youre welcome to try a bottle sam strangely certain he could trust this stranger said you havent heard any legends about a secret base around here have you a nazi submarine base yes thats the one the man put the scooter up onto its kickstand he went inside the hut and came back out carrying what looked like a traysized square of sheet metal he handed it to sam to carry our dinner sam asked thats a hydroplane son from a pretty small sub too by the looks of it where did you find this liberty rock on the north side near port boyd sounds like the place to start looking i found that in a lagoon my guess is it washed out of an underground river here on the east side of the island they all flow south to north problem is theyre not strong enough to push anything heavier than that plane no offense remi said but if you knew what this belonged to why havent you looked for it yourself the man smiled ive done my fair share of exploring i figured sooner or later someone would come along asking the right questions and here you are the man walked toward his scooter then stopped and turned back you know if id been a german sailor back then looking for a place to hide out i wouldve loved to have stumbled across a sea cave me too sam said as luck would have it rum cay is full of them dozens along this shore alone most unexploredmost connected to underground rivers thanks by the way ever heard of anything called the goats head the man scratched his chin cant say i have well im off good hunting the man puttered off on the scooter and disappeared sam and remi were silent for a few moments then sam said ill be damned what we didnt even think to get his name i dont think we need it remi said pointing at the hut beside the door was a wooden plaque in handpainted red letters it said casa de cussler chapter i could get used to this sam said staring into the fire ill second that remi replied theyd decided to accept their hosts invitation to spend the night at the hut as the sun dipped toward the horizon sam strolled the beach and gathered burnable driftwood while remi used their hosts collapsible bamboo fishing rod to snag a trio of snapper from the surf by the time night fell they were lying against a log before a crackling campfire their stomachs full of braised and seasalted fish the night was clear and black with diamondspeck stars filling the sky aside from the swooshhiss of the surf and the occasional rustling of palm fronds all was quiet their host hadnt been joking about the wine cellar which though barely larger than a closet sported two dozen bottles theyd chosen a jordan chardonnay to complement remis catch they sat and sipped and watched the stars until finally remi said you think theyll find us who arkhipov and kholkov not likely for the airline tickets the hotel and the rental car theyd used a credit card attached to a twiceremoved fargo foundation expense account while sam had no doubt bondaruks hatchet men had the resources to eventually unravel the financial trail it wouldnt happen he hoped before they were gone unless he added they already have a lead that points them here theres a cheery notion sam ive been thinking about ted that russianarkhipovhe was going to kill him wasnt he i suspect so over wine what kind of man would do that if rubes right bondaruks filthy rich what hed gain from selling the lost cellar would be pocket change why is he willing to kill for it remi for him murder comes naturally its not a last resort its a ready option i suppose but youre not convinced it just doesnt add up is bondaruk a wine collector a napo leonophile maybe i dont know well check she shook her head frustrated after a few moments of silence she asked so where do we start we have to make some assumptions sam replied first that selmas right about the goats head being a landmark and second that boehm and his team would have chosen the most uninhabited part of the island to set up shop this coastline certainly fits the bill at first light we pile our gear into the dinghy not the plane dont think so boehms vantage point would have been from the surface from the air a goats head could look like a ducks foot or a donkeys ear or nothing at all good point erosions going to be a problem sixty years of weather could change a lot true the bahamian archipelago was a spelunking and cavediving paradise sam knew and there were four general types of cave systems blue holes which came in both the open ocean and inshore variety and were essentially great tubes plunging hundreds of feet into the ocean or an islands rock strata fractureguided caves which followed the natural fissures in the bedrock solutional caves which formed over time by rainwater mixing with minerals in the soil to dissolve the underlying limestone or calcium carbonate bedrock and finally gardenvariety sea caves formed along cliffs by thousands of years of pounding surf while these systems rarely went any deeper than a hundred feet they were also usually spacious and offered sheltered underwater entrancesprecisely what one might look for when scouting for a spot to hide a mini submarine you missed one remi said an assumption i mean which is that all this isnt just a goose chaseor to be exact a wild molch hunt they woke at dawn had a breakfast of wild grape fig and pigeon plums all of which they found growing wild within a hundred yards of the hut then piled their gear into the inflatable dinghy and set out the trolling motor wasnt going to help them set any speed records but it was fuel efficient and powerful enough to get through the reef line and to navigate the inshore tides by the time the sun had lifted free of the horizon they were tooling north along the coast parallel to the reef line the water was a crystalline turquoise so clear they could see rainbowhued fish skimming along the white sand bottom twenty feet below as sam steered staying as close to the shore as possible which ranged from fifty to one hundred yards remi sat in the bow alternately scanning the cliffs through her binoculars and taking shots with her digital slr camera occasionally she would call for sam to come about and make a repeat pass of a rock formation as she tilted her head and squinted her eyes and took more pictures before eventually shaking her head and giving him the okay to proceed the hours and the coastline slipped by until around noon they found themselves nearing the islands headland and junkanoo rock beyond that on the northern shoreline lay port boyd and the islands more populous western areas sam turned the dinghy around and they headed south weve probably already passed dozens of sea caves remi said this was true many of the cliff faces theyd surveyed were shrouded in climbing vines and scrub foliage that jutted from every nook and cranny from this distance they could be seeing a cave entrance and never know it they had little choice however slipping inside each reef break and checking every foot of every cliff would take years more frustrating still was that most of their search had so far occurred during low tide which should have given them the best chance to spot an opening suddenly remi sat up straighter and cocked her head a posture sam knew only too well his wife had had a eureka moment what he asked i think were going about this the wrong way were assuming boehm used this goats head as a navigation aid while testdriving the molch before the mission correct theyd want to test out any refit work theyd done wouldnt they id hope so and close to shore they wouldnt have risked grounding the sub by diving which meant the molch probably didnt roam too far the molchs mothership the lothringen would have been equipped with an advanced openocean navigation system but not so the mini submarine which would have relied on speeddistance dead reckoning and quite likely visual aids right again so what if the only time boehm would have to rely on a landmark was when he was coming back infrom a test dive from offshore sam finished inshore a goats head might not look like a goats head but from a mile or two out to sea remi was smiling and nodding sam brought the dinghy about and pointed the nose toward open ocean once they were about a mile out they repeated their tour of the coastline heading back the way theyd come past their landing beach toward the southeastern tip of the island signal point and port nelson where they turned around and headed north again by three thirty tired thirsty and slightly sunburned despite their hats and repeated coatings of bullfrog sunscreen they were a mile from the northern headland when remi who was studying the coast through her binoculars held up a closed fist sam throttled down to an idle and waited remi turned in her seat and leaned back to hand sam the binoculars take a look at that cliff she pointed bearing about twoeightzero relative sam aimed the binoculars and panned along the rock face see the two banyan trees sitting next to one another remi said hold on okay i see them imagine them sixty years ago about a third their size with less branches add a little dimension to the rock sam made the illusive adjustment and looked again but after ten seconds shook his head sorry squint remi offered he did and suddenly as if someone had flipped a switch he saw it six decades of erosion had in fact softened the bump in the cliff but there was no doubt combined the outcropping and the twin banyans formed the vague profile of a goats face topped by a pair of overgrown and tangled horns the question was were they seeing what they wanted to see the victims of selfsuggestion or was there really something there one look at remis face told him she was wondering the same thing one way to find out he said the break in the reef was narrow less than eight feet wide and with high tide and churn the top of the coral was submerged just enough to be invisible at a distance but close enough to the surface to rip the dinghys rubber skin to shreds should sam stray remi sat in the bow arms braced on the side walls as she leaned forward and peered into the water left left left she called okay straighten out steady on on either side of the dinghy through the froth sam could see daggeredged coral just beneath the turquoise surface he jinked the throttle and rudder searching for that delicate balance between steerageway and power not enough of the former and he couldnt avoid being pushed onto the coral too much of the latter and he couldnt respond to remis signals good hard right sam pushed the rudder over and the dinghy veered just as a wave broke on the reef and knocked the stern around hold on he powered up and compensated left a little more more how far to go ten more feet and were through sam looked over his shoulder a swell was rising twenty feet behind them building up on the reef s outer edge gonna get hit sam called brace yourself almost there veer right straight now good give it all youve got sam cranked the throttle to its stops just as the wave broke under the dinghys stern sam felt his belly lurch into his throat for a brief second the prop lifted free of the water with a sputtering whine then the dinghy was slapped back onto a calm lagoon remi rolled onto her back leaned against the bow and let out a sigh ill say it again sam fargo you sure know how to show a girl a good time i do what i can welcome to goats head lagoon chapter paradise dead ahead sam said straightening the dinghys nose after spending the past eight hours first roasting in the hot sun and then navigating a sharks mouth of a reef break the shaded lagoon felt like paradise roughly one hundred feet in diameter it was sheltered to the north and south by curved thumbs of land choked with scrub pine and palms the cliff which rose thirty vertical feet from the water was blanketed in vines foliage and overhanging banyan treesthe two most prominent ones forming the goats horns to the left of the cliff lay a crescent of white sand roughly the size of a standard house deck with the sun on its downward arc toward nightfall the lagoon was cast in deep shade the water was glass calm in the canopy came a symphony of squawks and buzzes not a bad place to spend the night remi agreed not the four seasons but it does have a certain charm the question is are we in the right place i dont know the answer to that but one things for certain weve got a cave sam pointed then turned the rudder and steered toward the cliff face throttling down as he drew alongside it the water here moving in a barely perceptible clockwise rotation gave off a faint iridescent shimmer which generally indicated an outflow of fresh water sam dug out his dive goggles from the duffel bag at his feet pressed them to his eyes and dipped his face into the water which despite being warmed by the sun all day felt cool on his skin dozens of fish darted this way and that squabbling over invisible bits of nutrients being stirred up by the freshwater current sam lifted his head out he dipped his fingertip into the water and brought it to his lips it tasted only about a third as salty as true seawater underground river remi asked has to be sam replied shaking the water from his hair though it was an uncommon phenomenon sea caves in this area did on occasion link up with both solutional and fractureguided caves which in turn joined underground inland streams ill have to look at a map i think were only a couple miles from lake george i wouldnt be surprised if this system dumps out there or even down to salt lake neither would i but if you dont mind id prefer we put that adventure on our someday list deal sam checked his watch high tide was thirty minutes away if they were going to explore the cave theyd have to do it within the next hour lest they find themselves fighting the full force of the outflow ideally they would enter at the end of the inflow use the fortyfive to sixtyminute window of relatively calm current to explore the cave then ride the outflow back out the problem was this was not a typical closed sea cave the source of the underground river inside would create volatile currents that could either trap them inside or suck them into fracture tunnels that led into the bowels of the island neither option appealed to sam he put the question to remi who replied id rather we wait but i know that look in your eye you want to go in better we find out now if were on the right track weve got seventyfive feet of rope we tie one end to a banyan root out here the other end to my weight belt if i get into trouble i can haul myself out and if you bonk your head and are out cold every sixty seconds ill give the line three tugs i miss one of those and you haul me out using the dinghy time limit ten minutes not a second more remi considered this for a few moments narrowed her eyes at him then sighed okay jacques cousteau remember what i said though if you die ill never forgive you sam smiled and gave her a wink deal ten minutes later he was suited up and sitting in the bow remi glided the dinghy to a stop against the cliff sam moving carefully stood up and tied a bowline knot around a protruding root then sat down and secured the other end to the dring on his weight belt remi reversed the dinghy and stopped ten feet from the face using minute throttle adjustments to keep them stationary sam spit in his mask rubbed the saliva around the inside then dipped the mask into the water and slipped it on his head the lower edge resting just above his eyebrows next he slipped on his fins punched the regulator to test the airflow then nodded to remi luck she said ill be back he settled the mask over his eyes and rolled backward into the water he let himself hang motionless for a moment enjoying the sudden immersion and the striking clarity of the water that filled his vision he waited for the bubbles and froth to fully clear then tipped himself upright and did a pike dive for the bottom already feeling the tug of the current he let it take him rolling onto his side so he could watch the sundappled surface for a few fleeting seconds before the lip of the cliff appeared and he slipped into darkness he clicked on his dive light and cast it around the caves entrance was a rough half circle an arch ten to twelve feet wide and twenty feet tall at low tide its peak probably rose only a few inches above the lagoons surfacethat combined with the foliage blanketing the rock face rendered it all but invisible if not for the goats head clue they would have never found it he finned downward angling for the bottom and let his fingers trail in the sand after twenty or so feet the bottom suddenly dropped away into darkness he rolled back onto his side shined his light upward and saw the entrance arch had disappeared replaced by surface reflection he checked his watch and gave the line at his waist three solid tugs all okay remi he was suddenly enveloped by cool water and he felt a new current take hold of him this one pushing him to the right he realized he was spinning ever so slightly as though being pirouetted by an unseen hand whirlpool he thought with a trickle of panic the currents of the lagoon and the underground river were colliding the cooler water slipping beneath the warmer water creating a hydraulic tornado right now he was on the outer edge of the vortex so the current was strong but just manageable with finsalmost two knots he estimatedbut he knew it would grow stronger toward the center he pointed himself toward what he hoped was a wall and scissored his fins once twice then broke the surface his outstretched hand touched rock and he grasped at it his palm bumping over the surface before his fingers found purchase on an outcropping he jerked to a stop his legs trailing in the circular current he gave the line three hard tugs then checked his watch two minutes down eight to go aside from the soft gurgle of water rushing along the walls and some dripping sounds coming from deeper within the cave it was eerily quiet using his teeth he pulled the glove from his free hand and held his fingertips up instantly feeling the rush of cool air on his moist skin this was a good sign though he judged the possibility remote the caves connection to an underground river brought with it the chance of pollutants and while they would have seen signs of toxicity in the outflowa lack of fish discolored rocks dead spongesthere was also the chance of gas buildup the brisk airflow made this unlikely he pulled the regulator from his mouth and took a sniff then a breath all okay he gave the line another allokay signal then put his glove back on and shined the light around six feet above his head he got the first indication they were on the right track a crossplank catwalk suspended from the ceiling by rusted steel cables spanned the width of the cavern and ended at the opposite wall above a makeshift wooden pier supported by wooden pilings sunk into the sea floor a second catwalk joined the first at its midpoint and extended to the rear wall at a perpendicular angle the setup wasnt sophisticated by any means but clearly someone had put some effort into the structure and judging by the rust on the cables and the coating of slime on the wooden planking it had been quite a while ago the cavern was oval in shape perhaps fifty feet wide with a vaulted stalactitecovered ceiling that rose twenty feet above sams head panning the light along what should have been the back wall he saw only darkness hed imagined the juncture with the underground river would feature a gushing cleft in the wall but he now realized this cavern was simply an antechamber aside from a narrowing of the rear walls to a diameter of thirty feet there was no discernible separation between this cavern and the adjoining fractureguided system where and how far it went there was no telling was this catwalk and pier system enough to service a mini submarine or two sam wondered it would depend on what kind and how much work was required he decided this brought up another question why hadnt the work been done aboard the lothringen while at sea a question for selma the line at his waist began jerking violently and though theyd arranged no emergency signal from remis end he instinctively knew that was exactly what she was telling him he slipped the regulator back between his teeth flipped over and dove then scissored hard into the entrance pulling himself hand over hand along the line as the light from the lagoons surface appeared he angled toward the ceiling and rolled onto his back using his fins to keep himself away from the rock he slipped past the entrances leading edge and broke the surface beneath a curtain of vines suppressing the urge to call remis name he looked around the lagoon was empty the dinghy was gone along with remi chapter his rising fear turned to immediate relief as he saw a hand emerge from the undergrowth along the bank across the lagoon the hand was pointed toward him palm out wait a second later remis face emerged from the foliage she tapped her ear pointed toward the sky and made a vertical twirling motion with her index finger ten seconds passed then twenty a full minute and then he heard it the thumping of a helicopter blade faint and then moving closer sam poked his head out from beneath the vines and peered into the sky trying to localize the sound directly above his head spinning rotor blades appeared over the edge of the cliff followed a second later by a curved plexiglas windscreen glinting in the setting sun the lagoons surface rippled with the downwash a fine mist filling the air sam pulled his head back remi wriggled back out of sight for what seemed like minutes but was probably less than thirty seconds the helicopter hovered over the lagoon then banked away and headed south along the coast sam waited until the thumping faded away then ducked beneath the surface and stroked hard across the lagoon until his belly touched sand he broke the surface to find remis outstretched hand before his face he grabbed it and she helped him crawl into the underbrush is it them she asked dont know but id rather assume so than be surprised plus thats an expensive birda bell i think four million at least ideally suited for a ukrainian mafia kingpin and with room enough to seat a russian henchman and eight of his best friends did they see you im not sure the first time it passed over it was moving fast but it swung around almost immediately then made two more passes theyre either curious about this spot or they know were here wheres the dinghy remi pointed off to the left and sam could see a few inches of gray rubber jutting from the foliage i got it under cover as quickly as i could good sam thought for a moment lets get into the cave if they decide to land and look around thats our best hiding spot ears tuned for any sign of the bells return sam shed his gear and handed it over to remi who started putting it on whatre you going to do she asked you cross the lagoon and slip into the cave and wait for me theres a clockwise current in there so watch yourself take up the slack on the rope and stay close to the entrance three tugs from my end is emergency two for all okay stay put got it ill bring the dinghy over and try to get it inside well wait until its dark then see what we can see remi nodded finished donning the dive gear took one last look around then crawled into the water and slipped beneath the surface sam watched her bubble trail cross the lagoon then slip out of sight into the cave next he crawled through the underbrush to where remi had hidden the dinghy he went still and closed his eyes listening but heard nothing after stuffing all their loose gear into their two sealline dry bags and securing them to the cleats he tied the dinghys eightfoot painter line around his belt slipped into the water and started breaststroking across the lagoon he was halfway across when suddenly from the direction of the beach he heard the pounding of rotors even as he looked over his shoulder the bell appeared over the tops of the palms and stopped in a hover above him the door was open and a figure in dark coveralls was leaning out and looking down at him it wasnt frobishers kidnapper arkhipov sam realized immediately but the other one whose photo rube had emailed to himkholkov nor was there any mistaking the stubby cylindrical object in kholkovs hands compact submachine gun he took a quick gulp of air flipped over and dove his head disappearing beneath the surface just as the dinghys side tube exploded with a whoosh the water rippled above him and in the corners of his eyes he saw bullets arcing through the water leaving trails of froth in their wake the dinghy trembled with each bullet impact popping and hissing then collapsed in on itself and slipped beneath the surface the trolling motor dragging it down stern first sam kicked his legs hard arms spread wide as he pushed and pulled himself toward the cave entrance the firing stopped for two secondssam thought reloadingthen resumed peppering the surface like hail the bullets penetrating four feet before their thrust fell off and they fell harmlessly to the bottom everything went dark as he slipped beneath the rock arch the poppoppop of gunfire and the thumping of rotors became muffled he rolled over and kicked upward hand groping for the ceiling rope rope come on he felt something brush his feet the dinghy sinking toward the bottom it had been caught by the caves inflow he felt a tug on his belt as the painter line went taut felt himself being dragged along he was distantly aware of muffled gunfire continuing outside his fingers touched the rope he drew his dive knife from its calf sheath and sawed through it then he was moving being sucked inside lungs aching head pounding from oxygen deprivation sam fumbled trying to knot the rope around the knifes haft the knife slipped from his fingers bumped off his chest he caught it tried again managed to work a square knot then kicked for the surface and broke into air to the right in the corner of his eye he saw remi clinging to the rock wall he felt the vortex seize him start pulling him along sam what gimme all the slack you got sam tossed the knife in a high arc that took it up and over the catwalk as it plunged into the water he was already kicking that way hand reaching for the rope suddenly he was jerked away from it toward the wall as the dinghy was pulled deeper into the circular current remi the rope throw it coming he heard splashing saw her stroking behind him the dinghy was full deadweight now he was jerked beneath the surface water gushed into his mouth and nose grab it remi called right in front of you sam felt something brush his cheek and he slapped at it his fingers touched the rope and he closed his fist around it he jerked to a stop he caught his breath waiting for the sparkling behind his eyes to subside then looked over his shoulder remi was hanging half out of the water from the other end of the rope the dive light dangled from her belt loop casting dancing shadows over the walls nice toss sam said thanks are you okay yeah you just barely they hung still for a few moments getting their bearings then sam said im going to hoist you up to the catwalk tie off the rope and then ill join you right remis triweekly ninetyminute power yoga and pilates sessions showed their value in spades as she shimmied up the rope like a monkey then rolled onto the catwalk the planks gave a sharp pop followed by a slow splintering sound remi froze spread yourself flat sam said distribute your weightslowly she did so and then using her knees and elbows put some test pressure on the boards until satisfied none were going to give way i think were okay she shed her fins secured them to her belt then tied off the rope ive got the dinghy and all our gear hanging from my belt sam said im going to try to save it okay between remis knot and him there was only twenty feet of exposed rope the rest was trailing in the current sam reeled in ten feet of rope fashioned a temporary waist harness and then working by feel alone secured a closed clove hitch around his belt and the knotted end of the painter line right hand clenched around the line above his head he pulled the release loop on the harness with a wet zipping sound the rope went taut it lifted from the surface trembled for a few seconds then steadied i think itll hold sam called then climbed the rope and rolled onto the platform beside remi she hugged him tightly damp hair splayed over his face i guess that gunfire answered our question she whispered id say so you sure youre not hit remi asked eyes and hands probing his chest arms and stomach im sure wed better get a move on something tells me theyre not done yet while sam knew remi was almost certainly right he also knew they had few options go out the way theyd come in find another way out fight or hide the first option was a nonstarterit would play right into their pursuers hands the second option a huge question markthis cave system could be a dead end for them both figuratively and literally the third also a nonstarter while they were armed with guido the shoemakers snubnosed revolver kholkov and his men were armed with assault rifles the fourth option to hide was their only viable chance to get out of this the question was how long would their pursuers wait before following them here they had one thing on their side sam realized checking his watch the inflow period was ending in a few minutes the current would start flowing out again making entry difficult so this is what passes for a makeshift secret nazi submarine pen remi said shucking off the remainder of her gear probably so but theres no way of telling until we find no sam that wasnt a question look sam turned remi was shining the flashlight on the rock wall above the pier clearly homemade out of pounded tin and paint that had long ago lost most of its color the fourbythreefoot rectangle was nonetheless recognizable kriegsmarine nazi flag sam whispered in his hurried survey of the cavern hed missed it the pride of home ownership i suppose remi laughed taking it one careful step at a time probing for weak spots as they went they made their way across the catwalk to the pier aside from a few nervewracking creaks and pops the planking held firm the cables though coated in a thick layer of slimy rust were similarly solid bolted into the ceiling and rock walls by thumbsized steel eyelets under the helpful beam of remis flashlight sam recrossed the catwalk grabbed the rope and returned to the pier dragging the submerged dinghy along together they hauled it up onto the pier while the dinghy itself was shredded the motor and attached gas can had miraculously survived with only a few bullet scrapes similarly of their two dry bags one was riddled with a dozen or more holes the other unscathed well sort through this see what we can salvage sam said they walked to the end to have a look at the rear wall the second chamber was as sam had suspected a fractureguided system while thousands of years of water erosion had smoothed the walls of the main cavern the secondary chamber had jagged and wildly angled walls at the juncture were two tunnels in the shape of a wide v one tunnel slanting upward to the left the other slanting downward to the right water sluiced from the lefthand tunnel half its volume coursing into the main cavern the other half disappearing down the righthand tunnel theres your river remi said it cant have been here long sam replied walls are too rough how long do you think no more than a hundred years id say here let me see the light grab my belt loop will you remi did as he asked leaning backward as sam leaned forward he shined the light down the righthand tunnel then said huh okay reel me in what remi asked the tunnel curves back to the right just around the corner i can see another pier and more catwalks the plot thickens chapter using what remaining rope they hadsixty feet of the original seventyfivethey set up a system to ferry themselves and their gear down the righthand tunnel remi went first with sam giving her slack from a loop around the piling until she reached the next pier okay she called its about thirty feet id say sam reeled in the line then attached the motor the dinghy which they didnt want to leave for their pursuers to find should they have any doubt about whether their quarry was still in the cave the two dry bags and the dive gear to the end once done he played out the line until remi called okay hold it he could hear her grunting as she fished the gear from the water tied off from the entrance sam heard a gurgling sound then the tellale sputtering blow of a regulator breaking into air he dropped onto his belly and went still face pressed to the piers planking a flashlight clicked on and played over the walls and ceiling in the ambient glow sam could see the mans head floating beside him was a bulletshaped objecta batterypowered sea scooter sam realized combined with good fins and strong legs a sea scooter could propel a pound man at a speed of four or five knots so much for the outflow advantage sam thought the man threw what looked like a grappling hook over the catwalk gave the attached rope a tug then shouted in russianaccented english all clear come on the man turned the scooter toward the dock and started across the cavern sam didnt give himself a chance to think or secondguess but gave the rope three emergency tugs then rolled over the edge and lowered himself into the water the current caught him and took him down the tunnel a few seconds later the next pier came into view remi was kneeling on the edge taking up the slack sam put his finger to his lips and she nodded and helped him onto the pier bad guys he whispered how much time have we got only enough to hide sam looked around an eshaped grid of catwalks spanned the cavern connecting this pier to another against the opposite wall both piers held stacks of wooden crates bearing the kriegsmarine emblem though almost twice as large as the first this cavern was of the fractureguided variety which meant they would find no exit on the seaward side or would they sam thought shining the light around hanging from the ceiling in the far corner was what hed initially taken for an especially long stalactite under the flashlights beam he could now see it was actually a desiccated tangle of roots and vines drooping nearly to the waters surface a way out she asked maybe the currents slower in here half a knot no more remi agreed from the first cavern they heard a pair of voices calling to one another then a third a gunshot echoed down the tunnel then another then a tensecond burst shooting into the water sam whispered theyre trying to flush us out look here sam he turned the light around and pointed it at the water where she was pointing resting just beneath the surface was a curved shape hull remi whispered i think youre right we might have just found the um come on we got some work to do explaining his plan on the go they wrapped the motor and the rest of their gear inside the riddled dinghy cinched it shut using the painter line then sank the bundle beneath the pier next they cut off a thirtyfoot section of rope and started tying loops every few feet once that was done sam asked her which part do you want you dive ill climb she gave him a quick kiss then grabbed the rope and started half running half creeping across the catwalk sam took the flashlight slipped off the pier and dove he immediately realized this was not a molchclass mini sub it was far too small at least six feet shorter and half the diameter of the um it was a marderclass boat he decided essentially a pair of ge torpedoes stacked atop one another the upper one hollowed out and converted into a cockpitbattery compartment with an acrylicglass viewing dome the lower one a live detachable torpedo following the curve of the hull to the bottom sam could immediately see there was no torpedo attached but only a cockpit tube lying on its side the viewing dome half buried in the sand he kicked down the length of the hull to the dome laid the flashlight in the sand and set to work on the unlatching bolts they were frozen in place time sam time his lungs began to burn he wrapped both hands around a bolt braced his feet on the hull and heaved nothing tried again nothing through the water he heard muffled voices again this time closer he clicked off the flashlight looked up got his bearings then kicked off the sub and swam toward the far wall the piers pilings appeared in the gloom and he slipped between them and turned right following the wall clearing the pier he let himself float upward and gently break the surface across the cavern and down the adjoining river tunnel he could see lights dancing off the wallskholkov and his men at the end of the pier theyd be coming here next ten feet to sams left the root vine tangle hung just above the surface close up it was even larger than hed estimated as big around as a fiftyfivegallon drum he sidestroked to it dug around a moment and found remis rope he started climbing a minute later and fifteen feet higher his reaching hand found remis foot which was resting in a loop he gave it a reassuring squeeze and got a wiggle in reply he placed his foot inside a loop did the same with his right hand then got comfortable luck she whispered no locked up tight now what now we wait their wait was short kholkovs men moved fast using generally the same ferryrope system sam and remi had used to reach the second pier peering through the vines sam counted six men one of them stalked down the pier shining a flashlight over the crates into the water and down the catwalks where the hell are they he barked it was kholkov himself sam realized you four flush them out kholkov ordered then he nodded at the other man and said you with me as kholkov and one man searched the crates the others lined up at the piers edge and started firing short controlled bursts into the water after nearly a minute kholkov called cease fire cease fire theres something down there one of the men called shining his light into the water kholkov walked over looked a few moments then pointed to two of the men thats it get your gear and have a look the men were back in five minutes and five minutes after that they were diving under the water search the cavern first kholkov ordered them make sure theyre not hiding somewhere in a cloud of bubbles the men disappeared beneath the surface sam watched their lights move over the bottom under both piers and along the walls before finally both men resurfaced not here one of them reported theres no place to hide sam let out the breath hed been holding theyd missed the sunken gear perhaps they went down the river tunnel the man standing beside kholkov suggested kholkov considered this for a moment youre sure there was nothing he asked the divers both men nodded and kholkov turned to the man whod suggested the river tunnel take pavel rope yourselves off and search the tunnel for any sign of them the man nodded moved to the end of the pier and began uncoiling a rope search the sub kholkov ordered the divers who both replaced their regulators and dove sam watched their lights move along the hull until they stopped at what he assumed was the cockpit dome the lights wobbled and shifted and there came a faint clinking of metal on metal after three more minutes one of the men broke the surface and pulled the regulator from his mouth its a marder the man said the good kholkov replied the bolts are frozen though we need the crowbar one of the men on the pier kneeled beside a backpack and pulled out a crowbar the diver swam over took it and dove again there were five more minutes of muffled metalonmetal banging then silence for a few moments then suddenly a giant bubble burst on the waters surface the minutes ticked by until finally both divers broke the surface again one of them gave a hoot and lifted an oblong object from the water bring it kholkov ordered when they reached the pier he knelt down and took the object which sam could now see was an alltoofamiliar loafshaped wooden box kholkov studied the box for a full minute turning it this way and that peering closely at its surface before carefully lifting the lid and peeking inside he closed it and nodded good work from the river tunnel a shout help pull us in pull us in several of the men rushed down the pier and began hauling the rope hand over hand after ten seconds a man appeared at the end of it lights panned over him he was semiconscious half his face covered in blood they pulled him onto the dock and laid him flat wheres pavel kholkov demanded the man mumbled something incoherent kholkov slapped him across the face and grabbed his chin answer me wheres pavel the rapids the line got cut he hit his head i tried to reach him but he was gone one second he was there then he was gone hes gone damn it kholkov spun around paced halfway down the pier then spun back okay you two carry him and get back to the lagoon he pointed to the other man you and i will set the charges if theyre not already dead well bury the fargos alive get moving chapter kholkov and his men left gesturing for remi to follow sam scrambled down the rope shifted his weight back and forth to get a swing going then nodded to remi who jumped off onto the catwalk followed by sam they knelt down together you think he meant it remi whispered i doubt they have enough explosive to bury us but they can certainly seal the main entrance did you check for an opening up there he asked nodding at the tangle of roots she nodded it was nothing but a crackno wider than a couple inches and a good six feet to the surface but you saw daylight yes suns going down well exit or not at least well have an air shaftbut theyve got the damned bottle one thing at a time sam youre right lets get off this catwalk before the as if on cue there came a whump from the main cavern followed by two more in quick succession down sam pushed her to the ground and lay on top of her a few seconds later they felt a gust of cool air wash over them a cloud of dust billowed through the tunnel and filled the cavern the heavier particles peppering the surface like rain sam and remi looked up ah alone at last remi murmured sam grinned stood up brushed himself off and pulled her to her feet you want to stay for a while no thanks well then we better get busy on our escape pod remi put her hands on her hips whatre you talking about sam unclipped the flashlight from his belt and shined it in the water illuminating the subs hull im talking about that explain fargo ill check to be sure but chances are we cant go out the way we came and no one knows exactly where we are so we shouldnt count on rescue that leaves one option down the river oh you mean down the river that killed one of kholkovs men and sucked him into limbo that river it goes somewhere that tunnel is a good fifteen feet in diameter and the waters moving fast and steady if it narrowed anywhere down the line wed see backflow or signs of a higher tide line on the walls believe me it dumps out somewhereeither aboveground in a lake or pond or into another sea cave and youre sure about this reasonably theres a subjective judgment if ive ever heard one remi chewed her lip for a moment what about this you work your engineering magic with one of the tanks and blow a hole in the ceiling crack not enough power and we might bring the whole roof down on us true okay we can wait for daylight then set the root tangle on fire itll be a smoke signal she caught herself and frowned scratch that wed asphyxiate long before help arrived youve done as much cave diving as i have sam said you know the geology that rivers our best chance our only chance okay one problem though our escape pod is full of water and sitting fifteen feet below the surface sam nodded yes thats a problem after checking to make sure the main cavern was in fact sealed they returned to the secondary cave and got to work first retrieving their gear from the bottom then scrounging through the kriegsmarine crates for any odds and ends that might be of use in addition to a wellstocked toolbox of mostly rusted tools they found four lanterns and a dozen stubby votivelike candles that lit at the first touch from sams lighter soon the pier and surrounding water was dimly lit by flickering yellow light while remi sorted through their remaining gear and conducted an inventory of the toolbox sam stood at the edge of the pier staring distantly into the water okay remi said weve got two air tanks one twothirds full a second completely full two flashlights both working charge unknown my cameras shot but the binoculars are fine the revolver is dry but i cant vouch for the bullets two canteens of water and some slightly soggy beef jerky a firstaid kit your gerber nautilus multitool one dry bag thats in good shape one thats swiss cheese and finally two cell phones that are dry working almost fully charged but useless inside here the motor i dried it out as best i could but we wont know until we try it as for the gas tank i didnt find any holes and all the valves are sealed so i think its fine sam nodded and went back to staring at the water after ten minutes of this he cleared his throat and said okay we can do it he walked over and sat down beside remi lets hear it she said he started explaining when he was done remi pursed her lips tilted her head and then nodded where do we start it started with a tense claustrophobic crawl for sam he had no trouble with either confined spaces or water but had no love for the two combined wearing only his mask and a dive belt he first did a series of practice dives to expand his lung capacity then spent a full minute on the surface doing deepbreathing exercises to oxygenate his blood to its maximum he took a final breath then dove to the bottom flashlight extended before him he wriggled through the subs dome hatch and turned aft he knew from his cursory study of kriegsmarine subs back in the pocomoke the nose section of a marderclass boat held only a seat and some rudimentary steerage and diving controls what he was looking forthe scuttle valveswould be in the tail section pulling and pushing himself along the interior piping he felt the cylindrical walls close around him felt the darkness and the water pressing him crushing him he felt the hot bloom of fear in his chest he quashed it and refocused scuttle valve sam scuttle he shined his flashlight left right ahead he was looking for a lever a raised cylindrical fitting in the hull and then suddenly there it was ahead and to the left he reached out grasped the lever and heaved stuck he drew his dive knife wedged it between the lever and hull then tried again with a squelch and spurt of rust the lever gave way lungs pounding he turned to the opposite valve repeated the process then backed out and finned to the surface you okay remi called define okay not mortally wounded then yes im okay the next part of the plan took three hours most of which they spent sorting and splicing the rope the germans had left behind about half of which was either completely rotted or so weakened sam wasnt willing to trust it they would get only one chance at what they were attempting he told remi if they failed they would have to turn to her signal fire idea and hope help would arrive before the smoke killed them after four hours at nearly two am according to sams watch they were almost ready they stood at the edge of the pier studying their handiwork two quadruplebraided lines one secured to the subs bow and the other to its stern cleats rose from the water to the ceiling where remi superb climber that she was had threaded each through a catwalk ceiling eyelet from there each line dropped down again and was tied off to a cable under the catwalk planking the vertical support cables were themselves connected midpoint to midpoint by a carefully constructed spiderweb of rope to one of the cablesthe farthest one from the lines secured to the subsam had lashed one of their scuba tanks so remi said lets review you shoot the tank the blast sheers the cables the catwalk drops the sub pops to the surface and the water drains out is that it more or less the tank wont explode but itll take off like a rocket if ive rigged it right the torque should part the weakened cables beyond that its all math and chaos theory estimating the weight of the sub and the water inside it as well as the combined weight of the catwalks and the shearing limit of the cables had given sam a headache but he was fairly confident in his process using the ancient and rusted but stillserviceable hacksaw theyd found in the toolbox hed cut halfway through eleven of the eighteen vertical catwalk cables and gravity remi added curling her arm in his win or lose im proud of you she handed him the revolver its your mousetrap you get the honors they climbed behind the protective bulwark of crates theyd assembled at the far end of the dock and made sure everything was snug around them save sams firing slit ready he asked remi cupped her ears and nodded sam braced his gun hand on his opposite forearm took aim and pulled the trigger the guns report was instantly overwhelmed by a whumpwhoosh a flash of light the shriek of rending steel and a thunderous splash sam and remi peeked their heads above the bulwark but for ten full seconds could see nothing but a fine mist filling the cavern slowly it cleared they climbed out and walked to the edge of the pier and looked down never had any doubt remi murmured the marderclass mini submarine um having spent the last sixty years of its life lying on the bottom of a sea cave now sat perfectly upright on the surface water gushing from its scuttles beautiful was all sam could say chapter with a reverberating gong that both sam and remi felt in their heads the sub glanced over another boulder tipped hard to port then snapped upright and nosed over plunging back into the rivers main channel water sluiced over the acrylic dome obscuring sams view for a few moments then cleared he clicked on the flashlight and shined it over the bow but could see only rock walls flashing past on either side and whitewater crashing over the nose cone the deadly seriousness of the experience notwithstanding it was a lot like a ride at disney world sam decided you okay back there he called remi lying behind the cockpit seat arms braced against the hull shouted back peachy how long have we been going sam checked his watch twenty minutes my god is that all after recovering from the mild shock that their plan had actually worked sam and remi had climbed into the water and hung from the subs bow line lifting the nose a few more inches off the surface and allowing the rest of the water to drain out remi had then crawled inside and closed both scuttles from there theyd had little work to do check the sub for leaks and shore up the inside with a few carefully positioned planks from the catwalk the fiftygallon ballast tanksa fourinch pipe running lengthwise down the port and the starboard sidewere full and nicely balanced the sub satisfied they were as prepared as possible theyd caught four hours of sleep huddled together on the pier in a circle of lanterns at dawn theyd risen eaten a breakfast of tepid water and damp beef jerky then piled a few essentials into the sub and climbed aboard using a catwalk plank sam had paddled the sub to the mouth of the river tunnel then closed the hatch and held on so far the subs reinforced aluminum hull was holding up well but they both knew geology was also on their side while the tunnel walls were still jagged the rocks and boulders in the channel itself had long ago been smoothed by erosion leaving no sharp edges to rip the hull brace yourself sam called big rock the subs nose slammed squarely into the boulder rose up and over the crest then veered left the current caught the tail section and spun it around slamming the hull against the wall ouch remi shouted over the rush okay just another bruise for my collection well get you a swedish massage when we get back to the four seasons ill hold you to that one hour turned into two as sam and remi rode the rapids the sub caroming off the walls vaulting over boulders and tossing from one side to the other in the water occasionally they would find themselves in wider calmer parts of the river allowing sam to open the dome and let in some fresh air to supplement the oxygen remi was intermittently pumping into the space via their remaining scuba tank almost like clockwork every few minutes the sub slammed into a jumble of boulders and they would find themselves beached the sub either lying on its side or perched above the rapids balanced like a teetertotter each time either they would dislodge themselves by gently rocking from side to side until the sub slipped back into the channel or sam would have to open the dome and push and lever them free using his plank paddle nearing their third hour of travel the sound of rushing water suddenly faded the sub slowed and began spinning lazily whats happening remi called not sure replied sam he pressed his face to the dome and found himself staring up at a vaulted stalactiteencrusted ceiling he heard a scraping sound and looked left just in time to see a curtain of vines close over the dome like the swaying carpet arms inside an automated car wash sunlight burst through the dome filling the interior with a yellow glow is that the sun remi said you bet it is the hull scraped over sand slowed then came to a gentle halt sam peered ahead theyd run aground in another lagoon remi i think we have arrived he unlatched the dome and swung it open cool salttinged air rushed through the hatch he draped his arms outside letting them hang then leaned his head back and let the sun wash over his face he heard something off to his left opened his eyes and turned his head sitting on the sand ten feet away were a young couple wearing dive fins and scuba harnesses mouths agape and frozen in place they stared at sam the man had a farmers tan the woman whiteblond hairmidwesterners on a tropical adventure good morning sam said doing a little cave diving i see the couple nodded in unison saying nothing be careful you dont get lost in there sam offered it can be a little tricky getting back out by the way what year is it leave the nice people alone sam remi whispered from the back chapter heaven remi murmured absolute heaven true to his word upon returning to their four seasons villa sam had after theyd shared a long hot shower ordered first a sumptuous lunch of seafood salad hot sourdough bread and a tropical fruit bowl then a pair of masseuses whod spent an hour giving them a hot stone massage before moving to deeptissue swedish sam and remi lay side by side on the veranda the sheer curtains billowing around them in a light tropical breeze down the beach the breakers gently washed in and out natures own lullaby sam hovering on the edge of sleep simply muttered this is living the surprised couple theyd encountered upon their exit from the cave had in fact been midwesternersmike and sarah from minnesota and on their honeymoon after three tries theyd answered sams where are we question on rum cays northern coast between junkanoo rock and liberty rock they had by sams calculation traveled some nine miles along the underground river mike and sarah had graciously offered to give them a rideand a tow to the mini sub to which sam had grown quite attacheddown the coast in their rented boat fortytwo hours after first touching down at rum cay sam and remi were back at their landing beach their host the mysterious beachcomber was nowhere to be seen so they muscled the sub into the undergrowth and left a note on the huts wall please keep an eye on this well be back for it sam had no idea exactly what he had planned but it seemed wrong to simply abandon it they then climbed aboard the bonanza and headed for the main island and their hotel massages complete sam and remi lay still for a while dozing then got up and went back inside having already given selma a were okay text message sam now called her and put her on speakerphone he gave her a quick rundown of their cave odyssey well no one can accuse the fargos of taking mundane vacations selma replied i may have an answer to one mysterywhy it was kholkov who came after you rube called grigoriy arkhipov was found dead in a yalta parking lot his hands and feet were missing amputation by shotgun rube told me to tell us to be careful sam finished we are the question is how did kholkov find you weve been wondering that ourselves did you check our no credit checks on the account you used and all our computers here are firewalled so i doubt they got your itinerary that way same with your passport records the government is tight with those remi said that leaves airlines or some lead they have that we dont sam finished but that begs the question why hadnt they already raided the caves ill keep working on it selma said but i dont think it came from our end until we know well assume the worst and keep looking over our shoulders remi said good so about this submarine the um sam offered right you want me to get it back here wed better remi replied or sam is going to pout its a piece of history he grumbled theyd agreed that once this was all over they would tell both the german and the bahamian governments about the sub pens and let the two sort it out among themselves and if no one wants it remi had asked well put it above our mantel remi had groaned thats what i was afraid of now on the phone selma said ill work it out might take a few days but ill get it back here so kholkov got the bottle afraid so any news for us yes in fact a few things i think youll find interesting care to guess what else besides the spitting beetle is found only in the tuscan archipelago remi answered first our black rose right again well have to fill in the timeline but it seems likely the ink was applied to the labels during napoleons stay on elba or afterward with ink from there sam added either way its another piece in the puzzle well heres another one selma said our bottle appears to be something of an onion wrapped in a riddle the leather label is not one piece but two layers pressed together i managed to peel away the top layer without causing any damage and theres no ink present but more etchingsa grid of symbols eight across and four down for a total of thirtytwo what kind of symbols you name it everything from alchemy to cyrillic to astrology and everything in between my guess theyre customized shape codes with no connection to their origin sam youre probably familiar with shape code he was during his training at the cias camp perry theyd spent three days on cryptographic history its essentially a substitution cipher he explained to remi he grabbed a pad and pen from the nightstand and quickly sketched three symbols sam said now suppose the first symbol represents the letter c the second a the third t cat remi said seems pretty simplistic it is in a sense but in another sense its a virtually unbreakable code the military uses a version of it something called a onetime pad the theory is this two people have an encodingdecoding book one sends a message using shape codes the other deciphers it by substituting letters for shapes without a book all youve got is random symbols to anyone else theyre meaningless and we dont have a book remi said nope selma can you send us on the way as we speak its not the original picture i took of the label but wendy used a vector drawing program to recreate some of the symbols thisll be just a sample a moment later sams email beeped and he called up the image as for decoding it i might have an idea about thatat least a place to start selma said you remember the mystery man the major who hired the smuggler arienne to sail to saint helena of course remi said i think i know who the major is i ran across an obscure german biography of napoleon written in the s in when napoleon was nine he was sent to a french military school briennelechâteau near troyes there he met a boy named arnaud laurent and they became friendsall through école royale militaire college then on to artillery school and so on all the way to waterloo according to the author up until the mid s just before the first italian campaign laurent had been a step ahead of napoleon in rank it was said that in private or in close company napoleon jokingly called laurent the major napoleon had several confidants over the years but none as close as laurent is there an estate sam asked an arnaud laurent library by chance no such luck theres not much out there on laurent but from what i gather when he died in just four years after napoleon he was buried with what one article referred to as his most prized possession which with any luck will be a handydandy decoder ring sam said or book remi added selma wheres he buried after his army was routed at waterloo napoleons surrender was accepted aboard the hms bellerophon along with napoleons staff which im guessing included laurent who was at the time his chief military adviser afterward the bellerophon sailed to plymouth where after a twoweek wait napoleon was transferred to the hms northumberlandalone with no stafffor the final voyage to saint helena when laurent died his widow marie asked the british for permission to have him buried on saint helena next to napoleon but they refused so she did what she thought was next best thing she had him laid to rest on elba strange remi said its poetic sam replied laurents general his best friend had died in exile and been buried in exile his widow had chosen a spot of sam searched for the right word symbolic solidarity remi tilted her head at her husband thats beautiful sam i have my moments selma napoleons remains werent they moved from saint helena they were interesting story itself really in the bourbons who retook the throne after napoleons defeat at waterloo were themselves overthrown by the orléans dynasty they were a little more nostalgic over napoleon so they petitioned the british for permission to bring him home after seven years of wrangling the brits agreed and the remains were fetched from saint helena and returned to paris his official grave is under the dome of les invalides laurents grave is still on elbaits a crypt actually the trick is how do you handle it i assume youd prefer to avoid breaking in and playing tomb raiders ideally sam said then youve got to get permission and as luck would have it laurent has a granddaughter five or six times removed living in monaco ah monaco in the spring sam murmured how can we say no we cant remi chimed in chapter principality of monaco french riviera sam pulled their rented olive green porsche cayenne suv down the lilaclined driveway and stopped before a fourstory white stucco terracottaroofed villa overlooking the waters off point de la veille as it turned out arnaud laurents distant granddaughter yvette fournierdesmarais was embarrassingly wealthy having inherited her late husbands interests in a number of monaco businesses including a half dozen beach resorts and motor sporting clubs according to the gossip rags she was at age fiftyfive monacos most eligible bachelorette and since her husbands death fifteen years earlier had been courted by an impressive collection of europes jet set from princes to celebrities to captains of industry shed dated all of them but none for longer than four months and was rumored to have turned down dozens of marriage proposals she lived alone in her villa with a modest staff and a scottish deerhound named henri surprisingly sam and remi had had little trouble arranging a meeting first presenting their credentials and request to ms fournierdesmaraiss lawyer in nice who in turn agreed to contact his client shed emailed them directly within a day and insisted they come immediately they climbed out of the porsche and walked into the front courtyard and along a path between a pair of bubbling fountains to the front door twin slabs of mahogany and stained glass that rose four feet above their heads sam pressed the button on the wall and a soft chime sounded from within a marcia de muneghu remi said what the doorbell chimeits a marcia de muneghu the march of monaco its the national anthem here sam smiled read some guidebooks on the plane did we when in rome the door opened revealing a railthin middleaged man in matching navy blue slacks and polo shirt mr and mrs fargo yes his accent was british he didnt wait for a reply but merely stepped aside and tipped his chin they stepped into the foyer which was simply but tastefully done light gray egyptian slate on the floor and a soft mediterranean blue plaster on the walls a silverframed mirror sat above a nineteenthcentury english sheraton painted demilune console table my name is langdon the man said shutting the door the mistress is on the veranda this way please they followed him down the hall past the formal rooms to the private half of the house then out a pair of french doors onto a mul titiered deck made from polished burled walnut youll find her there langdon said gesturing up a set of stairs that wound along the villas outer wall if youll excuse me langdon turned and disappeared back through the french doors my god look at that view remi said walking to the railing sam joined her below an embankment of rock outcrops palm trees and flowering tropical shrubs lay the breadth of the mediterranean a carpet of indigo stretching beneath a cloudless sky a female voice called its a sight i never tire of either they turned a woman in a plain white sundress and sunflower yellow broadbrimmed hat stood at the top of the steps this was they assumed yvette fournierdesmarais but neither sam nor remi would have guessed her to be older than forty beneath the hat her face was tanned but not baked with barely perceptible laugh lines around a pair of hazel eyes sam and remi yes she asked walking down the stairs hand outstretched im yvette thank you for coming her english was excellent with the slightest trace of a french accent they shook her hand in turn then followed her up the stairs and around the back to an openair sunroom draped in gauze curtains and appointed in teak chairs and chaise lounges a large sleek brown and black dog sitting in the shade beside one of the chairs started to rise upon seeing sam and remi but sat back down again at his mistresss soft sit henri once they were all settled she said im not what you expected am i sam replied to be honest no mrs yvette yvette to be honest no youre not at all she laughed her white teeth flashing in the sun and you remi you were expecting someone more matronly perhaps a french bejeweled snob with a poodle under one arm and a champagne flute in the other im sorry but yes i was oh goodness dont apologize the woman i just described is more the rule than the exception here the truth is i was born in chicago went to grade school there for a few years before my parents moved us back to nice they were simple people my mother and fatherquite wealthy but with simple tastes without them i might have ended up the stereotype you were expecting langdon appeared up the stairs and placed a tray containing a carafe of iced tea and frosted glasses on the table between them thank you langdon yes maam he turned to go have fun tonight langdon and good luck yes maam thank you once he was out of earshot yvette leaned forward and whispered langdons been dating a widow for a year now hes going to ask her to marry him langdon is one of the best formula one drivers in monaco you know really sam replied oh yes very famous if you dont mind me asking why is he working for me sam nodded and she said weve been together for thirty years since i started dating my late husband i pay him well and we like each other hes not quite a butler really but more of a what is the word in american football he would be called a free safety yes thats it he wears many hats for me langdon was a commando before he retiredbritish special air service very tough fellow anyway well hold the wedding and reception hereproviding she says yes of course you two should come you really should you dont mind iced tea do you she asked pouring for them not really the beverage of the wealthy but i love it sam and remi each accepted a glass from her so arnaud laurent my greatgreatgreatsomething grandfather youre interested in him yes very much remi said first may i ask why you agreed to see us ive read about you about your adventures and your charitable work i admire the way you live your lives you know at the risk of being crass there are families here that are frighteningly rich so much so that they couldnt spend all their money if they tried and yet they give none of it away as far as im concerned the tighter you cling to money the tighter its hold on you dont you agree we do sam replied so thats why i agreed to see you i knew i would like you and i was right and i was also intrigued about how arnaud fit into whatever quest youre onyoure on a quest yes an adventure more or less marvelous perhaps i can tag along sometime well i apologize im running at the mouth do you mind sharing with me the nature of your work remi and sam exchanged glances each reading the others expression their instincts which were more often right than wrong told them they could trust yvette fournierdesmarais sam said we stumbled across a bottle of wine very rare that might be connected to arnaud napoleons lost cellar yes well yes maybe thats fantastic yvette said laughing wonderful if anyone should find the cellar it should be you two of course ill help in any way i can youll do the right thing i know back to arnaud in all fairness i should tell you youre not the first ones to ask about him a man called my attorney a few months ago did you get his name sam asked my attorney has it but i dont remember something russian i think anyway the man was quite insistent even a little rude so i chose not to see him sam remi i can see from your faces this means something to you do you know who im talking about we might sam replied weve run into our own illmannered russian and given how far hes been willing to go were probably talking about the same person you havent had any unwelcome company remi asked her no no and im not worried between langdon and his three cohortswho are lurking around here somewhereand the alarm system and henri here i feel completely safe not to mention im a fantastic shot with a pistol something you and remi have in common sam said is that true remi youre a marksman i wouldnt go that far yvette leaned forward and tapped remis knee when you can stay longer well go shooting just us girls theres a wonderful beach club in menton not far from here they have an indoor range so back to our russian villain he was very interested in arnauds crypt on elba i assume thats why you came to see me yes remi said well we told him nothing i suspected hed already been there and came away disappointed which was why he was so badly behaved what do you mean yvette leaned forward and lowered her voice to a conspiratorial whisper a few years ago there was some vandalism on elba just teenage children running amok but it got me thinking given who arnaud is and how zealous some napoleonophiles can be we decided to move arnauds sarcophagus to where sam asked off the island oh no its still there arnaud wouldnt have approved of being taken off elba no we found another graveyard with an empty crypt and moved him there hes safe and sound i assume youd like my permission to peek inside his sarcophagus thats why youve come yes sam smiled im glad you said it i wasnt sure of the etiquette when asking a relative if theyd mind us poking around their ancestors remains yvette waved her hand dismissively not to worry youll be respectful im certain anything you take youll return yes of course remi replied though none of it might be necessary weve been told arnaud was buried with some personal effects do you happen to know what they were no i dont im sorry im sure the only person who knew the answer to that was his wife marie and i can assure you the sarcophagus hasnt been opened since his death so now ill gladly tell you where to find the crypt but on one condition name it sam said youll both stay for dinner remi smiled wed love to wonderful when you reach elba youll be in rio marina from there youll drive west on the sp into the mountains chapter elba italy he let the beetle crawl up his finger and over the back of his hand before he nudged it with his other finger into his palm sam rose from his crouch alongside the dirt road and turned to remi who was taking pictures of the ocean far below historys a funny thing he said how so this beetle for all we know it could be related to one napoleon himself used to make the ink has it spit on you not as far as i can tell selma said the ink came from a spitting beetle youre missing my point wheres your sense of whimsy remi lowered her camera and looked at him sorry he said with a smile forgot who i was talking to i understand your point she checked her watch then said wed better get moving its almost three daylights burning their dinner the night before with yvette fournierdesmarais had gone late into the evening and well into three bottles of wine by which time she had convinced them to cancel their hotel reservations and stay the night they awoke the next morning and shared a veranda breakfast of coffee croissants fresh pineapple and french scrambled eggs with leeks fresh pepper and mint before heading to the airport for reasons neither sam nor remi had been able to deduce daily flights to and from elba were restricted to one airline intersky which serviced only three cities friedrichshafen munich and zurich the other two carriers skywork and elbafly offered more departure points but only flew three days a week so from nice theyd boarded an air france flight to florence then a train to piombino then finally a ferry across the tenmile stretch of sea to rio marina on elbas east coast their rental cara compact lancia deltapaled in comparison to the porsche cayenne but the air conditioner worked and the engine small though it was ran smoothly per yvettes instructions theyd driven inland from rio marina passing through one quaint tuscan village after anothertogliatti sivera san lorenzowinding their way through lush rolling hills and vineyards higher and higher into the mountains until stopping at this promontory overlooking the eastern side of the island if not for napoleons exile elba would not be the household name it was which as far as sam and remi were concerned was a shame as it had its own unique story over its long history elba had seen its share of invaders and occupiers from the etruscans to the romans to the saracens until the eleventh century when the island fell under the aegis of the republic of pisa from there it changed hands a half dozen times through sale or annexation starting with the visconti of milan and ending in when it became a protectorate of the kingdom of italy remi snapped a few more pictures then they got back in the car and continued on so where exactly did napoleon spend his exile sam asked remi flipped through her postit notemarked frommers guidebook in portoferraio on the northern coast he had two homes actually the villa san martino and the villa dei mulini he had a staff of somewhere between six hundred and one thousand and took the title emperor of elba took the title or was slapped in the face with it sam asked after having had a good chunk of europe under his thumb emperor of elba had to have been something of a letdown true another fun fact before leaving for elba napoleon tried to poison himself no kidding apparently he kept it in a bottle around his necka cocktail of opium belladonna and white hellabore before leaving on the russian campaign he had it mixed up he probably didnt want to fall into the hands of the cossacks well i cant say i blame him they still dont like him anyway he drank it but by then it was a couple years old and too weak he spent the night writhing in pain on the floor but survived remi youre a font of knowledge she ignored him still reading what none of the historians seemed to agree on is how exactly he escaped there were both french and prussian guards stationed all over the island and offshore there was a british manowar on constant patrol tricky little devil car behind us sam said a few minutes later remi turned and looked out the back window a half mile down the mountain road a creamcolored peugeot was rounding a curve it disappeared from view for a few moments behind a hillside then reappeared hes in a hurry since leaving the bahamas both sam and remi had been hypervigilant to signs of pursuit but had so far seen nothing the problem with an island as small as elba was that it had limited points of entry and bondaruks wealth could go a long way here sam tightened his grip on the wheel eyes alternating between the rearview mirror and the road ahead a couple minutes later the peugeot appeared behind them and closed the gap until it was only a few feet off their bumper glare from the sun kept the occupants in silhouette but sam could make out two shapes both male sam stuck his arm out the window and waved for them to pass the peugeot didnt move glued to their tail then abruptly it pulled out and started speeding up sam tensed his foot ready to hit the brake remi glanced out the passenger window there was the narrowest of dirt shoulders there followed by a sharp dropoff five hundred feet below she could see goats grazing in a pasture they looked like ants their passenger tire swerved a few inches right gravel peppered the side of the car sam eased left back onto blacktop buckled in he said through clenched teeth yep where are they coming up right now the peugeot drew even with sams door sitting in the passenger seat a swarthy man with a handlebar mustache stared at him the man nodded once curtly then the peugeots engine revved and it sprinted ahead and disappeared around the next bend friendly folks remi said with a loud exhale sam relaxed his hands on the wheel flexing his fingers to get blood flowing back into them how far left to go remi unfolded the map her finger tracing along five six miles they reached their destination in the late afternoon perched on the slopes of monte capanello and surrounded by forests of aleppo pines and juniper the village of rio nellelba population nine hundred sat under the shadow of the eleventhcentury castle volter raio and was to sams and remis eyes the epitome of a medieval tuscan village complete with narrow cobblestoned alleys shadowed piazzas and stone balconies overflowing with orchids and cascading lavender remi said says here rio nellelba is the rockhunting capital of tuscany theyre still finding mines that date back to the etruscans they found a parking spot across from the hermitage of santa caterina and got out according to yvette their contact a man named umberto cipriani was the assistant curator of the museo dei minerali the mining museum remi got herself oriented on the map and they started walking finding the museum ten minutes later as they crossed the piazza sam said here let me take your picture stand in front of the fountain she did as he asked smiled for several shots then rejoined sam who called up the images on the cameras lcd screen we should take another sam im a little out of focus i know look at what is in focus smile look pleased remi peered more closely at the image fifty feet behind her blurred figure she could see the hood of a creamcolored car jutting from the mouth of a shadowed alley behind the wheel a man stared at them through a pair of binoculars chapter playing the carefree tourist remi smiled and pressed her face against sams as they looked at the lcd screen our friendly tailgaters she whispered through her smile a coincidence id like to think so but the binoculars make me nervous unless hes an urban birdwatcher or hes stalking an exgirlfriend i think wed better assume the worst do you see the other one around the one with the mustache no come on lets go in act casual dont look around they entered the museum stopped at the welcome desk and asked for cipriani the receptionist picked up the phone and spoke a few words in italian and a few moments later a portly man with thinning saltandpepper hair appeared in the doorway to their right buon giorno the man said posso aiutarla youre up remi sam said while they both spoke several languages italian had for some reason always flummoxed him remi was the same way with german which came naturally to sam buon giorno she said signor cipriani sì parla inglese cipriani smiled broadly i speak english yes but your italian is very good how can i help you my name is remi fargo this is my husband sam they all shook hands ive been expecting you cipriani said is there somewhere we might speak in private certainly my office is this way he led them down a short hallway to an office with a window overlooking the piazza they all sat down and sam pulled yvettes letter from his pocket and handed it across to cipriani who scanned it carefully then handed it back forgive me may i see some identification please sam and remi handed over their passports then took them back when cipriani was done he asked and how is yvette well i hope she is sam replied she sends her regards and her cat moira it is well its a dog actually and its name is henri cirpriani spread his hands and smiled sheepishly im a cautious man perhaps overly so yvette has entrusted me with this matter i want to be sure im worthy of it we understand remi said how long have you known her oh twenty years or more she has a villa here outside the cas tello there were some legal issues in connection to the land i was able to help her youre an attorney oh no i simply know people who know people i see youll be able to help us of course you simply want to examine the crypt you dont plan to move it no then it should be very simple however just to be safe we should wait until it is dark we elbans are a nosy lot have you a place to stay not yet then youll stay with us my wife and me sam said we dont want to no imposition youll be my guest well have some supper then ill take you to the graveyard thank you may we use your office for a few minutes of course take as much time as you need cipriani left shutting the door behind him sam pulled out their satellite phone and punched in selmas number then waited through twenty seconds of clicks and buzzes selmas voice came on the line mr fargo everything okay so far any trouble there alls quiet i need you to check a license plate for me could be tricky were on elba if you have trouble call rube haywood he gave her the number to ciprianis office okay ill see what i can do be back to you shortly she called back twenty minutes later took some doing but as it turns out the italian dmv database isnt exactly what id call hackerproof good to know sam said the plate belongs to a tan peugeot correct thats it then i have bad news its registered to a polizia provinciale officer the provincial police im sending you the specifics right now sam waited three minutes until the email finally arrived scanned the contents then thanked selma and hung up he filled remi in either ive been speeding and havent realized it or someones interested in us he said if it were official they would have stopped us at the ferry in rio marina she replied agreed well at least we got some warning and we know what our other pursuers face looks like at ciprianis suggestion they spent an hour exploring rio nellelba but they did so warily taking care to stay within the village limits and close to crowds they saw no sign of either the peugeot or its occupants strolling arm in arm sam said been thinking about what yvette saidthat she suspected kholkov had already been here looking for laurents crypt bondaruk knew wed come here eventually it was a logical step so he sits back and lets us do the heavy lifting remi replied its the smart move sam said at five thirty they returned to the museum to find cipriani locking the front door and agreed to follow him home his cottage was less than a mile away sitting behind an olive orchard signora cipriani portly like her husband and with flashing brown eyes greeted them with smiles and double cheek kisses as they walked up she exchanged some rapidfire italian with umberto who ushered them onto the porch and toward a cluster of chairs a curtain of white clematis hung from the eaves creating a cozy alcove youll excuse us for a moment umberto said my wife needs me in the kitchen for a moment sam and remi sat down and a few minutes later umberto and his wife whom he introduced as teresa reappeared with a tray and glasses you enjoy limoncello i hope we do sam said limoncello was essentially lightly sugared lemonade cut by a healthy dose of vodka cento anni di salute e felicità umberto said raising his glass after theyd all sipped he asked you know the toastcento anni di salute e felicità remi thought for a moment and said a hundred years of health and happiness bravo drink up we will eat shortly after supper they returned to the porch and sat in the dusk watching fireflies winking in the trees and sipping espresso inside they could hear dishes clinking as teresa cleaned up shed adamantly refused sam and remis offer to help ushering them outside with flaps of her apron umberto how long have you lived here sam asked all my life and my family going back three hundred years yes thats right when mussolini came to power my father and my uncles joined the partisans and lived in these hills for years when the british finally landed here in operation brassard sam said yes thats right very good when the british came my father fought alongside the royal navy commandos he even received a decoration for it i was still in my mothers belly when the war ended he survived the war remi asked yes but none of my uncles did they were captured and executed by a nazi death squad hitler sent to quash the partisans im sorry cipriani spread his hands and shrugged what can you do sam pulled his cell phone from his pocket and glanced at remi who nodded theyd already discussed this umberto does this name look familiar to you umberto took the phone studied the screen a moment then handed it back oh yes of course carmine bianco first let me ask where did you get this name there was a car following us today its registered to him bad business bianco is a police officer but corrupt he is in the pocket of the unione corsethe corsican mafia why would they be interested in you i wonder we dont think its them remi said we suspect theyre doing a favor for someone else ah not that it makes a difference bianco is an animal was it just him in the car sam shook his head another one dark complected handlebar mustache he doesnt sound familiar why dont the police do something about this bianco remi asked you said hes corrupt cant they arrest him on the mainland perhaps but out here and on sardinia and corsica things are not quite that simple i think i know the answer to this but have to ask i dont suppose i could convince you to leave tonight before bianco does something sam and remi looked at one another and instinctively knew each others thoughts sam spoke for them thanks but weve got to see this through umberto nodded somberly i thought as much remi said we dont want to put you and teresa in danger if youll give us directions to umberto was already rising nonsense wait here he went inside then returned a minute later carrying a shoebox youll need this he said handing it over inside sam found a genuine world war iiera ninemillimeter luger pistol along with two full magazines my father liberated that from the gestapo officer who executed my uncles as my father told the story the man no longer had any use for it umberto smiled grimly at them and winked we cant accept this sam said of course you can when youre done here you can return it besides i have another my father was an exceptionally good liberator come well go now chapter the graveyard to which yvette had had laurents remains moved had no name umberto told them but it was hundreds of years old dating back to when elba was still a french protectorate nor was it on any map they took the lancia and followed the main road to the outskirts of the village then turned north heading higher into the mountains now in complete shadow as the sun set after ten minutes umberto who was riding in the backseat said stop the car please whats wrong sam said just pull over please sam did so shutting off the headlights and coasting to a stop sam and remi turned around to see umberto rubbing his forehead ive done something terrible he murmured what im leading you into a trap what are you talking about remi asked this afternoon while we were still in town bianco came to my home teresa called me he threatened to kill us if we didnt help him why are you telling us this the gun my father took that gun from a man who was threatening his family his friends he was afraid too i am sure just like i am but he fought back i have to do the same im very sorry sam and remi were silent for a few minutes then remi said you told us thats enough are they waiting for us no but theyre coming he checked his watch thirty minutes no more i am to let you open the crypt and recover whatever youve come for then theyll take it and kill you both i imagine and perhaps me as well how many men sam asked i dont know umberto pulled a spare magazine for his own luger from his pocket and handed it over the seat to sam the bullets in yours are dummies thanks but why give us a gun at all i wanted to gain your trust i hope you can forgive me well let you know in an hour or so if you cross us you have my permission to shoot me ill hold you to that sam said staring him in the eyes remi said what about teresa wont she shes already gone umberto replied i have cousins in nisporto theyll protect her well we have the sat phone call the police umberto the italian shook his head they wouldnt get here in time we can turn around or keep going and do our damnedest to get in and out before they get here there are only two roads in and out of here umberto said and bianco will have both watched you can be sure of that remi looked at sam youre quiet thinking the engineer in him was looking for an elegant solution but he quickly realized he was overthinking the situation much like with their initial runin with arkhipov at the boiler graveyard they had neither the time nor the resources for a sophisticated plan fortune favors the bold he finally said oh no he who dares wins sam added i know what that means remi said what umberto asked whats happening were going to make it up as we go along sam started the car put it in gear and pulled out they found the graveyard in a weedfilled meadow surrounded on three sides by hillocks covered in pine and cork trees only an acre in size it was surrounded by a waisthigh wroughtiron fence that had long ago been overtaken by rust and vines befitting the evenings task a low fog filled the meadow swirling around the headstones and crypts the sky was clear showing a bright full moon okay im officially creeped out remi said staring through the windshield as sam brought the car to a stop before the gate he shut off the engine and doused the headlights somewhere in the trees an owl hooted twice then went silent all were missing is howling wolves she whispered no wolves on elba umberto replied wild dogs and snakes many snakes the graveyard was arranged haphazardly with no regard to spacing or symmetry headstones jutted from the weeds at odd angles some within a foot of its neighbor while crypts of all shapes and sizes rose from the ground in various states of disrepair crumbling or overgrown by foliage or collapsed altogether in contrast several crypts freshly painted were islands of manicured grass and flowers theyre not much for civil planning are they sam said its been here so long the government cant bring itself to intervene umberto replied the truth is i cant remember the last time anyone was buried here how many are here many hundreds i think some graves are deep some shallow the dead are stacked atop one another remi asked wheres laurents crypt umberto leaned forward and pointed through the windshield that one in the far corner the one with the domed roof sam checked his watch time to find out how well the lancia holds up to punishment he started the engine did a yturn on the gravel drive then spun the wheel and drove into the meadow the tall grass scraping the cars underbody he followed the fence line to the back of the graveyard and coasted to a stop behind laurents crypt he shut off the engine again where does that go sam asked umberto pointing past remi out the passenger window a half mile away a pair of tire ruts disappeared over the hill and into the trees beyond i have no idea its an old mining road it hasnt been used for seventy eighty yearssince before the war remi murmured the road less traveled not for long sam replied he opened the door and climbed out remi and umberto following to remi he said why dont you wait here slide into the drivers seat and keep your eyes peeled well just be a minute he and umberto walked to the fence and hopped over compared to some of its neighbors laurents crypt was small not much bigger than a walkin closet and barely four feet tall but walking around to the front side sam saw that it was sunk into the ground a few feet three mosscovered steps led to a roughhewn wooden door sam pulled his led microlight from his pocket and shined it on the lock while umberto used the key in keeping with the fog the hooting owls and the full moon the hinges moaned as umberto swung open the door he glanced back at sam and smiled nervously keep an eye out sam said he walked down the steps and through the door and found himself facing a curtain of cobwebs under the bluewhite glow of his flashlight spiders scrambled across the webs and disappeared using his hand like a blade sam slowly cut the curtain down the center desiccated flies and moths pattered on the stone floor sam stepped inside the space measured five feet deep and eight feet wide and smelled of dust and rat droppings to his right he heard the faint scratching of tiny claws on stone then silence in the center the sarcophagus which was devoid of either markings or adornment stood on a threefoothigh platform made of red brick he stepped around the sarcophagus to the rear wall then placed the flashlight between his teeth and gave the lid a tentative shove it was lighter than hed anticipated sliding a couple inches with a hollow grating sound sam pushed the lid another few inches then grabbed the projecting end and walked the lid around until it was sitting perpendicular to the sarcophagus he shined his light inside nice to finally meet you monsieur laurent he whispered arnaud laurent now nothing more than a skeleton had been buried in what sam assumed was the full dress uniform of a napoleonicera army general complete with ceremonial sword lying between his blackbooted feet was a wooden box the size of a large hardcover book sam carefully lifted the box free blew off the layer of dust covering it then knelt down and placed it on the floor inside he found an ivory comb a flattened musket ball speckled with a flaky brown substance sam guessed was blood a few medals in tiny silk pouches an ovalshaped gold locket inside which he found a picture of a womanlaurents wife marie he assumedand finally a palmsized brown leather book breath held sam gently opened the book at its midpoint and could see in the narrow beam of his flashlight a line of shapes bingo he whispered he returned the other items to the box returned it to its place between laurents feet and was about to close the lid when his flashlight glinted off something metallic wedged between laurents boot and the wall of the sarcophagus was what looked like a thumbsized steel chisel sam fished it out it was a die stamp he realized a type of stone chisel one end was flattened like the head of a nail the other end was concave with a knifeedged border he shined his flashlight into the indentation it was the outline of a cicada thank you general sam whispered i wish we could have met two centuries ago he pocketed the stamp closed the lid and stepped out umberto was nowhere to be seen sam walked back up to ground level and looked around umberto he whispered umberto where are at the cemeterys gate a pair of headlights flashed to life pinning him in their glare he held his hand before his eyes squinting dont move mr fargo a russianaccented voice echoed through the graveyard there is a rifle aimed at your head raise your hands above your head sam complied then muttered out of the side of his mouth remi go get out of here thats going to be a problem sam slowly he rotated his head over his shoulder standing beside the lancias driversside door a revolver pressed against remis temple was carmine bianco chapter gun never wavering from remis head bianco stared at sam with a smug barracudas grin the headlights went dark sam looked back toward the gate and could see two figures walking toward him behind them the dark outline of an suv remi are you okay sam called over his shoulder shut up bianco barked sam ignored him remi im okay kholkov walked up through the kneehigh weeds and stopped ten feet away to his right mustache held a scoped hunting rifle at his shoulder its muzzle level with sams chest youre armed i assume kholkov said seemed the prudent thing to do sam replied very carefully mr fargo lets have it sam slowly pulled the luger from his pocket and dropped it on the ground between them kholkov looked around wheres cipriani hogtied and gagged in his barn sam lied after a little coaxing he told us about your partnership too bad for him at any rate here we are give me the book first call off bianco you have no leverage give me the book or at the count of three ill order bianco to shoot her then my friend here will shoot you and well take the book ten feet behind and to kholkovs left a shadowed figure rose from the weeds alongside another crypt and started creeping forward sam kept his eyes fixed on kholkov how do i know you wont shoot us once you have the book you dont said kholkov as i said youve got no leverage the figure stopped just beyond arms reach behind the russian sam smiled shrugged i have to disagree what exactly is that supposed to mean i think hes referring to me umberto said kholkov tensed but didnt move a muscle mustache however started to spin toward umberto who barked he moves another inch and itll be my pleasure to shoot you kholkov stop the russian ordered mustache froze umberto said sorry for the disappearing act sam i saw them pulling in and only had a moment to decide youre forgiven sam replied then to kholkov tell bianco to give remi the gun and join us kholkov hesitated sam could see the muscles in his jaw pulsing i wont ask again sam said bianco give her the gun and climb over the fence bianco shouted something while sams italian consisted of little more than simple greetings he felt certain his response was either scatological or carnal in nature or both bianco now without turning sam called over his shoulder remi ive got the gun hes climbing over the fence now kholkov tell your mustachioed friend to take his rifle by the barrel and toss it over the fence into the trees kholkov gave the order and the man complied bianco appeared on sams left and walked around to join kholkov and mustache now you sam told kholkov im not armed show me kholkov took off his jacket turned it inside out gave it a shake then dropped it on the ground shirt kholkov pulled his shirttails from his waistband and slowly spun in a circle sam nodded at umberto who circled around kholkov and backed across the open space stopping to retrieve the luger which he handed over to sam stronzo bianco barked what did he say sam asked he seems to think my mother and father were not married when i was born i will kill you bianco spat and your wife shut up now i recognize that onethe one with the mustache who is he a nobody hes a petty thief a thug umberto called to the man i know who you are if i see you again ill cut off your nose sam said kholkov heres how this is going to work youre all going to lie on the ground and were going to leave if you follow us ill burn the book youre lying you wont do that bad gamble to save our lives ill do it without a second thought it was a lie of course and sam knew that kholkov knew it too but he was hoping to plant even a slight seed of doubt enough to buy them some running room hed considered other optionstie them up disable their vehicle call the police but his every instinct was telling him to put as much distance as possible between themselves and kholkov and to do it as quickly as possible and were he a different man there would be a fourth option kill them right now but he wasnt that kind of man and didnt want coldblooded murder on his conscience kholkov was a superbly trained soldier who knew more ways to kill than most chefs had recipes every minute he remi and umberto spent around these men increased the chances of the tables being turned you wont get off the island kholkov growled lying down maybe but were going to give it the old college try even if you do ill find you again thats a bridge well cross when we get there umberto said sam a favor if i might id like to take bianco along with us ill make sure hes no trouble why let me worry about that sam considered this then nodded lets go umberto ordered bianco hands up under umbertos gun bianco started walking toward the fence once they were over it and standing beside the car umberto plucked biancos handcuffs from his belt secured them around his wrists frisked him then shoved him in the backseat and climbed in behind him remi started the car then opened the door for sam and slid over to the passenger seat sam got in the car put it in gear turned around and headed around the fence toward the main road how long do you think theyll wait remi asked sam glanced out the side window kholkov and mustache were already on their feet and running back through the graveyard about five seconds he said and stepped on the accelerator chapter sam sped down the fence line heading for the main gate in the corner of his eye he could see kholkov and mustache sprinting in the same direction dodging headstones as they went fog swirling in their wake gonna be close sam muttered where are you going remi said you heard umberto bianco will have the roads watched hows your aim tonight what oh she held up biancos gun as though suddenly remembering she had it fine why im going to make a quick pass by their suv see if you can get the tires umberto are you sure you can handle him in the backseat bianco was leaning in the corner wearing that same smug grin umberto reversed the luger in his hand and smacked bianco across the temple he went limp and slid into the floor i am sure the corner of the fence was coming up fast thirty feet beyond that and to the right was the suv kholkov had pulled ahead of mustache and was seconds from reaching the gate get ready sam called remi rolled down her window stuck the pistol out the opening and braced her arm on the door youre going too fast have to just do your best if you cant get the tires try for the windshield damn kholkov raced through the gate and skidded to a stop beside the suvs driversside door the interior dome light popped on remi snapped off two shots the bullets sparked on the suvs quarter panel but missed the tire too fast remi called windshield empty it remi squeezed off four shots the guns barrel spouting orange flame three spiderwebbed holes appeared in the suvs windshield atta girl suddenly kholkov appeared around the front of the car dropping into a crouch a gun coming up in his hands sam spun the wheel hard left the lancias tail whipped around the front tires spinning freely in the moist grass before finally finding purchase two metallic thunks echoed through the car as kholkovs bullets hit the cars trunk sam accelerated again straightening the car out and heading back into the meadow toward the hills everybody okay sam asked umberto peeked his head over the front seat said yes then disappeared again remi nodded and said sorry i couldnt get the tires we were going too fast no worries you got the windshield thatll slow them down theyll either have to punch it out or drive with their heads out the side windows remi turned in her seat and saw kholkov and mustache standing on the suvs hood stomping on the windshield option a she said the windshield collapsed inward kholkov and mustache knelt down dragged it out and tossed it aside seconds later the suvs lights popped on and it surged forward speeding into the meadow here they come with that fourwheel drive theyll i know sam muttered hold on the lancia lurched sideways as the front wheels slipped into the mining roads ruts sam tapped the brakes gave the wheel a jerk felt the rear wheels follow then punched the accelerator again the lancia surged up the hill the road was narrower than hed imagined no wider than six feet when they reached the crest the trees closed in around them boughs scraping the cars sides and blotting out the sky headlights washed through the back window as the suv started up the hill on the downslope now sam started to accelerate but immediately tapped the brakes as the road veered right and deeper into the trees behind them the suvs nose cleared the crest went airborne then slammed down again hes going to miss it remi said she was right still bouncing from its impact the suv overshot the turn and skidded to a stop its hood buried in the trees sam glanced in the mirror in time to see the suvs brake lights pop on just before the lancia plunged down another slope sam caught a fleeting glimpse of washboard ruts ahead and shouted hold on wheels thumping and shock absorbers shrieking in protest the lancia bumped over the patch then up another slope down the other side and onto a straightaway sam accelerated branches slapped at the windshield pinecones bouncing over the hood and over the roof the suv reappeared behind them its headlights bouncing wildly as kholkov negotiated the washboard while more durable and powerful than the lancia the suv was also two feet wider a disadvantage sam now saw was bearing fruit where the pine boughs had simply swiped at the lancia they were thrashing the suvs hood and into the hole where the windshield had been branches were snapping off jutting from the grille and becoming entangled with the windshield wipers the headlights fell back sam watch out he tore his eyes from the rearview mirror in time to see a boulder looming ahead he spun the wheel hard right sending the lancia in a sideways skid the boulder filled sams window he stepped on the gas as the lancia lurched forward but not quickly enough with a crunch the rear quarter panel glanced off the boulder and the rear side window shattered the impact spun the lancias tail around off the road and under the pine boughs the side bumper smashed into a trunk and they jerked to a stop the engine sputtered and died pine needles rained down on the windshield there goes our deposit remi said everybody okay sam asked remi fine splendid called umberto bianco still napping out sams window they saw the suvs headlights filtering through the trees he turned the ignition nothing still in gear remi said damn thanks he put the shifter into park and turned the ignition again the engine chugged and wheezed but didnt catch he tried again come on come on down the road the suv was halfway down the straightaway and approaching the boulder the lancias engine caught revved up then coughed out cutting it close sam remi said teeth clenched he closed his eyes said a quick prayer tried again the engine caught he shifted into drive spun the wheel right and accelerated back onto the road umberto slow them down okay umberto stuck his luger out the window and squeezed off two shots and then two more the bullets thudded into the grille shattering the driversside headlight the suv swerved left heading straight for the boulder then jinked right the side mirror scraped the rock shattered and bounced away into the darkness the suvs lights filled the lancias interior sam squinted and slapped the rearview mirror offangle he glanced over his shoulder and saw a hand holding a gun jut through the windshield gap down get down he yelled remi slid to the floorboards the gun roared from the suv muzzle winking from the darkened interior umberto poked his head up over the seat said ill slow them down then leaned out the side window with the luger no dont two more shots umberto screamed and rolled back into the car im hit where the forearm im okay he gasped the hell with this sam muttered brace yourselves he stood on the brakes for a two count then punched the gas again the suv skidded swerved then slammed into the lancias bumper sam had timed it well accelerating just before the moment of impact they pulled ahead of the suv twenty feet thirty four car lengths whoa abruptly the trees disappeared from either side of them remi popped her head up oh no the lancias wheels thumped over a berm and they were airborne open space loomed in the windshield the lancia landed again and bounced the tires spraying gravel shoulder remi called i see it sam replied and spun the wheel left the lancia went into a tail skid he eased right compensating then straightened out out remis window a boulderstrewn embankment dropped several hundred feet into a ravine engine roaring kholkovs suv sailed over the berm and slammed onto the road hes not going to make it remi said lets hope the suv went into its own skid but kholkov overcompensated the passengerside rear tire crunched into the rocks along the shoulder and slipped over the edge carried by its own momentum the rear third of the suvs chassis scraped over the dirt edging inch by inch over the precipice until it stopped partially suspended in space sam took his foot off the accelerator and let the lancia coast to a stop fifty feet behind them the suv was seesawing at the roads edge aside from the faint rhythmic groaning of stressed metal all was quiet remi sat up looked around careful sam whispered are we going to help them she asked a hand emerged from the darkened interior of the suv and grasped a windshield wiper a muzzle flashed from within the cab a bullet thunked into the lancias bumper the hell with them sam said and stepped on the accelerator thats gratitude for you remi said we could have bumped them into that ravine something tells me were going to wish we did chapter grand hôtel beauvau vieux port marseille france even as sam tipped the bellhop and shut the door behind him remi was dialing the iphone selma answered on the first ring safe and sound mrs fargo safe and sound remi replied as she sat on the bed and kicked off her shoes now will you tell me why were in marseille after leaving kholkov and his mustachioed partner teetering on the precipice theyd driven at the lancias best speed to nisporto umberto his forearm wrapped in his own shirt used the sat phone to alert his cousin to their arrival nisporto a village of a few hundred people sat in the nook of a vshaped cove ten miles up the coast from portoferraio when they arrived umbertos wife teresa and his cousinsall five of themwere waiting at the back door while teresa tended to umbertos wound which had missed hitting any bones or arteries the cousins bundled the nowconscious bianco into the garage the mother of the house umbertos aunt brunela ushered sam and remi into the house and straight to the kitchen table where she set about feeding them homemade pasta with onions capers olives and red sauce thirty minutes later umberto reappeared his arm bandaged weve put you in some danger sam said nonsense youve helped me redeem my honor i think my father would have been proud i think he would too remi said leaning over and kissing him on the cheek thank you sam asked do we want to know what youre going to do with bianco here and in corsica hes untouchable on the mainland umberto shrugged ill make some calls i think with the right evidence real or otherwise the carabinieri will be happy to embrace him as for the other one his partner hes a coward well be fine my friends now finish eating and well see about getting you off the island knowing bondaruks influence and kholkovs thoroughness made the marina di campo airport too risky theyd enlisted umbertos cousin ermete who ran a charter fishing boat to ferry them back to piombino on the italian mainland from there theyd returned to florence checked into the palazzo magnani feroni and called selma whod directed them to email her the photographed symbols from laurents codebook then head straight to marseille the next morning they dropped the book itself into an overnight envelope for san diego then headed to the airport why all the mystery remi now asked selma sam sat down on the bed and remi put the phone on speaker no mystery selma replied i was hashing out some details but i knew youd want to be in marseille one way or the other by the way pete and wendy are working on the symbols right now its fascinating stuff but the books condition is the big question sam said selma oh sorry remember wolfgang müller captain of the um i found him him you mean yep hes still alive took a lot of legwork but it turns out he was aboard the lothringen when it was captured after the war he was shipped back to germany by way of marseille he got off the boat but didnt take the train home he lives with his granddaughter ive got their address the next morning they got up and walked to a café le capri a few blocks away on rue bailli de suffren overlooking the vieux port or old port which was filled with sailboats of all shapes and sizes their sails dancing in the offshore breeze the bright morning sun glinted off the water at the mouth of the port rising from the north and south shorelines were the forts of saint jean and saint nicholas above these on the hillsides stood the abbaye de saint victor and the churches of saint vincent and saint catherine farther out in the bay of marseille proper lay the fourisland archipelago of frioul sam and remi had been to marseille three times together the last a few years earlier on their way to the camargue up the coast every may some twenty thousand gypsies from western and eastern europe gathered there to celebrate their gitane heritage they finished breakfast and hailed a taxi giving the driver an address in the panier a cluster of medievalesque neighborhoods filled with tightly packed pastelpainted houses sandwiched between the town hall and the vieille charité wolfgang müller lived in a twostory butter yellow whiteshuttered apartment on rue de cordelles a blond woman in her mid twenties answered the door when they knocked bonjour sam said bonjour parlezvous anglais yes i speak english sam introduced himself and remi were looking for monsieur müller is he at home yes of course may i ask what this is about theyd already discussed this and decided honesty was the best course remi replied wed like to talk to him about the um and the lothringen the woman cocked her head slightly her eyes narrowing clearly her grandfather had told her about his time in the war one moment please leaving the door open she walked down a hall and disappeared around the corner they heard muffled voices for a minute then she reappeared please come in my name is monique this way please she led them into the front room where they found müller sitting in a rocking chair in front of a muted television tuned to frances version of the weather channel he wore a gray cardigan buttoned up to his throat and his lap was covered in a blue and yellow argyle blanket completely bald his face heavily wrinkled müller watched them through a pair of placid blue eyes good morning he said in a suprisingly strong voice he gestured with a trembling hand to a floralpatterned couch across from him please can i offer you some coffee no thank you remi answered monique tells me you found ilsa ilsa sam asked its what i named the after my wife she died in the dresden bombings a few months after we left bremerhaven you found her in the cave in rum cay remi nodded we were doing some exploring and came across the entrance we found her sitting on the bottom in almost pristine condition shes still there sam smiled well no not exactly there was a problem we used her as what you might call an escape raft i dont understand the main entrance collapsed we rode the ilsa rode ilsa down the underground river and out through another cave müllers eyes went wide and he smiled thats astounding im glad she was put to good use weve arranged to have her transported back to the us if youd like well have her shipped müller was shaking his head thats kind of you but no keep her take good care of her he smiled and shook his finger at them something tells me you didnt come all this way just to tell me that we also found the um at this müller leaned forward and manfred captain boehm was still aboard her sam recounted their discovery of the sub leaving out any mention of bondaruk or kholkov the authorities are salvaging her right now mein gott wed always worried about the weather those boats werent meant for open ocean müllers eyes went distant for ten seconds then he blinked and refocused on them manfred was a good friend of mine it always pained me that i never knew what happened thank you the reason were here is the wine remi said the wine oh the bottles yes we were going to celebrate with them after the mission was over are you telling me they survived remi nodded one aboard the and one aboard ilsa and the third did you find that one as manfred had the harder of the two missions i gave him two bottles we found a shard near his subs resting place were not sure how it got out of the sub müller waved his hand the vagaries of war just out of curiosity sam said can you tell us about your mission what were you and boehm trying to accomplish müller frowned thinking after a few moments he said i suppose it doesnt really matter now it was an absurd task really concocted by the führer himself manfred was supposed to sail up chesapeake bay and attack the navy base at norfolk at the same time i was to attack the ammunition depot in charleston but ilsa had a problem with her screw so we were delayed before we could repair it we were recalled to bremerhaven you know the rest about the lothringen and all that youd stopped at rum cay for refitting what kind bigger batteries to increase the boats ranges another idiotic plan both manfred and i knew the missions were suicide then why did you volunteer müller shrugged duty indiscretion of youth neither of us were fond of hitler or the party but it was still our country we wanted to do what we could we were hoping you might tell us more about the bottles remi said where they came from why were collectors as it turns out they were very old and very rare müller chuckled i never knew well i might have guessed they were important somehow my brother karl gave them to me before we shipped out from bremerhaven he told me he found them here actuallyhe was in the army and was part of the occupation force where exactly did he find them let me think müller scratched his head my memory isnt quite what it used to be it was a castle no not a castle a fort he sighed in frustration then his eyes lit up it was one of the islands in the bay do you remember that book by dumasthe count of monte cristo both sam and remi had read it in an instant they knew what müller was talking about île dif yes thats it he found them in the château dif chapter château dif france despite their love for marseille the fargos had never managed to squeeze the frioul archipelago and château dif into their itinerary an oversight they planned to correct that night with their own private tour they doubted the châteaus staff would let them explore every nook and cranny of the island though neither of them knew exactly what theyd be looking for or whether theyd recognize it if it appeared the expedition seemed the next logical step in the journey from müllers apartment they took a taxi to the malmousque a waterfront district overlooking the friouls and found a quiet café they settled under the umbrella on the patio and ordered a pair of double espressos a mile offshore they could see château dif a faded ochercolored lump of rock fronted by sloping cliffs vertical ramparts and stone arches while the island itself covered just over seven acres the château itself was a smaller square a hundred feet to a side made up of a threestory main building flanked on three sides by cylindrical turrets topped with crenellated cannon slots at the behest of king françois i château dif began its life in the s as a fortress to defend the city against attacks from the sea a purpose that was shortlived as it was converted into a prison for frances political and religious enemies much like san fran ciscos alcatraz château difs location and its deadly offshore currents gave it a reputation as escape proof a claim that was shattered at least fictionally by alexandre dumass count of monte cristo in which the character edmond dantès after fourteen years of imprisonment managed to escape dif sam read from the brochure hed picked up at the vieux port tourist office blacker than the sea blacker than the sky rose like a phantom the giant of granite whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey thats how dantès described it doesnt seem so bad from here try being stuck in the dungeon for a dozen years good point what else the prison operated by a strict class structure rich inmates could buy their way into private cells on the upper floors with windows and a fireplace as for the poor they got the basement dungeons and the oublietteswhich are its derivative of oublierto forget they were essentially trap doored pits in the floor of a dungeon remis french was also better than sams you go in and youre forgottenleft to rot the phone trilled and sam answered it it was selma mr fargo i have something for you go ahead sam said he put the phone on speaker so remi could hear weve deciphered the first two lines of symbols on the bottle but thats it selma began the other lines are going to take some time i think were missing a key of some kind anyway the lines spell out a riddle folly of capetian sébastiens revelation a city under cannon from the third realm of the forgotten a sign that eternal sheol will fail were working on solving it done sam proclaimed its talking about château dif pardon me he recounted their meeting with wolfgang müller the fortress is where his brother found the bottles i already had the answer from there it was just a matter of working backward capetian refers to the dynastic line king françois i came from he had the fortress built sébastien is the first name of vauban the engineer who had to tell the government the fort was all but useless for whatever reason the architects had built it with the heaviest fortifications and gun embattlements facing not the open sea and potential invaders but the citya city under cannon impressive mr fargo its in the brochure as for the second line i dont know i think i do remi said in hebrew sheol means abode of the dead or underworld the oppositeeternal sheolis everlasting life remember the cicada from the bottle sam was nodding from napoleons crest resurrection and immortality and the other part the third realm of the forgotten its the french version of a dungeon oubliette to forget unless were wrong somewhere in the basement of the château is a cicada waiting to be found but why a riddle at all remi wondered why not simply go here find this thats where it gets really interesting selma replied from what ive been able to translate so far laurents book is part diary part decryption key he makes it pretty clear the bottles themselves arent the real prize he called them arrows on a map arrows to what remi asked and for whom to follow he doesnt say well know more when i finish the translation sam said well it seems clear laurent was doing this on napoleons orders and if they went to this much trouble to hide the bottles whatevers at the end of the map has to be something spectacular which might explain why bondaruk has no problem with murder remi replied they chatted for a few more minutes then hung up uhoh remi said out of the side of her mouth and pointing with her eyes look whos here sam turned around kholkov was walking across the patio toward them hands stuffed into the pockets of his jacket sam and remi tensed ready to move relax do you think id be stupid enough to shoot you both in broad daylight kholkov asked stopping before them he pulled his hands from his pockets and held them up unarmed i see you escaped your little fender bender remi said kholkov pulled out a chair and sat down sam said dryly please join us you could have easily bumped us off the edge kholkov said why didnt you it occurred to us believe me if not for your triggerhappy friend who knows i apologize for that he overreacted i dont suppose youd care to explain how youve been tracking us remi said kholkov smiled there was none of it in his eyes i dont suppose youd be willing to tell me why youve come here you suppose correctly remi replied whatever youre selling were not buying sam said your colleague kidnapped tortured and was seconds away from killing a friend of ours and youve tried to kill us twice tell us why youre here my employer is proposing a truce a partnership remi laughed softly let me guess we help you find whatever youre after and youll kill us for it later rather than sooner not at all we join forces and split the proceeds eightytwenty we dont even know what were after sam said something of great valueboth historically and monetarily and which of those interests bondaruk most remi asked thats his business sam and remi had no illusions her prediction of bondaruks and kholkovs plans for them was deadon whatever bondaruks true motives and whatever the prize there was no way they were going to let it fall into the ukrainians hands kholkov added lets just say the items involve a family legacy hes simply trying to finish what was begun a long time ago if you were to help bring that about hed be properly grateful no deal sam said remi added and you pass along a message for us nuts you should reconsider kholkov said have a look around sam and remi did so standing on the far side of the patio were three of kholkovs menall familiar faces from the rum cay cave the gangs all here sam said no theyre not i have more wherever you go well be there one way or another well get what we want what you need to decide is whether you wish to live through this well manage remi said kholkov shrugged your choice i dont suppose youre stupid enough to have brought the codebook along with you are you no sam replied and were not stupid enough to have left it at the hotel either but youre welcome to have a look around we already did i assume its already in mrs wondrashs hands either that or its in a safedeposit box remi said no i dont think so i think you have your people trying to decode it right now perhaps well pay them a visit ive heard san diego is beautiful this time of year good luck with that sam said lightly fighting to keep his face impassive youre talking about your security system kholkov waved his hand dismissively that wont be any trouble clearly youre not familiar with my résumé sam said kholkov hesitated ah yes an engineer tinkered with the alarm system have you remi added and even if you get past that who knows what youll find once youre inside you said it yourself were not stupid kholkovs brows furrowed a flicker of uncertainty but it was gone in a second well see last chance mr and mrs fargo after this the gloves come off you have our answer sam replied chapter château dif a drizzle had begun to fall shortly before they left the hotel and now as midnight approached it had given way to a steady rain that pattered through the trees and gurgled down the rain gutters the streets glistened under the hazy yellow glow of the streetlights here and there latenight pedestrians hurried down the sidewalks under umbrellas or folded newspaper or waited in clusters beneath bus shelters in the alley across from their hotel sam and remi stood in the shadows and watched the lobby doors down the block a gray citroën xsara sat at the curb a pair of figures just visible in the dimmed interior earlier from the window of their hotel room remi had gotten a look at the drivers face hed been with kholkov at the malmousque café whether there were more watchers around they couldnt tell but they knew it was best to assume so after parting company with kholkov at the café earlier that afternoon theyd roamed the malmousque shopping and taking in the sights for a few hours they saw neither kholkov nor his men until they started back to the hotel when two men on motorcycles fell in behind their taxi despite their nonplussed reaction to kholkovs threats sam and remi had taken them seriously fearing their room was bugged they found a quiet corner in the mostly deserted hotel bar and called rube haywood on the iridium he wasnt at cia headquarters in langley but they reached him at home sam put him on speakerphone and quickly explained the situation and their worries rube said i know a guy in long beachused to work for the diplomatic security service he runs his own shop now want me to have him send a couple guys to the house wed be grateful give me ten minutes he called back in five done theyll be there in two hours tell selma theyll have idskozal security group theyll ask for mrs french got it dont you think its time to call it a day rube asked youve seen how far these guys will go nothings worth this we dont even know what it is remi said you get my point im worried about you two we appreciate that rube but were going to see this through haywood sighed at least let me help you what did you have in mind asked sam ive taken a second look at kholkov a few years ago he was in chechnya we think he was playing middleman for a blackmarket ak dealer wouldnt take much to get his name slipped onto the terrorist watch list a couple calls and i could put him on the radar of the dcpj he said referring to the direction centrale police judiciaire or central directorate judicial police frances version of the fbi theres nothing they could arrest him on but they might be able to detain him and his buddies for a while do it any breathing room you can buy us will help the question is whether theyll be able to find him given his background hes not going to make it easy for them three hours later rube had called back the dcpj had put out a bulletin for kholkov but he wouldnt know anything more for a few hours if then the french rube told them were cagey about sharing information i dont suppose you know a french version of guido the shoe makerslasharms dealer sam the french are rabid about their gun laws you dont want to get caught with an unregistered one but i do know a guy named maurice he gave sam the phone number and they hung up now remi pulled up her jacket collar against the chill and huddled closer to sam beneath the umbrella i dont see anyone else me neither shall we with one last look around they stepped from the alley and started down the sidewalk using the rudimentary tradecraft skills sam had picked up at camp perry they strolled the streets north of the harbor for an hour doubling back on their path stepping abruptly into cafés and then out the back door and generally watching for any signs of pursuit satisfied they were alone they hailed a cab and directed the driver to take them to rue loge on the vieux port as promised by the rental companys manager at a slip in the northwest corner of the harbor they found waiting for them a gray eighteenfoot mistral though essentially a motor whaleboat with a glassedin pilothouse barely bigger than a phone booth it was widebeamed and sported a reliable and quiet lombardi engine it would they hoped serve their purposes using the key the manager had messengered over sam undid the padlocked hawser and the lines while remi started the engine he jumped aboard and she throttled up pointing the bow toward the mouth of the harbor ten minutes later the breakwater appeared off the bow astern the lights of marseille hazy in the rain reflected off the rippled surface of the water working to keep up with the droplets streaming down the pilothouse windscreen the single windshield wiper thumped softly beside remi at the wheel sam said ive been thinking about what kholkov said he saw her expression and quickly said not about his offerabout what bondaruks interest is in whateveritis he said it was a legacy we know hes deadly serious about it so maybe the answers in his family history good point remi said taking a buoy down the mistrals port side well turn selma loose on it youre not are youhaving second thoughts i mean only as far as youre concerned remi smiled in the darkness her face dimly lit by the helm consoles green lighting weve been through worse such as well for starters there was that time in senegal when you insulted that shaman forget i asked thirty minutes later île dif appeared a white lump rising from the dark ocean a half mile off the bow the château had closed at five thirty and aside from a lone navigation beacon pulsing red against the night sky the island was completely dark doesnt look as welcoming at night does it remi asked not even close in preparation for their afterhours tour theyd used google earth to scrutinize the island for hidden mooring spots that would shield them from not only kholkov should he and his men happen to follow but also the marseille harbor patrol theyd found a promising spot on the islands seaward side now remi eased the mistral to port they spent a half hour circumnavigating the island looking for other boats or signs of life seeing nothing they came about and proceeded along the northern shoreline ahead the châteaus westernmost turret the largest of the three came into view above the battlement remi steered into the cove below it throttled down and let the mistral glide to a stop at the base of the wall aside from a rainchurned surface the water was flat calm here sam dropped anchor and used the boat hook to pull the mistral closer to the rocks remi jumped over and followed stern line in hand he jammed the line beneath a basketballsized rock hand in hand they picked their way along the wall hopping from rainslick boulder to rainslick boulder until they reached a particularly tall one theyd spotted on the satellite shots sam climbed atop it positioned himself below a notch in the battlements used by archers then leaped up and grabbed the walls inner ledge he chinned himself up and crawled atop the wall then he helped remi up and down the other side he hopped down beside her thank god for bad architecture he said if not for the forts backwardfacing fortifications they would have needed an extension ladder to accomplish what theyd just done dont see anyone remi said you sam shook his head in their research theyd found no mention of the island employing afterhours guards but to be safe they would proceed as if there were with remi in the lead they crept forward along the curved wall of the turret to where it met the straight western wall and followed this to the end beside them the stone having been warmed by the sun all day then soaked by the rain smelled like chalk remi peeked around the corner clear she whispered in sams pocket the iridium vibrated he pulled it out and answered keeping his voice a whisper it was rube bad news sam the dcpj cant find kholkov or his buddies they know he entered the country on his own passport but none of the hotels or rental car agencies have any record of him switched to a false passport sam guessed probably so bottom line hes still out there be careful thanks rube well be in touch sam hung up and gave remi the news were not any worse off than we were before shall we absolutely they continued along the southern wall and around the next turret to the châteaus side entrance an arched breezeway that led into the courtyard freeze sam whispered very slowly crouch down together they dropped to their knees what remi whispered directly ahead of us a hundred yards away across the plaza stood two redroofed outbuildings the lefthand one shaped like a truncated j abutted the wall along the islands northern shoreline under the eaves they could see four windows black rectangles in the gloom they waited staying perfectly still for a minute and then two after three minutes remi whispered you saw something i thought so guess i was wrong come on stop she rasped you werent wrong there at the far corner sam looked where remi had indicated it took a moment for his eyes to pick it out but there was no mistake barely visible in the darkness was the white oval of a mans face chapter they watched the face for a full minute the man was all but a statue occasionally rotating his head to scan behind and to the sides but otherwise still a guard remi ventured maybe but would a lazy guard trying to stay out of the rain stand that still hed be shifting or smoking or fidgeting moving with exaggerated slowness sam reached inside his rain jacket and pulled out a nikon monocular he aimed it toward the outbuilding and focused on the mans face doesnt look like any of kholkovs men weve seen if it is them how did they get here we didnt see any boats theyre trained commandos remi skulking is what they do sam scanned the grounds taking his time looking into shadows and darkened doorways but seeing no one else great christmas present idea sam said a nightvision monocular my pleasure i dont see anyone else wait the man under the eaves moved now turning again to look over his shoulder on the sleeve of his jacket was a patch and on his belt a flashlight and key ring im happy to report im wrong sam murmured its a guard still it would probably be best if we didnt get caught sneaking about a french national monument in the dead of night true when i say go slowly move into the tunnel and stop about halfway dont go into the courtyard and be ready to freeze right sam watched the guard through the monocular until he looked away again go hunched over remi hurried into the corner then along the wall and into the arch sam kept watching it took another two minutes but finally the man moved again and sam was able to join remi my hearts pounding she admitted the joy of adrenaline they took a moment to catch their breath then crept down the tunnel to the mouth of the courtyard stopping just short of a twoinchhigh step to the left of the door was a short wall and a wooden bench to the right a set of stone steps bordered by a wroughtiron handrail rose alongside the courtyards inner wall then turned left and ascended to a turret where it branched off into a walkway that wrapped around the courtyard sam and remi scanned the walkway pausing on each rectangular door or window looking for movement they saw nothing they scooted forward gave the courtyard and walkway one more look and were preparing to move when sam saw set back in the shadows another archway beneath the steps nothing moved aside from the pattering rain all was quiet eyes scanning the courtyard sam leaned in and whispered in remis ear when i say go head straight up the steps and into the turret ill be right behind them a beam of light filled the tunnel remi go like a sprinter coming off the blocks remi dashed out and started up the steps taking them two at a time sam dropped to his belly and went still the flashlight panned through the tunnel then back out again then went dark sam crawled over the step into the courtyard then rose to his feet and joined remi in the turret did he see us well know shortly they waited for a minute then two halfexpecting to see the guard walk through the arch but he didnt appear sam looked around the darkened interior of the turret are we in the right one the brochure map had identified several entrances to the oubliette level one of which was in this turret yes the next landing down i think remi said nodding at the spiral steps another set led upward to the battlements they started down the steps remi in the lead on the next landing they found a wooden trapdoor in the floor secured to the stone lip by a padlocked latch from his waistband sam pulled a miniature crowbar given the predominantly stone construction of the château and recalling müllers words about his brother finding the bottles tucked away in a cranny theyd guessed the tool would come in handy while the padlock looked new the latch itself was anything but having turned black and flaky by years of exposure to the salt air remi pointed her led microlight at the latch but sam stopped her from turning it on lets wait until were out of sight it took thirty seconds of gentle work with the crowbars tip to wriggle the latch free of the wood sam lifted the hatch revealing a wooden ladder dropping into a dark shaft better let me test it remi said she sat down slid her legs into the hole and started downward ten seconds later she whispered up okay its about twelve feet go easy its bolted into the stone but the whole thing looks as old as the latch sam climbed in ducked down on the second rung and shut the hatch behind him leaving a gap wide enough for his fingers which he used to flip the latch back into place with luck a passing guard wouldnt notice the tampering in complete darkness and working by feel alone sam started downward the ladder creaked and shifted the bolts rasping inside their stone holes he froze he held his breath for a ten count then began moving again with a splintering crack the rung parted beneath his lowermost foot he lurched downward he clamped his hands on the uprights arresting his fall but the sudden shift of his weight was too much for the ladder which twisted sideways with a shriek and a pop the bolts gave way and sam felt himself falling he braced himself just before impact slamming into the stone floor back first sam remi whispered rushing over and kneeling down sam groaned blinked rapidly then pushed himself up onto his elbows are you okay she asked i think so just bruised my pride a bit and your tailbone she helped him to his feet before them the ladder lay in a heap the uprights were twisted away from one another the rungs jutting at crazy angles well remi said at least now we know how were not getting out of here always a bright side sam agreed remi clicked on her led and they looked around behind them was a stone wall ahead a passageway barely taller than sam stretched into the darkness unlike the forts outer walls the stones here were dark gray and roughhewn showing chisel marks that were four hundredplus years old this was the upper dungeon level there was one more below them and below that the oubliettesthe realm of the forgotten remi clicked off her led hand in hand they started down the passage when theyd gone twenty paces sam clicked on his led looked around shut it off again hed seen no end to the passage they kept going after another twenty paces he felt remis hand squeeze on his i heard an echo she whispered to the left sam clicked on the led revealing a tunnel containing a dozen cells six to a wall for safety purposes the barred steel doors had been removed they stepped into the nearest cell and looked around while these tunnels were gloomy in their own right sam and remi found the tiny coalpitdark cells a nightmare the châteaus guides reportedly divided tour groups into threes and fours then shut off the lights and had everyone stand in silence for thirty seconds though sam and remi had found themselves in similar situations beforemost recently in rum caychâteau difs cells evoked a unique sense of dread as though they were sharing the space with stillimprisoned ghosts enough of this sam said and stepped back into the main passage they found the next tunnel farther down the passageway on their right this one was slightly longer and contained twenty cells moving more quickly now they repeated the process passing cell tunnel after cell tunnel until they reached the end of the passageway where they found a wooden door it was closed but had neither latch nor lock beside the door a placard said in french do not enter authorized personnel only why no lock remi wondered aloud probably removed so wayward tourists cant accidentally lock themselves in places they shouldnt be he stuck his finger through the latch hole and gently pulled the door swung open an inch the hinges creaked he stopped took a breath then pulled the door the rest of the way open remi squeezed through the gap then he followed easing the door shut behind them they stood still for a few moments listening then remi cupped her hands around her led and clicked it on they were standing on a narrow fourbyfourfoot landing to the right of the door was a ledge at their backs another cylindrical stairwell this one leading only downward together they peeked over the ledge the leds beam didnt penetrate any deeper than ten steps chapter following the bluewhite beams of their leds they picked their way down the steps to the next landing as above they found a wooden door set into the wall and beside it another do not enter placard expecting the shriek of ancient hinges sam was surprised when the door swung noiselessly open they stepped through another tunnel this one barely four feet wide and five feet tall forcing sam and remi to duck spaced at fourfoot intervals along each wall was a rectangular cell door but unlike their counterparts on the upper level these were equipped with what sam and remi assumed were the original vertically barred doors each one standing open and tethered to an eyelet in the stone with a length of twine sam examined the nearest door under the glow of the led and found the lock and latch were still present just when you thought it couldnt get any more depressing remi whispered scanning the walls as they went they started down the tunnel after sixty or seventy feet they found a tenfootdeep side tunnel set into the lefthand wall at the end was a waisthigh rectangular opening they knelt down and sam leaned into the opening a few feet inside a hatch was set into the floor sam shined his light into it another ladder he whispered it goes down about six feet i think weve found the place ill go first remi said then slipped feet first into the hatch and started down okay she called the ladder seems sturdy sam climbed down and crouched beside her this tunnel was narrower still three feet wide and four feet tall stretching down the centerline was hatch after hatch after hatch each one a steelbarred black square that seemed to swallow their flashlight beams god almighty sam whispered how many do you think remi asked if this tunnel is as long as the ones above forty or fifty remi was silent for a long ten seconds i wonder how long it took for someone to go insane down here depends on the person but after a day or two your mind would start feeding on itself no sense of time no points of reference no outside stimulus come on lets get this over with what was the last line of the riddle from the third realm of the forgotten careful of their footing they walked down the wall to the third hatch under the beam of remis led sam examined the grate the hinges and latch had been removed and the bars were scabrous with corrosion he touched one flakes sloughed off and floated down into the oubliette he gripped the bars lifted the grate free and set it aside the oubliette lay at the bottom of a narrow sixfoot long shaft while the cell itself was four feet to a side and three feet deepneither wide enough for a prisoner to lie fully prone nor tall enough to stand without being bent at the waist i better go remi said im smaller and i couldnt pull you back up sam frowned but nodded okay from his waistband he pulled the miniature crowbar she took off her coat and laid it aside then tucked the crowbar into her belt and let sam lower her into the shaft dropping the last couple feet on her own on hands and knees she clicked on her light stuck it between her teeth and began examining the stone walls and floor after two minutes of crawling around she suddenly murmured there you are spittlebug yep in all its glory its carved into the corner of this block theres a goodsized gap here hang on remi worked the pry bar first into one gap then the other inching the block away from the wall with a grunt she pulled it free and shoved it aside then dropped to her belly and shined the light into the hollow it goes back a couple feet damn what remi got to her knees and looked up the shaft at him its bedrock there are no other openings no gaps theres nothing here sam remi took another two minutes to make sure she hadnt missed anything then pushed the block back into place sam reached down and lifted her up she pursed her lips and puffed a strand of hair from her eyebrow i was afraid of that karl müller found three bottles here something told me we werent going to find the rest sam nodded whatever laurent was up to it doesnt seem likely hed stash them all together well it was worth a try we know one thing for sure laurent did in fact use his cicada stamp come on time to leave the party and find a way out they replaced the grate and walked down the tunnel away from the door remi pressed against one wall sam the other ten feet from the end sam suddenly stumbled backward into an alcove and landed on his butt with an umph sam remi called looks like i found something he looked around only three feet deep the rear half of the alcoves floor was taken up by a hatch this one unbarred remi walked around the oubliette between them and ducked into the alcove with sam who shined his light into the hatch then dropped through followed by remi sam clicked on his led for a moment running perpendicular to the tunnel above a crawl space stretched into the darkness on hands and knees they started crawling remi in the lead and sam bringing up the rear not wanting to miss any side branches every few feet they reached out and touched each wall after a full minute of crawling sam tapped remi on the butt to call a halt then clicked on the led again ahead the tunnel stretched on did you notice the walls remi whispered yes the crawl spaces walls were not constructed of stone block but had rather been carved from the bedrock crawling as they were in a dark and cramped space inches of travel felt like many feet after thirty more seconds of moving remi stopped wall she whispered branch to the right they made the turn then crawled another twenty feet to another turn this one to the left after another short straightaway and another two right and left turns they found themselves at a ceiling hatch tall enough for remi to stand in she ducked back down and said theres a ledge then a dropoff into some kind of room can you make it i think so she boosted herself up and disappeared ten seconds later she called okay sam stood up crawled over the ledge and dropped down beside remi who was already surveying the room which measured ten by ten feet like the crawl space the walls and floor and ceiling were bedrock mounted on three walls were what looked like wooden gun cases each one divided into vertical slots meant for they assumed either muskets or swords in the wall to their left was a truncated arch this must be original to the fort sam whispered probably a lastditch bolthole and armory for defenders which means there has to be another way out or in unless it got closed up when the château was converted to a prison dont even joke about that one way to find out they ducked through the arch and into the tunnel beyond it was labyrinth for the next hour they picked their way along the tunnel into dead ends through horseshoe hallways and up and down stairs until sam finally called a halt ahead the tunnel split yet again into three branches like spokes on a wagon wheel what is this place remi panted i dont know that it has a name sam replied but im guessing its still part of the lastditch defense theoryattackers come down here get trapped then are ambushed by the defenders he licked his finger and held it up theres air movement he turned in a circle trying to localize it then shook his head cant tell where its coming from remi wasnt listening eyes closed she turned first this way then that her hands at her waist fingers alternately left and right retracing our steps she finally whispered that ways the courtyard she pointed down the left tunnel i think if theres a hidden entrance its got to be there good enough for me sam said he took her hand and they set off again time and again the tunnel branched off and each time remi would stop repeat her slowmotion eyesclosed spin then point after another hour their tunnel came to an abrupt dead endor near dead end leaning against the wall was a wooden ladder roughly hewn from what looked like red oak the uprights and rungs were slightly crooked they shined their lights upward the ladder well over thirty feet tall ended at a wooden hatch smell that remi said its rain sam were close he nodded absently eyes poring over the ladder this is ancient he murmured it could be original this could be hundreds of years old thats wonderful sam but right now all i care about is whether itll take our weight he gave the ladder a twist then put his weight on the bottom rung it creaked but held give me the pry bar will you he tucked it into his belt and climbed up to the hatch its locked he called down he wriggled the pry bar under the edge and wrenched once then again then once more and the latch popped open sam threw open the hatch fresh air rushed through the opening and down the ladder were in one of the turrets sam whispered down he boosted himself up and out then remi followed as her head cleared the opening outside the door they heard the scuff of a shoe on stone sam helped remi the rest of the way out and together they crept to the door over the railing they could see a guardthe one from before they assumedstrolling across the courtyard flashlight panning left and right the man turned around shined his flashlight briefly over the walkways then disappeared through the arch they gave him thirty seconds to move off a safe distance then trotted down the walkway left down the steps then through the courtyard and into the tunnel theyd first entered outside it was still raining and the temperature had dropped twenty degrees the cold washed over them they looked around to get their bearings they were back where theyd started ahead across the plaza lay the redroofed outbuildings his progress marked by his flashlight the guard was a hundred yards away and heading toward the reception area had enough prowling for one night sam asked remi and then some remi replied besides knowing you as i do im sure theres plenty of skulking left in our future safe bet together they stepped out into the rain chapter grand hôtel beauvau an hour later freshly showered and enjoying their second roomservice bombay sapphire gibson sam and remi sat on their balcony and looked out over the vieux port the lights of the city reflected off the waters surface in a mosaic of red yellow and blue that slowly rippled with the falling rain in the distance they could hear the mournful howl of a foghorn and closer in the occasional clang of a buoy the phone trilled sam checked the screen it was rube as soon as they got back to the hotel he had called haywood given him a purposely vague recounting of the nights events and asked him to call back sam closed the balcony door then answered and put the phone on speaker rube please tell us kholkov and his merry band are in custody sorry no the french dcpj cant find them wish i could say i was surprised me too ready to quit and come home now not on your life remi no chance well on the bright side kholkovs name and picture are everywhere if he tries to leave the country through an airport port or train station theyll pick him up then again sam said from what you told me it sounds like the spetsnaz are trained to slip across borders and he doesnt strike me as stupid enough to walk into an airport true what about bondaruk remi asked any chance of digging into his familys skeleton closet and figuring out whats driving him possibly it turns out the iranian pasdaran colonel who was bondaruks handler during the border war ran into some trouble with the ayatollah a few years later were not sure what the rigmarole was about but the colonelhis name is aref ghasemiescaped to london and started working for the british hes still there ive got someone reaching out to him thanks rube remi said and hung up the next morning they slept in until nine and had breakfast on the balcony the previous nights rain had disappeared leaving behind a blue sky with scattered cottonpuff clouds over coffee they called selma who was awake despite it being nearly midnight in california as far as they could tell their chief researcher slept only five or so hours a night but never seemed the worse for it leaving out the finer details sam told her about finding the château dif hiding place empty remi added the cicada was there though and it looked like a perfect match for laurents chisel stamp thats better than nothing selma said im making some headway on deciphering lines three and four on the bottle but as for the rest zilch and i think i know why theres a third key explain sam said laurents book is one key and the bottle we have is anotherat least the first four lines are im guessing the third key is another bottle we need all three to crossreference and decode the rest of the lines this feels convoluted remi said from our perspective maybe but weve got to make some assumptions first that laurent intended to hide the twelve bottles from the original case individually at scattered locationshis arrows on a map to whatevers at the end of all this we need to find a name for this thing sam said napoleons gold remi suggested with a shrug works for me selma said okay napoleons gold i suspect he meant it to work like this find one bottle decode it with the book then follow the riddle to another bottle sam caught on then use that labels code with the book and the first bottle to decode the next line and its riddle which leads to yet another bottle and so forth the good news isand this is another guessi dont think theres any sequence to the codein other words laurent designed it so any bottle would lead to another riddle remi said if all this is right why did he hide three bottles together at dif no idea we might find out down the road were ignoring the elephant in the room sam said we know for sure one of the bottles is lostthe shard from the pocomoke proves that without that bottle we could be missing the last riddlethe one that points us to napoleons gold i was thinking the same thing remi replied i guess we wont know until we reach the end selma what are the chances the bottle kholkov recovered in rum cay is doing them any good sam asked slim unless they have a codebook that is and based on how hes been on your heels every step of the way id say theyre lost heres elephant number two remi said at some point were going to have to get our hands on the rum cay bottle which means sam said a trip into the lions den sevastopol two thousand miles east of marseille hadeon bondaruk sat at his desk hands clasped before him spread across the burgundy leather blotter were a dozen highresolution color photographs each one highlighting a separate line of symbols for the tenth time in an hour he picked up a lighted magnifying glass and studied each photo in turn focusing on the minute details of every symbolthe right angle of this square the looping curve of a truncated omega the tilt of a crescent moon nothing there was nothing he tossed the magnifying glass across the desk then swept his arm over the surface scattering the photos despite its monetary value alone the bottle was worthless to him and now that the fargos had arnaud laurents book he had to assume they would quickly begin to unravel the code as much as he wanted to blame kholkov for the books loss bondaruk had to admit hed also underestimated the fargos they were treasure huntersadventurers neither he nor kholkov had anticipated they would be this much trouble or this resourceful perhaps they should have foreseen this after all it stood to reason the fargos escapades had landed them in enough dicey situations to have seasoned them still their resources couldnt hope to match his own on napoleon alone hed spent hundreds of thousands of dollars his researchers had dissected the mans life from cradle to grave had tracked down not only his every known descendant but those of the dozens of friends and advisers and lovers napoleon might have confided in arnaud laurent included every book written about napoleon had been scanned into their computer database and parsed for clues period artwork from battle scenes to portraits to rough sketches had been scoured for anything that might point the waya symbol on a tunic button a finger pointing at something in the background a book on a shelf behind napoleons head and for all that for all the money spent and time invested he had nothing but a useless bottle of wine and a pictograph of a damned insect his desk phone chimed and he picked it up its me vladimir kholkov said where have you been bondaruk growled i was expecting your call last night tell me whats happening we tracked them to marseille yesterday afternoon i met them and proposed a truceand a partnership you what i didnt tell you to do that proposing a truce and keeping a truce are two different things mr bondaruk at any rate they didnt budge where are they now back in marseille back what does that mean i had to leave france im in la jonquera on the other side of the spanish border the french police are looking for me someone put out a bulletin the fargos it has to be how would they do that im looking into it it doesnt matter if they leave ill know it how kholkov explained and bondaruk said what about the book i had a man watching their house but fargo wasnt bluffing theyve got security i think it would cause more trouble than its worth and since well know where theyre going and when we can let them do the hard work for us agreed bondaruk hung up strode to his window and forced himself to take a calming breath kholkov was right there was still time the fargos were ahead but they had a long way to go and many hurdles to clear before they reached the end sooner or later they would make a mistake when they did kholkov would be there chapter sevastopol sam pulled their rented opel coupe off the dirt road and coasted to a stop a few feet from the cliffs edge sunset was an hour away and the sun was already dropping toward the western horizon cast ing the surface of the black sea in tones of gold and red directly below them the palisades of cape fiolent plunged directly into the bluegreen water and just offshore dozens of spires of jagged rock jutted from the water each surrounded by a whirlpool of churning surf in the distance a gull cawed then went silent leaving only the sound of wind rushing through sams open window a little foreboding remi murmured just a tad sam agreed then again it does suit his reputation the he in question was hadeon bondaruk knowing that without another bottle with which to complete the next lines of the cipher sam and remi had chosen the only course open to them stealing bondaruks bottle it was a dangerous if not foolish idea but their adventures had taught them a number of things one of which sam had dubbed the inverse law of power and assumption of invulnerability given bondaruks power and notoriety who in their right mind would try to steal from him having reigned as ukraines mafia kingpin for so many years bondaruk like many powerful men had likely begun to believe his own press certainly he and his property were well guarded but like muscles that havent been exercised for many years there was a fair chance his security had grown laxor at least that was the theory of course neither of them were ready to risk such a venture on guesswork alone so they had asked selma to do a feasibility study were there any exploitable weaknesses in bondaruks home security there were she found one he kept his antique collection on display at the estate along with a small team of experts who maintained and supervised the pieces two the estate itself was sprawling and steeped in history a piece of which selma felt certain might offer them a way in they climbed out of the car walked to the edge and gazed north a mile away along the undulating coast perched before a rock bridge jutting from the cliff face was bondaruks hundredacre estate officially named khotyn the bridge undercut by millennia of erosion extended to a pillar of rock that rose from the ocean like a skyscraper bondaruks home was a fivestory thirtythousandsquarefoot kievan russtyle castle complete with steeply pitched slate roofs deepset gabled windows and oniondomed copper minarets all surrounded by a low whitestuccoed stone wall and serpentine groves of evergreen trees khotyn began its life in the mideighteenth century as home to a crimean khanate chieftain whose line had split from the mongol golden horde in the sixteenth century to settle in the area after a hundred years the chieftains clan was ousted by muscovite russian forces led by a zaporozhian cossack hetman who claimed it as a spoil of war only to have it taken from him thirty years later by a yet more powerful hetman during the crimean war khotyn was commandeered by tsar nicholas iis most prominent black sea fleet admiral pavel stepanovich nakhimov to serve as a retreat after which its role changed four times first as a museum dedicated to the siege of sevastopol then as a wehrmacht headquarters during world war ii then again as a military summer house for soviet high commanders after the city was liberated from to the fall of the soviet union khotyn fell again into ruin sitting mostly abandoned until bondaruk purchased it from the moneystarved ukrainian government in given the estates rich history selma had had little trouble finding plenty of tantalizing research trails to follow but in the end it was one of the basest of human motivationsgreedthat gave away the chink in khotyns armor give me the story again sam told remi as he stared at the estate through his binoculars his name was bogdan abdank remi replied he was the zaporozhian cossack who took it over from the mongols right seems abdank was only a parttime cossack the rest of the time he was a smugglerfur gems liquor slavesanything he thought he could sell on the black market he trafficked problem was there were plenty of other cossack clans and kievan rus warlords who wanted to take over abdanks action but old bogdan was crafty sam replied warming to the subject and industrious according to the online archives selma was able to unearth in the national taras shevchenko university of kiev abdank had used slave labor to dig into the cliffs and hills surrounding khotyn a series of tunnels in which to hide his illicit goods cargo ships laden with romanian sable or turkish diamonds or georgian prostitutes bound for the west would weigh anchor in the waters below khotyn for offloading into launches which would then disappear into the night ostensibly for further offloading into the smugglers tunnels beneath the mansion so more caves in our future remi said now looks like it the question is how familiar is bondaruk with khotyns history if the tunnels exist does he know about them and has he sealed them up better still has he followed in abdanks footsteps and put them to use sam checked his watch well well know shortly they had a contact to meet as it turned out selmas research into khotyn became something of a onestop shopping trip giving them not only a hint about how they might sneak into khotyn but also hopefully a road map of exactly how to go about it the archive curator at taras shevchenko university a man named petro bohuslav hated his work with a passion and he desperately wanted to move to trieste italy and open a bookstore after some parrying hed made his pitch to selma for the right price he was willing to share a set of rare as yet unarchived blueprints of khotyn as well as his personal knowledge of the grounds they found him in a momandpop restaurant overlooking the balaclava marina a few miles down the coast night had fully fallen by the time they arrived and the interior of the café was dimly lit by hurricane lamps on each table soft kobza folk music played over loudspeakers hidden by hanging ferns the air smelled of sausage and onions as they entered a man in a corner booth lifted his head and studied them for five long seconds then put his face back into his menu a hostess in a bright red shirt and white blouse approached them sam smiled and nodded at the man and they made their way through the tables to the booth mr bohuslav remi asked in english the man looked up he had receding white hair and a bulbous drinkers nose he nodded i am bohuslav you are mr and mrs jones thats right sit please they did something to eat drink no thank you remi said you want into khotyn yes we didnt say that sam replied were writers doing a book on the crimean war yes your assistant told me tough woman that one remi smiled she is that so this book you are writingit is about the siege of sevastopol or the war both you need special details you are willing to pay depends on the details sam replied and how special they are first tell me you know who lives there now remi shrugged no why a bad man bought khotyn in the nineties a criminal his name is bondaruk he lives there now many guards thanks for the information but were not planning an invasion sam lied tell us about you how do you know so much about the place not just from the blueprints i hope bohuslav grinned displaying a trio of silver front teeth no more than that you see after the war after we drove the germans out i was stationed there i was a cook for the general after that in i moved to kiev and worked at the university started as a janitor then became research assistant in the history department in the government decided to make khotyn a museum and they asked the university to head the project i went with others from the department to do a survey spent a month there mapping taking photographs exploring i have all my original notes and sketches and photos you see along with the blueprints those too the problem is remi said that was forty years ago a lot could have changed in that time who knows what the new owner has done since you were there bohuslav held up a finger in triumph hah you are wrong this man bondaruk last year he hired me to come to khotyn and consult on restoration he wanted help making it look more like zaporozhian cossack period i spent two weeks there except for decoration nothing has changed i went almost anywhere i wanted mostly without escort sam and remi exchanged oblique glances upon hearing about bohuslavs offer from selma their first concern was that bondaruk was setting a trap for them but upon further contemplation theyd decided this was unlikely primarily because of sams inverse law of power and assumption of invulnerability but also because of a suspicion that had been nagging at them since their journey had begun was bondaruk having had little luck unraveling the riddle on his own letting them run free in hopes that they would lead him to what theyd dubbed napoleons gold it was possible but still it didnt change their options keep going or quit but however unlikely the trap scenario they were still curious about bohuslavs motivation the amount he was asking forfifty thousand ukrainian hryvnias or ten thousand us dollarsseemed a paltry amount given what bondaruk would do to him should his betrayal be discovered sam and remi suspected desperation but about what why are you doing this sam asked for the money i want to go to trieste we heard but why cross bondaruk if hes as bad as you say he is he is then why risk it bohuslav hesitated his mouth twisting into a frown he sighed you know about pripyat yes the town near chernobyl remi replied yes my wife olena was there when she was younger when the nuclear plant exploded her family was one of the last to get out now she has cancerof the ovaries were sorry to hear that sam said bohuslav gave a fatalist shrug she has always wanted to see italy to live there and i promised her we would someday before she dies id like to keep my promise im more afraid of breaking my promise to olena than of bondaruk whats to keep you from simply turning around and selling us out to bondaruk for a higher price nothing except that i am not a stupid man what would i do go to him and say i was going to betray you but for more money i will not bondaruk does not bargain the last man who tried thata greedy policemandisappeared along with his family no friend i would rather deal with you less money but at least i will be alive to enjoy it sam and remi looked at one another then back to bohuslav im telling you the truth he said you give me money and i promise you will know more about khotyn than bondaruk does chapter leaning over the chart table under the dim red glow of the lamp above it remi used the compass and dividers to plot their current position she used the pencil clamped between her teeth to jot a few calculations along the charts margin then circled a spot on the course line and whispered were there in response sam standing at the helm throttled down the engines and turned off the ignition the fishing trawler coasted through the fog the water hissing along her sides until she slowed to a stop sam ducked out the pilothouse door dropped the anchor overboard then came back inside it should be off our port bow remi said joining him at the window he lifted a pair of binoculars to his eyes and scanned the darkness off the bow at first seeing only fog and then faintly in the distance a slowly pulsing white light nicely done sam said this point three miles off the lighthouse had been the critical waypoint for tonights journey and as their rented boat had not come equipped with a gps navigation system theyd had to rely on dead reckoning using their course speed and the occasional recognizable landmark picked out by the shortrange radar to guide their way if only that were the hard part remi replied come on lets get suited up the night before after agreeing to bohuslavs price and calling selma to approve the money transfer to his account theyd followed the ukrainian to the balaclava train station and waited in the car while he retrieved a leather satchel from one of the rental lockers a quick scan of the satchels contents seemed to confirm bohuslav was on the leveleither the sketches notes photos and blueprints inside were genuine or they were dealing with a professional forger back at their hotel in yevpatoria fifty miles up the coast from sevastopol they laid the contents of the satchel out on the bed and went to work with selma watching on via webcam after an hour of crosschecking what they already knew about bondaruks estate they were sure bohuslavs material was the real deal every entrance every stairwell and every room in the mansion was accounted for but more importantly so too were the rumors about bogdan abdanks smuggling tunnels khotyn was riddled with miles of them starting in the cliff face below the mansion where cargo was unloaded and branching into myriad storage chambers and exits some of which emerged from the earth almost a mile beyond the estates grounds more surprising was the discovery that the zaporozhian cossack had not been the only one to take advantage of the tunnels every subsequent occupant from the crimean wars admiral nakhimov to the nazis to the soviet red army had used them for a variety of purposes ammunition depots fallout shelters private brothels and in some cases as vaults for their own spoils of war however the one piece of information they most needed was missing from bohuslavs informationwhere precisely bondaruk might be keeping his bottle from napoleons lost cellar of course theres another possibility remi said perhaps hes got it locked away somewhere else i doubt it sam replied everything about bondaruks personality suggests hes a control freak he didnt get to where he is by leaving the important stuff to chance something hes this obsessed about hed want to have close at hand good point assuming thats right selma said over the webcam there might be some clues in the blueprints if hes a serious collectorand we know he isthen hes going to keep his most prized pieces in an environmentally controlled areathat means separate airconditioning units humiditycontrol systems backup power generators fire suppression and hell probably have it separated from the rest of the mansion check bohuslavs notes for any mention of those things it took an hour of work picking their way through bohuslavs chickenscratched notes which were written in both english and russian but finally remi found a room in the mansions western wing that was labeled secure utility room the location fits selma said heres something else sam said reading from another note denied access western side add that to the secure utility room and we may have found our x ironically the mansion itself was laid out in the shape of a peace symbol with the main portion of the house in the center two wings radiating out to the southeast and to the northeast and a third wing to the west and all encircled by the low stone wall the problem is remi said the plans show the smugglers tunnels merge with the mansion in two placesat the stables a couple hundred yards north of the house and in the southeast wing sam replied so we either have to hoof itno pun intendedacross the open ground to the west wing and hope we find a way in or come up on the southeast wing and pick our way through the house and pray were able to dodge the guards surprising neither of them selma had found them a reliable equipment source in yevpatoria an old soviet red army surplus store run by a former soldier turned bodyshop mechanic their outfits for the evening were a pair of cold warera naval commando camouflage coveralls their transport a fivefoot rubber dinghy complete with a batterypowered electric trolling motor suited up their faces streaked with black face paint they inflated the raft affixed the motor to the transom then lowered the raft over the side of the fishing boat donned their backpacks and climbed in remi pushed the trawlers gunwale and within seconds it disappeared in the fog sam turned the motors ignition and it hummed to life sitting on the bow remi aimed her compass at the lighthouse then lifted her hand and pointed into the fog damn the torpedoes sam said and throttled up the trolling motor was quiet but slow pushing them along at three knots barely a walking pace so it was an hour before remi who had kept a steady fix on the lighthouses pulsing beacon raised her hand calling a halt sam throttled down all was quiet save the waves lapping at the rafts sides fog swirled around them obscuring all but a few feet of black water around them sam was about to speak when he heard it in the distance the muffled crash of waves remi looked at him nodded and pointed again ahead lay their first hurdle given the nature of the black seas currents theyd decided to approach from the south while they wouldnt be fighting the tide they would have to pick their way through the spires of rock that jutted from the bay beneath bondaruks estate a dicey proposition in the dead of night let alone in the fog worse still assuming bondaruk had guards posted on the cliffs theyd decided against flashlights on their side they had remis keen hearing and sams quick reflexes moving at half throttle he aimed the rafts nose in the direction remi had indicated for thirty seconds then throttled down they listened to their left and right distantly came the hiss of waves eyes closed remi turned her head this way and that then pointed a few degrees left off the bow sam throttled up and kept going after twenty seconds remis hand shot up sam let up on the throttle keeping on just enough power to hold position in the sudden quiet they heard the crash of waves very close to the right then more on the left and behind they were surrounded suddenly dead on the bow a towering rock wall veined with rivulets of whitewater appeared in the fog the waves stacking atop one another in the shoals beneath them lifted the raft and shoved them forward sam remi rasped quietly hold on drop flat the spire loomed before the bow sam waited until the raft dropped into a trough then twisted the throttle to its stops and pushed it hard right the propeller bit down shooting them toward the spire before veering away the rock swept past on the left and disappeared in the gloom sam drove on for a ten count then throttled down again they listened closer on the right i think remi whispered sounds closer on the left to me sam replied toss a coin no chance your ears are better than mine he said and steered left stop remi called ten seconds later do you feel that yeah he replied looking around the raft was moving sideways and gaining speed they felt their stomachs rise into their throats as the raft was lifted on another crest ten feet to the right they caught a glimpse of jagged rock and then it was gone lost in the fog paddles sam called and grabbed his from the floor of the raft in the bow remi did the same sharp eyes sam muttered behind you remi called sam turned paddle coming up in his hands like a spear the spire was right there within arms reach he slammed the tip of the paddle into the rocks then leaned all his weight into it and pushed but the wave was too powerful and the raft simply rotated around the pivot point the paddle created coming around he called between clenched teeth got it remi was already moving turning on her knees to face the other side her paddle raised and ready with a splintering thunk she slammed it into the rocks the raft its momentum slightly slowed bounced off the rock and spun again sam leaned back dropping his center of gravity back into the raft and reached for the throttle his hand was halfway there when he felt his stomach rising again and heard the suddenly unmuffled whirring of the motor as the rafts tail end came out of the water he had only a fraction of a second to call remi before he felt himself tossed into the air knowing the rock was close but not how close he turned his head looking for it then out of the fog he saw it rushing toward his face chapter seconds or minutes or hours later sam felt his mind groping back toward consciousness one by one his senses started to return beginning with a feathery sensation on his cheek followed by the distinct and familiar smell of green apples hair he thought hair brushing my face coconut and almonds remis shampoo he forced open his eyes and found himself staring into her upsidedown face he looked around he was lying in the bottom of the raft his head resting on her lap he cleared his throat are you okay he asked am i okay remi whispered im fine you dummy youre the one that almost drowned what happened you slammed headfirst into the spire thats what happened i looked over just as you started to slip into the water i threw you the line you hadnt blacked out yet i shouted at you to grab the line and you did i reeled you in how long have i been out twenty twentyfive minutes he squeezed his eyes shut my head hurts youve got a gash in your hairline its pretty long but not very deep sam reached and probed with his fingertips finding a stretchable bandage wrapped around the upper part of his forehead hows your vision remi asked everythings dark thats a good sign its night okay how many fingers am i holding up sam groaned come on remi im fine humor me sixteen sam four fingers my name is sam and youre remi and were floating in a raft in the black sea trying to steal a bottle of wine from napoleons lost cellar from a mafia kingpin satisfied she gave him a quick peck on the lips youre right on all counts except the raft part what after i pulled you in i beached us im not sure where we are you navigated through the rest of the spires heck you should have been driving the whole time dumb luck and desperation sounds like a good name for a boat how is it by the way the raft i mean no leaks that i could find were still seaworthy what time is it just after midnight feel up to having a look around more remarkable even than remi having picked her way through the spires without suffering so much as a scratch was that shed found the patch of shale beach on which the raft now rested measuring no more than ten feet deep and twenty feet wide the beach narrowed in both directions to stone paths no more than two feet wide once sam was on his feet and had shaken out the cobwebs they first set out to the south but found the way blocked by a rock wall after only a few hundred yards to the north they fared better walking almost a half mile before coming across a rickety wooden stairway set into the cliff they climbed to the top and looked around here high above the oceans surface the brisk wind had driven the fog away but far below the ocean was still shrouded in mist using the compass they got their bearings sam said well you either headed farther south of the estate or past it to the north how long was it until you found the beach twenty minutes but i made several loops im sure so dont count on that how was the current for the most part choppy and almost dead on the bow probably headed south then sam lifted the binoculars and started scanning do you see the light in fact i do there it is she replied and pointed sam looked down her outstretched arm wait for it remi whispered a few seconds passed then in the darkness a single white light pulsed no more than two miles away sam said were still in business ten minutes later they were back in the water and motoring north taking care this time to keep within hearing distance of the waves hissing against the cliff face it was slack tide now and the swells were slow and rolling but still sam and remi were keenly aware that somewhere to their left were the spires ebb tide or not neither of them wanted to risk another run through the labyrinth after thirty minutes of travel sam throttled down and let the raft coast forward remi looked over her shoulder a questioning look on her face sam held a cupped hand to his ear and pointed off the bow and whispered boat the rumble of a highpowered engine at near idle echoed through the fog seemingly crossing from left to right somewhere ahead of them there came the squelch of a radio then a tinny voice saying something neither sam nor remi could make out ten seconds passed to their right a spotlight glowed to life in the haze and began tracking over the water nearer the beach after thirty seconds the light popped off and the boat began moving off heading back the way sam and remi had come bondaruks guards remi whispered or a ukrainian navy coastal patrol sam replied either way theyre someone we dont want to run into if it is part of bondaruks security we can take it as a good omen hows that if wed been spotted they would have sent more than one boat for the next hour they continued moving north along the coast while playing catandmouse with the mystery patrol boat which continued to move unseen through the fog around them engines gurgling and spotlight occasionally glowing to life scanning over the water then disappearing again three times sam had to use the trolling motor to circle slowly away from the panning light its on a schedule remi said ive been timing it that will come in handy sam replied do your best to keep track of it it has to be bondaruks if it were the navy why would they be patrolling this same patch of water good point after a few more minutes the boats engine noise once again faded and sam put the raft back on course and before long they saw the glow of lights to their right high up on the cliff remi took a bearing on the lighthouse and said thats it thats khotyn with remi perched in the bow eyes scanning ahead sam steered toward shore remis hand came up pointing left sam veered that way and saw to their right the cliff face materialize out of the fog he turned parallel to it and kept going the hum of the trolling motor changed its tone echoing off stone walls as they slipped inside the bridge beneath the estate from the drawings and blueprints of the island they knew it was a cavernous openended tunnel measuring eighty feet high and two hundred yards wide and running parallel to the shore for a hundred yards large enough to accommodate a mediumsized cruise ship we have to risk a light sam whispered remi nodded and pulled from her pocket a conenosed flashlight which she clicked on and began playing over the passing rock now we see if bohuslav is the real deal or a con man remi said the words had no sooner left her mouth when she murmured well speak of the devil call me a believer there sam right under my beam back up back up sam eased up on the throttle then reversed inching backward until they drew even with the spot from remis flashlight jutting from the rock face at chin height was what looked like a rusted railroad spike a foot above it was another then another sam leaned his head back as remi scanned the flashlight upward revealing a ladder of staggered spikes chapter if they stick to their schedule theyre already headed back this way remi said four or five minutes away at most the presence of the patrol boat had dramatically changed the linchpin to their exit strategy the raft if they left it here it would almost certainly be found and the alarm would be raised and there was no time to find a place to stash it which left only one option they donned their backpacks and then sam found a pair of handholds in the rock face and held the raft steady as remi used his shoulders as a step stool to the first spike once she had ascended high enough to make room for him he flipped open his swiss army knife and slit the rafts side tube from bow to stern then gripped the spike and pulled himself onto the face as the raft sank below him with a soft hissing sound time sam asked three minutes give or take remi replied and started climbing they were halfway to the top when sam heard the rumble of the outboard engines to their right as had the rafts trolling motor the tone of the patrol boats engines suddenly changed echoing through the arch remi companys arrived sam muttered ive got a tunnel opening here she replied it goes horizontally into the face but i cant see how far any port in the storm just go right the gurgle of the boats engine was directly below them now skimming along the face sam looked down while the boat itself was invisible in the fog he could see the mist cleaving before it like smoke around an object in a wind tunnel the spotlight popped and began playing over the cliff zigzagging upward im in remi whispered from above eyes alternating between the spikes above him and the rapidly ascending pool of light below him sam climbed the last few feet then suddenly felt remis hand on his own he coiled his legs beneath him and pushed off while simultaneously pulling with his arms he rolled into the tunnel and jerked his legs inside as the spotlight hovered over the opening for a moment then continued on they lay huddled together in the darkness sam trying to calm his breath as they listened to the boat make its way through the arch and the engine noise finally faded is this the place sam asked pushing himself up onto his elbows and looking around the tunnel was roughly oval in shape roughly five feet tall and six feet wide id say so remi said pointing bolted to the ceiling at the mouth of the tunnel was a crisscross bulwark of thick tarcovered oaken beams supported by vertical timbers bolted to the walls dangling from the center of the bulwark was a rusted blockandtackle pulley system linked by thick hawser rope to a handcrank winch affixed to the uprights a pair of narrowgauge rails sitting atop wooden cross ties and crushed gravel ballast stretched into the darkness well the winch isnt original thats for sure he said unless that is zaporozhian cossack technology was way ahead of its time see here those bolts are precisely machined this might go back to the crimean war but my guess is world war ii just look at the mitered joints this thing could have lifted thousands of pounds he stepped up to the mouth of the tunnel and peered over the edge ingenious see how they placed this just above this natural bulge in the face even in daylight it wouldve been invisible from the water i see it wow look at this sam what i hate to stifle your imagination but weve got a bottle of wine to steal right sorry lets go having used google earth to draw up their own overhead sketch of bondaruks estate complete with angles and distances as well as annotations from bohuslavs notes they kept track of their steps as they headed into the tunnel under the moving beam of their flashlights sam could see signs of limited blast work along the walls but it appeared most of the tunnel had been carved out the oldfashioned way by hammer chisel and backbreaking labor here and there on the floor were wooden toolboxes coils of halfrotted rope rusted pickaxes and sledgehammers a pair of halfrotted leather boots canvas coveralls that partially disintegrated when remi nudged them with her shoe attached to the rightand lefthand walls every ten feet were oil lamps their glass globes black with soot their bronze reservoirs and handles covered in a scabrous green patina sam tapped one with his index finger and heard sloshing inside after fifty yards of walking remi stopped studied the sketch and said we should be just under the outer wall another hundred yards or so and we should be directly under the main house she was off by only a few yards after another two minutes they reached a widened intersection the tunnel and tracks continuing straight as well as to the right five oldfashioned ore carts sat in a line against the lefthand wall while a sixth sat on the northsouth tracks straight ahead to the stables and right to the east wings sam said i think so he checked his watch lets check out the stables first and see what we can see after another half mile or so of walking remi stopped suddenly and placed her index finger to her lips and mouthed music they listened in silence for ten seconds then sam leaned in and whispered in remis ear summer wind by frank sinatra she nodded i hear voices laughing singing along yeah they continued on and soon the tunnel came to a dead end at a set of stone steps leading upward to a wooden trapdoor sam lifted his head and sniffed manure then were in the right place the music and laughter were louder now seemingly coming from directly above their heads sam placed his foot on the lowermost step at that moment there came the thunk of a footfall on the trapdoor sam froze another foot joined the first followed by two more these lighter somehow more delicate through the gaps in the trapdoor shadows moved blocking and unblocking the light a woman giggled and said in russianaccented english dont dmitry that tickles thats the idea my lapochka ooh i like that stop stop what about your wife what about her come on lets get back to the party before someone sees us not until you promise me the man said yes i promise next weekend in balaclava the couple moved off and moments later there came the banging of a wooden door somewhere above a horse whinnied then silence remi whispered weve managed to stumble into one of bondaruks damned parties talk about bad luck maybe good luck sam replied lets see if we can make it work for us what do you mean chances are decent that bondaruk is the only one who knows what we look like oh no sam he grinned remi where are your manners lets mingle once certain there was no one about sam climbed the steps lifted open the hatch and had a look around he turned back to remi its a closet come on he climbed up and held the hatch for remi then closed it behind her through the open closet door was another space this one a tack room dimly lit by theaterstyle lights along the baseboards they stepped through and out the opposite door and found themselves on a gravel alleyway bordered on both sides by horse stalls overhead was a high vaulted ceiling with inset exhaust fans and skylights through which pale moonlight filtered they could hear horses snorting softly and shuffling in the stalls at the far end of the stable perhaps thirty yards away was a set of double barn doors they walked to them and peeked out before them lay an acresized expanse of lush lawn surrounded by chesthigh hedges and flickering tiki torches multicolored silk banners fluttered on cross wires suspended over the lawn dozens of tuxedoed and eveninggowned guests mostly couples stood in clusters and strolled about chatting and laughing waiters in stark white uniforms moved through the crowd occasionally pausing to offer hors doeuvres and cocktails the source of sinatras summer wind polemounted loudspeakers strategically placed around the lawn now emitted a soft jazz number to sam and remis right they could see the upper floors of bondaruks mansion its oniondomed minarets silhouetted against the dark sky to the left through an entrance gap in the hedges sam could see a gravel parking lot packed with several million dollars worth of bentleys mercedeses lamborghinis and maybachs were underdressed remi muttered severely sam agreed i dont see him do you remi moved closer to the gap and scanned the throng no but with the torchlight its hard to tell sam shut the door let go check out the southeast wing they went back through the tack room trapdoor retraced their steps down the tunnel and took the east branch almost immediately they found side tunnels spaced at twenty to thirtyfoot intervals along the north wall storage chambers and other exits sam said remi nodded shining her flashlight on her sketch bohuslav has these marked but theres no description of where they go they shined their flashlights into the darkness but could see nothing past ten feet somewhere in the distance they could hear wind whistling i dont know about you but i vote we avoid another dungeonlike maze if we can amen they kept walking and after a few hundred yards found themselves standing before another set of stone steps this time remi took the lead crouching beneath the trapdoor and listening until certain the way was clear she lifted the hatch peeked out then ducked back down again its pitchdark i cant tell where we are lets go up well see if our eyes adjust remi climbed through the hatch then stepped aside so sam could join her he eased the hatch shut and carefully reached out trying to measure the space it was roughly four by four feet square after thirty seconds of standing still their eyes slowly began to adjust and they could make out a thin rectangle of light to their left sam crept to the wall and pressed his eye to the gap he pulled back frowned then looked again what remi asked books he whispered its a bookshelf he felt along the wall and found a recessed wooden latch he lifted it up placed his palm against the wall and gently pushed soundlessly the wall swung away from them on hidden hinges revealing a footwide gap sam stepped into it and leaned out he jerked his head back and had no sooner swung the bookcase shut again when a mans voice said olga is that you footsteps padded across a rug paused then padded in another direction olga silence for a few seconds then the sound of water running the water shut off footsteps again then a door opening and shutting sam pushed the bookcase open again and peeked out all clear he whispered to remi together they stepped out and shut the bookcase behind them they were in a bedroom measuring twenty feet on a side with an adjoining bathroom the space was furnished in heavy walnut furniture a massive fourposter bed and wellworn expensive turkish rugs what now remi asked sam shrugged lets spruce up and join the festivities chapter youre serious arent you dont i look serious yes thats what worries me why because its nuts thats why theres a fine line between nuts and ingenious and an even finer line between ingenuity and idiocy sam chuckled i didnt see any security guards at the party did you no which means theyre focused on the perimeteron keeping people out the guests have all been vetted and probably frisked there were sixty or seventy people out there and i didnt see anyone checking invitations you know the rule look like you belong and you belong that sounds more like a sam fargoism than a rule i like to think theyre one and the same i know you do as for the guards its unlikely theyd know us from the king and queen of england you think its even crossed bondaruks mind that wed try to invade his home no chance his ego is too big for that fortune favors the bold remi another fargoism and what if the man himself appears well avoid him well keep our eyes on the guests given bondaruks reputation theyll be our best earlywarning system when hes near theyll part like a school of fish in sharkinfested waters remi sighed how sure are you about this about what part all of it sam smiled and gave her hand a squeeze relax worst case we walk around get the lay of the land then come back here and plan our next step chewing her lip she thought about it for a moment then nodded okay lets see if olga is my size the fit wasnt perfect but with a few safety pins remi found in the bathroom she was able to tuck and gather the black vnecked evening gown until only a fashion designer would be able to tell it hadnt been fitted for her remi did the same for sams classic black tuxedo cinching the waistband and gathering the shirt at the small of his back with a pin with their faces washed hair combed and camouflage coveralls and backpacks safely stashed inside the bookcase they gave one another a onceover stuffed sams pockets with a few essential items then left arm in arm they started down the hall which like the bedroom was decorated in somber dark wood heavy rugs tapestries and landscape oil paintings they counted doors as they walked but stopped after they reached thirty assuming the room theyd just left wasnt an aberration it seemed clear this was bondaruks guest wing one problem remi muttered as they reached the end of the hall and stepped into a highceilinged room flanked by a pair of brown granite spiral stairways the rest of the space was divided into seating areas of wellworn leather chairs and divans here and there sconces cast soft pools of light on the walls arched doorways to their right and directly ahead led to other parts of the house what problem sam asked neither of us speaks russian or ukrainian true but we do speak the international language he replied as another couple entered the room and strolled toward them which is a smile and a polite nod he replied giving both to the passing couple who returned the greeting once they were out of earshot sam said see there magical a waiter appeared before them holding a tray of champagne flutes they each took one and the waiter disappeared and if someone tries to strike up a conversation remi asked have a coughing fit its the perfect excuse to slip away so which way do we go west if his collection is here thats where well find it you have the sketch in my cleavage mmm behave yourself apologies okay lets see how close we can get to the secure utility room before we see signs of security i havent seen any cameras yet have you no another couple approached sam and remi raised their glasses smiled and kept going i just had a thought she said what if we run into olga and her husband and they recognize their own clothes well that would be a problem wouldnt it the next room they entered was what bohuslav had called in his survey the sword room upon entering they instantly realized the name was woefully inadequate measuring seventy by forty feet the walls were painted a flat black and the floor covered in black roughcut slate in the center of the room was a rectangular glass case lit from within by recessed spotlights in the floor smaller than the room by only a few feet and bordered by bloodred carpet runners the case was filled with no fewer than fifty ancient edged weapons from axes and swords to pikes and daggers each resting on its own marble pedestal bearing a placard written in both russian and english eight or ten couples circulated around the room staring in fascination at the case their faces lit from below as they pointed at different weapons and murmured to one another sam and remi joined them but were careful to remain quiet history buff that he was sam immediately recognized many of the weapons the famous claymore the scottish twohanded broadsword a bardiche a russian poleax a short curved french falchion a shamshir a persian saber an ivoryhandled omani khanjar the japanese katana the samurais weapon of choice the classic roman short sword known as the gladius still others were new to him a british mameluke saber a turkish yataghan a viking throwing ax known as the mammen a rubyinlaid moroccan koummya remi leaned in close and whispered not very original is it whats that a murderer having a knife collection it would have been so much more interesting if this case were filled with porcelain dolls they reached the far end of the case rounded the corner and paused to admire a gleaming sickleshaped egyptian khopesh from the other side of the case there came a murmuring of voices through the length of the glass case sam and remi could see couples stepping aside as a figure entered the room the shark has arrived remi murmured and here i am without my bucket of poison chum sam said speaking in lightly accented english hadeon bondaruks deep basso voice filled the room good evening ladies and gentlemen i can see by your expressions you find my collection fascinating shoulders back hands clasped behind his back like a general inspecting a line of soldiers bondaruk strolled down the side of the case the tools of war often have that effect as socalled civilized people we try to pretend were not captivated by death and violence but its in our genetic makeup in our hearts were all neanderthals fighting for survival bondaruk stopped and looked around as though daring anyone to disagree with him seeing no challengers he continued walking unlike his guests he wore not a tuxedo but a pair of black trousers and a matching black silk shirt he was a lean man with sharp facial features glittering black eyes and thick black hair tied into a short ponytail he looked ten or fifteen years younger than his reported age of nearly fifty he paid no attention to his guests all of whom respectfully stepped aside at his approach the men watching him warily the women studying him with expressions that ranged from outright fear to curiosity bondaruk stopped and tapped the glass before him the kris dagger he said to no one in particular the traditional weapon of the malay beautiful with its wavy blade but not very practical more for ceremony than for killing he walked on then stopped again heres a fine piece the chinese dao perhaps the best melee weapon ever produced he continued on stopping every few feet to hold forth on another weapon offering either a brief history lesson or his personal impression of the weapons efficacy as he neared the end of the case sam casually stepped backward drawing remi along with him until they were standing with their backs to the wall bondaruk his face reflected in the glass turned the corner and stopped to admire a sixfoottall halberd he stood less than six feet away now remi tightened her hand on her husbands forearm sam his gaze fixed on bondaruk tensed himself ready to charge the moment bondaruk turned toward them that he would recognize them wasnt in doubt whether sam could subdue him and turn him into a human shield was the question without that advantage the guards would swarm them inside of a minute finally bondaruk said the halberd leave it to the british to come up with a weapon that is both ugly and purposeless the guests chuckled and murmured their agreement then bondaruk walked on turning the corner and beginning his strolling lecture down the opposite side of the case after a few more comments bondaruk strode to the door turned to the crowd nodded curtly then disappeared remi let out her breath well hes got a presence ill give him that its cruelty sam muttered he wears it like a cape you can almost smell it on him i got the same odor from kholkov sam nodded yes i thought for a moment there you were going to go for him for a moment i thought so too come on lets find what we came for before i change my mind chapter the farther west through the mansion they walked the fewer party guests they encountered while the mansion and its wings were laid out as a peace symbol the main portion of the house was an octagon with sitting rooms parlors dens and libraries surrounding a central foyer after twenty minutes of wandering they found themselves in a darkened conservatory filled with potted palms and hangingtrellis half walls overflowing with flowering vines through the arched glass ceiling they could see diamondspeck stars against the black sky to their left through the floortoceiling glass walls was a long porch surrounded by hedges set into the northwest wall was a single door they made one circuit through the conservatory to check for cameras and to make sure they were alone then headed to the door it was locked sam was reaching into his pocket for his pick set when a voice behind them said excuse me sir may i ask what youre doing sam didnt give himself a chance to think but simply reacted on instinct he turned on the man and barked in what he hoped was passable russianaccented english finally where have you been do you know the humiditycontrol sensors have been going off in there pardon me you are security yes yes sir however mr bondaruk told us to come straight here that someone would meet us weve already been standing here for what dear five minutes remi didnt miss a beat nodding firmly at least that the guard narrowed his eyes at them if youll wait just a moment ill confirm fine do what you must but let me ask you this have you ever seen what condensation can do to a ninehundredyearold bardiche with a mongolian red maple handle have you the guard shook his head his portable radio halfway to his mouth sam said here look at this palmthis is a perfect example of what im talking about do you see the leaves he took a step forward and to the guards left pointing at a nearby palm tree already distracted by his own radio the guard reacted with natural curiosity turning his head to look at what sam had indicated in that fleeting moment sam reversed direction spinning on his right heel he swept his left foot in a short arc hooking the mans right ankle and kicking it out from under him even as the guard stumbled backward sam was spinning again this time with a perfectly timed uppercut that caught the man squarely on the chin he was unconscious before he hit the floor wow remi breathed and here i thought your judo was just a hobby it is it just happens to be a very practical hobby next ones yours by the way find me a foil and youve got a deal mongolian red maple is there such a thing i have no idea sam knelt down scooped up the mans radio then frisked him finding a glock ninemillimeter pistol in a hip paddle holster a set of handcuffs a hotelstyle card key and a key ring this he tossed to remi who began trying keys in the door sam rolled the guard onto his belly cuffed his hands behind his back gagged him with his own tie then dragged him by the collar into the corner and rearranged a few potted palms so he would be harder to spot got it remi said turning and holding up one of the keys did you check the door she nodded didnt see any alarm wires the striker plate and latch look pretty standard well well know for sure in about five seconds sam said then inserted the key into the lock and turned the knob silence no whooping alarms no blaring klaxons still could be a silent alarm remi said true hurry over there they sprinted to the corner and ducked down with the guards body one minute passed two minutes and still there were no pounding footsteps or loudspeaker announcements it cant be this easy remi said can it no chance no turning back now unless you want to that is me she replied with a smile im just starting to enjoy myself thats my girl on the other side of the door they found a tenfootlong corridor painted in pure white and lit by recessed overhead fluorescent lights at the far end of the corridor was another door this one made of heavy steel and controlled by a wallmounted card reader very tricky sam said see that quartersized clear screen above the reader yes its a biometric thumbprint scanner which means theres probably a security control center somewhere i agree it looks like we need our friend wait here sam stepped out the first door then reappeared dragging the guard behind him he handed remi the card key then together they hoisted the man up so sam could wrap his arms around his waist and remi had access to his cuffed hands we might get as few as two chances at this before we trip something and attract some more company he said swipe first then the thumbprint right i think great sam spread his legs wider for leverage then shufflewalked the mans limp form to the reader remi swiped the card then grabbed the guards thumb and pressed it to the scanner the reader emitted a squelchy beep strike one sam said im nervous second times the charm hurry this guys getting heavy she took a break then tried again the reader let out a soft welcoming chime followed by a metallic snick as the lock disengaged open it just an inch before the lock reengages sam said backing away and laying the guard down be right back he dragged the guard back out the first door then returned see anything sam asked remi eased the door open another inch pressed her eye to the gap for a few seconds then pulled back and whispered no cameras that i can see lets go remi opened the door and they stepped through the room was circular with graypainted walls and navy blue carpet pot lights in the ceiling cast pools of light on the floor directly ahead of them at the ten oclock and two oclock positions on a clock face were two card reader doors they each took a door sam left remi right and checked for wires they found none repeating their earlier swipethumb process they first checked the lefthand door inside was a small landing and a set of steps that descended fifteen feet to a burgundycarpeted corridor lit by soft baseboard lights they checked the righthand door its a square alcove about ten by ten feet remi whispered pulling it open an inch straight ahead is another doora latch but no lock that i can see the wall to the right is glass from waist height to the ceiling on the other side is what looks like a control rooma couple computer workstations and a radio console theres another door behind the workstations lights dark except for the glow of the computer monitors cameras she peeked again this time dropping into a crouch and craning her neck she pulled back again and nodded only one that i can seea blinking green light near the ceiling in the righthand corner is it fixed no rotating good for us bad for them how so in a space that small they should have gone with a fixed camera and a fisheye lens no blind spots to hide in watch it count how long it takes to make a complete pan she did so four seconds sam frowned not a lot of time you have a preference no lets go left first they dragged the guard through the door dropped him on the landing then descended the steps hunched over so they could scan the corridor ahead they saw no blinking green camera lights they kept going after thirty feet the corridor ended at an oaken door bearing a gold plaque embossed in cyrillic lettering while neither of them read russian the style of the plaque suggested its context private keep out the knob too was gold sam tried it unlocked he swung it open another circular room this one thirty feet in diameter and pan eled in polished and centercut burled walnut the floor was covered in what looked to be a handwoven turkish rug thats a dosemealti remi whispered pardon me the rug its a dosemealtitheyre woven by yoruk nomads extremely rare and extremely expensive i read an article about them last month in every square yard of that thing are almost two hundred thousand handstitched knots impressive yes but something tells me its not the prize of this room no kidding spaced every few feet along the curved walls were gleaming glass cases each containing yet another piece of militaria displayed on a marble pedestal the room was dark save a single halogen lamp mounted inside each case unlike the sword room however the decor here made it clear this collection was for bondaruks eyes only any remaining doubt about this was quashed by the highbacked leather chair sitting in the exact center of the room it has a distinctly thronelike feel doesnt it sam asked exactly what i was thinking they split up each strolling along a wall studying each piece in turn heres something called a gerron sam said over his shoulder stopping before a case displaying a tall oval shield made of wicker and leather used by persian troops ive got a persian sword over here remi replied from across the room an akinakes its called it was carried by persian immortals of the achaemenid dynasty looks like we have a theme going ive got a sagaris over here a persian battleaxalso from the achaemenid dynasty they continued their tour each reading aloud from the placards as they went shields spears daggers long bows all from the ancient persian achaemenid dynasty of xerxes i i think someones got a fetish remi said as they met back near the door i agree sam replied unless i miss my guess we may have just found the bondaruk skeleton weve been looking for maybe but that begs the question what does any of this have to do with napoleons lost cellar they made their way back to the bluecarpeted rotunda remi crouched by the righthand door pulled it open and took another peek nothings changed okay heres what were going to do sam said then quickly explained once i go in if the camera stops panning close the door and find a place to hide it might mean theyve seen something and guards are on the way what about you you worry about you ill be right on your heels they switched places at the door sam waited until the camera had panned fully to the right then dropped to his belly and slithered through the door he rolled right until his back touched the wall then crawled along it to the next door now he could hear the faint whirring of the cameras pivot motor remi once again kneeling beside the door tapped the floor twice with her fingernail camera away slowly sam turned his head until he could see through the glass he checked the ceiling and walls above the computer workstations for cameras he saw none out of the corner of his eye he saw the camera panning back toward him remi tapped her fingernail oncecamera comingand he ducked down five seconds passed remi tapped twice sam reached up and tried the doorknob it was unlocked he rolled left and got to his knees careful to keep his head below the glass he waited until remi gave him the allclear double tap again then turned the knob pushed open the door crawled through and shut it behind him three seconds later he was standing pressed against the wall below the camera he gave her a thumbsup fifteen seconds later she was through both doors and standing beside him the control room was twice as big as the alcove under the halfglass wall was a long white melamine desk holding two computer towers and twentyfourinch lcd displays fifteen feet down the wall against which they stood was the other door sam tapped his ear pointed to the camera then to himself might have microphone will check remi nodded her understanding synchronizing his movements with the cameras panning sam ducked first left then right rising up on his tiptoes so he could get a clear view of the camera no sound he told remi ill check the door you say go they waited watching the camera pivot above their heads go sam slid left down the wall checked the doorknob found it unlocked then slid back our luck is holding he said thats what makes me nervous the cameras panning speed didnt leave them enough time to open the next door peek through then either pull back or keep going well have to take our chances and risk it sam said i know ready she took a deep breath let it out then nodded they watched the camera waiting for it to swing fully away then dashed down the wall opened the door and stepped through chapter they were greeted by the blinding glare of white light before their eyes could adjust a scottishaccented voice said hey who are you what are you hand held before his eyes sam jerked the glock up and pointed it toward the voice hands up okay okay for gods sake dont shoot me their eyes adjusted they were in a laboratory clean room painted all white save the floor which was covered in white antistatic antimicrobial rubber tiles in the center of the space was a twelvebysixfoot worktable surrounded by rolling stools on the shelves and tables was sam estimated a quartermillion dollars worth of restoration equipment including autoclaves glassfronted refrigeration units two zeiss stereomicroscopes a polarized fluorescence microscope and a handheld xrf xray fluorescence device on the tables formica surface rested what looked like pieces from bondaruks war collectiona broken spear handle a doublesided ax head a tarnished and bent civil war cavalry sword a triangle of articulated stainless steel halogen lamps shined down from the ceiling the man who stood before them was short and bald save a fringe of orange hair above his ears he was dressed in a kneelength white lab coat from behind a pair of thick blackrimmed glasses his eyes were comically magnified well thats a familiar sight remi said pointing projected on one of the monitors was a piece of cracked leather bearing a grid of symbols eureka sam muttered then he said to the man who are even as the words left sams mouth the man spun and began sprinting toward the far wallheading for sam realized the red mushroomshaped panic button mounted there stop sam shouted to no effect damn it behind him remi was moving she leaped forward snatched the spear handle from the table and hurled it sidearm it spun through the air in a flat arc and smacked the man behind the knees arm already outstretched for the button he grunted and pitched forward his head slammed into the wall with a dull thud just below the button he slid facefirst to the floor unconscious sam eyes wide his gun still raised stared at her she looked back at him and offered a shrug and a grin i used to toss a baton when i was a kid it shows bet youre hell in a horseshoe pit hope i didnt kill him oh god i didnt kill him did i sam walked over knelt down and rolled the man onto his back protruding from his forehead was a purple eggshaped lump sam checked for a pulse hes just down for a long nap hell have a headache for a few days but nothing else remi was standing before the monitor displaying the symbol grid you think its the bottle from rum cay she asked i sure hope so if not that means bondaruks got more than one bottle look around see if its here they checked the humiditycontrol cabinets the refrigerators and the drawers beneath the worktable but found no sign of either the bottle or the label its probably a digital image remi said studying the monitor see the edge there on the left it looks color enhanced as much as id like to get the bottle away from bondaruk this might be all we need see if you can print sam stopped talking and cocked his head you hear that oh crap he pointed in the corner partially hidden from view by a cabinet was a wallmounted video camera it stopped panning the lens aimed directly at them companys coming remi said quick check the keyboard see if you can print us a screen capture of the label as remi started tapping on the keyboard sam sprinted to the corner grabbed the feed wire beneath the camera and jerked it loose next he ran to the door flipped off the lights and returned to remi who said got it and tapped a key the laser printers lights blinked green and it hummed to life from the control room they heard a door bang open then shut then open again footsteps clicked on linoleum then went silent down sam whispered then dropped onto his belly and pulled remi with him stay here and grab that printout he crawled down the short side of the table and peeked his head out at the door the knob was slowly turning he extended the glock and took aim the laser printer started rhythmically humming printing remi whispered the door burst open revealing a figure silhouetted by the control rooms lcd monitors sam fired once the bullet struck the man in the calf just below the knee he screamed and toppled forward his weapona compact heckler koch mp submachine gunbounced across the rubber floor and landed a few feet from sam in the control room he heard a hushed voice bark somethinga curse sam assumed from the tonein russian the man sam shot was whimpering and crawling back toward the door got it remi called details perfect we can use it come around sam whispered she crawled around the corner and tapped his ankle here sam turned handed her the glock and said when i say go fire three shots through the door aim for the glass wall okay sam got to his knees took a breath go remi popped up and started firing glass began shattering sam somersaulted out from behind the table veered left grabbed the mp then scuttled back to cover whatre they waiting for remi asked reinforcements or better weaponry would be my guess we need to get out of here before either arrives as if on cue a hand appeared around the edge of the door and hurled something the object bounced off the side of the table hit the rubber floor then came to a spinning rest down remi sam shouted moving on instinct and on the faith that hed correctly identified the thrown object sam stood up took a bounding leap and soccerkicked the object back toward the door as it reached the threshold it exploded blinding white light and a deafening boom filled the lab sam stumbled backward and collapsed behind the table what in gods name was that remi said shaking her head to clear it flashbang grenade special forces and swat teams use them to distract the bad guys a lot of sound and light but no shrapnel how did you know discovery channel at least now we know one thingtheyre trying to avoid any shooting in here how about a little distraction of our own remi said pointing with the glock sam looked on the wall opposite the panic button was a paperbacksized plexiglas box housing a yellow mushroom bearing a pictograph of a water droplet thatll do two shots if you will ready go remi popped up and opened fire sam charged to the wall and slammed the butt of the mp sideways into the plexiglas box ripping it from the wall he jerked the lever down from unseen loudspeakers a computergenerated female voice made an announcement first in russian and then in english warning fire suppression system activated evacuate area immediately warning fire suppression system activated sam rushed back behind the table rains coming remi protect that printout already tucked away cleavage safer found a ziplock baggie to the right in the corner of his eye sam saw movement in the doorway he spun let loose a quick threeround burst a monitor in the control room exploded in a shower of sparks then started smoking he dove behind the table again with a whir silver nozzles descended from the ceiling there was a onesecond delay followed by a pophiss the nozzles exploded into cones of water sam peeked his head around the corner of the table in time to see a figure run through the alcove and disappear through the door lets go before the cavalry arrives sam rasped over the rush of water wait im checking my ammunition ive got nine shots left ready when you are when i go put three more shots through the doorway then follow me stay directly behind me got it yep go sam got up and charged as he passed the end of the table he reached out with his right hand and snagged one of the rolling stools ten feet from the door he pushed it ahead of him then gave it a kick at that moment a figure appeared in the doorway the stool already tipping over and spinning crashed into the mans legs arms flailing he stumbled backward into the still smoking computer monitor sam was through the door in three more paces he reversed the mp across his body and slammed it squarely into the center of the mans face with a sickening crunch his nose shattered he went limp and slid off the table legs still entangled in the stool sam picked up the fallen mans mp and handed it to remi what now she asked flipping her sopping hair away from her face nothing complicated we run for our lives they went through the first door into the alcove then through the cardreader door and into the corridor beyond where the trapped water had risen to ankle depth the overhead fluorescent lights had gone dark remi asked you have a plan right wouldnt call it a plan a sketch maybe good enough for me he turned to her and took her free hand in his own are you ready for this you may have to do something you dont want to do remi smiled water ran down her cheeks and over her lips in rivulets like shoot someone no worries they started it thats my girl okay we go on three stay low and head left for cover if it moves shoot it gladly sam grabbed the knob one two chapter three crouched down sam threw open the door except for moonlight filtering through the ceiling the conservatory was dark and separated as it was from the lab area not raining water from the corridor gushed out and began spreading across the floor sam and remi waited watching silence nothing moved remi whispered where are they a flashbang thunked into the wall beside the door and landed at their feet sam kicked it away with his heel and slammed the door shut from the other side came a bang white light flashed through the cracks sam opened the door an inch and was this time greeted by the sound of pounding footsteps and the sight of flashlights jostling their way toward them across the conservatory mind if i borrow that sam asked and took remis mp when i start shooting you head right take out a window and go for the patio and you im going to bring down the house go sam pushed the door open angled both mps at the ceiling and opened fire hunched over remi charged toward the patio the barrel of her glock flashing orange and bucking in her hand knowing the glass itself was probably reinforced sam aimed for the support joints near the peak with a reverberating elongated cracking sound the joints gave way the first plate of glass collapsed inward and tumbled downward followed by another then another crashing through the palm trees and cleaving trellis walls as they went voices started shouting in russian but almost immediately changed to screams as the first pane struck the floor shards of glass shot across the conservatory like shrapnel ripping through foliage and peppering the walls sam already moving saw all this out of the corner of his eye remis shots had struck true shattering one of the wall panes she was already crouched on the patio waving for him to hurry he felt a pluck at his sleeve then a trio of stings on his face he put his head down and his arms up kept running and leaped through remis opening youre bleeding remi said maybe ill end up with a dueling scar come on he handed her back one mp then turned and ran for the hedges arms held before him like a wedge he bulldozed through the tangle of branches into open air then reached back in and pulled remi through on the other side of the hedge they could hear the shattering of glass every few seconds as the remainder of the conservatory roof continued to collapse voices some in english and some in russian called to one another similarly from the main house and what sam and remi guessed was the party area came a cacophony of voices from bondaruks guests sam and remi crouched down in the grass to catch their breath and get their bearings to their right fifty yards away was the estates cliffside wall behind them lay the west wing the main part of the mansion and the east wings directly ahead a hundred feet away stood a line of closely set pine trees fronted by barberry bushes sam checked his watch four am a few hours before dawn lets steal one of the cars remi said taking off her shoes snapping off their high heels then settling them back on her feet we drive like hell for sevastopol and find someplace with lots of people bondaruk wouldnt dare do anything in public dont count on it besides thats too obvious by now theyve got the perimeter locked down dont forget the only way hell know its us is from the camera footage or by putting our pictures in front of the guy back in the lab right now all he knows is all hell is breaking loose better we maintain that mystery how retrace our steps the last place theyll check is the way we came in back through the tunnel and then what swim for the boat sam shrugged i hadnt gotten to that part yet still i think its our best chance remi gave it five seconds of thought then said smugglers tunnel it isunless we spot a helicopter or a tank somewhere along the way you find me a tank remi fargo and ill never drive over the speed limit again promises promises of all the unknowns about bondaruks estate two were of the greatest concern to sam and remi one did bondaruk have guard dogs two how many gunmen did he have either on the property or in reserve ready to come when called though they didnt know the answer to either of these questions they decided to assume the worst and get out while confusion still reigned and before their host had a chance to muster whatever houndshuman or caninehe had at his disposal hunched over they sprinted in bursts to the end of the hedges paused to make sure the way was clear then dashed across an open patch of lawn to the line of barberry bushes sam took off his tuxedo jacket and gave it to remi then dropped to his belly and wriggled through the thorny branches and onto the narrow strip of grass before the pine grove remi joined him a few moments later and started to take off his jacket keep it he said temperatures dropping she smiled always the gentlemansam your arms he looked down the barberry thorns had shredded his shirtsleeves the white material was streaked and dotted with blood looks worse than it is but this shirt is going to get us caught they crawled a few feet into the pine trees sam dug into the earth grabbed a handful of dirt and began rubbing it over his shirtfront sleeves and face remi did his back then her own arms and face sam couldnt help but smile looks like weve been to the cocktail party from hell not far off look there a hundred yards east across the lawn they saw a trio of flashlights appear around the corner of the house and begin moving along the wall toward them hear any dogs sam asked no lets hope it stays that way come on they moved deeper into the trees ducking under and sidestepping lowhanging branches until they came across a narrow northsouth game trail they took it heading north toward the stables the pine grove was untouched oldgrowth a hundred or more years old which was both a curse and a blessing while the intertwined boughs frequently forced them to crawl and crabwalk it also provided perfect cover several times as they stopped to catch their breath they watched as guards moved along the other side of the tree line not thirty feet away but so dense was the foliage that their flashlight beams penetrated only a few feet eventually theyll send someone in sam whispered but with luck well be long gone before that how far to the stables on a straight line a quarter mile but this grove zigzags so its probably double that ready whenever you are for the next twenty minutes they picked their way along the game trail pausing every dozen paces to look and listen frequently they saw flashlights or shadowed figures moving around the estate grounds sometimes hundreds of yards away sometimes so close that sam and remi had to lie flat not daring to breathe or move as the guards scanned the trees before moving on finally the grove began to thin around them and soon the game trail opened into a clearing of grass across which they could see the south wall of the stables sam wriggled ahead did a quick reconnaissance then returned to remi the party lawn is off to our right the guests are gone but all the cars are still in the parking lot bondaruks probably got them inside lined up for interrogation remi muttered wouldnt be surprised i didnt see any posted guardsexcept for one and as bad luck would have it hes standing at the corner of the stables right beside the entrance any chance of taking him out not unless i can levitate his heads on a swivel i wouldnt get halfway across the clearing before he heard me i do however have an idea he explained how far she asked sixty seventy yards over the stable roof no less its a long shot if youll pardon the pun they spent a few minutes rummaging around the trees until they had a pile of a half dozen golfballsized stones sam picked up the first one crabwalked to the edge of the clearing waited for the guard to look away then popped up and hurled the stone it sailed in a high arc over the stable roof sam popped back down and scurried back silence miss remi whispered sam grabbed another stone and repeated the process another miss then a third and then a fourth he picked up the fifth stone shook it in his hand like a pair of dice then held it before remis lips for luck she rolled her eyes but dutifully blew on the stone he crawled out waited for his moment then hurled the stone two seconds passed from the parking lot came the sound of breaking glass followed by the rhythmic honking of a car alarm you sank someones battleship remi said the alarm had an immediate and dramatic effect starting with the guard at the stable door who turned and sprinted toward the parking lot voices from other parts of the estate began shouting to one another sam and remi bolted for cover and sprinted for the wall reaching it in under ten seconds bent at the waist now they slid down its length to the corner ahead of them they saw five or six guards rush headlong across the party area and through the hedges go sam rasped they stepped out around the corner and through the door into the stables they werent two steps inside when a massive dark form rose up before them sam pushed remi left then rolled right the horse a jetblack arabian stallion standing at least sixteen hands high reared up its hooves clawing the air before sam it let out a deepchested snort then slammed back to the ground galloped down the alleyway and disappeared into an open stall door behind sam the door opened the guard saw remi first and wheeled on her his mp coming up before he could utter a word sam was there driving a right cross into his temple he stumbled sideways and fell to the ground as remi scooped up his gun sam closed the door and dropped the crossbar into place outside they could hear boots pounding on gravel so much for a stealthy exit sam muttered at this point ill settle for any exit at all remi replied they turned and sprinted for the tack room chapter they had just reached the entrance to the tack room when the pounding on the stable door began instinctively sam and remi spun looking back how long do you think she asked then followed sam into the closet they knelt beside the trapdoor he said thirty seconds before they start shooting another thirty for them to smarten up and find something to slip into the jamb and pop up the latch two minutes no more that plan you mentioned sketch whatever lets hear it he took ten seconds to explain remi said we could just make a run for it one big problem if theyre faster than i give them credit for well be caught on the cliff theyll pick us off like pigeons my way well at least have some cover and maybe even turn them back good point okay ill handle the heavy stuff you gather the supplies if we do it right it should be enough to slow them downmaybe even turn them back ever the optimist sam ducked back into the tack room grabbed the desk chair and carried it back into the closet he closed the door and jammed the chair beneath the knob remi already had the trapdoor open and was climbing down sam followed and shut it behind him guided by their flashlights they set to work sam jogging back to the intersection where he began manhandling ore carts away from their place along the wall and onto the tracks while remi ran down the tunnel toward the cliff entrance distantly there came the chatter of automatic weapons fire good guess remi called from the darkness i was kind of hoping to be wrongby three or four hours he replied shoving a second cart into place a minute later he had the third one seated on the tracks remi ran out of the darkness carrying a handful of oil lanterns she hurled two or three into each cart making sure they landed with enough force to start leaking oil into the bottoms of the carts the gunfire from above ceased theyre using their brains now sam said together they sprinted back down the tunnel snatching lanterns as they went until they had a dozen more then returned and tossed them into the ore carts kindling remi said and they took off again they grabbed anything that would burn from wooden toolboxes to boots and coveralls to coils of dryrotted rope then returned to the carts and divided the haul into three piles which they dumped into the three carts you feel that remi asked sam looked up and for the first time noticed a cool breeze blowing in from the cliff entrance thats good luck for us using his swiss army knife he cut a trio of wicks from the coveralls then knotted each one at the bottom and together they soaked the knotted ends in the oil at the bottom of the lead cart remi asked do we wait or from the direction of the tack room hatch there came the sound of pounding forget i asked she finished using his lighter sam lit each of the three wicks as remi held them once certain they were fully caught she handed two to sam who tossed them into the first two carts remi tossed hers into the closest cart and they backed away nothing happened come on remi muttered i was afraid of that oil might be too sludgy down the tunnel there came the sound of splintering wood followed by a door banging open sam stared at the carts his jaw pulsing with anger damn it with a whoosh one of the carts burst into flames and oily black smoke began gushing from the top the second and third cart ignited and within seconds a thick cloud of smoke roiled near the ceiling pushed by the breeze it began surging through the intersection and into the side tunnels sam and remi coughing eyes watering from the peripheral exposure backed away from the carts if that doesnt slow them down nothing will sam said can we finally leave this party remi asked after you they sprinted down the tunnel and skidded to a stop at the entrance outside the fog had lifted and the erosion bridge was dimly lit by moonlight waves lapped and hissed at the cliff face despite the breeze the smoke cloud was moving down the tunnel toward them and with it came the faint sounds of coughing and retching when we reach the water well let the tide take us it should be running north to south along the coast balaclavas only about three miles down the coast well go ashore there right still have the printout remi patted her dress at the waistline safe and sound sam eased up to the edge and peered down a bullet smashed into the rock beside his head he jerked back and they dropped flat remi gasped what theres a patrol boat down there sam muttered theyre sitting right below the spikes were trapped like hell we are come on he pulled remi to her feet and they began sprinting back down the tunnel care to fill me in remi said no time youll get it just stay on the tracks with each step the smoke thickened until even their flashlight beams did them no good hand in hand they kept running heads down and eyes slitted against the fumes almost there sam called and stretched his free hand before him the retching and coughing were louder now seemingly all around them a voice shouted something in russian followed by a rasped reply in english back go back sam tripped and fell taking remi down with him they got back to their feet and kept going his groping hand bumped into something hot and he jerked it back he dropped to his knees and pulled remi down beside him somewhere close by multiple boots crunched on gravel a flashlight beam cut through the smoke then disappeared whats going on remi whispered in response sam gave the ore cart a quick rap with his knuckles take off the coat she did so sam shoved his hands into the sleeves from the outside in then twisted the body of the jacket into a ball oven mitts he explained now remi caught on depth charge you got it clever boy once i get it rolling you push me from behind okay hunched over sam moved around to the other side of the cart planted his feet wide then placed his gloved hands against the steel side and shoved the cart didnt budge he tried again nothing he heard a metallic clickclick then remis whispered voice wheel brake was on try again sam took a deep breath set his jaw and shoved with a steelonsteel shriek the cart lurched forward the crack of a gunshot echoed down the tunnel but sam ignored it and kept going he passed remi and she fell in behind him hands pressed against his lower back the cart quickly picked up speed pushed by the breeze the flames and smoke streamed backward over their heads like a comets tail suddenly the smoke thinned out the tunnel entrance loomed before them not twenty feet away braking sam shouted and leaned backward digging his heels into the gravel ballast remi her hands tight around his belt did the same their combined weight began to slow the cart the opening rushed toward them ten feet five feet sam made a quick mental calculation decided the momentum was right then let go they stumbled backward together landed in a heap and looked up just in time to see the flaming cart tip ever so gently over the lip of the entrance there were three seconds of silence then a thunderous crash sam and remi crawled on hands and knees to the entrance and looked over the edge already half engulfed in flames the patrol boat was listing heavily to port as water bubbled up through a crater in the afterdeck after a few seconds a pair of heads bobbed to the surface one began swimming away but the other remained motionless the boat dipped stern first below the surface and slid from view i think thats called a bullseye remi said then dropped to her belly and let out an exhausted sigh sam did the same above their heads black smoke spewed from the tunnel and began drifting away through the bridge well sam said id say weve thoroughly worn out our welcome shall we call it a night yes please chapter monaco yvette fournierdesmaraiss hazel eyes stared over the rim of her poised coffee cup as she listened intently to sam recount their adventure on elba hed left out any mention of umbertos near betrayal of them to kholkov after that sam finished we drove to nisporto then made our way back to the mainland amazing yvette said you two certainly know how to live up to your reputations it was early morning and the three of them sat on the patio of yvettes villa overlooking point de la veille the sun sparkled off the flat calm waters of the mediterranean after watching bondaruks patrol boat sink into the depths below the erosion bridge sam and remi had climbed down the spike ladder and slipped into the water they found a pair of orange kapok life jackets that had escaped the boats demise latched on to them and let the current carry them south along the coast as the sun rose over the horizon they drifted along watching plumes of black smoke gather over bondaruks estate and listening as the sirens of the fire engines grew louder several times to the north they saw more bondaruk patrol boats but the crews focused their attention on the cliffs beneath the estate an hour after they went into the water they found themselves off the beaches north of balaclava and they paddled ashore and made their way into town and two hours after their phone call to selma they were sitting in the back of a limousine and on their way to kerch a hundred miles up the coast on the sea of azov waiting there was a courier who upon selmas orders had gathered their passports credit cards and luggage from their hotel in yevpatoria an hour after that they were aboard a private charter headed for istanbul knowing they were in a holding pattern until selma could decipher the printout theyd stolen from bondaruks lab and knowing they needed a safe place to regroup theyd called yvette whod happily and immediately dispatched langdon her exsas bodyguard aboard her gulfstream to collect them well in all fairness i have to tell you umberto confessed everything yvette now said he was quite ashamed of himself he redeemed himself remi said in spades i agree i told him that if the fargos forgave so did i sam asked im curious what happened to carmine bianco who the corsican mobsterslashelban cop ah him i believe hes now the guest of the italian government something about attempted murder sam and remi laughed so yvette said laurents diary is proving helpful and a challenge remi replied the code he used is complex and layered but if anyone can puzzle it out its selma as soon as theyd arrived at the villa they faxed the printout to selma langdon appeared with a fresh carafe of coffee and refilled everyones cups sam asked so langdon whats the answer pardon me sir did she have the good sense to say yes langdon cleared his throat and pursed his lips yvette said oh for goodness sake langdon to sam and remi hes so reserved so proper langdon youre allowed to share good news you know go on tell them langdon allowed his mouth to form the barest of smiles and said yes sir she agreed to marry me congratulations remi raised her coffee cup to the groom to be the three of them toasted langdon whose face turned a deep shade of red he nodded his thanks and murmured madam if theres nothing else go on langdon before you have a stroke langdon disappeared unfortunately this means ill be losing him yvette said hell be a kept man now a gigolo if you will not a bad job if you can get it sam said remi lightly punched him on the biceps mind your manners fargo im just saying there are worse jobs out there enough they chatted and drank coffee until langdon returned thirty minutes later mr and mrs fargo mrs wondrash is calling for you they excused themselves and followed langdon down to the study yvettes macbook air sat open on a mahogany desk overlooking the garden langdon had already arranged a pair of club chairs before the laptop once they were seated he left and closed the door behind him the laptops screen displayed selmas workroom back in la jolla selma are you there sam called pete jeffcoats tanned face appeared before the camera he smiled at them hi sam hi remi howre you pete fantastic couldnt be better petes sunny attitude knew no bounds he could not only turn lemons into lemonade but he could turn them into a grove of lemon trees and wendy shes good getting a little stircrazy being all cooped up here the bodyguard guys are great but a little strict its for the best sam said hopefully itll be over soon sure no worries were cool hey heres the head honcho pete disappeared from view and was replaced by selma who settled onto a stool in front of the camera casually dunking a tea bag into a steaming cup morning mr and mrs fargo morning selma you want the good news or the bad news first both at the same time sam replied like peeling off a bandaid whatever you say the printout you faxed did the trick very good image high resolution i used it to decipher the next lines of code heres the bad news the riddle has us stumped maybe youll have more luck with it selma grabbed her clipboard from the table and recited anguished house fellows in amber trapped tassilo and pepere gibbous baia keep safe the place of hajj the genius of ionia his stride a battle of rivals a trio of quoins their fourth lost shall point the way to frigisinga thats it selma said ive emailed it to your iphones with the standard blowfish encryption well keep working on it but it seems clear this ones a bit tougher than the last id say so remi replied already deep in thought sam said selma the word in the last linecoins its spelled quoins youre sure thats it were sure i triplechecked it myself then had pete and wendy do the same why quoin is an architectural term it has a couple meanings its a keystone of an arch or exterior cornerstone but to what remi said thats the milliondollar question we have to assume its answered in the rest of the riddle unless it refers to any of its other meanings selma said quoin also relates to printing and naval warfare the first is a device used to hold handset type in place the second is a type of block used to raise and lower the barrel of a cannon a block remi said as in a wedge yes i think so so it has something to do with cornerstones and wedges if we take the meanings literally sam replied but if theyre metaphorical they could mean anythinga wedge can either support or separate objects same with a cornerstone we need the rest of the context remi agreed well get to work selma thanks two more things before you go im also deciphering laurents diary as we go along and i think weve got the answer to a couple of our mini mysteries first ive found out why he and napoleon bothered with a code and riddle instead of just a map with a big x on it according to laurent napoleon fell into a depression soon after he reached saint helena hed escaped exile on elba only to get defeated four months later at waterloo he confided to laurent that he thought his fate was sealed he was sure hed die in exile on saint helena he was right sam said it started him pondering his legacy selma continued he had one son napoleon francis joseph charlesnapoleon iiby his second wife marie louise when napoleon lost at waterloo he abdicated the throne to junior who ruled for about two weeks before the allies stormed paris and dethroned him napoleon was heartbrokenand furious he felt if his son had shown true bonaparte character it wouldnt have happened never mind that the boy was four years old sam said it couldnt have been easy for him to live up to his fathers reputation impossible id say anyway napoleon ordered laurent to create a puzzle map that wouldand im quoting hereconfound our enemies prove the new emperors mettle and point the way to the prize that would help return the bonaparte name to greatness unfortunately selma continued after the allies overthrew him napoleon ii was bundled off to austria given the honorary title of duke of reichstadt and kept a virtual prisoner there until he died of tuberculosis in as far as i can tell he never even tried to regain poweror even follow the map laurent isnt clear why though as for the second mini mysterywhy napoleon and laurent chose wine bottles as their puzzle cluesaccording to laurents writings napoleon himself ordered the lacanau grape line destroyedthe seeds the vineyard everythingbut it didnt have anything to do with his love of the stuff his theory was the bottles would become instant collectors itemsthe wine napoleon bonaparte didnt want anyone else to have if any of the bottles were unearthed from their hiding places theyd find their way into museums or private collections where theyd remain safe until a bonaparte descendant who knew their secret came along so the father wasnt entirely confident in his sons mettle as he called it remi said he was hedging his bets seems so when napoleon abdicated for the second and final time the first napoleonic law of succession was in effect it named napoleon ii as the legitimate heir to the throne failing that succession went to napoleons older brother joseph and his male descendants then to his younger brother louis and his male line none of whom bothered to follow the trail remi said if they even knew about it selma replied were still working on that part either way it seems clear all the trouble napoleon and laurent went to was wasted until now no ones even been aware of their grand plan and now its just us and bondaruk sam said remi said its all very sad in the end napoleon was just desperate pathetic and paranoid waiting for someone to restore the family name and to think at the height of his power this was a man who held a good chunk of europe under his thumb sam said a tyrant is most tyrant to himself pardon its a quote from george herbert a welsh poet i dont think he was talking about napoleon but it certainly fits selma this prize laurent talked about there was nothing else in the diary about it nothing so far the safe bet would be on money remi said or something he could convert into moneya war chest the son could use to raise an army sam nodded enough for a new bonaparte emperor to reconquer france and maybe europe they signed off with selma and headed back to the patio they were halfway up the steps when sams phone chimed he checked the screen it was rube haywood sam put it on speaker i think i found the skeleton in bondaruks closet rube said were all ears the guy i sent to talk to bondaruks old iranian handler aref ghasemi remi said right at first ghasemi was a little cagey but he finally opened up he pretty much confirmed he handled bondaruk all through the border war with the russians the details are sketchy on this part but somewhere along the way bondaruk got the idea that hes a direct descendant of some ancient persian king a guy named xerxes i sam finished yeah thats it howd you know without going into too much detail sam described the private achaemenid dynasty museum theyd found in the bowels of bondaruks estate well theres your confirmation rube said what was ghasemis take on this sam asked does he think bondaruk could be from the xerxes line he thought it was possible but the thing you have to understand about ghasemi is hes a slippery fish the brits dont buy anything he says without triple or quadruplechecking it that seems like an odd story to make up remi said i thought so too rube replied either way bondaruks spent millions researching this so unless hes certifiably insane he may have found proof to support his claimat least in his own mind sam said remi remember what kholkov told us in marseille about bondaruks goal remi closed her eyes recalling the conversation and kholkovs words the items involve a family legacy hes simply trying to finish what was begun a long time ago this xerxes angle could be the key sam replied but what are the items something xerxes lost long ago another project for selma and the gang rube said whether his claim is true is irrelevant he believes it and its driving everything he does what hes after is a different story figure that out and you could be halfway home so were back to square one sam said what in the world do xerxes and the achaemenid dynasty have to do with napoleons lost cellar sam awoke to the trilling of his iphone he rolled over the red numerals of the led display said am sam grabbed the phone and checked the caller id blocked he answered hello i thought it was time we talked directly a voice said without intermediaries still waking up it took sam a moment to place the voice you woke me up bondaruk thats just bad manners i dont suppose youd like to tell me how you got my number money is the great equalizer mr fargo money is just money its what you do with it that counts spoken like a true dogooder remi rolled over and sat up beside sam in answer to her questioning expression he mouthed bondaruk what do you want sam said im curious you were among the guests at my party werent you we were standing right behind you during your lecture in the sword room we got the distinct impression you like to hear yourself talk youre brave both of you ill give you that much you invaded my home mr fargo if you were anyone else youd already be dead skip the threats and make your point id like to get back to sleep im giving you one last chance we work together when its over you get the bottles i get what im after and we part company no harm done speaking of what youre after it wouldnt have anything to do with your private persian funland below the laboratories would it bondaruk didnt answer i thought so sam said bondaruk dont you think youre taking your xerxes infatuation a little too far its not healthy youre making a mistake mr fargo it seems to us that youve been making all the mistakes by the way we know your people have been casing our house in san diego if any of them so much as touch a newspaper in the driveway half the san diego county sheriffs department will fall on them like an avalanche so noted this is the last time ill ask nicely thanks for the warning sam hung up remi said private persian funland very imaginative i have my moments chapter armed with the next lines of the riddle and yvettes broadband internet connection sam and remi locked themselves in the study and went to work yvette ever the gracious host ordered langdon to supply them with snacks and beverages pens and paper a second laptop dryerase markers and a fourbysixfoot dryerase board on this they wrote the riddle in huge block letters anguished house fellows in amber trapped tassilo and pepere gibbous baia keep safe the place of hajj the genius of ionia his stride a battle of rivals a trio of quoins their fourth lost shall point the way to frigisinga they began by compiling a list of synonyms for each word that easily lent itself multiple meanings they counted sixteen anguished house fellows trapped gibbous keep safe place hajj genius stride battle rivals trio point way from these they generated a list of dozens of words those they wrote on the boards opposite side in a spiderweblike chart branch leading to thread leading to question marks next they turned their attention to words they felt had clear links to historyamber tassilo baia hajj genius ionia quoinswhich they also placed on the board in their own separate columns and lists once done they divided up the words and began scouring the internet for historical references which they plugged into briefs of each word five of the wordsamber tassilo baia hajj ioniahad links to wellknown places peoples or things amber was a fossil resin used for jewelry tassilo was the given name of a long line of bavarian kings hajj was the name of the yearly islamic pilgrimage to the holy site of mecca baia which meant mine was the name of a commune in romania on the moldova river and ionia was a greek island in the north aegean sea unfortunately like their list of synonyms each of these historical references was in itself a web of facts and double meanings and cross connections breaking only to eat and drink and refresh themselves in the studys attached bathroom sam and remi kept at it through the morning into late afternoon until finally they decided on a different tack to focus their attention on a single line of the riddle hoping its solution would start a domino effect they decided to try the second line tassilo and pepere gibbous baia keep safe the place of hajj remi recited absently tapping her temple with a pencil pepere is easy its a french nickname for grandfather right and unless were missing some other significant reference to tassilo we can assume its a reference to bavariaits history its landmarks its culture something bavarian agreed how about gibbous baia theyd already devoted two fruitless hours to romanian history in hopes of stumbling across an epiphany about the baia area gibbous means a moon thats between half and completely full are we sure about that part yes a gibbous moon is no im asking if thats the only meaning sam thought for a moment then frowned id assumed so maybe i shouldnt have he picked up and shoved books around the desk until he found the dictionary he found the correct page scanned the entry then clicked his tongue dumb sam what gibbous also means humpbacked so gibbous and baia remi was already typing on the laptop though much of their indepth references had come from library sites their default starting point was good old google here got something she said after a few minutes of reading put the two together and you get this baia is part of a phrasemen of baia its a rough translation for the word bavaria so the humpback of bavaria sam asked no no remi tapped the keyboard again and scanned the search results gotcha okay tassilo iii the king of bavaria from to was installed on the throne by pepin the short father of charlemagne and grandfather of pepin the hunchback now were talking sam replied so tassilo and the hunchbacks grandfather pepin the short keep safe the place of hajj problem is i cant find any connection between either of them or bavaria to mecca it has to be a metaphor or a synonym sam replied yes or maybe an islamic artifact somewhere in bavaria sam now on his own laptop did a quick search nope nothing jumps out lets keep going try another line well go back to the beginning anguished house fellows in amber trapped weve already got the etymology and synonyms for anguished house fellows amber and trapped so how do they all intersect sam plopped down in a chair and leaned his head back squeezing the bridge of his nose between his index finger and thumb i dont know something about the line is familiar though which part i dont know its right there i can almost see it they sat in silence for nearly a half hour each wrapped in thought their minds swirling with connections and possible connections finally remi looked at her watch its almost midnight lets get some sleep and come back to it fresh in the morning okay its frustrating i know im missing something i just cant put my finger on it four hours later as they lay asleep in yvettes guest suite sam bolted upright in bed and muttered there you are remi a light sleeper was instantly awake what whats wrong sam nothing i think ive got it in their pajamas they returned to the study turned on the lights and powered up their laptops for twenty minutes sam sat at the keyboard typing and following links as remi watched from the corner chair at last sam turned around and smiled its from a book i read in collegethe days of the upright by a guy named roche he talks about the origin of the word huguenot french calvinists right remi asked protestants right pretty big group from the sixteenth to eighteenth century anyway there are a lot of explanations for where the word huguenot comes from some think its a hybridfrom the german word eidgenosse meaning confederate and the name besan çon hugues who was involved in early calvinist history the etymology most historians subscribe to comes from the flemish word huisgenooten which was what some bible students in flemish france were nicknamed huisgenooten would gather secretly in one anothers homes to study scripture the name translates as house fellows remi stared at him for ten seconds before murmuring sam thats brilliant what would have been brilliant is if id come up with it eighteen hours ago better late than never okay so were talking about huguenots anguished huguenots sam corrected remi stood up and went to their whiteboard and used the dryerase marker to circle their list of synonyms for anguished there were dozens no obvious connection between them and huguenots jumped out at them so lets talk about amber sam said turning to the second part of the line in amber trapped how do you get trapped in amber they brainstormed this for a few minutes before remi said lets try this what happens when something gets trapped in amber you die sam offered before that immobilized frozen in place r ight head down eyes closed she paced back and forth frozen in place like a snapshot sam his head resting against the chairs headrest leaned forward like a painting yes he spun around in his chair and started typing on the laptop painting huguenots he scanned the search results anything massacre he muttered what massacre could be in a stretch synonymous with anguished couldnt it sure then how about this a painting by françois dubois called the saint bartholomews day massacre whats the context sam scanned the article then summarized france in from august to october of that year catholic mobs attacked minority huguenots throughout the country sam leaned back in his chair and frowned anywhere between ten thousand and a hundred thousand were killed if that isnt anguish i dont know what is remi murmured okay so combine that with bavaria sam leaned forward and began typing again this time using for his major search terms dubois saint bartholomew and bavaria in combination with day and massacre might as well throw in our synonyms for hajj remi said then dictated from the whiteboard mecca pilgrimage islam pilgrim sam finished typing and hit enter a lot of results he whispered scrolling through the page nothing obvious though lets start subtracting and mixing words from the search for the next hour they did just that trying permutations of their search terms until finally near sunrise sam found something interesting with the combination of saint bartholomew bavaria and pilgrim he said with a grin lightbulb just popped on what remi said then leaned in and read from the screen saint bartholomaes pilgrim church bavaria germany chapter schönau bavaria unbelievable sam whispered he and remi stepped to the wooden railing of the overlook and stared at the vista below finally remi murmured i dont think the word beautiful even begins to capture this sam why did it take us this long to come here i have no idea he whispered back then lifted his canon eos digital camera and took a picture theyd been to bavaria before but never this area even breathtaking doesnt seem to fit does it not even close i can almost hear the sound of music below them lay the emerald waters of the königssee kings lake fjord measuring just over half a mile at its widest point and bracketed on both sides by thickly forested granite escarpments and jagged snowcapped peaks the königssee meandered its way from the village of schönau in the north down to the obersee or upper lake five miles to the south long ago severed from the königssee by a landslide the obersee sat tucked away in its own oval valley surrounded by alpine meadows bursting with wildflowers and encircled by tumbling waterfalls sights that attracted nature lovers and photography buffs the world over a special boat service ran from schönau to the obersees salet docks aside from the occasional wake from the handful of electric tour boats that soundlessly plied the königssee the lakes surface was perfectly calm a sundappled mirror reflecting the greens and grays and ochers of the surrounding forests and cliffs everywhere sam and remi turned lay yet another perfectly composed alpine postcard twothirds of the way down the königssee where it narrowed to only a few hundred yards before widening again and curving southeast toward the obersee saint bartholomaes pilgrim church sat in a clearing of trees on the hirschau peninsula an architectural hybrid of sorts half of saint bartholomaes church was an old bavarian ski lodge with white stucco exterior walls steeply sloped gray shingle roof and heavy wooden shutters painted in greens and yellows while the other half was made up of a cluster of three redroofed onion domes atop of which further rose two spires one a windowless dome the other sitting nearer the waters edge a more traditional steeple with a sloped hip roof and shuttered slit windows is it ironic that hitler also loved this place remi asked or just a little scary berchtesgaden the municipality in which the königssee sat was also home to adolf hitlers mountaintop retreat known as the eagles nest no ones immune to beauty sam replied even him it seems the question was sam and remi knew aside from the scenery why exactly were they here though they had deciphered only the first part of the latest riddle theyd felt confident enough in their solution to immediately call selma and ask her to arrange passage from monaco to bavaria by midmorning having thanked yvette for her hospitality and promised to return and recount their exploration they were on their way to the nice airport from there to paris and then to salzburg where they rented a car and drove the remaining thirty miles to schönau am königssee what time does our boat leave in the morning remi asked nine remind me to check the weather tonight even now in late spring the königssee valleys weather was volatile prone to days that could go from warm sunshine to brooding clouds to snow in the space of an hour the savvy königssee visitor was always armed with a spare sweater or windbreaker given saint bartholomaes location there were only two ways to reach it either by boat from schönau or by hiking in through the surrounding mountain passes while the latter option piqued their wanderlust they knew it would have to wait for their next visit time was not their friend now while their infiltration of bondaruks estate had put them a step ahead given how long the man had likely been pursuing the lost cellar and given the scope of his resources their lead could be shortlived theyd seen no sign of kholkov or his men but still a touch of paranoia seemed warranted until they found whatever secrets saint bartholomaes held and were safely away theyd assume they were being watched moreover they would assume their invasion of khotyn had enraged an already frustrated bondaruk whatever restraint the man might have thus far shown was probably gone what they couldnt predict was given the lengths to which bondaruk had already gone what might he do now if the königssee was the height of alpine beauty sam and remi decided the nearest village schönau epitomized the word quaint home to five thousand souls schönau which sat astride the stonestrewn river that fed the königssee was a sprawling collection of homes and businesses each one a bavarian architectural gem that seemed more chalet than building on the eastern side of schönaus truncated sshaped harbor just south of a string of cafés restaurants and hotels sat a curved line of boathouses whose styling seemed torn from the pages of a vermont covered bridges coffeetable book now as sam steered their car down the treelined road to schönau they could see the days last tour boats gliding in and out of the boathouses their wakes forming translucent fans atop the emerald water a few minutes later they pulled into the parking lot of the hotel schiffmeister fronted by white and red awnings and balconies bursting with red and white and pink flowers the schiffmeisters facade was painted in earthtoned rococo traceries of intertwined flowers and vines and spirals as the valet saw to their car and the bellhop to their bags they walked into the lobby and found the front desk minutes later they were being shown into their lakefront suite they each showered wrapped themselves in the hotels heavy terry cloth robes then ordered coffee from room service and settled on the balcony overlooking the water with the sun falling behind the mountains to the west the lake was backlit in a golden hue and the calm evening air was growing chilled on the streets and sidewalks below tourists strolled along looking in shop windows and taking pictures of the harbor sam powered up his iphone and tapped into the hotels satellite internet connection something from selma he said scanning their email with typical efficiency she had compiled a report on xerxes i and the achaemenid dynasty one a condensed version the other more detailed sam forwarded both to remis iphone and they spent the next thirty minutes learning about the ancient persian king the eighth attested ruler of the achaemenid dynasty xerxes i took the throne at the age of thirtyfive and wasted no time living up to his warlike reputation first crushing a revolt in egypt then in babylon where he declared the babylonian empire abolished and promptly spirited away the golden idol of belmarduk and had it melted down effectively crushing the empires spiritual foundations two years later xerxes turned his wrath on the athenians who had fallen afoul of the achaemenid dynasty at the battle of marathon where theyd thwarted king darius is attempt to conquer all of greece in bc xerxes began preparations for the invasion of greece in dramatic fashion by creating a bridge to span the hellespont then by digging a navigable canal across the athos isthmus from sardis xerxes and his army bulldozed north through thrace and macedonia before being stalled at thermopylae by king leonidas and his spartans who despite a valiant effort were killed to a man now unhindered xerxes continued south down the coast to athens where he plundered the abandoned city this would prove to be the zenith of xerxes invasion shortly thereafter he lost much of his fleet at the battle of salamis then most of his land force at the battles of plataea and mycale in bc leaving the army in the hands of one of his generals mardonius xerxes retired to persepolis in modernday iran where he spent the remainder of his days dealing with political turmoil he was eventually murdered by the captain of his guard possibly at the behest of his own son artaxerxes i who took the achaemenid throne in bc oh what a tangled web remi said as she finished sam ten seconds behind her looked up and replied not a nice guy mr xerxes remi smiled are any of them not often well if were looking to xerxes biography for clues about what bondaruks after the first thing that strikes me is the belmarduk idol from babylon but history says it was melted down what if the history is wrong what if he melted down a copy made off with the original then lost it somewhere could be sam typed up a quick email to selma and sent it off he got a checking on it email a few minutes later okay other possibilities it seems everything went downhill for xerxes after his invasion of greece he surrendered control of the army went home loitered about for a few years then was assassinated maybe he lost something on the campaign that in his own mind cursed his reign and bondaruk thinks recovering it will somehow balance the scales sam finished put things right for the xerxes line as you said the safe money is on belmarduk but history treats the babylonian uprising as nothing more than an annoyance for xerxes how about the egyptian revolt it was roughly the same time remi sighed its possible the problem with historyespecially ancient historyis that often only the highlights get the attention for all we know buried in an ancient text in some library or museum vault theres a list of treasures stolen by xerxes along with their disposition great sam said with a smile where do we start take your pick cairo luxor istanbul tehran if we start digging today well be done in ten or twelve years not the best course then okay lets see if we can narrow things down xerxes ruled for twenty years in that time he embarked on three major campaigns egypt babylon and greece of the three greece was the most important and arguably a turning point for his reign why dont we focus on the grecopersian war and see where that takes us remi considered this then nodded sounds good sams email chimed and he read it from selma he explained the history around the melting down of belmarduk is pretty firm plenty of supposedly firsthand accounts of the event from both the persians and the babylonians that settles it then remi replied greece it is they spent another hour researching the grecopersian war period of xerxes reign then took a break dining in the restaurant balcony overlooking the now darkened harbor the combination of the altitude the breathtaking scenery and travel fatigue had left them famished they tucked into the bavarian fare with gusto enjoying a meal of kalte braten cold thinly cut roasted pork with bread and horseradish kartoffelsalat a potato salad in a vinegary marinade and salmon trout fillets simmered in kristallweissbier and enhanced with a franconian bacchus wine served in the traditional flattened bottle known as a bocksbeutel finally they washed down the meal with mugs of icecold weizenbier their belowroomtemperature choice drew curious stares from a pair of schönau townsfolk sitting at a nearby table but sams oneword explanationamericansdrew smiling nods and a free round satiated and slightly tipsy they returned to their room ordered a pot of coffee and got back to work the point of the whole campaign seemed to be the sacking of athens remi said it was the seat of greek power thrace and macedonia were just warmup acts sam agreed he saved up most of his wrath for athens so lets make another assumption xerxes subjugated the babylonians by stealing and destroying the belmarduk idol wouldnt he be inclined to do the same thing with the greeks remi was already scanning selmas report i thought i saw something yes here delphi as in the oracle at delphi thats the one xerxes had his sights set on it located a hundred miles northwest of athens on the slopes of mount parnassus the sanctuary of delphi dedicated to the god apollo was a complex of temples that included the corycian cave the castalian spring the altar of the chians the stoa of the athenians and the temple of apollo where the oracle resided as well as numerous treasuries stadiums and theaters in ancient times as well as modern the temple housing the delphic oracle was perhaps the most frequently visited in the complex truth seekers from across the mediterranean sought out the pythia of the day usually a local woman chosen to temporarily serve as the oracles earthly conduit scientists had in the last few years relieved delphi of its magical properties suggesting the seemingly omniscient trance into which the pythia would fall was in fact caused by methane carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide fumes leaking from the rock beneath the temple an attack on delphi would have been in keeping with xerxes modus operandi sam and remi knew pillaging delphi would have been tantamount to rendering impotent the greek gods similar to what he had done in babylon with belmarduk remi continued right after he crushed the spartans at thermopylae xerxes sent a battalion of seven thousand men to sack delphi according to legend they were turned away by a timely rockslide sent by apollo himself which may or may not be true if i recall my ancient history correctly remi nodded theres a lot of debate about that okay lets continue the assumption train what if xerxes raiding party wasnt turned back what could they have taken the pythia herself but unless bondaruks looking for a skeleton that doesnt seem likely how about the omphalos the omphalos or navel was a hollowcored pineappleshaped stone that was said to have been modeled after a rock that zeuss mother rhea wrapped in swaddling rags to trick zeuss father cro nus who in a jealous rage was bent on murdering the newborn situated within the delphic temple the omphalos allegedly allowed direct communication with the gods but again scientists had since speculated that the hollow nature of the omphalos did little more than funnel hallucinogenic gases into the pythias lungs remi said no go there are plenty of accounts of the omphalos surviving the war the problem is who knows what the truth is if the british had managed to steal the declaration of independence during the war of how anxious would the us government have been to admit it true what else there were plenty of treasuries at delphi two in particular were said to have been centers of wealth the treasury of argos and the siphnian treasury they had some religious and cultural significance but they were essentially smalltime banksgold and silver repositories sam shrugged again its possible but kholkov said bondaruk was after a family legacy that sounds a little more personal than loot from an ancient bank robbery plus he said finish what was begun a long time ago sounds like a mission of some kind sam nodded and a yawn slipped out my brain is running out of steam lets call it a night and pick it up tomorrow thirty miles to the north kholkov stepped off the jet bridge and into the airports concourse powering up and checking his blackberrys voice mail as he walked he stopped suddenly and peered at the screen the three men with him did the same what is it one of them asked in response kholkov simply grinned and walked to a nearby cluster of chairs where he sat down he pulled his laptop from his briefcase powered it up then tapped at a series of keys after thirty seconds he muttered gotcha you have them not so smart after all are we fargos he said under his breath he looked up at his compatriots theyre just south of us in bavaria lets go chapter and soon now you will enjoy my musical talent the boat captain said in solid but heavily accented english he throttled the engine back and the boat began to slow to your right you see echowandin english it is echo wall along with the boats other twenty passengers sam and remi turned in their seats and looked starboard they were aboard one of the eighteen covered electric passenger boats operated by the königssee boat company there were two typesa sixtyfooter which held eightyfive passengers and sam and remis model an eighteenfooter that held twentyfive a quarter mile away through the early morning mist they could see a heavily forested cliff rising from the water the captain lifted a polished flügelhorn from beneath the helm console put it to his lips and blew a few mournful notes then went silent two seconds of silence passed and then the sound bounced back in perfect pitch the passengers laughed and clapped please if you would my trumpeting is not included in your fare this morning and it is thirsty work as you disembark you may if you wish put trinkgeld into my cup here or where you see them on the bulkheads i will divide proceeds between myself and my colleague in the mountains who answered my call more laughter one passenger asked what is trinkgeld drinks money of course thirsty work the flügelhorn okay now we go on next stop saint bartholomaes pilgrim church the ride resumed in near silence the boats electric motors making a soft gurgling hum they glided along seemingly suspended in the mist water hissing along the sides the air was perfectly calm but chilled enough that sam and remi could see their breath theyd gotten up early at six and had a light breakfast in their room before resuming work before going to bed remi had emailed a handful of former colleagues and acquaintances with three questions at the time of xerxes invasion what treasures did delphi hold what was the current disposition of those treasures were there any accounts of xerxes making off with delphic or athenian treasure waiting in her inbox were a half dozen answers most of which simply opened doors to further questions and more whatifs still nothing from evelyn though remi said now thumbing through her iphones email sam said remind me evelyn evelyn torres at berkeley she was the assistant curator at the delphi archaeological museum until about six months ago nobody knows delphi better than she does right shell get back to us im sure sam snapped a few pictures of the scenery then turned back around to find remi staring at her iphone her brow was furrowed whats wrong he asked i was worrying about kholkov showing up again and had a thought how many times has he popped up so far sam thought for a moment not counting the pocomoke there was rum cay château dif and elba three times not in the ukraine not in monaco and not here right knock wood dont count on it whats that mean i cant be sure but if memory serves there are three things ukraine monaco and here have in common go on i never used my iphone in any of those places we had the iridium i never even powered it up and only did that here last nightno thats not right i checked email when we landed in salzburg youre sure pretty sure could they have bugged it technically its doable but when could they have done it its never been out of your sight has it once i left it at the bb when we went to raise the molch damn the other timesrum cay château dif and elbadid you just power it up or did you connect to the internet the iphone could connect to the internet in two ways either through its builtin edge network or via local wireless networks both kholkov could have installed a transponder every time you powered up or connected to the internet the transponder tapped the iphones gps and sent a ping back to kholkov saying here remi exhaled heavily her mouth set do you think theyre she started to turn around but sam stopped her well look when were getting off when was the last time you powered up the hotel right i didnt notice anyone following us this morning me neither but with these crowds its hard to be sure unfortunately schönaus not that big with a half dozen men they could have simply spotted us from a distance and watched us board the boat what do we do first things first we drag the riddles and the research to the burn folder he replied already doing so on his own cant risk kholkov getting his hands on it as he had with most of their personal and household gadgets sam had tweaked their iphones adding a number of applications including a quickerase folder trying to open the folder without a password would instantly delete its contents once remi had her data moved sam said now we hope for a miracle which is that youre wrong about this problem is that doesnt happen very often let me see your phone she gave it to him he got out his swiss army knife and went to work sam his head bent over the dissected iphone in his lap finally muttered there you are remi leaned down something using his knifes tweezers he lifted a pinkie nailsized circuit chip from the iphones innards a pair of monofilamentlike leads trailed down to the phones battery the culprit he said the good news was the bug was set to transmit only when the phone was on no signal ping would alert kholkov that theyd found the device sam detached the leads and dropped the chip into his shirt pocket and started reassembling the iphone twenty minutes later with most of the mist dissipating under a sunfilled blue sky they rounded the hirschau peninsula saint bartholomae came into view its bright red onion domes glowing in the sun and the snowveined granite of the mountains rising behind them the meadow in which saint bartholomaes sat was on a fortyacre wedge of shoreline extending back to the forest there were two dock areas one for visitor arrivals and departures the other situated nearer the chapel a covered boathouse strung out behind the chapel on islands of green lawn and meandering paths were a dozen wooden outbuildings all roughhewn and ranging from barn to cabinsized the captain circled the dock area once waiting for another electric boat to disgorge its passengers then headed in and glided alongside the pier a crewman jumped across the gap tied off the stern and bow lines then swung up the boats protective railing scanning their fellow passengers for familiar faces sam and remi disembarked pausing to drop some trinkgeld into the bulkhead cup didnt see anyone sam muttered as he stepped onto the dock then offered his hand to remi you no theirs was the second boat of the morning to put ashore the majority of the first group was still lingering in the landing area and around the gift shop snapping photos and studying maps sam and remi moved along the splitrail fence that encircled the landing scanning faces before the crowd had a chance to disperse as they walked they could hear several tour guides starting their introductory speeches over the background babble originally built in the twelfth century saint bartholomae was once considered the protector of alpine farmers and of milkmaids find the interior floor plan is based on the salzburg cathedral and the exterior stucco work was done by famed salzburg artist josef schmidt until the hunting lodge adjacent to the chapel was the private retreat of the princeprovosts of berchtesgaden the last of whom after berchtesgaden became part of bavaria the lodge became a favorite wittelsbach hunting cabin sam and remi completed their circuit of the landing and ended up back at the dock theyd seen no familiar faces a half mile up the fjord two more electric boats were coming around the peninsula sam said we can wait here and check faces as each boat comes in or mix with the crowds and start hunting for clues im not a big fan of waiting remi said me neither lets get moving they made their way into the gift shop where they selected a pair of sweatshirtsone a pale yellow the other a dark bluefrom the rack then a pair of floppy hats from another display they paid for their purchases and headed to the restrooms to don their new clothing if kholkov and his men had been observing them from the schönau docks these rudimentary disguises combined with the crowds which had by now swelled to over two hundred might provide sam and remi enough cover to move about anonymously ready he asked as ill ever be remi replied tucking her auburn hair under her hat for the next twenty minutes they loitered around the landing area taking pictures of the fjord and the mountains until remi said got him where sam replied without turning the boat thats circling waiting to dock starboard side fourth window back sam turned and pointed his camera across the fjord and caught the incoming boat in the corner of the frame he zoomed in took a few pictures lowered his camera yep thats kholkov i counted three others wait here hat pulled low over his eyes sam strolled back toward the dock hey there just a minute he called to the deckhand who was getting ready to untie the docked boat forgot the trinkgeld sam held up a teneuro note certainly sir go ahead the deckhand said sam hopped aboard dropped the note and transponder chip into the trinkgeld cup then stepped back onto the dock while in the bathroom hed used the price stickers from their sweatshirts to affix a spare watch battery to the chip the battery wouldnt power the transponder for more than thirty minutes he suspected but it would be long enough for their purposes he made his way back to remi who asked think itll work itll work they wont have a choice but to follow it the question is how will kholkov handle it following the throng half of whom were taking a guided tour the other half on their own exploration sam and remi made their way down the broad whitegraveled path toward the chapel back at the dock kholkov and his three companions were disembarking you think theyre armed remi asked id put money on it we could find someone see if there are any security guards i dont want to put anyone in kholkovs way who knows what hed do besides right now were still a step ahead no use in squandering that lets keep going finish the job find what weve come for and go okay so the riddle the first half weve solved remi said that leaves us with two lines the genius of ionia his stride a battle of rivals and a trio of quoins their fourth lost shall point the way to frigisinga something about that first line keeps nagging me such as something from history a connection im overlooking from behind them they heard a voice pardon me please excuse me they turned and saw a woman on crutches trying to get past them they stepped aside and the woman smiled her thanks as she passed remis eyes narrowed as she watched her move off i know that look sam said lightbulb pop on remi nodded her eyes still fixed on the woman her crutches the one on her right is set a notch lower so put it another way her stride isnt a battle of rivals she replied her face lighting up thats it come on she hurried down the path to where it widened before the chapel and stopped at the fence making sure they were away from prying ears she hurriedly began tapping on her iphones screen there got it youve heard of the ionian leagueancient greece a confederation of states formed after the meliac war yes one of the members of the ionian league was the island of samosthe birthplace of the genius of samos also known as pythagoras you know the father of the triangle im still not following the womans crutches one was shorter than the other if you stretch your imagination they formed a scalene triangletwo unequal sides now sam caught on he smiled pythagoras was the father of the isosceles triangletwo equal sides his stride a battle of rivals remi quoted again so were looking for an isosceles triangle right probably marked by laurents cicada stamp that leaves us with one line a trio of quoins their fourth lost shall point the way to frigisinga sam looked over his shoulder and scanned the crowds until he spotted kholkov who was strolling around the landing area his cohorts wouldnt be far away sam was about to turn away when he saw kholkov pull a blackberry from his pocket and study the screen he jerked his head up looked around then gestured to someone in the crowd ten seconds later his three companions were huddled around him after a brief conversation two of them turned and started jogging back to the dock kholkov and the other man headed for the chapel path took the bait remi said but only partially thats what i was afraid of the question is when will he realize the obvious which is that hes got us trapped all they have to do is stake out the dock and wait for us to come back chapter quoin remi murmured thinking aloud as they walked three options a wedge used to secure printers blocks wedges used to raise the barrel of a cannon or architectural cornerstones it has to be the last one i dont see any printing presses or artillery sam nodded absently half his attention on keeping kholkov and his partner in sight they were halfway down the path to the chapel their heads swiveled this way and that searching for their quarry remi continued brainstorming a lot of corners around but we have to assume its not one of the wood buildings the splitrail fence on their left gave way to a hedgelined biergarten with umbrellacovered patio tables a bavarian brass band played an oompah folk song as onlookers clapped and sang along sam and remi left the biergarten behind and circled around the rear lodgelike portion of the chapel to the north lawn cannon sam said stopping in his tracks sort of remi followed his outstretched arm thirty yards away in the middle of the lawn was a waisthigh stone pedestal mounted atop it was an ornamental bronzed sextant a premodern navigation tool generally used to find the altitude of the sun above the horizon where most sextants were no larger than an opened hardcover book this one was four to five times that size measuring roughly four feet on a side its comically large telescope resembled the barrel of a blunderbuss sam and remi walked over there were fewer people here most visitors were sticking to the gravel paths their attention focused on the chapel the mountains or the fjord theres a plaque remi said its in german sam leaned down for a better look and translated presented august of to elector maximilian i joseph house of wittelsbach member of the confederation of the rhine and king of bavaria by napoleon i emperor of the french if that isnt a clue i dont know what is remi said here sam look at this he moved to where she had knelt down the lower part of the sextant consisted of a vertical index arm designed to slide over a curved arc engraved with notches each indicating onesixtieth of a degree a gap in the index arm showed the arcs current reading it was set to seventy not a trio remi said would have been nice if itd been set on three sam suddenly grabbed her arm and moved them around the pedestal putting it between them and the chapel area through the arms of the sextant they could see kholkov and his partner walking down the path toward the outbuildings nearer the trees maybe it is sam said lets think outside the box if the sextant is our cannon and the notches on the arc are quoinsthe wedgesthis part of laurents riddle is metaphorical go on remember the line a trio of quoins their fourth lost shall point the way to frigisinga that suggests that a fourth quoin would complete the group if you have a completed group what percentage do you have a hundred so each quoin would represent a quarter of the total how many notches on the arc remi checked a hundred fortytwo sam mentally did the math quoins x quoins he said okay so if we were to lift the barrel to a hundred six degrees they both knelt behind the sextant and imagined the telescope angled upward to its new position it was aimed directly at the for wardmost minaret atop the redroofed onion domes i guess thats what you call x marks the spot remi said met aphorically of course triangle marks the spot sam corrected hopefully they hadnt taken ten steps back toward the chapel when a voice came over the loudspeaker making an announcement first in german and then in english attention visitors we apologize for the inconvenience but we have just been alerted of an impending storm due to expected heavy winds we will be closing the park early please proceed immediately but calmly to the dock area and follow the instructions of park staff thank you around sam and remi there came the babble of disappointed voices and mothers and fathers calling to children faces turned upward scanning the blue sky sam said i dont see any there remi said to the southwest a narrow wall of purplish black clouds were rolling over the peaks of the mountains as sam and remi watched the front seemed to roll like a slowmotion wave down the slopes toward the fjord visitors began moving toward the docks some trotting some simply strolling staff members in light blue shirts acted as shepherds gently encouraging stragglers and helping parents round up children i dont know about you sam said but im not keen on me neither were staying need to find a place to hide come on with remi close on his heels sam headed for the shore some fifty yards away where a path led left toward the forest and right toward the docks they turned left and started trotting passing a dozen or so visitors headed in the other direction one of them a man herding two toddler boys in green lederhosen called out to them in german youre going the wrong way the docks are this way dropped my car keys sam replied be right back a minute later they were inside the tree line the path curved left toward the outbuildings but they kept going straight ducking under the handrail and into the underbrush after a hundred feet they stopped and crouched down beneath the boughs of a pine tree above leaden clouds began rolling over the peninsula blocking out the sun for the next twenty minutes they watched through the trees as visitors hurried down paths and across lawns toward the docks a few minutes later they glimpsed one of the electric tour boats chugging up the fjord passing two more coming down from the north all three nosing their way through serrated whitecaps slowly the cacophony of voices died away leaving only the wind whistling through the trees and snowmuffled shouts of all aboard from the dock area the loudspeakers which had been repeating the evacuation notice every thirty seconds stopped broadcasting getting colder remi said hugging herself sam having heeded the guidebooks advice pulled their windbreakers and knit caps from his backpack remi donned the clothes and pulled her hands into her sweatshirts sleeves think they left with the others she asked depends on what kholkov thinks we did the safe bet would have been to wait for the last boat and look for us in the departing crowds still something tells me wed better assume the worst i agree they waited a full hour after the last boat had disappeared up the fjord filled with fat snowflakes the wind was gusting heavily shaking the tree canopies pinecones thumped to the ground and leaves skittered through the underbrush snow began collecting behind tree trunks and on the grass but immediately melted as it touched the sunwarmed gravel paths creating tendrils of steam that were whipped into tiny vortexes by the wind lets have a look around sam said find someplace to warm up they picked their way back to the path and followed it inland to a clearing where they found a log cabin with a lowslung mansard roof and block windows it was a long structure measuring nearly a hundred feet with a stairway rising up its rear wall to a door sam and remi climbed up it and tried the door it was unlocked they pushed through and found themselves in a loft with a balcony overlooking the lower level the interior was dark save what little gray seeped through the tarnished glass windows its not the four seasons but at least were out of the wind sam said comfort is relative remi said with a smile brushing snow off her sweatshirt they found a warm corner and sat down they waited another thirty minutes enough time they hoped for any staff members who had stayed behind to catch a final boat back to schönau whether any caretakers had stayed behind sam and remi didnt know but theyd cross that bridge if it arose outside the wind had slackened slightly giving way to heavy snow pine boughs scraped the sides of the cabin like skeletal fingers remi jerked her head around as though shed heard something sam mouthed what she put her fingers to her lips and pointed toward the window a few moments later sam heard it footsteps crunching through the snow silence then a thunk of a boot on wood someone was mounting the stairs outside sam got up crept to the door locked it then returned to remi a moment later the doorknob gave a squeak then a rattle silence again the footsteps thumped down the stairs then began crunching through the snow again a door on the lower level opened remi huddled closer to sam who put an arm around her shoulders footsteps again this time a pair of them they moved into the cabin and stopped a flashlight panned over the ceiling skimmed along the loft railing then clicked off hello a voice called in german park staff is anyone here remi looked at sam her mouth forming a question he shook his head and mouthed kholkov anyone here theres been a weather evacuation kholkov called in german again then a few seconds later no one here lets check the other buildings more footsteps the door banged shut sam held his palm up to remi then put his finger to his lips a minute passed two five from below there came the faint scuff of a shoe on wood theyre not here kholkov said in english what makes you think theyre still here at all a second voice asked its what i would do and i know how they think theyre too stubborn to let a little weather turn them back lets go the door opened shut footsteps crunched through the snow and faded away on hands and knees sam crawled to the railing and peeked through he turned and gave remi a thumbsup my hearts pounding like a jackhammer she said join the club were going to have to be careful about our footprints so are they in fact lets use them while we can chapter they slipped out the door climbed down the steps and followed kholkovs footprints out of the clearing stopping every ten feet to look and listen they were being overly cautious they knew but the russian was a professional at this there was a very real chance the man would double back and wait in ambush their best chance was to locate kholkov and his partner and keep them in sight while remaining hidden themselves the weather was not going to make this easy the snow was falling more heavily and the visibility had dropped to less than a hundred feet already kholkovs footprints were filling in after fifteen minutes of stopandstart progress they reached an intersection of pathways left and right branches led to another pair of stuccowood cabins while straight ahead stood a barnlike outbuilding beyond that barely visible through the falling snow they could see the dark roof of the chapels lodge to the left a muffled thump a door swinging shut sam and remi ducked off the path and dropped to their bellies in the undergrowth ten seconds later a pair of snowblurred figures appeared on the path to their left tromped through the intersection and disappeared into the trees on their way to the other cabin a minute later came the squeak of door hinges sam slipped back onto the path crept to the intersection and looked right he turned and signaled remi forward together they hurried down the opposite path to the cabin kholkov had just left they ducked inside and eased the door shut sam went to the window and knelt down to keep watch remi joined him after ten minutes kholkov and his partner materialized out of the snow and turned right at the intersection heading toward the chapel lodge within seconds the weather had swallowed them again how long do we wait remi asked sam fished the brochure from his pocket and checked the tour map one more building between here and the chapel whether theyve already searched it or not is anyones guess so we keep going and hope we see them before they see us maybe sam said his eyes distant maybe not he dug through his backpack and came up with their camera he called up the pictures on the lcd screen and began studying them one by one there he handed remi the camera i shot this while we were circling the dock it was a picture of the boathouse through its partially open barn doors was the white nose of a speedboat its got to be for emergencies remi said i count two more behind that one in reply sam grinned devilishly and nodded i know that look remi said the mental gears are turning lets hear it a little macgyverinspired goose chase remi said as ruses go its a bit transparent i agree but theyll still have the same the dilemma follow split up or sit tight they cant afford not to follow on the off chance its real either way our odds are improved they slipped outside followed kholkovs footprints back to the path then turned left ahead the trail forked around the last outbuilding before the chapel the fluffy snow had piled up quickly three to four inches of it lay on the grass and the trees were shaggy with powder alpine spring had turned to winter wonderland kholkovs prints went right so they took the left path then pressed themselves to the buildings wall and slid down its length ducking beneath windows and pausing every few feet to look and listen they reached the front corner and stopped directly ahead lay the lodge portion of the chapel to their right lay the splitrail fence the meadow and the path back to the dock landing to their left they could just make out the sextant statue beyond that the fjord shrouded in snow and surface mist remi stopped suddenly and tugged on sams sleeve to get his attention she nodded with her chin at the wall behind them with her palm against the wood she mouthed vibration he pressed his ear to the wall from inside footsteps clunked on wood around the corner they heard the creak of a door swinging open sam peeked then jerked his head back he pressed himself flat against the wall remi did the same moments later kholkov and his partner appeared on the path on their way to the chapel lodge sam and remi waited until they disappeared through the rear door then sprinted ahead dropped into a crouch and duckwalked into the openfronted firewood shed beside the door lets give them a minute sam whispered if theyve already searched the chapel theyll come out pretty quickly if not im going to make a run for the boathouse and in the meantime im doing what sitting here more or less forget it sam gripped her hand once i go you block yourself in with this firewood and sit tight two of us on the move doubles our chances of being seen then you better keep up remi said and stood up you coming sam sighed im coming hunched over they took off at a flatfooted sprint circling left around the chapel careful to stay on the grass and off the gravel path within a minute theyd reached the transition where the lodges wooden wall became the white stucco of the onion domes they slid down this wall following its curve to where it joined the shoreline path they stopped down the path not more than fifty feet away was the boathouse the door was standing open just inside the dim interior they could see movement kholkov stepped out followed by his partner they looked around each pointing this way and that as they talked finally kholkov pointed toward the landing and they headed in that direction sam and remi waited until they were halfway down the path then sprinted forward and slipped into the boathouse roughly the size of a twocar garage it was divided into thirds by plank docks suspended by cables from the rafters in each slip was an orange and white fifteenfoot hans barro work boat the barn doors were closed and locked by a horizontal twobyfour cross brace sam walked down the center catwalk lifted the cross brace to its vertical position and pushed the doors open a couple inches a blast of icy air pushed through the gap check for keys sam whispered they checked each boat there were no keys in the ignitions guess that explains what kholkov was doing in here remi said cutting off our exit its either that or the staff keeps the keys in another location either way something tells me he wouldnt have relied just on keys to keep us here in turn sam lifted each boats engine hatch and checked the system under the glow of his led microlight in each case a wire had been removed from the engines starter solenoid not cut remi said looking over his shoulder removed clearly kholkov was planning his own eventual exit strategy smart but not smart enough sam murmured from the time hed been old enough to work a screwdriver hed been tinkering with things starting with his mothers toaster when he was five years old and both his degree and his work at darpa had only honed his doityourself skills keep a lookout sam said remi moved to the door and dropped to her knees peeking through the gap between the hinges he climbed into the middle boat clicked on his led then clamped it between his teeth and wriggled his way under the helm console the dashboard electrical system was a simple affair the bundled cables hidden behind a plastic panel on the underside of the helm in short order he traced the wires for the ignition system the headlight the horn and the windshield wipers four snips from his swiss army knifes scissors and he had two seveninch lengths of excess wire both of which he stripped and noosed at each end he spliced one into the engines solenoid and pocketed the other what else sam whispered absently something easy but not too obvious remi looked over her shoulder and shrugged youre asking the wrong gal any way you can rig something nasty for them like a bomb i wish theres not enough here he kept looking it took two more minutes but he found what he was looking for a bent brush arm inside the alternator he adjusted the arm back to its original position satisfied hed found all of kholkovs handiwork he ducked back under the dash found the ignition wires then scraped away the insulation and let them dangle he crawled back out and climbed onto the dock it took only a minute to find what he needed hanging from a wall pegboarda twofootlong bungee cord with a hook at each end he secured the cord first to the steering wheel then to the throttle which he pushed to its forward stops finally he untied the boats bow and stern lines and let them drop into the water now came the tricky part the timing howre we doing he asked remi see for yourself no sign of them he crept back to the door and peeked out the landing area was lost in the falling snow he pulled remi away from the door soon as you hear the ignition spark take off retrace our steps and well meet back at the woodshed right remi got into position beside the door sam returned to the rigged boat and crawled beneath the helm console again cross fingers he muttered then touched the exposed ignition wires and gave them a twist there was a spark then a pop sam wriggled backward jumped to the dock raced for the door go he rasped to remi she peeked out then darted into the gloom the boats engines gurgled to life gray smoke burst from the manifolds and filled the boathouse the water beneath the stern turned to froth and the boat surged forward nosing through the doors and disappearing into the drifting snow sail true sam said then turned and ran chapter he had taken three strides out the door when he heard a snowmuffled voice to his left shout there unsure whether it was for the escaping speedboat or for him sam veered right along the curve of the building then sprinted onto the lawn in the direction of the sextant statue if kholkov and his partner were in fact after him he didnt want to lead them back to remi when he saw the statue appear ahead he dove into a headfirst slide that took him behind the pedestal he flipped onto his belly and looked back the way hed come ten seconds passed he heard the sound of feet pounding on gravel through the blowing snow he saw two figures appear around the corner of the building and duck into the boathouse now the question was how long would it take kholkov to reverse his own sabotage the solenoid wire would take less than a minute but returning the flywheel to its proper position would be trickier the longer it took the harder their automaton boat would be to find one minute passed two minutes an engine growled to life and revved up after a few seconds it faded moving out onto the lake sam got up circled to the rear of the chapel and found remi crouched in the semidarkness of the woodshed i heard she said the question is how much time did it buy us ten fifteen minutes at least in this weather itll take them at least that long just to find our decoy come on he helped her to her feet they climbed the steps to the rear door and pushed through after the wind and snow the relative warmth of the chapel felt like heaven compared to its grand exterior the chapel was surprisingly simple with reddish brown stone tiles scarred wooden pews and white walls bearing framed religious icons above their heads a balcony spanned the rear wall while the vaulted ceiling was filigreed in light pink and gray paint tall mullioned windows on the side walls cast the interior in milky white light they made their way down the center aisle to the far end of the chapel to a narrow door through it they found a crescentshaped room dominated by a spiral staircase they started upward after thirty or forty steps they found themselves at a wooden trapdoor secured by a sliding hasp and padlock the padlock wasnt locked looks like somebody missed an item on the evacuation checklist remi said with a smile our good luck wasnt looking forward to defiling a bavarian national landmark sam removed the padlock and slid back the hasp bolt he carefully lifted the trapdoor climbed through then helped remi up and closed it behind them aside from what little light seeped through the shuttered slit windows the octagonal space was dark they clicked on their flashlights and began looking around here remi said kneeling down got something here too sam said from the opposite wall he moved to remi and inspected what she was shining her flashlight on stamped into the heavy timber molding beneath the window nearly obliterated by layer upon layer of paint and lacquer was a cicada symbol yours the same remi asked sam nodded and they moved to the opposite side a second cicada symbol was stamped into the wood why two he wondered aloud the linea trio of quoins they must have meant it to apply to more than just the sextant it took them less than thirty seconds to find the third the first two cicada symbols were situated near the front of the minaret the third at the rear lets form it up sam said he crouched beside one of the stamps and remi did the same then they extended their arms each pointing at the other as well as the third stamp correct me if im wrong sam said but this is an isosceles triangle it is indeed but which way is it meant to point if we extend the lines the two at the front would point at the lake and into the mountains the third one points inlandbehind us sam lowered his arms as he sat down back against the wall his brows furrowed for a few seconds then he smiled what remi asked the last part of the line sam replied i knew something looked familiar he dug into his pants pocket and came up with the saint bartholomaes tour brochure he flipped through it there he handed it to remi frigisinga remi read until the hunting lodge adjacent to the chapel was the private retreat of the princeprovosts of berchtesgaden the last of whom joseph conrad of schroffenbergmös had also served as the lord bishop of freising i knew id read something about that during our research sam said i mentally misplaced it the eighthcentury name for freising was frigisinga okay so this schroffenbergmös fella was here not just here he lived here and weve already been there they climbed back through the hatch and down the spiral staircase then retraced their steps through the chapel and out the back door and started down the path toward the woods five minutes later they were back at the cabin in whose loft theyd first sought shelter they stopped at the postmounted plaque beside the front door remi read once served as the private hunting lodge and warming cabin for the last of berchtesgadens princeprovosts joseph conrad of schroffenbergmös formerly of frigisinga sam finished they stepped inside while most of the cabin was made of heavy timber both the stanchion footers and the foundation which rose eighteen inches from ground level were constructed of blocked stone lets check the stonework first sam said timber can be easily replaced stone not so much agreed how are we on time sam checked his watch fifteen minutes since our rabbit ran knowing what they were looking for they made quick work of the search splitting up and walking hunched over along the walls flashlights playing over the blocks grasshopper marks the spot remi called she was kneeling beside a footer beneath the loft sam hurried over and crouched beside her stamped into the upperleft corner of the block abutting the footer was the familiar cicada stamp looks like were going to have to do a little defiling after all remi said well be gentle sam looked around then trotted over the openhearth fireplace grabbed a steel poker from the mantel rack and returned he went to work though the pokers end was slightly spatulashaped it was still wider than the gaps between the stones so it took a precious ten minutes of inching the block outward before together they could pull it free remi reached her hand into the alcove hollow spot around the footer she murmured hang on she lay down on the floor and wriggled her arm into the hole until she was elbow deep she stopped her eyes went wide wood the footer no i dont think so pull me out gently sam grabbed her ankles and dragged her away from the wall her hand emerged from the alcove followed by an oblong wooden box hand clenched like an eagles talon her fingernails were sunk an eighth of an inch into the lid silently they stared at the box for a long ten seconds then remi smiled you owe me a manicure sam smiled back done the heft of the box told them it wasnt empty but they checked anyway snug in its bed of straw and enveloped in its oilskin wrappings was another bottle from napoleons lost cellar sam closed the lid and said i dont know about you but i think ive had enough sightseeing for one day im with you sam stuffed the box into his rucksack and they stepped outside into the clearing this far from the boathouse they wouldnt have been able to hear the sound of a returning speedboat so they moved quickly but carefully stopping frequently to hide and watch until finally they were back at the chapel almost there sam said remi nodded and hugged herself sam embraced her and rubbed his hands vigorously on her back well be drinking warm brandy in no time now youre singing my song she replied they circled left around the chapel following the straight and curved walls until they reached the front of the building sam stopped ten feet short signaled for her to wait then crabwalked ahead and peered around the corner after a few seconds he pulled back and returned to her anything remi whispered nothings moving but the doors partially shut i cant tell how many boats are inside how about the landing nothing there either but with the snow shhh remi cocked her head and closed her eyes listen after a few seconds sam heard it faintly somewhere in the distance came the buzzing of an engine somebodys out there remi said they wouldnt have just given up on the decoy sam reasoned theyre either still chasing it or on their way back agreed its now or never after one last check around the corner sam motioned for remi to move up hand in hand they broke from cover sprinted to the boathouse and ducked inside in addition to their decoy boat the righthand boat was gone remi jumped aboard the remaining boat and settled into the drivers seat while sam set aside his backpack then lifted the engine cover quickly installed his makeshift solenoid wire and bent the brush arm back into place he closed the engine cover shimmied under the dash and hotwired the ignition okay he said crawling back out lets sam the door sam spun a figure was rushing through the boathouse door sam caught a fleeting glimpse of the mans face kholkovs partner turning squaring up through the door his hand came up holding a snubnosed revolver sam didnt think but reacted snatching up the nearest objecta bright orange life vestand hurling it the man batted it away but it had bought sam the second he needed to leap to the dock and charge he slammed into the man and they crashed back into the wall sam grabbed the mans gun wrist and twisted hard trying to break the delicate bones there the gun roared once then again the man was a professional instead of fighting the torque on his wrist he went with it twisting his body while swinging his left arm in a tight hook that slammed into sams temple sparks burst behind sams eyes but he kept his grip on the mans wrist then got his right arm inside the mans punching arm and wrapped him in a bear hug vision still swimming sam jerked his head back and slammed it forward the head butt found its mark with a muffled crunch the mans nose shattered the gun clattered across the planks with a grunt the man levered himself against the wall and together they stumbled backward sam felt his foot step into empty air he felt himself falling he took a gulp of air then plunged into the water chapter the water enveloped him so cold it momentarily stunned him like an electrical charge fighting his natural instinct to surface for air sam instead did the opposite with the man still wrapped in a bear hug he rolled over flipped his legs straight up and kicked driving them deeper the man was stunned and with his shattered nose hed hopefully been unable to snatch a lastsecond breath the man thrashed punched wildly with his right arm sam took the blows and held on the man suddenly stopped punching sam felt his arm between them he looked down through the dark water and froth he saw the mans hand reaching under his jacket the hand came out clutching a knife sam grabbed the forearm tried to shove it sideways the knife arced upward sam pushed off the blade sliced through his shirt he felt a sting as it sliced across his abdomen the blade kept rising sam released his grip on the mans other wrist clamped it around the mans knife hand he sensed rather than saw the blade nearing his throat he jerked his head back turned it to one side the tip of the knife skipped over the point of his jawline beneath his earlobe pierced the upper curve of his ear and sliced cleanly through a dozen years of judo had taught sam the power of leverage the man having extended his more powerful right arm above his head was at that moment at his weakest sam wasnt about to let the advantage pass left hand still gripping the mans knife wrist sam reversed his righthand grip cupped the back of the mans hand then jerked down and twisted at the same time with a dull pop the mans ulna tore free from his wrist the mans mouth flew open and he let out a muffled scream amid a stream of bubbles sam kept twisting heard the grating of bone on bone the knife fell away and dropped out of sight sam rolled again kicked downward they thumped into the bottom the man clawed at sams eyes with his left hand sam clenched his eyes shut turned his head away then drove his right hand up and palmbutted the man in the chin the mans head snapped backward sam heard a sickening crunch the man jerked once twice then went still sam opened his eyes the mans own eyes fixed and lifeless stared back behind the mans head a jagged triangularshaped rock jutted from the sandy bottom sam let him go and he floated away trailing tendrils of blood as he bumped along the bottom after a few moments he disappeared into the gloom sam coiled his legs and pushed himself off the bottom he broke the surface beneath one of the plank walkways and laid his head back and gulped air until his vision began to clear sam remi called here this way come on sam paddled toward her voice draped in soaked clothes his arms felt as if they were stroking through molasses he felt remis hands gripping his he grabbed the gunwale and let her help him aboard he rolled onto the deck and lay still panting remi knelt beside him oh god sam your face looks worse than it is a few stitches and ill be back to my devilishly handsome self your ear is split you look like a dog who just lost a squabble lets call it a dueling scar she turned his head this way and that inspecting his face and neck and probing with her fingers until sam reached up and gave her hand a reassuring squeeze im okay remi kholkov might have heard the shots we better get moving right she lifted the nearest seat cushion and dug around until she found a rag which sam pressed to his wounds remi gestured tentatively toward the water is he gone he didnt give me much choice sam sat up rolled onto his knees and stripped off his windbreaker and sweatshirt wait the gun already got it here she handed him the revolver then settled into the drivers seat as sam untied the bow line remi turned the ignition and the engine rumbled to life hold tight she shoved the throttle to its stops and the speedboat surged through the doors look for an emergency kit remi said maybe theres one of those space blankets sam checked beneath each seat cushion until he found a large tackle box inside as remi had predicted he found a rolledup silver mylar sheet he unrolled it draped it around him then settled into the passenger seat later sam wouldnt remember hearing the sound of the other engine over the roar of their ownonly seeing the white wedge of the speedboats bow emerging from the mist to his left and the orange firefly winks of kholkovs gun remi hard right to her credit remi reacted instantly and without question spinning the wheel over the boat slewed sideways kholkovs bow which had been aimed directly at sams passenger seat glanced off the hull and slid over the gunwale already ducking sam jerked his head sideways and felt the fiberglass hull skim over his hair kholkovs bow crashed through the corner of the windscreen shattering glass and twisting aluminum then crashed back down into the water sam caught a glimpse of the boat arcing away to the left from the floorboards sam asked remi you okay yeah i think so you yes turn hard left go for five seconds then shut off the engine again remi asked no questions and did as sam asked she throttled down shut off the ignition and the boat glided through the water until finally stopping they sat in silence the boat gently rocking from side to side sam whispered hell circle back hell assume we kept going in the same direction for a while how do you know natural instinct to panic and run directly away from him how many bullets do we have in that thing sam pulled the revolver from his belt it was a fiveshot smith wesson two gone three left when we hear him off to our right head left toward the shoreline go as fast as you can for thirty seconds then throttle down again another hunch sam nodded that well run straight for schönau well have to eventually its either that or we hike for three days through the mountains in this snowstorm sam smiled or plan c ill explain later shhh you hear that moving from left to right off their bow came the sound of an engine after a few moments the pitch changed echoing off the shoreline go sam rasped remi started the engine jammed the throttle forward and swung the boat to port they drove for a count of thirty then throttled back down and coasted to a stop it was silent save the lapping of waves on the boats hull the wind had slackened to an almost dead calm fat snowflakes began piling up on the gunwales and seats whats he doing remi whispered same thing we are listening waiting how do you know hes a soldier hes thinking like one directly astern perhaps two hundred yards distant they heard an engine revving remis hand moved to the throttle sam said not yet hes close sam wait kholkovs engine kept coming closing the distance sam pointed astern and to their left then held his index finger to his lips barely visible through the falling snow a ghostly elongated shape glided past they could see a manshaped silhouette standing behind the wheel kholkovs head pivoted left and right sam raised the revolver and took aim tracking the boat until it faded from view after ten seconds remi let out a breath and said i cant believe he missed us he didnt it was barely noticeable a little pause when he turned this way but he saw us hell double back now reverse engines take us backwardslowly quiet as you can remi did so after theyd covered fifty feet sam whispered slow ahead angle us back toward shore he grabbed the eightfoot boat hook from its mount below the gunwale and peered through the mist to their left he heard water lapping on rocks okay shut it down he told remi ease right she did so silence off the beam the fuzzy conical outline of a pine tree appeared then another branches stretched out toward them like skeletal fingers sam snagged a larger limb with the boat hook dragged them to a stop and hauled until the hull bumped against the bank the snowladen boughs formed a canopy over their heads drooping to within a foot of the lakes surface sam knelt beside the gunwale and peeked through the branches remi joined him from ahead and to the right came the revving of an engine after ten seconds it stopped a moment later their boat started wallowing as kholkovs bow wake reached them any second now sam whispered be ready to move as if on cue forty feet away kholkovs boat drifted past heading back toward the church docks his engine was gurgling softly just above idle then he was gone lost in the snow he didnt see us remi whispered not this time okay lets move follow him five seconds of low throttle ten seconds of glide remi got back into the drivers seat and they pulled out from under the boughs came about and fell into kholkovs wake for the next twenty minutes they continued their glideandthrottle headway always keeping kholkovs engine noise directly on their bow going silent when he did moving only when his engine resumed their progress was slow covering less than fifty feet at a time saint bartholomaes docks drifted by on their right the redroofed onion domes seemingly floating in midair directly off their bow kholkovs engine spooled up and began arcing away to the left sam gestured for remi to ease right back toward shore slow and easy kholkovs engine noise was moving toward the center of the lake cut the engines sam whispered and remi did so he thinks were hiding out or heading back to schönau doesnt he she asked sam nodded hell set up an ambush somewhere to the north unfortunately for him were not going to play his game the minutes slipped by five turned into ten then into twenty finally sam said okay lets keep going follow the shoreline south keep it just above an idle something tells me that warm brandy is going to have to wait would you settle for a roof over your head and a cozy campfire chapter hotel schöne aussicht grössinger salzburg message from evelyn torres remi said sitting down on the kingsized bed and kicking off her shoes just a call me she sounded excited though she lives for this stuff first that brandy i promised you then evelyn sam said were going to need clothes and essentials brandy evelyn sleep then shopping since eluding kholkov on the königssee theyd been awake and on the move for over twentyeight hours heading south along the shoreline at a snails pace they reached the obersees salet docks an hour later and disembarked sam opened the boats scuttle cock waited until a foot of water was sloshing on the deck then pointed the bow toward the center of the lake and eased the throttle forward a notch it disappeared into the snow remi said we havent exactly been lowimpact tourists have we dont worry he said with a wink well make an anonymous donation to the saint bartholomaes historical society they can buy a fleet of speedboats from the docks they followed the gravel path inland for a half mile then across the land bridge to the mouth of the obersee proper where they found another boathouse similar to the one at saint bartholomaes this one however had an adjacent warming room inside they stripped down to their underwear draped their clothes over coat hooks on the wall and then found a kerosene lantern around which they huddled until nightfall when sam started a small fire in the woodstove they spent the remainder of the night curled together around the stove then rose at eight thirty donned their clothes and waited for the days first boatload of tourists they intermingled themselves with the crowds strolled about for a few hours and kept their ears tuned for any discussion of gunshots the previous day or a floating body having been found in the lake they heard nothing at noon they took the boat back to schönau once ashore they decided to err on the side of slight paranoia and not return to the hotel nor would they use their rental car watchful for kholkov and his men they ducked into the nearest gift shop then out the back door into the alley for twenty minutes they picked their way away from schönaus waterfront until they found a café on a secluded side street where they called selma at two oclock a mercedes from a salzburg car service pulled up before the café and three hours later after a scenic drive during which remi and sam watched for signs of pursuit they checked into the hotel under the names hank and liz truman fed and warmed by the brandy they first emailed selma the photographed symbols from the saint bartholomae bottle then dialed evelyn torres at home so why the sudden interest in xerxes and delphi evelyn asked over a speakerphone after a bit of small talk just a little project were working on remi replied well fill you in when we get home well to answer your questions in order at the time of xerxes invasion delphi was arguably the most sacred place in greece the pythias predictions were sought for everything from matters of state to marriage and everything in between as for treasure there wasnt much there of tangible wealtha few treasuries but nothing compared to the riches of athens some scholars disagree but i think xerxes didnt understand delphis place in greek culture from what few oral histories ive read he considered the oracle a novelty like a modernday ouija board he was convinced the greeks were hiding something at delphi were they thereve always been rumors but theres no solid evidence to support them besides you know the history xerxes raiding party was turned back by the divine hand of apolloin the form of a welltimed rock slide a few persians got through and made off with ceremonial objects but nothing of importance sam asked did anything of value survive the invasion the ruins are still there of course some of the columns from the treasuries are in the delphi museum as are some pieces of altars stone friezes the omphalos no gold or jewels if thats what youre asking do you remember anyone ever nosing around about delphi when you were there remi asked anything unusual no not really just standard research requests from universities for the most part evelyn paused for a moment wait a second there was this one guy about a year ago he was from the university of edinburghthe school of history classics and archaeology i think weird character how so hed applied for a permit to examine the delphi artifacts and we granted it there are rules for handson examinationsthings you can and cant do with the objects i caught him breaking one of the biggiesor almost breaking one that is i walked in on him trying to do some kind of acid test on one of the columns which columns remi asked the karyatids they stood at the entrance to the siphnian treasury at delphi before either remi or sam could ask the next question evelyn answered it a karyatid is a stone columnusually marblein the shape of a robed greek woman the most recognizable ones are at the athens acropolis what kind of test was he trying to do sam asked i dont remember he had a jewelers hammer and pick and some kind of acid kit i put it all down in my report to the board i may still have a copy let me look while we talk they heard evelyn moving about then the rustle of cardboard and the shuffling of paper remi asked what did he say when you caught him that hed misunderstood the rules which was bunk i gave him the rules myself he was lying but he refused to say what he was up to we ejected him and notified the guys department chair at edinburgh no police the board decided against it lucky for him too the greeks take that kind of thing seriously he would have done jail time i heard edinburgh fired him though so thats something i dont know what happened to him after that heres the report his name was bucklin thomas bucklin and the acid kit he had sam asked the sound of flipping pages came through the speaker this is strange evelyn said id forgotten this part he was using nitric acid remi said whys that strange its not a standard artifact test its highly corrosive we dont use it who does sam answered metallurgists its used to test for gold they talked for a few more minutes then hung up sam opened his macbook airone of the few things theyd brought along in his backpack from königsseeand logged into the hotels wireless internet connection there were almost two thousand hits for the name thomas bucklin it took only a few minutes to narrow their search to the right one bucklins written a number of papers on classical history mostly focusing on persia and greece but nothing more recent than a year ago sam said about the time he got fired remi said looking over his shoulder are any of his papers available looks like jstor has them all jstor was a nonprofit online archive for scholarly work whose subjects ranged from archaeology and history to linguistics and paleontology sam remi and selma used the site extensively ill have selma download and forward them sam typed up a quick email and sent it selma responded thirty seconds later five minutes remi asked any mention of what hes been up to since leaving edinburgh nothing sams email chimed selma had found fourteen papers by bucklin they were included as pdf attachments heres something interesting sam said according to selma bucklin had been on a sabbatical from edinburgh when he showed up on evelyns doorstep so he was freelancing remi replied he wasnt there on behalf of the university who the heck is this guy sam stopped scrolling his fingers frozen over the keyboard he leaned closer to the screen and squinted theres your answer have a look remi leaned over his shoulder one of bucklins papers included a photo of the author it was small and in blackandwhite but there was no mistaking the mostly bald pate fringe of orange hair and blackrimmed glasses thomas bucklin was the labcoated man theyd encountered in bondaruks private laboratory chapter bucklins papers were compelling if not well received or widely circulated according to jstor sam and remi had been only the second party to purchase them since their publication they had little trouble guessing the identity of the other interested party sam forwarded the papers to his iphone and gave remi the macbook then they spent the next three hours wading through bucklins work not wanting to taint one anothers conclusions they waited until they were finished to compare notes what do you think sam asked nutcase or genius depends on whether hes right or wrong theres no mistaking hes obsessed with xerxes and delphi his version of the invasion didnt make him any friends in the academic world through years of painstaking research bucklin had come to an outlandish conclusion that xerxes raid of delphi had been more of a success than greek historians admitted according to bucklin in the weeks leading up to the invasion the keepers of the siphnian treasury devised a scheme to protect their wealth knowing no place would be safe from persian plunder the siphnians melted down their stores of gold and cast it into a pair of karyatids when the columns cooled they were covered in gypsum plaster and put in place of the real columns that stood astride the treasurys entrance for reasons unknown the persian raiding party did not fall for the ruse on xerxes orders a detachment of two hundred specially trained troops called immortals fled with the karyatids intending to head north out of greece before swinging east through macedonia and thrace and returning to the achaemenid dynasty capital of persepolis where xerxes planned to melt down the karyatids and have them cast into a massive throne a memorial to his triumph over the greeks that would sit in his hall of a hundred columns for eternity unbeknownst to the immortals word of their desecration of delphi reached sparta less than a day after the persian raiding party left a phratra of spartan soldiers roughly twentyseven in all gave chase intending not only to recover the karyatids but also to avenge the brothers theyd lost at the battle of thermopylae they caught up to the immortals in presentday albania and cut off their easterly escape route for three weeks the spartans hounded the immortals chasing them north through montenegro then bos nia and croatia before finally cornering them in the mountains of northwestern slovenia even outnumbering them ten to one the immortals were no match for the spartans the persian raiding party was all but destroyed of the original two hundred that had left greece a month before only thirty survived these spared to serve as porters for the karyatids the spartan commander decided not to return home not while xerxes army was still ravaging their country the columns had become a symbol of greeces survival and the spartans pledged to die rather than let them fall into xerxes hands not knowing how far the persian invasion would advance the spartans headed north out of slovenia intending to find a place to hide the columns until it was safe to bring them home the phratra was never seen again save a lone soldier who stumbled into sparta a year later before succumbing to his exhaustion and the ravages of exposure he claimed that the rest of his comrades had perished and the karyatids had been lost with them their location died with him so thats the last puzzle piece remi said or one of the last that is how bondaruk and bucklin found each other we may never know but its clear bondaruk believes the story he thinks napoleons lost cellar is a treasure map to the siphnian columns theyre the family legacy hes trying to recover remember what else kholkov said in marseille about bondaruks motive hes simply trying to finish what was begun a long time ago sam nodded slowly the bastard wants to melt them down just like xerxes did we cant let him get away with it remi as archaeological artifacts those karyatids are priceless beyond priceless it all fits after the battles of plataea and mycale xerxes abruptly hands over control of the army to mardonius and goes homegoes home assuming the karyatids are on their way most accounts have him returning to persepolis and starting a massive building programincluding the hall of a hundred columns where bucklin claims he planned to display the throne ill give you one guess where bondaruk plans to put his throne the persian playground in the basement of his estate remi replied its sad if you think about it xerxes died waiting for a prize that was never cominga prize that meant relatively nothing to the greeksand napoleon died waiting for his son to follow the riddles and recover the same prize we might as well keep the streak alive sam said what do you mean we make sure bondaruk dies never getting his hands on the karyatids hell be in good company at six the next morning sams iphone trilled it was selma its early selma he said groggily its late here good news were getting better at this i think weve deciphered the code but we thought youd want first crack at the riddle okay email it to me on its way call me later sam shook remi awake she rolled over just as sams email chimed another riddle he said i heard he called up the email and together they read the lines man of histria thirteen by tradition house of lazarus at nazareth son of morpeth keeper of leuce the land that stands alone together they rest any thoughts sam asked ask me after coffee having already unraveled two of the riddles sam and remi now better understood the patterns napoleon and laurent had used to produce them a patchwork of double meanings and obscure historical references the solution to each puzzle depended upon the fusion of its individual lines by midmorning theyd gathered from the internet the most obvious references for each line the firstman of histria thirteen by traditionlikely referred to histria the latin name for istria a peninsula between the gulf of trieste and the bay of kvarner in the adriatic sea the secondhouse of lazarus at nazarethcould have hundreds of meanings the name lazarus was mentioned twice in the bible once as the man jesus raised from the dead the other in the parable of lazarus the beggar nazareth of course was the childhood home of christ the thirdson of morpeth keeper of leucewas also too broad to nail down morpeth was a town in northeast england and in greek mythology leuce was a nymph the daughter of oceanus the fourthtogether they restwas the most ambiguous of all who were they did rest mean sleep or death or something else altogether think about the last riddle sam suggested napoleon and laurent used a similar linethe genius of ionia to reference pythagorus maybe theyre doing that here we know the third line probably contains a placenamemorpeth lets find out if morpeth was home to any famous residents remi shrugged worth a try an hour later they had a list of a dozen semiprominent morpeth sons none of them were immediately recognizable remi said lets crossreference see if theres a connection between any of the morpeth names and the word leuce are any of them experts in greek mythology sam checked the list doesnt look like it what else do we know about leuce remi paged through her legal pad she was carried off by hades the god of the underworld depending on which version you go with upon her death she was transformed into a poplar tree either by hades or by persephone poplar tree sam murmured tapping on the keyboard the leuce is a type of poplar he checked his list of morpeth names this might be something william turner born in morpeth in considered by many to be the father of english botany interesting so is the line about turner himself or about poplar trees no idea whats the last part the land that stands alone my first thought would be islandthey stand alone in the middle of water my thought too sams google search of island poplar and turner turned up no revelations therere several references to a poplar island wildlife refuge in the chesapeake bay but theres no connection to turnerunless you count tina turner donating some money to the refuge that is lets try the first line againman of histria thirteen by tradition as they had with morpeth they generated a list of historical figures associated with the istrian peninsula but like morpeth none of them were historically noteworthy they turned to the second linehouse of lazarus at nazarethand dug deeper looking for more obscure references how about this remi said reading from the macbooks screen during the middle ages christian religious orders used to oversee leper colonies known as lazar houses as in lazarus the patron saint of lepers sam asked right in italy the term lazar morphed into lazaret a quarantine station for ships and crews the first recorded lazaret was established in off the coast of venice on the island of santa maria di nazareth she looked up at sam that could be our lazarus and nazareth connection were getting warmer but it cant be that easy he said were still missing the first line he did another google search combining and subtracting words until he came across a national geographic story describing the discovery of a mass grave for bubonic plague victims who had been quarantined to protect venices uninfected sam said the site was on an island in the venice lagoon called lazzaretto vecchio remi flipped through her notes vecchio thats the modern name for santa maria di nazareth sam thats got to be it probably but lets be sure twenty minutes and dozens of search permutations later he said okay here i used the words island venice and plague and came up with this poveglia its another island in the venice lagoon used to quarantine plague victims during the seventeenth century the bodies were buried in mass pits sometimes the living mixed in with the dead or cremated in mass pyres estimates put the number of dead between he paused and his eyes went wide what remi asked estimates put the number of dead between a hundred sixty thousand and a quarter million good lord something else before it was called poveglia it was popilia why does that sound familiar popilia is a derivation of populuslatin for poplar poveglia was once covered in poplar groves so on one hand weve got poveglia on the other santa maria di nazareth both are solid possibilities youre right itll come down to the first line of the riddle and our mysterious man from istria either way our next stop is venice sevastopol i can tell by your tone the news is not good hadeon bondaruk said into the phone theyre gone and one of my men is dead kholkov said we found the transponder chip from the fargo womans phone aboard one of the electric boats how they discovered it i have no idea kholkov recounted the rest of the encounter at königssee starting with their arrival at saint bartholomae and ending with his losing the fargos on the lake somehow they must have slipped back into schönau without us spotting them did they find the bottle i dont know and where are they now we found a local that saw someone matching their description getting into a mercedes we traced it to a car service in salzburg were on our way there now well check the motels the airport the train stations no bondaruk said pardon me every time we get close to them they slip the noose i think its time we step back and let the fargos do what they do best in the meantime i want you to go ahead with your alternate plan there are risks i dont care im tired of chasing these people all over europe you have a man in mind yes kholkov said according to my sources hes the only one with a familya wife and two daughters get started if he reports it rather than then make sure he doesnt report it convince him that cooperation is his only way out you can do that much cant you ill make the call chapter venice italy the water taxi pulled to a stop and sam and remi climbed out together they stared at the surrounding buildings no matter how many times i see it it always takes my breath away remi said known to english tourists as saint marks plaza the piazza san marco is in fact a trapezoid sitting at the eastern mouth of the grand canal famous for its pigeons and geometric hopscotch stone inlays it is perhaps the most famous plaza in all of europe home to some of venices greatest attractions many dating back a thousand years or more sam and remi turned in a circle taking it in as if seeing it for the first time saint marks basilica with its byzantine domes and spires the campanile its threehundredfoot bell tower the imposing gothic palazzo ducale or doges palace and finally directly opposite the basilica the ala napoleonica the onetime home of napoleons administrative residence whether a coincidence or not they would soon know but they were keenly aware of napoleons connection to venice and the piazza san marco which hed dubbed the drawing room of europe in soon after venice was named part of the newly created kingdom of italy napoleon ordered the ala napoleonica built after realizing his initial choicesthe zecca or mint the libreria marciana and the procuratie nuovewere not large enough to accommodate his court it was nearly six oclock and the sun was dipping toward the horizon over the roof of the marciana library some of the piazza lights had come on casting amber pools on the arches and domes most of the days tourists had left and the piazza was quiet save for the background babble of voices and the cooing of the pigeons who are we meeting remi asked the curator sam replied maria favaretto before catching their two oclock lufthansa flight from salzburg sam had called the curator of their destination the museo archeologico and introduced himself luckily signora favaretto had heard of them their discovery of the lost diary of lucrezia borgia the fifteenthcentury machiavellian political operatorseductress a year earlier in bisceglie had been frontpage news in venice she told sam in fact a former colleague of hers was the assistant curator of the vatican librarys museo borgiano where he and remi had donated the diary favaretto agreed to meet them for an afterhours visit of the museo archeologico is that her remi asked pointing a woman was waving to them from inside one of the entrance arches to the procuratie nuove in which the museo archeologico was partially housed the rest was located within the biblioteca nazi onale marcianathe national library of st marks sam and remi walked over to the woman signor fargo signora fargo i am maria favaretto its my pleasure to meet you please call us sam and remi remi said shaking her hand and im maria thank you for your help we hope we arent inconveniencing you not at all remind me again what period are you interested in were not positive but none of the references we found are later than the eighteenth century good i think were in luck if youll follow me please she led them through the arch across a breezeway done in terracotta and cream tiles and into the museum they followed her past displays of egyptian sarcophagi and assyrian chariots etruscan statues and vases and roman busts byzantine ivory carvings and minoan earthenware jars maria stopped at a wooden door and unlocked it with a key they went down a long dimly lit hallway she stopped this is our notforpublic library given what you were asking about i thought the best person to help you would be giuseppe he doesnt have a title per se but hes been here longer than anyonealmost sixty years he knows more about venice than anyone i know she hesitated cleared her throat giuseppe is eightytwo and a little odd eccentric is the word i think dont let that worry you just ask your questions and hell find the answers okay sam said with a smile the reason i asked about your time frame is that giuseppe is what you might call a throwback he has no interest in anything modern if it didnt happen in the nineteenth century or earlier it doesnt exist for him well keep that in mind replied remi maria opened the door and gestured for them to step through just press the buzzer on the wall here when youre done ill come back for you good luck she shut the door the museums library was long and narrow measuring two hundred feet by forty feet the walls were not walls at all but floortoceiling bookcases they were twenty feet tall on each of the four walls was a rolling wooden ladder a single tenfootlong worktable and a lone hardbacked chair sat in the center aisle halogen pendants hung from the ceiling casting soft pools of light on the greentiled floor is someone there a voice called yes sam replied signora favaretto let us in as their eyes adjusted they could see a figure standing atop the ladder at the far end of the library he was perched on the top rung finger tracing along the book spines occasionally nudging one inward or sliding one outward after a moment the man climbed down and started shuffling down the aisle toward them thirty seconds later he came to a stop before them yes he said simply giuseppe was barely five feet tall with wispy white hair that jutted out from his head at all angles he couldnt have weighed more than ninety pounds he stared up at them with surprisingly sharp blue eyes hello im sam and this is giuseppe waved his hand dismissively you have a question for me um yes weve got a riddle on our hands were looking for the name of a man probably from istria in croatia that might have a connection to either poveglia or santa maria di nazareth give me the riddle giuseppe ordered man of histria thirteen by tradition sam recited giuseppe said nothing but stared at them for ten seconds as he pursed his lips from side to side remi said we also think he might have something to do with lazarets abruptly giuseppe turned around and shuffled away he stopped in the aisle then stared at each wall in turn his index finger tapped the air before him in the manner of a slowmotion conductor hes cataloging books in his head remi whispered quiet please giuseppe barked after two minutes giuseppe went to the righthand wall and pushed the ladder to the far end he climbed up plucked a book off the shelf paged through it then put it back and climbed back down five more times he repeated the process staring at the walls conducting the air and mounting the ladder before climbing back down and shuffling back to them the man youre looking for is named pietro tradonico the doge of venice from to chronologically he was the eleventh doge but by tradition he is considered the thirteenth tradonicos followers fled to the island of poveglia after he was assassinated they had some huts near the islands northeastern corner with that giuseppe turned and started shuffling away one more question sam called giuseppe turned said nothing is tradonico buried there asked sam some think so some not his followers claimed the body after his assassination but no one knows where it was taken giuseppe turned again and doddered away remi called thank you giuseppe didnt reply did you find what you were looking for maria asked a few minutes later when they came out after theyd pushed the buzzer beside the door it had taken her five minutes to arrive during that time giuseppe continued about his work as though they didnt exist we did sam replied giuseppe was everything you said hed be we appreciate your help its my pleasure is there anything else i can do for you since youre being so helpful whats the best way to get to poveglia maria stopped walking and turned to them her face was drawn why would you want to go to poveglia research youre welcome to use our facilities im sure giuseppe would sam said thank you but wed like to see it for ourselves please reconsider why remi asked how much do you know about poveglias history if youre talking about the plague pits we read not just those theres much more lets have a drink ill tell you the rest chapter explain it to me again remi whispered why couldnt this wait till morning it is morning sam replied turning the wheel slightly to keep the bow on course though their destination showed no lights its bell tower was nicely silhouetted against the night sky from above poveglia looked like a fan measuring five hundred yards from its flared tip to its base and three hundred yards at its waist where a narrow walled canal bisected the island from west to east save for a sandbar in the center dont get technical on me fargo as far as im concerned two am is the middle of the night it isnt morning until the sun comes up after drinks with maria theyd managed to find an open boat rental office the owner had only one craft left a twelvefoot open dory with an outboard motor though not luxurious by any means it would suffice sam decided poveglia was only three miles from venice inside the sheltering arms of the lagoon and there was little wind dont tell me you bought into marias stories sam said no but they werent exactly cheery thats the truth in addition to having served as a dumping ground for plague victims throughout its thousandyear history poveglia had been home to monasteries colonies a fort and ammunition depot for napoleon and most recently in the s a psychiatric hospital in frightening detail maria had explained that the doctor in charge after hearing the patients complain about seeing the ghosts of plague victims began to conduct crude lobotomies and gruesome experiments on the inmates his own brand of medical exorcism legend had it that the doctor eventually began seeing the same ghosts his patients had reported and went insane one night he climbed up the bell tower and jumped to his death the remaining patients returned the doctors body to the bell tower and sealed the exits entombing him forever shortly thereafter the hospital and the island were abandoned but to this day venetians reported hearing poveglias bell ringing or seeing ghostly lights moving in the windows of the hospital wing poveglia was maria told them the most haunted place in italy no i dont buy the part about the ghosts remi said but what went on in that hospital is well documented besides the islands closed to tourism were breaking and entering thats never stopped us before just trying to be the voice of reason well i have to admit its very creepy but were so close to solving this riddle i want to get it done me too but promise me something one gong from that bell tower and were gone if that happens youll have to race me to the boat a few minutes later the mouth of the canal came into view a few hundred yards down the shoreline they could see the dark outline of the hospital wing and bell tower rising over the treetops see any phantom lights sam asked keep joking funny man he maneuvered the dory through the chop created by the lapping waves and they slipped into the canal sheltered from the seaward side the canal saw little circulation the surface was brackish and dotted with lily pads and in some places the water was only a few feet deep to their right a brick wall draped in vines slipped past to their left trees and scrub brush above they heard the rasp of wings and looked up to see bats wheeling and diving after insects just great remi muttered it had to be bats sam chuckled remi had no fear of spiders or snakes or bugs but she loathed bats calling them rats with wings and tiny human hands ten minutes later they reached the sandbar sam revved the engine driving the bow onto the soil then remi got out and dragged the dory a few feet higher sam joined her and staked down the bow line they clicked on their flashlights which way she asked he pointed to their left north end of the island they walked across the sandbar then up the opposite bank to a dense hedge of scrub they found a thin spot pushed their way through and emerged in a footballsized field surrounded by low trees remi whispered is this it might be none of the maps of poveglia had agreed upon the exact locations of the plague pits either way its odd that nothings growing here they continued across the field stepping gingerly and shining their flashlights over the dirt if this was the site of a plague pit they were treading on the remains of tens of thousands of people when they reached the opposite tree line sam led them east for a hundred feet before turning north again the trees thinned out and they emerged into a small clearing filled with kneehigh grass through the trees on the other side of the clearing they could see moonlight glinting off water in the distance rang a gong buoy in the lagoon sam whispered thank god my heart skipped a couple beats heres something they walked forward and stopped before a block of stone peeking above the grass must have been part of a foundation over there sam remi was shining her flashlight at what looked like a fence post on the right side of the clearing they walked over affixed to the post was a plexiglasenclosed placard ninthcentury site of the followers of pietro tradonico doge of venice to remains disinterred and relocated in poveglia historical society if tradonico was here hes gone now remi said relocated in sam read again that was about the time napoleon was crowned king of italy right remi caught on and about the time he had poveglia converted to a munitions depot if laurent was with him this is probably where they got their inspiration for the riddle and they would have known where tradonicos remains were sent remi there was never a bottle here the whole riddle was just a steppingstone to send napoleon junior somewhere else but where the next morning at two minutes after eight sam and remis water taxi stopped on a small side street two blocks east of santa maria maddalena church they paid the driver got out and stepped up to a red door bordered by black wroughtiron railing a tiny bronze plaque on the wall beside the door read poveglia historical society sam pressed the buzzer they heard footsteps clicking on wood and then the door opened revealing a plump woman in a pink and yellow floral dress sì buon giorno remi said parla inglese yes i speak english very well can i help you are you the curator pardon of the poveglia historical society sam said smiling and pointing to the plaque the woman leaned out the door squinted at the plaque then frowned thats old she said the society hasnt met for five or six years why all that ghost business all people wanted to know about was the hospital and the plague pits the rest of its history was forgotten i was the secretary rosella bernardi perhaps you might be able to help us remi said she introduced herself and sam we have a few questions about poveglia signora bernardi shrugged motioned them inside then led them down the hall into a kitchen decorated in black and white checkered tile sit i have coffee made she said pointing to the kitchen table she filled three mugs from a silver percolator then sat down what do you want to know were interested in pietro tradonico sam said do you know if he was buried on poveglia signora bernardi got up walked across the kitchen and opened a cabinet above the sink she pulled down what looked like a brown leather photo album and returned to the table she opened the album and flipped to a page near the middle under a sheet of acetate was a yellowed sheet of paper bearing dozens of lines of handwritten notes is that an original reference remi asked sì this is the government census data of poveglia when napoleon ordered the island annexed the government hurried to erase its checkered past which included the settlements established by tradonico and his followers yes those too according to this pietro tradonico and his wife majella were buried side by side on poveglia when they were disinterred their bones were stored together in the same coffin then temporarily placed in the basement of the basilica della salute sam and remi exchanged a glance here was the solution to the riddles last line together they rest you said temporarily sam said does it say where the remains went after that signora bernardi traced her index finger down the sheet then flipped to the next page halfway down the next sheet she stopped they were taken home she announced home where exactly tradonico was istrian by birth yes we know members of the tradonico clan came and took the bodies to their village of oprtalj thats in croatia you know remi smiled yes what they did with tradonico and his wife once they reached peroj we dont know does that answer your questions it does sam said then stood up both he and remi shook signora bernardis hand then walked down the hall and out the front door where she stopped them if you find them please let me know i can update my records i doubt anyone else will ask but at least ill have it written down signora bernardi gave them a wave then shut the door croatia here we come remi said sam who had been tapping on his iphone now held up the screen theres a flight leaving in two hours well be there for lunch sams estimate was generous as it turned out the quickest route was an alitalia flight from venice to rome then across the adriatic to trieste where they rented a car and drove across the border and south to oprtalj some thirty miles away they arrived in late afternoon situated atop a thousandfoot hill in the mirna valley oprtalj had a distinctly mediterranean feel with terracotta pantile roofs and sundrenched slopes covered in vineyards and olive groves oprtaljs history as an ancient medieval fort showed itself in the towns labyrinth of cobblestone streets portcullis gates and tightly packed rowstyle buildings after stopping three times for directions which came in either halting english or italian they found the town hall a few blocks east of the main road behind the church of saint juraj they parked their car beneath an olive tree and got out and walked with only inhabitants in oprtalj sam and remi were hoping the tradonico family name would be renowned they werent disappointed at their mention of the former doge the clerk nodded and drew them a map on a piece of scratch paper museo tradonico he said in passable italian the map took them north up a hill past a cow pasture then down a zigzagging alley to a garagesized building painted in peeling cornflower blue the handpainted sign above the door had six words most of them in consonantheavy croat but one word was recognizable tradonico they pushed through the door a bell chimed overhead to their left was an lshaped wooden counter directly ahead a twentybytwentyfoot room in white stucco and dark vertical beams a half dozen glass display cases were situated around the room along the walls shelves displayed tiny sculptures framed icons and knickknacks a rattan ceiling fan wobbled and creaked an elderly man in wirerimmed glasses and a tattered argyle sweater vest rose from his chair behind the counter dobar dan sam opened the croat phrase book hed picked up at the trieste airport and opened it to a dogeared page zdravo ime mi je sam he pointed to remi and she smiled remi the man pointed a thumb at his chest andrej govorite li engleski sam asked andrej waggled his hand from side to side little english american yes sam nodded from california were looking for pietro tradonico said remi the doge yes doge dead yes we know is he here no dead long time dead sam tried a different tack we came from venice from poveglia island tradonico was brought here from poveglia andrejs eyes lit up and he nodded yes pietro and wife majella this way andrej came out from behind the counter and led them to a glass case in the center of the room he pointed to a framed woodcarved icon painted in flaking gold leaf it showed a narrowfaced man with a long nose pietro andrej said there were other items in the case mostly pieces of jewelry and figurines sam and remi walked around the case inspecting each shelf they looked at one another shook their heads are you a tradonico remi asked gesturing to him andrej tradonico da yes sam and remi had discussed this next part on the plane but hadnt decided how to handle it how exactly did you tell someone you wanted to gawk at their ancestors remains we would like to see perhaps we could see body yes if its not an inconvenience sure no problem they followed him through a door behind the counter and down a short hallway to another door he produced an oldfashioned skeleton key from his vest pocket and opened the door a wave of cool musty air billowed out somewhere they heard water dripping andrej reached through the door and jerked down a piece of twine a single lightbulb glowed to life revealing a set of stone steps descending into darkness catacombs andrej said then started down the steps sam and remi followed the light faded behind them after theyd descended thirty feet the steps took a sharp right and stopped they heard andrejs shoes scuffing on stone then a click to their right a string of six bulbs popped on illuminating a long narrow stone passageway cut into each wall were rectangular niches stacked one atop the other to the twentyfoot ceiling and spread down the length of the passage in the glare of the widely spaced bulbs most of the niches were cast in shadows i count fifty sam whispered to remi fortyeight andrej replied two empty then not all of the tradonico family is here remi asked all he chuckled no too many the rest in graveyard come come andrej led them down the corridor occasionally pointing at niches drazan jadranka grgur nada my greatgreatgreatgrandmother as sam and remi passed each niche they caught glimpses of the skeletal remains a jawbone a hand a femur bits of rotted cloth or leather andrej stopped at the end of the passageway and knelt at the bottom niche in the righthand wall pietro he said matteroffactly then pointed at the niche above majella he reached into his pants pocket withdrew a tiny flashlight and handed it to sam please sam clicked it on and shined it into pietros niche a skull stared back he shined it down the length of the skeleton he repeated the process with majellas niche just another skeleton nothing but bones remi whispered then again what were we expecting that one of them would be holding the bottle true but it was worth a try he turned to andrej when they were brought from poveglia was there anything else with them pardon were there any belongings remi said personal possessions yes yes you saw upstairs nothing else a bottle with french writing on it french no no bottle sam and remi looked at one another damn he whispered no bottle andrej repeated box what french writing yes yes there was box inside coffin small shaped like loaf of bread yes thats it remi replied andrej stepped around them and walked back down the passageway sam and remi hurried after him andrej stopped at the first niche beside the steps he knelt down leaned inside rummaged about then scooted back out with a wooden crate covered in cyrillic stencils it was a world war ii ammunition crate andrej opened the lid this lying atop folds of rotted canvas and half buried under spools of twine rusted hand tools and dented cans of paint was a familiarlooking box good god sam murmured may i remi asked andrej he shrugged remi knelt down and carefully lifted the box out she turned it over in her hands inspecting each side in turn before finally looking up at sam and nodding sam asked is there something in it yes chapter trieste italy sams iphone trilled and he checked the screen to remi he mouthed selma then answered thats a new record took you less than two hours they were sitting on the balcony at the grand hotel duchi daosta overlooking the lights of the piazza unità ditalia night had fallen and in the distance they could see the lights twinkling in the harbor wed already decoded eleven lines of riddles and hundreds of symbols selma replied its starting to feel like a second language after opening the box and confirming it did in fact contain a bottle from napoleons lost cellar sam and remi had faced a dilemma clearly andrej didnt know the value of what had been tucked away in his familys catacombs for the past two hundred plus years still they werent about to give up the bottle in truth it didnt belong to them or to andrej but to the french people it was a part of their history this is a rare bottle of wine sam told andrej oh he replied french you say yes andrej snorted napoleon disturb tradonico grave take bottle let us give you something for it remi said andrejs eyes narrowed he stroked his chin three thousand kuna sam did the conversion in his head about five hundred dollars he told remi andrejs eyes brightened behind his wirerimmed glasses you have us dollars yes andrej stuck out his hand we make deal now selma said i just emailed the riddle well call you when weve got an answer sam hung up and checked his email remi scooted her chair closer and looked over his shoulder a long one this time he said east of the dubr the third of seven shall rise the king of iovis dies alpha to omega savoy to novara savior of styrie temple at the conquerors crossroads pace east to the bowl and find the sign the first five lines fit the pattern remi said but the last is different theyve never been so explicit have they no this is the first time theyve come out and said go here and find this we may be coming up on the finish line remi she nodded lets get cracking they started as they had before picking from the riddle what seemed like places and names for dubr they narrowed the references to two likely candidates ad dubr a village in north yemen and dubr a celtic word meaning water so something either east of ad dubr or east of some body of water whats east of ad dubr sam checked google earth about eighty miles of mountains and desert then the red sea doesnt seem likely up until now all of the locations have been in europe i agree lets move on try the king of iovis when did he die sam checked no such person iovis wasnt a kingdom or a territory heres something were grouping the words wrongiovis dies the original latin for thursday king of thursday jupiter sam said in roman mythology jupiter is the king of gods like zeus is to the greeks remi caught on also known as the jovian planet so from the latin iovis they got jovis then jovian you got it so try a search with jupiter dubr three and seven nothing he added and subtracted the search terms and again came up empty whats the fifth line temple at the conquerors crossroads sam tried jupiter combined with conquerors crossroads turned up nothing then tried jupiter and temple bingo he muttered there are lots of temples dedicated to jupiter lebanon pompeii and rome this is it in rome the capitoline hill is dedicated to the capitoline triadjupiter juno and minerva and heres the kicker its located on one of the seven hills of rome let me guess the third one the third of seven shall rise yes sam found an artistrendered map of how the area would have looked during romes peak he turned the screen so remi could see after a few moments she smiled you see anything that looks familiar there you mean other than capitoline hill no look due west sam traced his finger across the screen and stopped on a blue serpentine line running from north to south the tiber river and whats the celtic word for water sam grinned dubr if those were the only lines to the riddle id say wed need to go to rome but something tells me it isnt going to be that easy having assumed the last linepace east to the bowl and find the signwould sort itself out whenever they reached their destination they turned their focus to the fourth and fifth linesalpha to omega savoy to novara savior of styrie temple at the conquerors crossroadsand spent the next two hours filling their notepads and going in circles a little before midnight sam leaned back in his chair and raked his hands through his hair he stopped suddenly remi asked what is it i need the biographical sketch of napoleonthe one selma emailed us he looked around grabbed his iphone from the nightstand and called up the correct email there he said styrie what about it she paged through her notes its a region in austria it was also the name of napoleons horseor at least until the battle of marengo in he renamed styrie to commemorate the victory so the savior of styrie someone who saved napoleons horse are we looking for a veterinarian doctor dolittle perhaps sam chuckled probably not well its a start lets assume the two previous phrasesalpha to omega savoy to novarahave something to do with whoever did the saving we know savoy is a region in france and novara is a province in italy but theyve also got a napoleon connection sam replied novara was the headquarters for his department of the kingdom of italy before it was given to the house of savoy in right go back to the previous phrase alpha to omega beginning and end birth and death first and last maybe its talking about whoever ran the department of the kingdom of italy first then took over in no thats not right were probably looking for a single name maybe someone who was born in savoy and died in novara sam punched different terms into google playing with combinations after ten minutes of this he came across an encyclical on the vatican website bernard of menthon born in savoy in died in novara in he was sainted by pope pius xi in bernard remi repeated as in saint bernard yes i know this isnt it but the only thing that comes to mind are the dogs sam smiled youre close the dogs gained their notoriety from the hospice and monastery at the grand st bernard pass we were there remi three years earlier theyd stopped at the hospice during a biking trip through the grand st bernard pass in the pennine alps the hospice while best known for ministering to the injured and lost since the eleventh century had another claim to fame in it had offered respite to napoleon bonaparte and his reserve army on their way through the mountains toward italy i dont know if there are any accounts of it sam said but it doesnt take much of a leap to imagine a grateful napoleon handing styrie over to the hospices farriers in the middle of a blizzard it would have seemed like salvation it would at that remi replied one last line temple at the conquerors crossroads those mountains have seen their share of conquerers hannibal charlemagne roman legions sam was back at the laptop typing his queryjupiter temple and grand st bernardreturned an oxford university article recounting an expedition to the site of the temple of jupiter at the summit of the pass the temple dates back to ad sam said constructed by emperor augustus he called up the location on google earth remi leaned over his shoulder they could see nothing but jagged gray granite i dont see anything remi said its there sam said it may be just a pile of stones but its there so if we look east of the temple using her index finger she traced a line across the lake to the cliff along the southern shoreline i dont see anything that looks like a bowl not enough resolution well probably have to be standing right on top of it thats great news selma said when sam and remi called ten minutes later she leaned back in her chair and took a sip of tea without her afternoon cup of celestial seasonings red zinger her afternoons tended to drag let me do a little research and ill get back to you with an itinerary ill try to get you on the first flight out in the morning the sooner the better remi said were in the home stretch so if were to believe bucklins story about the immortals and the spartans then were assuming the spartans took the karyatids through italy into the grand st bernard then what then twentyfive hundred years later napoleon somehow stumbles onto them how or where we wont know until we make the walk from the temple exciting stuff it almost makes me wish i were there and leave the comfort of your workroom remi said were shocked youre right ill look at the pictures when you get home they chatted for a few more minutes then hung up selma heard the scuff of a shoe and turned around to see one of the bodyguards rube haywood had sent moving toward the door ben isnt it selma called he turned right ben is there something i can do for you uh no i just thought i heard something so i came down to have a look must have been you talking on the phone are you feeling all right asked selma you dont look well just fighting a little cold think i caught it from one of my little girls chapter grand st bernard pass swissitalian border there were two routes for reaching the pass sam and remi discovered from aosta on the italian side of the border and from martigny on the swiss side the path napoleon and his reserve army had followed almost two hundred years earlier they chose the shorter of the two from aosta following the ss north through entroubles and saint rhémy winding their way ever higher into the mountains to the entrance to the grand st bernard tunnel a marvel of engineering the tunnel cut straight through the mountain for nearly four miles linking the aosta and martigny valleys and offering a weather and avalancheproof route beneath the pass above another time sam said as they drove past and continued up the ss it would add almost an hour to their drive and with no way of knowing how long it would take to follow the riddles last line they erred on the side of caution after another thirty minutes on the switchbacking road they passed through a narrow canyon and pulled into the lake basin split by the imaginary swissitalian border the lake was a rough oval of bluegreen water surrounded by towering rock walls on the eastern shorethe swiss sidesat the hospice and monastery on the western shorethe italian sidethree buildings a hotelbistro staff quarters and a cigarshaped carabinieri barracks and checkpoint high above sam and remi the sun burned in a cloudless blue sky glinting off the water and casting the peaks along the southern shoreline in shadow sam pulled into a parking spot at the lakes edge across from the hotel they got out and stretched there were four other cars nearby tourists strolled along the road taking pictures of the lake and surrounding peaks remi slipped on her sunglasses its stunning think about it sam said were standing in the exact spot where napoleon marched when america was only a couple decades old for all we know hed just found the karyatids and he and laurent were hatching their plan or they were worrying about how to get out of these mountains alive in the middle of a blizzard or that okay lets find ourselves a temple it should be on top of the hill behind the hotel excuse me excuse me a voice called in italianaccented english they turned to see a slight man in a blue business suit trotting toward them from the hotels entrance yes sam said pardon the man stepped around sam and stopped at the bumper of their rental car he looked at a piece of paper then the license plate then turned back to them mr and mrs fargo yes i have a message for you a selma is trying to reach you she said it is urgent you call her you may use the phone inside if you wish they followed him inside and found a house phone in the lobby sam punched in his credit card number and dialed selma she picked up on the first ring trouble she said we havent had a cell signal since saint rhémy what is it yesterday when i was talking to you on the phone one of rubes bodyguardsbenwas walking around the workroom i didnt think much of it at first but it started nagging me i did a scan on all the mac pros someone had installed a hardware keylogger then removed it in english selma its essentially a usb drive loaded with software that records keystrokes you plug it in and leave it however long it was installed it downloaded everything i typed every email every document do you think bondaruk got to him via kholkov doesnt matter right now is he there now no and hes late for his shift if he shows up dont let him in call the sheriff if you have to when we hang up call rube and tell him what you told me hell handle it what are you going to do assume weve got company coming they walked outside grabbed their packs from the car then circled to the back of the hotel and started up the slope the grass was starting to green around the rock outcrops and here and there they saw purple and yellow wildflowers poking up when they reached the top of the hill sam pulled out his gps unit and took a reading you think theyre already here remi said scanning the parking area with her cameras zoom lens maybe but we cant secondguess ourselves there are hundreds of people here unless we want to leave and come back later i vote we push on remi nodded eyes fixed on the gps screen sam walked south a hundred feet then east for thirty then stopped were standing on top of it remi looked around there was nothing youre sure there sam said pointing beneath his feet they knelt down faintly visible in the rock was a chiseled straight line roughly eighteen inches long soon they could make out other ruts some intersecting others moving off in different directions must be whats left of the foundation stones remi said they walked to what they guessed would have been the center of the temple then faced east sam took a bearing with the gps picked out a landmark on the other side of the lake and they headed back down the hill at the bottom they crossed the road theyd driven in on and followed a path along the shore past a stone block bistro fronted by a wooden walkway then onto a rock shelf that ran along the water to a sheer ledge here they dropped down and followed a trail around a small cove to another flat area littered with boulders and patchy grass above them the cliff shot up at a fiftydegree angle in the shade of the peaks the temperature had dropped ten degrees end of the line sam said unless were supposed to climb maybe we missed something back the way we came more likely two hundred years of erosion turned whatever bowl was here into a saucer or were overthinking it and they were talking about the lake itself a gust of wind whipped remis hair across her eyes and she brushed it away to sams right he heard a hollow whistling sound he snapped his head around eyes scanning whats wrong remi asked sam held a finger to his lips the sound came again from a few feet away sam moved down the face and stopped before a granite slab it was ten feet tall and four feet wide twothirds of the way up was a diagonal crack filled with yellowgreen lichen sam stood on his tiptoes and pressed his fingertips to the crack theres cool air blowing out he said theres a void behind this that top piece cant weigh more than five hundred pounds with the right leverage we could do it from the packs he withdrew a pair of petzl cosmique ice axes and slipped them into his belt though unsure of what theyd find once they reached the pass it had seemed unlikely the karyatids were tucked away in a closet in the hospice the most likely hiding place would be either in some high hidden cranny or somewhere underground remi said next adventure less spelunking more tropical beaches anyone looking sam asked they scanned the opposite side of the lake and the roads remi said if they are theyre being careful about it do you mind playing ladder have i ever said no to that sam slid his fingers into the crack and chinned himself up remi put her shoulders beneath his feet and he boosted himself onto the top of the slab he turned himself around his back against the slope next he jammed the pick end of each ax into the scree between the slab and the slope so the handles were pointing outward he gripped a handle in each hand as if he was going to set dual parking brakes look out below sam set his jaw heaved back on the ax handles and pressed with his feet the cracked slab tilted outward teetered for a moment then toppled over sams feet went with it he spun himself onto his belly and crossed his arms catching them on the ledge the slab crashed to the ground sending up a puff of dirt what do you see remi asked a very dark tunnel about two feet by two feet he dropped to the ground and they knelt beside the slab he plucked the water bottle off his belt and dumped half the contents onto the face washing away the dust stamped into the stone was a cicada chapter they donned their headlamps and climbing harnesses then sam boosted himself up the slab and shined his lamp into the entrance its straight and level for ten feet then widens out he said cant see any ledges he wriggled feet first into the tunnel then leaned over and helped remi up once she was perched atop the slab he continued backing inside remi crawling after him until they reached the wide part where he turned around the ceiling was three feet tall and covered in popcorn tiny clusters of calcite ahead a funnelshaped hole in the floor was partially plugged by a stalactite they saw no other openings they crawled ahead and sam peeked down the hole theres a platform about six feet below he rolled onto his back and kicked the stalactite until it broke loose from the ceiling he shoved it away from the hole ill go remi said then scooted forward and slipped her legs through sam grabbed her hands and lowered her down until her feet found the platform okay feels solid he let go then a moment later dropped down beside her reaching up and manhandling the stalactite into the hole after himself with a grating sound it fell into place he took a rock screw from his belt and wedged it between the stalactite and the edge of the hole early warning system he explained slightly canted the platform was ten by six feet and ended at a ledge over this they saw a thirtydegree diagonal chute under the glow of their headlamps it curved down and to the right sam pulled a coil of ninemillimeter climbing rope from his pack clipped a carabiner on the end then dropped it over the ledge letting it clink down the chute after hed let out twenty feet of rope the carabiner came to a stop another level spot sam said what we dont know is how wide lower me remi said he reeled in the carabiner and secured the rope to her harness feet braced against the wall sam lowered her down into the chute letting out slack at her command until she called a halt another platform she called up her voice echoing walls to the left and directly ahead and a ledge to the right sam heard her boots scuffing over loose rock and another diagonal chute how wide is the platform about the same as the one youre on move against the wall im coming down he dropped the coil over the edge then lowered himself down until his feet touched the chute at which point he dropped onto his butt and slid down to the platform remi helped him to his feet the ceiling was taller two feet above sams head and dotted with inchlong soda straw stalactites sam walked to the ledge and shined his headlamp down into the next chute im sensing a trend he told remi for the next fifteen minutes they descended following a series of winding platforms and chute formations until finally they found themselves in a barnsized cavern with a stalactitespiked ceiling and walls covered in mottled brownandcreamcolored flowstone barrel stalagmites jutted from the floor like gnarled fire hydrants sam pulled a chemlight tube from his pack cracked it and shook it until it glowed neon green he dropped it behind a nearby barrel so it couldnt be seen from the platform above directly ahead lay a deadend wall to their right were three tunnels each a vertical fissure in the wall to their left a curtain of dragonsteeth stalactites dropped to within a foot of the floor were at least a hundred feet underground remi said sam theres no way anyone could have gotten the karyatids down this way i know there must be another entrance farther down the pass im betting do you hear that somewhere to their left beyond the dragons teeth came the sound of rushing water waterfall they walked down the curtain stopping to peek beneath it every few feet at the midpoint they found a section of dragons teeth had broken off creating a waisthigh gap on the other side lay a fourfootwide rock bridge spanning a crevasse halfway across a thin curtain of water tumbled into the chasm sending up a cloud of mist that sparkled in the beams of their headlamps barely visible through the waterfall they could see the dark outline of another tunnel its incredible remi called over the rush is it from the lake sam put his mouth beside her ear probably snowmelt runoff it probably wont be here in another couple months they walked back the way theyd come somewhere in the distance came a metallic ping followed by silence then a series of pings as sams rock screw bounced down the chutes above it may have just slipped remi said they crept back to the platform and stood still listening a minute passed two minutes then an echoing voice lower me down damn sam muttered the voice was unmistakable hadeon bondaruk how long do we have remi asked hell have more people twenty twentyfive minutes he must think were on the right track remi said hes come to claim his prize at that moment there was only a handful of people who knew this cave was the likely hiding place for the columns sam and remi and bondaruk and whoever was with him bondaruk couldnt allow them to get out alive sam said then hes going to be disappointed come on they zigzagged their way through the stalagmites to the opposite wall and checked each tunnel in turn down the first tunnel and the middle tunnel they could see nothing but darkness the third one jogged left after six feet sam looked at remi and shrugged she shrugged back and said coin toss they slipped through the fissure and followed the bend remi tripped and fell she rolled onto her butt rubbing her knee sam helped her up im okay she said what was that an object on the floor glittered in her headlamp sam walked past her and picked it up it was a straight narrow sword about two feet long though heavily tarnished spots of bright steel showed along the blade this is a xiphos remi it was carried by spartan infantrymen my god they were here he shook himself from his reverie and they continued on the tunnel continued on for another fifty feet turning this way and that until merging with a threeway intersection left is the middle tunnel i think leads back to the cavern sam said no thanks after twenty feet the tunnel began sloping downward first gently then more dramatically until they were sidestepping and groping the walls for handholds the minutes ticked by they turned a corner and sam skidded to a stop sliding a few feet before bumping into a wall dead end remi said not quite where the wall met the floor there was a horizontal split sam crouched down and shined his headlamp inside it was barely eighteen inches high cool air gushed from the opening that might be the other entrance remi said ill check it out too risky behind them a voice echoed down the tunnel anything it was k holkov in turn two voices called back nothing bondaruk kholkov and two others sam said im going remi said remi theres less chance of me getting stuck if i do well need your strength to get me back out dont worry ill just go in a few feet and see what there is to see sam frowned but nodded she took off her pack and harness sam knotted one end of the rope to her ankle and she dropped to her belly and crawled into the split when she was up to her ankles sam put his mouth near the opening and rasped thats far enough hold on theres something just ahead her feet disappeared and sam could hear her scrabbling over loose rock after thirty seconds the sound stopped sam held his breath finally he heard remis whispered voice theres another cavern sam he took off his own pack and belt stacked them atop remis then jammed the xiphos between the packs he clipped on the rope and gave it a tug the bundle disappeared through the slit okay now you remi called sam lay flat and wriggled into the opening the sides and ceiling closed around him brushing his elbows and the top of his head then behind him a noise he stopped footsteps pounded down the tunnel followed by the sound of boots skidding on gravel a flashlight beam danced off the rock walls there he is a voice said ive got them sam scrambled forward hands clawing at the floor boots pushing off the sides you stop sam kept going ten feet away was another slit silhouetted by her headlamp remis head appeared her hands came into view then a carabiner at the end of her rope clattered across the floor toward him he grabbed kept crawling remi began hauling the rope hand over hand shoot him kholkov shouted there was a roar the tunnel filled with orange light sam felt a sting on his left calf he grabbed remis outstretched hand coiled his legs and shoved hard he tumbled out headfirst did a clumsy somersault and landed in a heap the gun roared twice more the bullets ricocheting harmlessly through the slit just above their heads sam rolled over and sat up remi crouched beside him and lifted his pant leg just a crease she said an inch to the right and you wouldnt have a heel small miracles she pulled the firstaid kit from her pack and quickly wrapped the wound with an elastic bandage sam stood up tested the leg and nodded his approval from inside the slit came sounds of crawling we need to block it sam said he and remi looked around the cavern none of the stalactites was narrow enough to break loose something near the righthand wall caught sams eye he jogged over he picked up what looked like a pole but quickly recognized it for what it was a spear the hardwood shaft was amazingly well preserved coated in a lacquer of some kind spartan sam asked no the head is shaped wrong persian i think sam hefted the spear sprinted back and pressed himself against the rock beneath the split turn around and go back he shouted no response last chance go to hell the gun boomed again the bullet thunked into the opposite wall suit yourself sam muttered he popped up cocked his arm and jammed the spear into the opening it struck something soft and they heard a gasp sam jerked the spear back out then ducked down they waited expecting to hear their pursuer calling to his comrade but there was only silence sam peeked his head up a man lay motionless a few feet inside the slit sam reached in and grabbed his gun a magnum revolver ill take it remi said youve got your hands full unless you want to part with your poker sam handed her the revolver and she said itll take them a while to get him out bondaruk wont bother unless he has no other choice sam predicted theyre trying to find another entrance they looked around to get their bearings this cavern was kidney shaped and smaller than the main one with a twelvefoot ceiling and an exit in the righthand wall sam and remi searched among the stalactites but found no other manmade objects how many persians and spartans did bucklin say survived sam asked twenty or so spartans and thirty persians remi look at this she walked over to where sam was standing beside what looked like a pair of stalactites they were hollow their sides reaching up like flowstone flower petals the spaces inside were perfectly cylindrical nothing in nature is that uniform remi said they were here sam and theres only one place they could have gone they walked to the wall and ducked into the tunnel which meandered for twenty feet before opening onto a ledge another rock bridge this one only two feet wide stretched across a chasm and into another tunnel sam leaned right then left checking the bridges thickness seems solid enough but he looked around there were no stalactites to rope onto my turn before remi could protest sam stepped onto the bridge he stopped stood still for a few seconds then made his way across remi joined him they wound their way through a tightly packed forest of stalactites then stepped into an open space they stopped short remi murmured sam i see them caught in their headlamps the karyatids lay side by side on the floor their golden faces staring at the ceiling sam and remi walked forward and knelt down cast with immaculate care the womens golden torsos were draped in robes so finely detailed sam and remi could see tiny creases and stitching on each womans head rested a laurel wreath each stem and leaf and bud was a work of art unto itself who moved them remi said laurent how could he have done it by himself that sam replied then pointed lying beside the wall was a makeshift sled constructed of a half dozen overlapping shields made of lacquered wicker and leather each shield was a fivefoottall hourglass they were bound together with what looked like catgut to form a shallow canoe shape we saw one of these at bondaruks estate sam said its a persian gerron imagine it laurent in here working alone for days building his sled then dragging each karyatid across that bridge amazing but why leave them here i dont know we know theres a gap in his biography a few years before he hired arienne and the faucon maybe napoleon ordered him to try to get the columns out maybe laurent realized he couldnt do it without help so he left them behind assuming hed return sam daylight he looked up remi had moved farther down the wall and was kneeling beside a shoulderwide crack in the wall the interior had collapsed and was choked with rock a pencilsized shaft of sunlight showed at the far end napoleon and laurent might have come in this way remi said but we wont be using it to get out time to go sam said lets go get reinforcements they found another opening this one barely larger than the slit theyd come through earlier at the other end was an alcove and another side tunnel this one leading back in the general direction of the main cavern for twenty minutes they picked their way along until finally they reached an intersection to the left they heard the sound of rushing water the waterfall remi said they crept down the tunnel to the mouth stopping a few feet short directly across from them lay the dragonsteeth curtain to the left the platform they could just make out the glow of sams chem light on the wall behind the barrel stalactite i dont see anyone sam said me neither they started across the cavern angling toward the platform sam saw the movement in the corner of his eye a split second before the gun roared the bullet struck the stalactite beside sams hip he ducked beside him remi spun took aim on the charging figure and snapped off a shot the figure spun and fell but almost rolled onto his side and started to rise run sam barked that way with remi in the lead they sprinted for the dragons teeth through the gap and onto the waterslick bridge never slowing remi crashed through the waterfall followed by sam when they reached the far ledge remi kept going ducking into the tunnel but sam skidded to a stop and turned back sam through the waterfall he could see a figure running across the bridge sam dropped the xiphos and the spear scooped up a double handful of gravel and tossed it across the bridge a second later the figure crashed through the waterfall his gun extended before him his lead foot skidded over the gravel and shot out from under him eyes wide his arms windmilling he stumbled backward his face upturned into the waterfall he slammed back first onto the bridge his leg slipped over the edge and he scrambled with his opposite leg trying to find purchase then he was gone screaming as he tumbled into the crevasse remi appeared at sams shoulder he picked up the spear then stood up and turned toward her two down two to too late for that a voice said dont move a muscle sam pivoted his head surrounded by billowing mist kholkov stood on the bridge in front of the waterfall his ninemillimeter glock was pointed at them remi whispered ive got one more bullet theyre going to kill us anyway true sam murmured kholkov barked stop talking fargo step away from your wife sam turned his body slightly still covering remis gun hand as he very slowly extended the spear toward kholkov instinctively the russians eyes flicked toward the spearhead remi didnt miss the moment instead of raising the to shoulder height she simply lifted it to waist level and pulled the trigger a neat hole appeared in kholkovs sternum a red stain spread across the front of his sweater he collapsed to his knees and gaped at sam and remi sam saw kholkovs gun hand twitch saw the glock start to rise spear held before him sam charged onto the bridge kholkovs fading reflexes were no match for the spears sevenfoot reach the steel head plunged into kholkovs chest then out his back sam leaned forward wrenched the glock from kholkovs hand then planted his feet and gave the spear a twist kholkov tumbled over the side sam stepped to the edge and watched him spin out of sight remi walked up couldnt have happened to a nastier person back in the cavern they picked their way through the stalactites frequently checking behind and to the sides on their way back to the platform bondaruk was nowhere to be seen they half expected him to step from the darkness of one of the tunnels but nothing moved aside from the distant rush of the waterfall all was quiet they stopped at the platform ill play ladder this time sam said then knelt down and formed a stirrup with his hands remi didnt move sam wheres the chem light he turned its right over behind the barrel the green glow of the chem light shifted sam whispered out of the side of his mouth run remi she didnt argue but turned and started sprinting back across the cavern toward the tunnels across from the dragons teeth ten feet in front of sam bondaruk rose up like a cougar attracted by a fleeing hare he spun raised his gun took aim on her no sam shouted he jerked up the glock and fired the bullet missed bondaruks head grazing past his cheek and slicing through his ear he screamed turned fired sam felt a hammer blow in his left side a wave of whitehot pain rushed through his torso and exploded behind his eyes he stumbled backward and fell the glock clattered across the floor sam remi shouted stop right there mrs fargo bondaruk barked he came out from behind the barrel stalactite and stalked over and leveled his gun with sams head come back here bondaruk commanded remi didnt move i said come back here remi put her hands on her hips no youre going to kill us anyway sam lay still trying to catch his breath through the rush of blood in his ears he tried to focus on remis voice not true you tell me where the columns are and i will youre a liar and a murderer and you can go to hell you may find the columns without us but youre going to have to do it the hard way with that remi turned on her heel and began walking her unexpected defiance had the desired effect damn you come back here bondaruk turned bringing the gun to bear on her sam took a deep breath set his jaw then sat up he raised the xiphos above his head and chopped downward the blade caught bondaruk at the wrist despite having gone unused for twoandahalf millennia the spartan sword still bore enough of an edge to sever bone and flesh bondaruks hand came off and dropped to the ground he screamed and clutched the stump with his opposite hand he collapsed to his knees remi was there seconds later kneeling beside sam help me up he said you need to stay still he rolled over got to his knees help me up he repeated she did so grimacing against the pain sam straightened up he pressed his palm into the bullet wound is my back bloody he asked yes thats good through and through wound i wouldnt exactly call that good everythings relative sam walked over to bondaruk kicked the gun away then grabbed him by his jacket collar stand up i cant he gasped my hand sam heaved bondaruk to his feet mr bondaruk how do you feel about heights what does that mean sam looked questioningly at remi she thought for a moment then nodded grimly sam began half dragging half walking him across the cavern toward the dragons teeth let me go bondaruk shouted what are you doing sam kept walking stop stop where are we going we sam replied were not going anywhere you on the other hand youre taking the express elevator to hell epilogue beaucourt france four weeks later remi pulled their rented citroën into a treelined gravel driveway and followed it a hundred yards to a twostory whitestuccoed farmhouse with gabled windows framed by black shutters she stopped beside the picket fence and shut off the engine to the right of the house was a rectangular garden its black soil tilled and ready for planting a pavingstone walkway led through the gate to the door if were right about this remi said were about to change a girls life for the better sam replied she deserves it following the confrontation in the cave theyd spent two hours making their way back to the entrance remi climbing ahead setting pitons and rock screws and taking as much of sams weight as she could sam refused to let her go for help theyd come down together and they were going back up together once outside sam made himself comfortable while remi sprinted back to the hotel where she called for help the next day they were at the hospital in martigny the bullet had missed any major organs but left sam feeling like hed been used as a boxers heavy bag he was kept two days for observation and then released three days later they were back in san diego where selma explained how bondaruk and kholkov had tracked them to the grand st bernard one of the security guards sent by rubes friend had been approached days earlier by kholkov and given an ultimatum install the keylogger or see his two daughters kidnapped putting themselves in the mans shoes sam and remi couldnt fault the choice he made the police were left out of it the next morning they started the process of returning the karyatids to the greek government their first call went to evelyn torres who immediately contacted the director of the delphi archaeological museum from there events moved rapidly and within a week an expedition sponsored by the hellenic ministry of culture was in the cave beneath the grand st bernard lake on its second day inside the team found a side cavern inside were dozens of spartan and persian skeletons along with their weapons and equipment it would be weeks before the expedition would attempt to extract the columns from the cave evelyn reported but the ministry was certain the karyatids would safely find their way home and eventually be put on display at the museum before the year was out scholars the world over were going to have to rethink a good portion of greek and persian history hadeon bondaruk had died never laying eyes on his beloved and elusive karyatids once sam was fully on the mend they returned their attention to the lost cellar according to the legend napoleon had ordered his enologist henri emile archambault to produce twelve bottles of the lacanau wine sam and remi could account for only five one lost by manfred boehm and destroyed based on the pocomoke shard found by ted frobisher three recovered by themaboard the molch at saint bartholomaes and in the tradonico family catacombs in oprtaljand finally the bottle stolen by kholkov from the marder at rum cay and presumably delivered to hadeon bondaruk at his estate an issue the french and ukrainian governments were working to settle for their part sam and remi had already turned over their bottles to frances ministry of culture which had offered an endowment of to the fargo foundation a quarter of a million dollars per bottle one mystery remained what had happened to the other seven bottles were they lost or were they somewhere waiting to be discovered either superfluous parts of napoleons riddle or hidden for their own safety the answer sam and remi decided might lie with the man whod started the legend of the lost cellar the smugglercaptain of the faucon lionel arienne whom laurent had allegedly hired to help stash the bottles as far as they could tell napoleon had been willing to trust only laurent with the task and theyd gone to great lengths to ensure the bottles remained hidden why then had laurent enlisted the help of a random sea captain he met in a le havre tavern it was a question that would take two weeks to answer their first stop was the newberry library in chicago where they spent three days sorting through the spencer collection home to arguably the largest gathering of napoleon original source material in the united states from there they flew to paris spending four days and three days respectively at the bibliothèque nationale de france and the defense archives at château de vincennes finally armed with a legal pad full of notes copies of birth and death certificates discharge documents and transfer records they drove west to rouen the capital of the normandy province there in the basement of the provincial archives they found the last link in the chain in september sergeant léon arienne pelletier a decorated veteran grenadier in napoleons reserve army and subordinate of arnaud laurent during the italian campaign was discharged for reasons unrecorded and returned to his home in beaucourt miles east of the port of le havre two months later he disappeared from beaucourt resurfaced in le havre with a set of new identity papers and purchased a threemasted barque named the zodiaque the ship cost more than a sergeant could have made in eight lifetimes in the french army he changed the zodiaques name to faucon and began smuggling arms and liquor up and down the coast making modest profits and astoundingly not once running afoul of the french authorities two years later in june of arnaud laurent walked into a pub and hired lionel arienne and the faucon twelve months after that arienne returned to le havre sold the faucon and returned home to beaucourt where he slowly but steadily drank and gambled away his fortune why pelletierarienne had chosen to reveal the secret on his deathbed neither sam nor remi knew but it seemed clear that he laurent and napoleon were the only ones whod known about the siphnian karyatids nor would they probably ever know how the three men had found the columns in the first place selmas completed translation of laurents diarycodebook had solved two smaller riddles ten months after he and arienne picked up the wine from st helena having spent nearly a year secreting bottles around the world they received word napoleon had died heartbroken but already enroute to marseille laurent hid three bottles at château dif before returning to port of the other bottles hed said nothing as to why napoleons son napoleon ii never took up the quest his father had devised for him this too was a source of despair for laurent from the time he returned to france with arienne to his death in laurent wrote napoleon ii dozens of letters begging him to obey his fathers wishes but napoleon ii refused stating he saw no reason to leave the comforts of the austrian royal court for a childish game of hideandgoseek sergeant léon arienne pelletier it turned out had one living descendant a distant cousin named louisa foque she was twentyone and deep in debt after her parents had died in a car crash a year earlier and left her a thricemortgaged beaucourt farmhouse how do you think shell take it remi asked lets find out one way or another her life is about to change they climbed out of the car and walked up the path to the front door remi pulled a leather cord and a bell tinkled a few moments later the door opened to reveal a petite woman with light brown hair and a button nose oui she said bonjour louisa foque oui remi introduced herself and sam then asked if louisa spoke english yes i speak english may we come in we have some information about your familyabout léon pelletier do you know the name i think so my father showed me our genealogy once please come in inside they found a kitchen done in quintessential french provincial yellow plaster walls a lacquered oak dining table and a sage green sideboard displaying a few pieces of chinoiserie pottery cheerful orangecheckered toile curtains framed the windows louisa made tea and they sat down at the table remi said your english is very good i was studying american literature at amiens i had to quit there was a i had some family problems we know sam replied were very sorry louisa nodded forced a smile you said you have some information about my family taking turns sam and remi outlined their theory about pelletier the lost cellar and their connection to the siphnian karyatids remi pulled a half dozen newspaper clippings from her purse and slid them across the table to louisa who scanned the articles i read about this she said you were involved sam nodded i cant believe it i had no idea my mother and father never said anything im sure they didnt know aside from napoleon and laurent pelletier was the only other person and he kept the secret up until his death even then he didnt tell the whole story no one believed him almost no one remi said with a smile louisa was silent for half a minute then shook her head in wonderment well thank you for telling me its nice to know someone in our family did something important a little strange but important still sam and remi exchanged a glance i dont think weve made ourselves clear sam said there are some bottles still unaccounted for louisa blinked at them and you think here sam pulled out his iphone and pulled up a picture of a cicada have you ever seen this anywhere in response louisa got up and walked to the pot rack hanging above the sink she pulled down a sauté pan and set it on the table before sam the handle was a thumbsized steel rod set into its end was a cicada stamp it was identical to the one theyd found in laurents crypt my father found that in the attic a few years ago louisa said he didnt know what it was for so he used it to fix the pan remi asked do you have a basement while their research into sergeant pelletier had uncovered a number of surprises it had also challenged one of their basic assumptions that laurent alone had placed the bottles in their hiding spots having spent so much time consumed by the chase theyd begun to think like laurent and pelletier and so it took them only fifteen minutes to find what theyd come for in the northwest corner of the basement beneath a wall next to the root cellar they found a block bearing the cicada stamp as usual sam did the prying remi the probing louisa stood behind them with a flashlight remi slid her hand out of the hole and got to her knees seven she said oh my lord louisa breathed remi scooted aside so the girl could kneel down and look for herself how long have they been there a hundred and ninety years give or take sam replied what happens now remi smiled louisa youre rich you pay off the farm go back to school and live happily ever after hand in hand sam and remi walked out the front door to their car we got eleven bottles out of twelve remi said not bad better than not bad think about it those bottles survived a trip around the world the fall of napoleon and two world wars id call that miraculous good point i have to say i feel a little let down about the end of the adventure remi said wistfully the end not on your life patty cannons treasure is still out there and weve got most of the pocomoke swamp left to search remi laughed and after that after that we pick a spot on the map and go
