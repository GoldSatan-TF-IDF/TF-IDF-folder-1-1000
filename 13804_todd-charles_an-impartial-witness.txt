charles todd an impartial witness chapter one early summer as my train pulled into london i looked out at the early summer rain and was glad to see the dreary day had followed me from hampshire it suited my mood i had only thirtysix hours here and i intended to spend them in bed catching up on lost sleep the journey from france with the latest convoy of wounded had been trying six of us had brought home seventeen gas cases and one severe burn victim a pilot they required constant care and two were at a critical stage where their lungs filled with fluid and sent them into paroxysms of coughing that left them too weak to struggle for the next breath my hands ached from pounding them on the back forcing them to spit up the fluid and draw in the air they so desperately needed the burn victim swathed in bandages that had to be changed almost every hour was frightful to see his skin still raw and weeping his eyes his only recognizable feature i knew and he knew that in spite of all his doctors could do it would never be enough the face hed once had was gone and in its place would be something that frightened children and made women flinch id been warned to keep a suicide watch but he had a framed photograph of his wife pinned to his tunic and it was what kept him alive not our care it had been a relief to turn our patients over to the efficient clinic staff who swept them into fresh beds and took over their care in our place the other nurses were already on their way back to portsmouth while i as sister in charge signed the papers noting eighteen patients delivered still living none delivered dead and went to find a cup of tea in the kitchen before the next train left for london the kitchen was busy and so i stood looking out the windows of the staff sitting room as i drank my tea the green lawns of the countryhouseturnedclinic led the eye to the rolling hampshire landscape beyond misty with the rain so different from the black battlescarred french countryside id just left here it was peaceful and disturbed by nothing louder than birdsong or the lowing of cattle it had been hard to tear myself away when the driver arrived to convey me to the railway station now as the train came to a smooth stop and the man sitting opposite me opened our compartment door i smelled london that acrid mixture of wet clothing coal smoke and damp that i had come to know so well my fellow passenger smiled as he handed down my valise and i thanked him before setting out across the crowded platform as i threaded my way through throngs of families seeing their loved ones off to god knew where i caught snatches of hurried lastminute conversations you will be careful wont you mother will expect you to write every day i love you my boy youre in my heart always did you remember to pack your books im so proud of you son so proud a pair of highland officers stepped aside to allow me to pass and i found myself facing a couple who were oblivious to my approach and blocking my way to the exit she was standing with her head bent and slightly turned toward her companion her hat brim shielding her face but even at a distance of several yards i could tell that she was crying her shoulders shaking with the force of her sobs the man an officer in a wiltshire regiment seemed not to know how to console her he stood with his hands at his sides clenching and unclenching them an expression of longsuffering on his face i thought he must be returning to the front and had lived through this scene before she clutched an umbrella under her right arm while her left was holding to his as if it were a lifeline her distress stopped me in my tracks for a moment watching them i wondered at his reluctance to touch her and at the same time i was struck by the air of desperation about her id seen this same desperation in men who had lost limbs or were blinded a refusal to accept a bitter truth that was destroying them emotionally but there was nothing i could do rescuing kittens and dogs was one thing marching up to complete strangers and asking what was wrong was something else still i felt a surge of pity and my training was to comfort not ignore as her companion was doing i was about to walk around them when a whistle blew and she lifted her head to cast an anguished glance at the train as if afraid it was on the point of departing i had the shock of my life id seen her before there was no doubt about it hers was the face in the photograph that the pilot lieutenant evanson had kept by his side like a talisman during his treatment in france and in all the long journey home his wife hed said there was no doubt about that either i couldnt be mistaken id seen that photograph too many times as i worked with him id seen it that very morning in fact when id changed his bandages one last time she was looking up at the officer now her eyes pleading with him i couldnt be sure who was leaving whom but just then the engines wheels began to move and the officeri couldnt see his rank he was wearing a trench coat against the rainbent swiftly to say something to her kissed her briefly and then hurried toward the train she lifted a hand as if to stop him then let it drop he swung himself into the nearest compartment shut the door and didnt look back she stood there forlornly watching him until he was out of sight it had all happened rather quickly and i had no idea who this man might be but i had the distinct impression that she never expected to see him again women sometimes had dreams or premonitions about loved ones more a reflection of their own fears than true foreboding they usually hid these well as they sent their men off to fight but perhaps hers had been particularly vivid and she couldnt help herself it would explain his restraint and her desolation before i could move on she turned and literally dashed toward the exit i tried to follow but i lost her in the crush by the time i reached the street she was in a sea of black umbrellas as people made their way toward the line of cabs waiting there i gave up my search after several minutes and found a cab of my own to take me to the flat i wasnt sure what id have done if id caught up with mrs evanson but id have felt better knowing shed taken a cab rather than tried to walk off her low spirits in this chill rain mrs hennessey opened her door as i came into the hall smiling up at me in welcome from her own groundfloor flat she watched us come and go took in our mail when we werent there brought us soup when we were ill and generally kept an eye on us without in any way intruding bess my dear and just look how wet you are she embraced me with warmth then added youve just missed elayne she left this morning mary is in london but staying with her brothers family and theres been no word from diana since she went back last week is there anything you need i must say you do look tired how long will you be here i laughed thirtysix hours thirtyfive now and yes im tired and im glad to have the flat to myself i want only to sleep and you must do just that ill see that you have a nice tea you look thin to me bess crawford and what would your mother say to that we sometimes miss meals i admitted you wont tell mama will you for some time id had a sneaking suspicion that my mother and mrs hennessey had entered into a conspiracy to keep me safe choosing nursing as my contribution to the war effort hadnt been met with the greatest enthusiasm at home the colonel sahib my father had no sons to follow in his footsteps and while i believed he was secretly quite proud of me he was also well aware that war had an ugly face and nursing sisters saw the worst of what war cost mrs hennessey said which reminds me sergeantmajor brandon stopped here last week he took diana to dinner before she left i felt a flicker of jealousy simon usually came to dine with me when he was in london hed served with my father in all our postings around the empire and now lived near us in somerset when he wasnt doing whatever hushhush work he and my father never talked about no longer in active service their experience was still invaluable and the war office sent for them often sometimes for weeks at a time my mother and i had tried to guess what they were doing but i had a feeling we were well off the mark simon had always been a part of my life hed picked me up at six when i fell off my first pony hed taught me tactics when i was tired of being a girl and bored with petticoats hed interceded with the colonel sahib when i was in disgrace hed listened to my secrets and comforted me when i was in the throes of first love and couldnt tell mama and hed stood on the dock when my packet had sailed for england that last time and promised me id return to india some day when the time was right half confessor half godfather half friend half elder brothersimon had no business taking my flatmates to dinner besides diana was in love with someone else mrs hennessey finally let me go and i went up the stairs i was just plumping my pillow when she came in with a cup of tea i think i was asleep before id finished half of it twentyfour hours later i was back in france the next two weeks were a blur broken bodies and long hours then one afternoon sister james came in with a box that had just arrived from her family martha was two years my senior plump levelheaded and a very experienced nursing sister id learned a great deal from her and we had become close friends as well as colleagues we had just finished an extra shift and were tired and on edge from the german shelling that had gone on for hours although we were out of range here behind the lines the ground shook with the pounding until our heads were aching and our nerves frayed it was usually a sign of an attack to come and an ambulance had been sent back to the depot for fresh supplies to see us through harry the driver had also found time to walk across the camp to ask if there was any mail for our sector arriving at the hospital hed looked up sister james and presented her with her package before unloading his cargo i think harry is half in love with you i said as she let me feel the weight of the box hefty enough for sharing i smiled looking forward to seeing what was inside it was a much needed distraction you seem to receive your post before anyone else sister james laughed then winced as another miniature earthquake shook the beds we were sitting on our only lamp had fallen over earlier in the day when the shelling began but blessedly was still intact a jar of tea hadnt fared as well there was a crack down one side and my mirror had come off the wall fortunately landing on my spare pair of boots before tumbling to the floor the beds danced again and sister james said if this doesnt stop well get no rest this night never mind the guns i said handing her my scissors to cut the string open the box there may be something perishable in it that we ought to eat at once chocolate she said if it hasnt melted in this heat she managed to get the box open and the first thing we saw was a small jug of honey from the hives on the jamess home farm swathed in a scarf her little sister had knitted never mind that it was summer under that was a tin of fruit and another of milk for our tea i wondered how her family could bear to part with such treasures knowing as i did how scarce these were at home around the whole was a folded newspaper and sister james gently pulled it out with a cry of delight just then the beds shook once more and we both reached for the jug of honey bumping heads as we caught it right on the brink of going over blast them she said and then began to unfold the pages it was a london newspaper and in it was the engagement announcement of her middle sister she read it hungrily having missed the excitement of the proposal sitting back she said oh how i wish i could be there for the wedding we munched on stale biscuits that wed found tucked in the scarf and speculated on the chances of the marriage taking place in early autumn as planned i coughed as the next shell landed catching me with a mouthful of biscuit crumbs if i were her i said clearing my throat id want to be married as soon as may be still a christmas wedding would be nice if henry can manage leave we fell silent henry had proposed on his last leave there might not be another sister james said well we can hope she took the engagement notice out of the newspaper and folded it carefully stowing it in her trunk i picked up the rest of the pages to search for the obituaries instead i found myself staring at a penandink drawing of a womans face beneath it was the caption police ask for witnessesevanson murder still unsolved startledfor i recognized the facei read on the murder of mrs marjorie evanson wife of lieutenant meriwether evanson presently in hospital in hampshire remains a mystery police are asking any witnesses who may have seen her to step forward mrs evanson left her residence shortly after noon on may and was never seen alive again tracing her movements that fateful day has proved difficult and scotland yard has now turned to the public for assistance in learning where she might have gone and whom she may have seen i put the newspaper down sister james shoving her trunk back under her bed said what is it you look as if someone has walked over your grave it was just an expression one id heard many times but i said without thinking not minebut someone i may have seen look read this sister james took the newspaper from me and scanned the column i dont know her do you her husband was among that group of wounded i escorted to hampshire the badly burned pilot remember he kept his wifes photograph by himand thats his wife i cant bear to think how he must have felt when he was told but bess murdered thats awful yes but whats more important is that i saw her late that very afternoon she was at the railway station seeing off an officer in a wiltshire regiment she was crying terribly upset im afraid i stood there staring i was so surprised to recognize her i winced as the next shell landed they seemed to be coming closer together now who was the man with her ive no idea i shook my head trying to come to terms with the fact that shed been murdered that very same day that poor manher husbandwas counting the hours until he saw her again it was what kept him fighting to live i wonder who had to break the news to him i cant imagine having to do it bess if you saw her that day you must tell the yard but i dont know who she was with or where she went after she left the station only that she was there for a few minutes seeing someone off and thats not terribly useful its been a week since this request came out in the newspapersurely someone else has come forward a waiter in a restaurant a cabbie a friend who ran into her somewhere but what if they were saying the same thing someone else will do it if hes at the front this wiltshire officer hasnt spoken to the police she pointed out and just now what lieutenant evanson probably wants more than anything else is for the police to find her killer does it say there how she died i didnt read the rest of the article she went back to the newspaper scanning down the column of close print here it is she was stabbed and then thrown in the river they say that she was still alive when she went into the water but was most likely unconscious how awful i tried to bring up the image of the woman id seen in london her face streaked with tears yes it was the same person id have no problem swearing to that and the man could i remember him as clearly dark hair blue eyes a rather weak chin more to the point would i know him again what if this officer hasnt seen the newspapers or been told yet that shes dead if the police find him its possible he could tell them where she was going after she left the station theres no way of knowing where that might lead martha james persisted yes i said slowly youre right i really should report what i saw and let the yard decide whether its helpful information or not they dont mention what time she died or when her body was found mores the pity she added finishing the article you may have been the last person to see her alive except for her killer now theres an unsettling thought if he was looking for a likely victim he might have followed you home instead you were a woman alone too you have a ghoulish imagination i told her ill write the letter now my voice suddenly seemed overloud we looked at each other silence had fallen the earth was still i felt almost dizzy with relief my ears still ringing my nerves still jangled my teeth on edge oh dear sister james said i have a feeling theyll be sending for us soon very likely it shouldnt take long to put down what i saw could you make us a cup of tea meanwhile but it proved unexpectedly difficult to compose that letter i kept seeing lieutenant evansons eyes peering through his heavy bandages tenaciously holding on to hope even as time was running out for hope trusting to his wifes love for him to help him survive and unaware that she would be dead before morning and so i weighed each word to make certain that i reported events accurately uncolored by my own imagination after three tries i was finally satisfied i was just on the point of sealing the envelope when we could hear the first of the ambulances rumbling toward the wards bringing in new casualties i hastily finished my tea put on a fresh uniform and by the time sister james and i were ready there was a knock on the door and an orderlys voice summoning us to duty chapter two i expected that the police would thank me for my information and that would be the end of it i wrote to mrs hennessey asking her to save the london papers in the event there was any more news what i was not prepared for was a summons through channels to speak to someone at the yard an inspector herbert i was given leave to travel to london for that purpose and two days later i was sitting in a grim little office at scotland yard having been escorted there by a constable with a limp and lines of pain in his face after several minutes a harried balding man stepped into the room introduced himself asked me how my journey from france had been and then lifted a sheet of paper from his desk and frowned at it i recognized it the evanson case weve had precious little help from the public sad to say i was on the point of giving up hope when your letter came he lifted his gaze to my face the frown deepening you write that you recognized mrs evanson from a photograph that her husband kept by his side how long before encountering mrs evanson at the railway station had you seen this photograph a matter of hours that morning id transported her husband and other patients to a clinic in hampshire and turned them over to the staff there it was a little past five oclock when my train pulled into londoni wasnt required to return to france for another day tell me again exactly what you saw as i left the train and was walking toward the exit mrs evanson was literally in my path and it was obvious that she had broken down her shoulders were shaking with her sobs of course at that point i couldnt see her face because she was turned toward the officer standing beside her just then she looked up and i realized i knew who she was you also state in your letter that you recognized the cap badge but couldnt see the mans rank because of the trench coat he was wearing but he was an officer in a wiltshire regiment can you be quite certain about such details my father was in the army for most of his adult life i replied i know how to judge what rank a man holds and what regiment he serves with and you are satisfied that he did take the train just as it was pulling away he didnt pretend to board and then return to the platform i saw him take his seat he didnt look back toward mrs evanson that distressed her and she watched the train until it was out of sight i dont know how he could have managed leaving without being seen she turned then and left in a rush i couldnt tell which way she went after that it was raining i had to hand in my ticket and i was carrying my valise he nodded to be sure and she was in great distress you said yes thats what drew my attention to her in the first place what made her distress different from that of other women seeing off friends or loved ones i frowned i thought at the time that perhaps shed had a premonition or a dream that he wouldnt be coming back she wasnt putting on a brave front you see as so many women do she appeared to be giving in to her feelings as you observed the two of them togethermrs evanson and the officercould you form an opinion of the relationship between them she clung to him he hardly looked at her or touched her inspector herbert raised his eyebrows he didnt comfort her was he perhaps embarrassed by her behavior ithats one possible interpretation but he stayed there with her he didnt walk away until the train began to move it occurred to me then that by standing with her until the last minute hed kept her from following him to his carriage after a moments thought inspector herbert went on i am about to confide to you information that we havent made public miss crawford and i hope youll not repeat it but i think its necessary if were to understand the facts youve placed before us the coroner has informed us that mrs evanson was nearly three months pregnant i must assume from my exchange of letters with his commanding officer that her husband lieutenant evanson couldnt have been the father of this child by any chance are you able to verify his medical history i tried not to show my shock i know from his medical records that lieutenant evanson has been in hospital in france for two months before that his aircraft had been shot down over german lines and it was at least two weeks before he made his way back to british lines he wasnt hurt in that crash at least not seriously although he was sent to hospital for observation because of a blow to the head there was no concussion and he was released to his unit but a few weeks later he wasnt so luckyhis aircraft caught fire and he was fortunate to survive at all it must be four months or more since he was in england at the very least i had heard one of the doctors say that lieutenant evanson had been returned to duty too soon before the psychological effects of his first crash had worn off but they were desperate for experienced pilots and hed been eager to rejoin his flight as wed thought the army has supplied the particulars but not in such detail to the next question you only saw mrs evanson and the officer together for a brief moment do you think that this man might be the father of her child i knew what he was asking if not did she have other lovers i didnt want to believe that of her but then i really knew nothing about her i pictured her again in my minds eye if id been touched by her anguish why hadnt he how had he managed to remain indifferent could that mean shed only just told him her news there at the station where they were surrounded by strangers she might have lost her nerve earlier or been afraid that he wouldnt allow her to come to see him off i remembered a detail that i hadnt put in my letter when he bent to kiss her on the cheek she hadnt responded she hadnt put her hand up to his face or turned to kiss him it was as if he hadnt quite known how to walk away from her and she had been numb the perfunctory kiss a gesture on his part that she barely felt that could mean hed just made it clear that for him the affair was over what if her distress was her bitter realization that he would do nothing to help her now even if he knew about the child i took a deep breath it would be easy to read into what i saw all sorts of explanations that very likely werent there at a guess there was more estrangement between them than passion thats why i felt at the time that she never expected to see him again inspector herbert nodded ive drawn much the same conclusion still theres always the possibility that he left the train at the next stop because he knew where to find her i must keep an open mind there if he was rejoining his regiment he might not have had the option of waiting for a later train then we must find the man if only to clarify that point to be honest were no closer to discovering our murderer now than we were when our plea for information was published in the newspapers which i interpreted to mean that he was in some way disappointed in my evidence if youd told me she was a suicide i would have found that believable given her state of mind or even if hed been found dead instead of mrs evanson not to suggest that she could have killed anyone its just that her death seems soinexplicable inspector herbert smiled you have been very helpful miss crawford thank you for coming forward i was being dismissed i rose to take my leave but at the door i turned my training reminding me do you knowhad she seen a doctor to confirm her suspicion that she was pregnant she must have guessed by the third month weve had no luck there either i sent my men out with photographs of mrs evanson in the event she had used a false name they spoke to doctors and their staffs all across london and to midwives as well aserless savory practitioners in the poorer neighborhoods of the city so far it would appear that she hasnt been to anyone we had hoped that the father was decent enough to accompany her and someone remembered him scotland yard had been thorough surely her family must have some idea who her friends were there must have been someone shed seen more of than was proper neither her sister nor her sisterinlaw had any inkling that there was someone and the friends weve spoken to tell us the same thing inspector herbert replied on the other hand its more than likely that when she was with this man shed avoid places where she might be recognized otherwise there could have been gossip which might even reach her husbands ears in time he paused youre a woman where would you look for help if you were in mrs evansons shoes i cant imagine that id turn to the mans family im sure they were kept in the dark as well im not sure about friends either id be afraid they would stand in judgment of me i expect id go somewhere i wasnt known and pose as a war widow people might be more kind in such circumstances id be frightened about doing anything until id told my lover and perhaps even after id told him frightened of him inspector herbert asked sharply frightened for myself and what was to come i couldnt count on him could i he might be married and even if he were not i couldnt be sure hed stand by me and marry me whenifmy husband divorced me id have to face everything alonemy family my husband my friends theres nowhere else to turn then and theres the child to think about i wish now id caught up with her outside the station but thats hindsight of course she wouldnt have confided in her husbands nurse would she quite at least thanks to you weve discovered she was with someone later that day that leaves only five or six more hours to account for it had been ten in the beginning and in ten hours she might have gone anywhere and still returned to london in time to be murdered a needle in the proverbial haystack i remembered sister jamess comment i dont like to suggestbut there are men who prey on women and if she had nowhere to turn literally if she sat crying on a bench along the thames or walked in green park weve had no problems of that sortthank godthese past twelve months but yes weve taken that into account farfetched perhaps but we havent shut our eyes to the possibility and her husbands family is pushing for an early conclusion we have none to offer at present i thanked him and left the patient constable led me down the stairs and out to the street he asked as i stepped out onto the pavement shall i find a cab for you miss id like to walk a bit first thank you constable he smiled safe journey home miss little did he know that id be in france in another four and twenty hours id come nearly as far as buckingham palace going over what id learned from inspector herbert this meeting at scotland yard had been distressing both because of what id seen at the railway station and because id had lieutenant evanson in my care long enough to be concerned for him and his welfare yes marjorie evanson had transgressed in the eyes of society sadly such affairs were more common in the disruption of war id heard patients worry about their wives when letters were slow in arriving long silences that were never fully explained they would ask me if i thought there was someone else and always id tried to be reassuring for fear of a relapse and id had patients confess to me that theyd been unfaithful to wives or sweethearts afraid to die with that on their conscience sister i have to tell someone but i couldnt judge marjorie evanson i knew nothing about her about what or who had tempted her how she had come to do what she did whether it had anything to do with her death was something scotland yard must discover i found myself looking at the watch pinned at my shoulder there was timejustto find a telephone and put in a call to my parents to say hello and then i could take the early train to portsmouth and stop at laurel house on my way there i could see for myself how lieutenant evanson was faring and it would help me put all this behind me there was probably very little i could do for him but perhaps a familiar face would cheer him and we neednt mention his wife at all i felt a little better as i turned to hail a cab this was a lovely summers day to be traveling the roadsides and meadows rampant with wildflowers villages quiet under the afternoon sun a herd of sheep recently shorn ambled down a lane on their way back to pasture as we waited half an hour at a crossing to give a troop train priority lambs frolicked about the ewes and robins were nesting in the hedgerow beyond birds had all but vanished in france even the carrion crows i was looking forward to seeing lieutenant evanson but i was beginning to wonder what i was to say to him i neednt explain precisely why i was in england he would take it for granted that id brought other patients back and i wouldnt speak of his wife unless he brought up her death least said soonest mended my mother had often warned me there was no need to mention my encounter with marjorie at the railway station either and if there were other visitors my stay could be brief id know after five minutes in his company how he was coping at marlyn station i found a man who could carry me on to my destination and he promised to wait because i dared not miss the next train south to portsmouth id have to stay the night and my orders didnt leave me that option i had had other things on my mind the last time i was here and it had been raining today as we came through the gates and up the drive i could see that laurel house was a handsome brick edifice in the georgian style with white stone trim and two broad halfmoon steps leading up to the main doors they stood open to the warm day and i walked in stopping at the small table that served as reception i didnt recognize the middleaged woman sitting there nursing sister crawford to see lieutenant evanson he was my patient on his journey back to england and ive stopped in to see him she gave me a strange look i suddenly felt like an interloper with no business here lieutenant evanson i repeated perhaps you ought to speak to matron first the woman said finally yes thats fine i answered we walked down a passage between the graceful staircase and the doors to rooms that had once been fashionably decorated for social calls and parties and family evenings at home now they were bare wards for those who couldnt mount the stairs matron had established herself in what had been a small morning room and i remembered the pale lavender walls and a white coffered ceiling filing boxes still occupied all the free space and the breeze from the open windows stirred papers on the desk matron looked as harried as she had on my last visit miss crawford how nice to see you again do sit down may i offer you tea thank you no i must make the next train to portsmouth ive come to speak to lieutenant evanson i realized suddenly that something was wrong she had turned her head to look out the window as i was speaking her gaze on the small gazebo in the garden then she turned back to me with an expression i instantly recognized im so sorry to be the one to tell youwe lost lieutenant evanson six days ago i started to speak but she held up her hand hed been very depressed since the death of his wife despondent might be the better word we did all we could and then on tuesday night we found him in his bed dead somehow hed managed to purloin a scalpel we dont know exactly where or how and hed cut his own throat it was the only death he could manage with his bandaged hands even so it couldnt have been easy but he was determined you see i knew my face must be mirroring the expression on hers horror loss grief and there was something more in her eyes a sense of guilt as if somehow she should have prevented his death i sat there stunned and after a moment she nodded as if she understood what i was feeling i managed to say the proper things even as my mind struggled to accept what had happened it was inevitable given how much he loved his wife what else was there to live for without her without a face or hands that resembled human features and fingers and yet it was sad beyond words why hadnt inspector herbert told me but then he couldnt have known i was coming here still a brief silence fell then i asked the difficult question who told him that his wife was dead his sister came down it had to be done of course we couldnt have kept it from him hed been asking for her you see but we thoughthe seemed to take the news as well as could be expected he just stared at the wall and said nothing he was very quiet for the next week although he asked on two occasions if the police had made any progress in their search for her killer afterward we realized he was simply biding his time we kept an eye on him well aware of how muchhow important she was to his recovery as soon as hed arrived at laurel house hed asked one of the staff to write to his wife to tell her that he was back in england and how much he looked forward to seeing her when she didnt come he wrote to his sister asking if mrs evanson were ill his sister had hoped to spare him the news until he was stronger but that was not to be mrs melton had no choice but to tell her brother the truth even as he was dictating his first letter it was too late according to the police marjorie evanson had left her house early to set out on the journey that would take her to the railway station and then to her death he did inquire of the doctor if it would be possible for him to attend the funeral service i neednt tell you it was out of the question we asked our chaplain mr davies to sit with him that day and offer what comfort he could i spoke to mr davies that evening as he was leaving and he felt that lieutenant evanson seemed reconciled to his loss i wasnt convinced however and kept an eye on the lieutenant anyway so much for mr daviess powers of observation still he was undoubtedly the village priest and had very little experience in suicide watches there was something else to be considered lieutenant evanson was trained as a pilot taught to bury everything that might distract him from the intense concentration required to handle his aircraft and face a very aggressive enemy he could well have concealed his intentions by drawing on that same training remembering i said what became of the photograph he carried with him the one of his wife that was odd you know we had suggested that it be buried with him it had meant so much to him but his sister wouldnt hear of that she left it on his bed when she came to collect his few belongings that seemed soso cruel to me somehow i interpreted his sisters decision to mean that she had learned about the pregnancy even if she hadnt told her brother or anyone else here at laurel house matron opened her desk drawer and took out an envelope she passed it to me i kept it i really couldnt bring myself to throw it away i took the envelope but didnt open it i could feel the edges of the thin silver frame through the brown paper i understand id have felt the same i nursed him for days this was his anchor perhaps someone in mrs evansons family might care to have it later what a pity yes in spite of his burns he was doing quite well and he was a lovely man you must have seen that too never complaining never thinking of himself no trouble she took a deep breath a middleaged woman who had seen so much suffering and yet still felt the tragedy of this one mans death her hair was turning gray and there were dark circles under her brown eyes i thought she had lost weight since id seen her last well you have made this journey for nothing but i can tell you that the other patients you brought us have done better than expected still when the winter rains begin she shook her head i knew what she was dreading the stress of days of dampness on damaged lungs thank you so much for seeing me matron it must have been difficult yes well sometimes talking about things helps and you knew lieutenant evanson too she rose to walk with me to the door you are looking tired she commented how long have you been in france since late january before that i was on britannic when she went down ah yes i recall and youre going back to france now im told to report to a small hospital just outside st jacques which sounded more grand than it was st jacques had all but ceased to exist muddy ruins in the midst of fields that no longer grew anything even weeds a forward dressing station i added though it calls itself a hospital she nodded two of my nursing sisters have spent some time in france they are very good at improvising we had reached the main door i smiled we often have no choice this is your driver she asked looking out at the motorcar by the door i wish you a safe journey my dear if youshould you find that mrs evansons family would like to have that photograph do let me know it will set my mind at ease i believe the obituary listed little sefton as their address sadly thats not all that far from here but it might as well be on the moon they never came to visit you see and then i was on my way to the train my leave nearly up and france waiting for me across the channel at the railing of the ship staring out at the water as we passed out of the solent and into the channel i found myself thinking that whoever had murdered mrs evanson had killed her husband as well just as surely as if hed held that scalpel to the lieutenants throat two victimsthree if one counted the unborn child i found it hard to put marjorie evanson out of my mind perhaps because id first seen her through her husbands eyes as he held on to life amid great pain so that he could come home to her not to her as a murder victim or disgraced wife but as his anchor i had kept the photograph with me of course there was no time to find the direction of mrs evansons family and post it to them but remembering her sisterinlaws emotional response as well as matrons comment that they had never visited i felt i ought to ask their wishes before sending it to them and in the weeks ahead i often caught myself looking for a face i was certain i would recognize every time i saw an officer wearing the uniform of the wiltshire regiment it had become a habit chapter three i was hardly back in francea matter of a fortnightbefore we were given leave it was unexpected but the little dressing station in st jacques was too exposed and was being moved to another village a fresh contingent of nursing sisters was assigned to take over there first however we were to escort a hundred wounded back to england it was never easy and on this occasion even though our convoy moved at night we were strafed by a german aircraft racing down our lines with guns blazing and then swinging around behind the lines to find other targets of opportunity ambulances were clearly marked so there was no excuse for the attack the wonder was only three people were wounded and no one died i couldnt help but think the pilot had intended to frighten us rather than kill us if that were true hed succeeded beyond his wildest dreams the weather had changed by the time we reached the coast and on our crossing there was a storm that turned the rough channel into bedlam we were all seasick patients nurses orderlies and doctors and probably half the crew if they were honest about it id sailed from india to england and never met a storm like this my stomach agreed with me as i ran to the railing for the third time then it was back below cleaning sheets as best i could washing faces swabbing the decks by the time we reached dover i could have kissed the quay from the sheer joy of having dry land under my feet once more dover castle was a familiar sight looming above us half hidden in the clouds its walls dark with rain a friend was on duty there but i didnt catch a glimpse of him we were pressing on for the sake of the worst cases and pulled into london late in the afternoon a watery sun greeted us the worst of the storm well behind us i was relieved of my duties there and after seeing the train on its way again i took the omnibus to the corner of our street and walked down to the flat i shared with friends none of them was at home but there were signs that mary might be on leave again as well and i left her a note before taking a leisurely bath and falling into bed it was thursday evening and id have enjoyed dining out if i hadnt been so tired mary came in later bringing me a cup of tea and a plate of cheeses and biscuits that shed just received from home she was small british fair with rosy cheeks and dimples the soldiers adored her wrote poems to her blue eyes and curls and flirted outrageously with her but her heart was in the navy the first officer on a cruiser you cant sleep away your leave she said cheerfully how long do you have ten days i said stretching and yawning i thought i might go home for the last half of it your parents will be delighted she paused then said ive heard stories was it a bad crossing very bad i thought i would never be able to swallow food again now im ravenous tell your father how grateful i am that he is in the cheese business i havent had a stilton this good since the war began and these are the leftover bits think what it would be like to have half a wheel to ourselves laughing we caught up on news chatting among the biscuit crumbs and then mary said something that nearly caused me to choke on my tea ive an invitation to spend the weekend with friends a house party in the country would you like to come it would make a nice change do i know them i dont believe you do its the melton family but i think you convoyed serenas brother home from france lieutenant evanson he killed himself not long ago had you heard serenas husband will be coming home after a fortnight somewhere he cant talk about its his birthday and she wants to do something nice to celebratehere she reached out to pound me on the back as i turned red from coughing i cleared my throat and said politely surely this is a family occasionshe wouldnt care to have strangers hanging about the truth is nearly everyone they know is somewhere elsein france at sea in the middle east she told me i could bring one of my flatmates with me if i cared to she wants it to be a gay weekend no sadness to mar it i thought of the envelope with marjorie evansons photograph still sealed in it id carried it through france and now it lay in the top drawer of the small chest under my window where id put it when i unpacked it was mrs melton who had decided that it shouldnt be buried with her brother i thought id guessed why but both matron and i had felt it waswrong i really shouldnt go to this house party on the other hand i hadnt had any news about the search for the killer perhaps i could satisfy my curiosity without causing any trouble yes all right if shell have me but it might be best if we dont say anything about my having nursed her brother it could bring uppainful memories if you dont mind then i wont which is how i found myself on a crowded train to oxfordshire with malice aforethought the house where the meltons lived was within walking distance of the station we arranged to have our valises brought there by trap and set out on foot it was a lovely day and the dusty scents of summer wafted from the front gardens of the small village of diddlestoke and then from the pastures and fields that surrounded us as we reached the outskirts another quarter mile and we could see the gates of our destination melton hall was a charming old brick house with a central block spacious wings to either side and a small park through which the drive meandered on its way to the handsome pedimented front door two small children ran out to greet us the girl taking my hand and the little boy clinging to marys niece and nephew she said over their heads and i nodded on jack meltons side serena told me theyd be leaving before dinner we were greeted in the marble foyer by serena melton herself and i was most interested in my first impression of her tall dark and rather elegant she embraced the shorter fairer mary then held out her hand to me elizabeth i may call you elizabeth may i not we are so pleased you could come i hadnt met lieutenant evanson before he was burned and so i couldnt judge the likeness between brother and sister and then she was leading the way up the stairs to our room which overlooked the east gardens over her shoulder she was telling us about her plans for the grand celebration and then while we washed away the dust of travel she was asking me about my family expressing interest in the exotic places where my father had served and then wanting to know about my work in france i hear its frightful to be the first to deal with the severest wounds my brother was badly burned i was never so shocked as i was when i saw him the first time they were changing his bandages and his skin was raw and weeping it was all i could do to keep myself from showing what i was feeling that he could have been a complete stranger i hope hes continuing to heal i said though mary cast me a sharp glance alas he didnt survive serena melton answered her eyes filling and i made appropriate noises of sympathy i could see how much she cared for her brother in her shoes i might have felt the same about marjorie evanson after all it was marjories betrayal of her husband that had led to his suicide sometimes in cases of sudden death people needed someone to blame or blamed god taking a deep breath serena added i was never so grateful than when they found that jack was good at numbers and assigned him to break codes instead of carrying a rifle he was furious but as i told him one martyr to the cause in a family is enough if he can protect a convoy or warn of an attack he saves hundreds of lives surely thats more useful than slogging through france in the hope of killing a few germans i dont know why men think that they arent doing their part if they arent up to their knees in mud and frightfully cold and hungry and tired we followed serena down the stairs she and mary were having a conversation about a mutual friend serving in the navy and exchanging news about him then we were in the kitchen where she was supervising the main course for dinner serena said proudly i got my hands on a roast dont ask how it nearly cost me my virtue and my firstborn but its jacks favorite from the oven came the most tantalizing aromasbeef i was sure of it after a quick look at her prize and a few instructions for the cook a mrs dunner serena whisked us out to the north terrace where her husband was sitting with several other guests there she made the introductions captain truscott lieutenant gilbert and major dunlop were army of course while jack wore his naval uniform with panache i thought perhaps that he was making up a little for not having war stories to tell for he worked in the admiralty in signals he looked particularly handsome regular features his hair only lightly touched with gray and his eyes without that haunted look one so often sees among men whove served at the front still there were lines in his face and i had the feeling that he knew more about the war than most and carried different burdens because of it i realized very quickly that everything happening outside this household had been set aside for the weekend talk ranged from past shooting parties in scotland to the thames regatta any topic would do that didnt remind us of war and death and destruction we laughed at stories that werent really funny made no mention of absent friends and pretended to be happy and lighthearted other guests arrived in the next hour but none of them was a certain officer in a wiltshire regiment not that id expected him to be here he was no doubt still in france but marjorie evanson must have met him somewhere in just such a social setting it was entirely possible that someone would mention him remember fred serving with the wiltshires we had a letter from him last week of course he could be a complete stranger someone marjorie met in london and never introduced to anyone she knew that was surely the safest way to conduct an affair but people dont fall in love with safety in mind sometimes risk must be half the excitement of a secret affair neither mary nor i wore our uniforms to dinner nurses at a dinner table tend to cast a pall over conversation men in uniform on the other hand tend to look dashing whether they are or not the roast was indeed heavenly there was even horseradish sauce and yorkshire pudding for an hour the war faded into the background and it was again when food was plentiful and parties like this frequent and fun that evening we played croquet on the lawn in the long summer twilight a ruthless game with no holds barred the next morning saturday we played tennis and were silly over the litter of pups that one of the english setters had produced in the stablecumgarage instead of the box carefully prepared in the house for her accouchement as we admired the little family under cover of the ohs and ahs someone behind me commented quietly that was evansons bitch you know hed arranged to breed her to fitzgeralds dog the one the king admired hed hoped to give hm the pick of the litter pity about all that the other voice said his wife i mean to say murder but before i could turn and see the speakers we were being handed pups and i couldnt be sure who had been just behind me the warm furry little bodies wriggling and squirming in our arms licking our faces kept us occupied for another half an hour and then it was time for our luncheon we trooped out of the stables in good spirits and i listened for the same voices as people laughed and congratulated serena on the litter still the two men had been nearly whispering so it was harder to identify them with a normal voice serena said nothing about the mother of the pups being her brothers dog not an hour later i overheard her speaking to jack as i passed the study she was saying i dont believe any of them could have been marjories lover it was sheer foolishness to think we could find out this way her husband answered quietly you were desperate it was the best i could do on short notice so many of the people we know are in france or god knows where the man may even be dead as far as that goes by his own hand i hope she retorted viciously after all hes done to us jack said nothing its not your family she went on into the silence answering it as if her husband had spoken aloud im the one who has to live with the whispers and the shame i can read pity in my friends eyes that is when they cant avoid me and wherever i go i can feel the stares behind my back did you know her sisterinlaw was murdered and then her brother killed himself as if ive done something wrong no one asks how im coping for fear i might embarrass them by telling them and expecting a little comfort in return what if they knew the rest of it id never dare show my face in public again her voice broke but not with tears i should have had that damned bitch put down i understand her husband answered her but youre tormenting yourself as well you know as for the poor dog find her another home if you feel that way dont blame her im not blaming her i see her looking up at the door sometimes as if shes waiting for merry to come through it any minute she loved him probably more than marjorie did if you ask me and how do you tell a dumb brute that her master is dead i think she knows meriwether is dead i think she also hopes it isnt true this is the third time weve had one of these parties i dont know if i can face another one jack but i cant think of a better way to question someone about marjories friends than inviting them here under false pretenses and the women come out of curiosity hoping ill drop some crumb of gossip that they can take home with them the men come because they like you but i watch their faces when i mention marjorie to see if she meant more to them than she should have surely whoever that man is he still feels something hes bound to give himself away a shift in the way he looks at me a tightness in the mouth i want to know who it is i wont have any peace until i do and can put the blame where it belongs you may be right my dear but the truth is i dont hold out much hope i walked on down the carpeted passage for fear one of them might come out and find me there eavesdropping but i carried with me food for thought for one thing inspector herbert hadnt told serena about the man at the railway station and probably wouldnt until he knew whether or not it was pertinent to his investigation for another it appeared i wasnt the only one searching for marjorie evansons lover even here and i had the very strong feeling that if serena found the man before i did she would take savage pleasure in exposing him to the world before she killed him the thought occurred to me out of the blue i didnt know whether she was capable of such a thing or not but her brothers death had affected her deeply and sometimes people who turned to anger as they grieved acted rashly in the heat of the moment wanting to hurt the person who had hurt them still now i knew the purpose of this wartime birthday party and why it hadnt mattered if mary had brought a friend serena melton saw me as a smoke screen added to make up the partys numbers and conceal her true purpose in inviting certain guests well i neednt feel quite so guilty now about coming here under false pretenses out of curiosity last evening during croquet and again during the tennis match this morning id seen serena casually drawing aside first one guest and then another she and captain truscott had had a long conversation and soon after that lieutenant gilbert id thought she was making them feel at home just as shed chatted to me about my father and my duties and that reminded me of the naval commander she and mary had discussed had marjorie known him as well id tried politely not to listen at the time now i made an effort to bring the exchange back i didnt want to mention it to mary when was his last leave do you remember shed asked was he in london then and when mary told her hed taken the train directly to scotland to see his parents shed replied no wonder marjorie had missed seeing him i must say jack was wondering about him too serena must not have been very close to her sisterinlaw or she wouldnt be fishing among marjories friends for answers and that brought to mind another question was there jealousy between marjorie and serena had meriwether evansons marriage caused a rift with his sister chapter four id taken refuge in the meltons dining room from a storm that had suddenly blown up sending us all dashing for the house as i stood there looking out at the rain sweeping across the lawns i heard someone come in the door behind me and turned it was lieutenant bellis one of the late arrivals last night hed missed the tennis match pleading fatigue and i hadnt seen much of him at lunch he was drenched his hair plastered to his skull and he said lightly is there nowhere in this house that a man can find a drink i laughed i suspect jack keeps whats left of his precious stock under lock and key im beginning to think youre right known him long have you actually not very i took a chance i met his brotherinlaw once i think meriwether a good man he didnt deserve what happened to him hed found a table napkin in one of the drawers of the sideboard and was busy toweling his head pausing he looked at me from between the folds i thought i remembered you a nursing sister arent you from britannic i think i was in mesopotamia i fished quickly for a face in a hospital bed then smiled as i remembered george bellis the legs healed i see i didnt add that the thin sunbaked man with a broken leg and cracked ribs a fractured skull and the bites of myriad insects looked nothing like the tall muscular officer standing before me now his brother was a captain in one of the county regiments i tried to recall which wiltshire indeed it has he said as we shook hands like lost friends i was sent to france after i recovered were you still with britannic when she sank id wondered i was i told him and escaped with a broken arm harrowing experience i should think i still dream of it sometimes he nodded folded the napkin and put it aside not surprising my dreams arent what they once were he made a gesture intended to lighten his next words my favorite is finding myself flying through a hail of bullets diving headfirst into the nearest trench only to find it crowded with the most despicable collection of turkish soldiers you can imagine bazaar thieves guttersnipes and murderers all better than any rooster for a fast wake up but the lines around his mouth as he spoke told me that it had really happened only to be repeated over and over again in his dreams i smiled as i was expected to do and then said who wins i never find out since im still here i expect it was me we laughed together then i quickly changed the subject wasnt there a girl i seem to remember writing a letter for you you could have written your own but you were malingering so i was a few minutes with the pretty ward sister and i was envied by every man present yes there wasisa girl shes in norfolk helping her family grow whatever it is they grow in norfolk worse luck she couldnt meet me in london it was harvesttime for something i could hear the disappointment in his voice why didnt you go to her he grimaced apparently marrows or parsnips or whatever they are rank higher than a mere lieutenant and then he brightened but im taking the train from here to london meeting my brother and were driving on to gloucestershire how nice i was trying to think how to bring meriwether evanson back into the conversation when george did it himself when did you know merry after his first crash or his second the second ah the burns he stared out the window watching the rain ive always had a horror of fire i cant imagine finding myself aflame how bad were they head hands and feet part of his torso infection is the greatest danger bloody hell he said shuddering as he considered that then he realized hed sworn aloud and was busy apologizing did you know his wife i asked he smiled if you knew merry you knew marjorie shes all he ever talked about im surprised he didnt name that bitch in the stables for her and once more he realized hed put foot in mouth sorryi didnt mean it the way it came out id seen her photograph she seemed to be such a lovely woman in every sense yes well she most certainly was pretty he smiled remembering but it hadnt turned her head do you know what i mean she was a thoroughly nice person thats what makes it so hard to believe she was murdered i mean to say he went on frowning now one doesnt think of murder touching nice people before i could stop myself i spoke in defense of marjorie evanson i dont think murderers care if one is nice or not oddly enough serena asked me yesterday if i thought marjorie had fallen in with the wrong sort of people i couldnt imagine what she was getting at marjorie wasnt like that he took a deep breath is there something worrying her i expect shes also having trouble understanding murder i said grasping at strawsthe wrong sort of people money debts secretsanything to explain what happened i doubt if it was money or debts marjorie was comfortably off in her own right but not rich as i remember she and her sister shared the inheritance from their father someoneinspector herberthad mentioned a sister as for secrets he went on marjorie was hopeless there merry told me she couldnt wait for an anniversary or a birthday and was forever asking if he wanted to know straightaway what she was giving him and yet she had kept a very different secret from her husband and everyone else lieutenant bellis began to pace restlessly how did we get on such a morbid subject the weather is wretched enough taking the hint i said it does seem a little lighter in the west your imagination he replied grinning coming to stand by me at the windows its still as black as the bottom of a witchs kettle out there this could go on for hours but it didnt a tiny square of blue grew to the size of a counterpane and then spread quickly offering us the spectacle of a rainbow as the sun finally burst through the grass was too wet for sport and so we collected in the study for our tea jack was looking tired as if he rather regretted inviting so many guests for the weekend watching him i thought perhaps he was feeling the strain of his duties it must be a burden to know the truth about what was happening in france or the north atlantic and say nothing id noticed several times that when he was asked for his views on the course of the war or the prospect for the americans to come in he evaded a direct answer giving instead the public view we could read for ourselves in any newspaper my own father had told me privately that if the americans didnt commit themselves soon we would run short of men id asked him if the germans were in the same state and hed answered gravely wed better start praying they are it was a worrying possibility that we could lose the war that so many might have died in vain the men drifted off to the billiard room and the women settled down to read or knit we were all expected to do our share with our needles and most of us were thoroughly tired of the drab khaki wool intended for stockings scarves gloves hoods and even waistcoats to keep men warm in the trenches serena came to join us after seeing to matters in the kitchen and i noticed the shadows on her face as she sat by one of the lamps rolling yarn into a ball cynthia newley said serena is there any news regarding marjorie has the yard learned anything more apparently not she answered coldly at least we havent been told it seems soodd you would think marjories death would receive top priority indeed i glimpsed serenas eyes as she looked up briefly at her friend there was angry denial there it was a pity the police had had to tell her about the unborn child it had only added to her distress any indiscretion on marjories part should have died quietly with her but this was murder and there were no secrets in cases of murder and then serena was saying as if unable to stop herself i dont know whats wrong with me i cant seem to concentrate on anything you knew marjorie cynthia so did you patricia those last months in londonwhat did she do where did she go i wasnt in london often i seldom saw her when the police asked me if she had met any new friends i had no idea or if she was worried about something i was so out of touch i couldnt give them an answer patricia a quiet woman with dark hair said these past few monthswell since late winter for that matteri saw her hardly at all a few memorial services and once at a morning church service i asked helen calder if marjorie was all right helen replied that she was probably worried sick about meriwether lets face it pilots dont have very long lives do they juliana said well i can vouch for the fact that she didnt spend much time with her usual friends i invited her to several parties and she declined which could mean cynthia commented dryly she must have made new friends still you must have seen her somewhere dining out volunteering somewhere the theater serena looked around the room inviting comment cynthia sitting by the window peered over her glasses well since you ask there must have been a man serena bristled thats disgusting is it she ran her fingers through her fair hair look were not the innocent lambs we were in are we if marjorie stopped seeing her friends and family theres probably a good reason she had new friendsor she had something to hide and what would she have to hide if it wasnt a man cynthia added bitterly shes not the first serena and nor will she be the last youre fortunate you know where jack is even if hes not at home he isnt off in france or god knows where being shot at and his letters coming in bunches or not at all and youre left wondering if hes dead or wounded or missing you cant stand in judgment of marjorie you havent lived with her fears serena said she never said anything to me about any fears no im sorry but youre meriwethers sister you had your own worries there i expect she didnt want to add to them mary said trying to pour oil on troubled waters theres been nothing more in the newspapers have the police made any progress at all serena gave her a cold hard look the inquest was adjourned at the request of the police citing the ongoing inquiry into her murder by person or persons unknown mary answered mildly i was in france serena i didnt know nor did i cynthia held her ground theres no use asking us about marjorie talk to her sister its possible she knew more about what was going on marjorie may have confided in her i doubt it patricia interjected my impression was that they didnt get on serena turned to cynthia you seem to feel there was something to hide no one else does it must mean that you know something you arent willing to tell me if youre asking if i know who murdered her i dont she avoided all of us these past few months even you if you think about it one doesnt advertise adultery serena but the signs are there if you havent noticed them im sure the police have if the man she was seeing killed her then she threatened him somehow but i hardly think knowing marjorie that she would do such a thing so who else could it be thats a matter for the police but you wont get anywhere unless you look the truth in the face patricia winced we were all feeling decidedly uncomfortable one didnt discuss such things openly and yet cynthia had juliana was bent over her ball of yarn rewinding it after dropping it avoiding looking at any of us i shot a quick glance at serenas face i dont think shed bargained for someone as strong willed as cynthia and then serena surprised me she said i dont want to believe there was someone else after all marjorie was married to my brother but im grateful for your honesty ill speak to the police i wasnt supposed to mention it but theyre of the opinion now that someone noticed the rather fine lozenge brooch she was wearing when she was killed its missing of course along with her purse these new friends she possibly madethe police ought to be aware of them surely it wont hurt to look into who they are she glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece and set aside her knitting i think the gentlemen have had long enough to bore themselves to death lets rout them out and have our tea brought in she turned away to ring for tea but her shoulders were stiff and i thought she wouldnt soon forgive cynthia for being outspoken and voicing what serena already knew to be true as for a missing brooch inspector herbert hadnt asked if she was wearing it at the railway station serena had just lied to distract cynthia and the rest of us from any thought of a lover she went in search of her husband and his guests a silence filled the room after shed gone i realized the sun now coming through the window was warm on my feet i shifted a little in my chair everyone looked at me as if i were about to speak finally mary said i didnt know where to look when she was talking about marjorie patricia said her voice irritable wed be liars if we didnt admit that weve been curious about what happened well she certainly put paid to any more gossip didnt she i think we all must have had in the back of our minds that marjorie must have done something to lead to her death making her as guilty as whoever killed her cynthia said the police should have made it clear about the missing brooch it would have quelled a good deal of speculation and talk i put my knitting into its bag and said im crosseyed from counting stitches at least the sun has come out it will be good to walk a little after tea the others turned to me as if id changed the subject on purpose which i had chapter five lying awake in my bed that night long after mary was asleep i considered serenas lie about the brooch it had been a foolish thing to do she was bound to be found out when marjories murderer was caught and tried i couldnt help but wonder what other lies she might have told people who came too close to the mark as cynthia had done and cynthia newley had brought up a very interesting point that if marjorie was meeting a man in places where neither of them was known she was outside that safe circle of acquaintances and familiar surroundings that made it possible for women to move about london on their own if her murderer had come from those shadows the chances of finding him would be very slim indeed on the other hand if the killer wasnt a stranger serena was running a risk openly digging for information just as one of her guests might unwittingly know this person one of them might just as unwittingly tell him how close serena was coming to uncovering the truth none of her efforts would bring her brother back to her even if she could personally hand marjories killer over to the police i was surprised that jack melton hadnt reined in her attempts to question his guests but perhaps he saw this as a harmless way to deflect her grief and anger and he could always say later you must remember how recent it was and how upset shes been especially since the police have got nowhere i drifted into sleep and dreamed not of murderers but of india its strange how smells and sounds come back so vividly in a dream the dust ancient and full of an exotic mix of scents from dung to rare spices the muffled sounds of car wheels in the distance harness bells jingling and the creak of wood as the oxen put their shoulders into pulling the feel of the dry wind on ones face just before the monsoon rains come voices in a bazaar a dozen different dialects all talking at once i was back in a familiar and happy past safe in a world i knew so well my father walking through the compound gate simon brandon at his heels sunday morning it rained again not just the occasional shower but a hard steady rain that had no intention of going away most of us went with serena to attend morning services at st ambrose church in diddlestoke and listened to a homily on faith in times of trouble the rector aptly named mr parsons was eloquent most of the congregation were wearing black although the government had tried to persuade people to eschew mourning to keep up the spirits of those at home as well as the returning wounded my blue uniform coat stood out among them on the walk home i asked if anyone knew someone in the wiltshires adding casually i havent heard from friends in a while are they facing serious opposition should i be worrying there was a general shaking of heads lieutenant bellis added i shouldnt if i were you your letters probably havent caught up with you yet i had to leave it there jack and serena had gone ahead to see that breakfast was ready for us and afterward we played bridge it was fun at first but then the friendly bickering grew more strident as the better players argued over each hand i lost interest and wandered away captain truscott was a tall thin man suffering from nerves his hands shook as he dealt the cards almost like a palsy no one had said anything as he twice dropped cards or his fork fought to find his mouth at meals but his mind was sharp and his sense of humor intact he too was soon banished from the tables and he came in to join me in the music room hed asked me earlier to call him freddy may i join you he asked politely of course this is a sanctuary for hopeless bridge players he laughed do you play he gestured toward the piano not as well as i should like pianos are delicate creatures and dislike being shipped around the world much less being carted from cantonment to cantonment on the backs of camels or in swaying oxcarts absorbing dust and monsoons in equal measure lessons were possible only when my mother could find an instrument in fair enough tune to make learning the rudiments of playing even possible she has perfect pitch and i realized much later what agony of spirit she must have endured even trying to pass on a little of her skill to her only daughter captain truscott walked across the room sat down at the piano adjusted his chair a little and began to play freddy i discovered was amazingly gifted his hands steady and sure on the keys i came to join him turning pages in the music hed found it was a pleasure to listen to him he smiled up at me but i could see his mind was elsewhere as if the music reached deep inside as he moved on to another piece this one from memory he said marjorie evanson liked to listen to my playing her husband was serenas brother a pilot they dont have much of a record for longevity marjorie formed a sort of club for women who were the wives or widows of fliers they met once a week in her london house to give each other support and comfort something else i didnt know about this woman who has taken over the group now he shrugged i hope someone has but she was the driving force it may have collapsed without her moving effortlessly to another piece this one an irish ballad the keys rippling softly under light fingers he fell silent then to my astonishment he said there was another man i dont think serena knows but i saw them together some months before marjories death two three im not sure at any rate they were in a small restaurant on the outskirts of rochester not a place id expect to find her but i knew her at once id had a flat you see and had to wait for it to be repaired so id come to the black horse to have something to eat while i waited there was a girl with meshe was engaged to someone else and worried about gossip i was taking her back to london for her fiance it was completely aboveboard but you know how people talk i could easily see how that might happen with trains so crowded and having to wait for trooptrain priority everyone asked for lifts from someone going their way did marjorie see you oh yes im sure she did she was facing the door as i stepped into the room she looked away at once and i backed out telling nancy i didnt care for the restaurant after all i couldnt see the man she was with his back was to me the lights were dim and there must have been something wrong with the chimney because there was a smoke haze hanging about i knew it wasnt meriwether but thats about it the man was dark and looked to be about my height before marjorie saw me they had their heads together in a way that seemed ratherintimate if you know what i mean i did and his description matched that of the man id seen could you tell if he was in uniform anything to indicate rank or regiment he shook his head i was too busy beating a hasty retreat he could have been and at that critical moment the door opened and cynthia came in with lieutenant gilbert we heard the music she said its war in there she gestured over her shoulder i could just hear patricia arguing with jack melton about a hand weve escaped that was the end of a private conversation but just before lunch when we had no more than a minute alone freddy said i can trust you to keep that confidence i wouldnt want to hurt serena of course and that was that i walked over to where jack was showing off his gun collection the cabinet was mahogany and lined with a pale velvet two prizes were there on display id noticed them before jack was just pointing to the early american colt revolver my uncle went out to the american west to raise cattle he had a weak chest and he hoped either for a cure or to die of it more quickly out there to everyones amazement he survived made a fortune came back to england and lived to be seventyseven everyone laughed as they were meant to and jacks hand moved onto a pair of dueling pistols halfway there i saw his fingers pause for an instant where the lining was indented but nothing lay in that spot it was an infinitesimal pause but i saw the flicker of expression on his face and then he went on smoothly these belonged to my greatgrandfather handsome arent they he bought them not to kill anyone but because he believed a gentleman ought to own a pair they were never fired in anger but i have it on good authority that when he tried them here at the hall they pulled slightly to the right and he missed his target hit his coachmans pet goat instead and there was a terrible uproar the goat survived but the tip of one horn was shorter than the other for the rest of its life and my greatgrandfather was required by the magistrate to pay compensation only no one could decide on the value of a goat in the end my greatgrandfather paid the coachman five pounds a princely sum in that day and was ordered to swear he would never dismiss the coachman or eat the goat i moved past them as his audience laughed again and went to find mary our train left for london an hour after lunch and we were nearly ready she was rather quiet on the first leg of our journey busy with my own thoughts i was content to let the silence between us lengthen after a time she said you know it just goes to show that to eat well one should live on a farm that was not as farfetched a conversational gambit as it might sound she was seeing a naval officer whose father was a gentleman farmer like jack and she had been dithering over whether to marry him should he propose or find someone more likely to enjoy the social whirl in london i murmured something noncommittal and she went back to her own reverie i myself had been thinking about serena melton id had no brothersor sisters for that matterto help me judge how one might feel in serenas shoes having lost meriwether would i have been forgiving or vindictive the closest i could come to imagining her emotional state was to consider something happening to simon brandon he wasnt related but id known him all my life and loved him dearly if someone caused his death id be furiously angry and determined to see that person punished soldiers are mortal we had all been touched by that loss but serenas brother hadnt given his life for king and country hed died under tragic circumstances just after the doctors had felt it safe enough to send him home hed had a good chance of surviving his wounds first hope then despair i myself had grieved in my own way for meriwether evanson and so had matron for that matter i took a deep breath more like a sigh and mary said was it a boring weekend im sorry for dragging you there i was very glad i went i told her truthfully but i was looking forward to spending the rest of my leave with my family id had my fill of spying i had been back in france nearly ten days when the letter came from inspector herbert at scotland yard it was brief and it contained a photograph i turned it over to find myself staring into a dead mans face i could see clearly the bullet wound in his temple i turned to the letter this is lieutenant fordham he died of a single gunshot wound to the head forgive me for sending this to you without some warning but im told youre in france and theres no other way fordhams death appears to be a suicide i use that word appears because there is a modicum of doubt he was an officer in the wiltshire fusiliers are you still certain that the man with marjorie evanson the evening of her death was in this regiment could this be the man i looked again at the photograph but i already knew the answer this was not the man at the railway station i felt a chill suicide among soldiers was more prevalent than the army admitted it wasnt good for morale to give exact numbers they said why had lieutenant fordham chosen to kill himself what demons drove him and whyother than his regimenthad inspector herbert thought this might be the man id seen with marjorie evanson was there something in his suicide note that pointed in that direction and what did inspector herbert mean by appears to be a suicide his brief message told me so little that my curiosity was aroused i found myself thinking that hed have done better to satisfy it i reached for pen and paper to answer him before the next post bag left poor man to answer your questions i am not mistaken in the matter of the wiltshires and this is not the person i saw at the railway station but even as i finished putting those words down on paper in black ink stark on the page i glanced again at the photograph lieutenant fordham was a handsome man even in death and if he were charming into the bargain he might easily turn a lonely womans head he was the sort serena melton should have invited to a weekend party not a lieutenant bellis who considered himself a friend of meriwether evansons or captain truscott with his shaking hands they were loyal to the dead and not likely to confide anything they might know to a grieving sister i added another line to my message what weapon did lieutenant fordham use to kill himself service revolver other it was the price inspector herbert must pay for not being more straightforward for something had just struck a chord of memory thinking about serena and her house party had brought to mind a vivid image of jack meltons hand pausing over an empty depression in the lining of his gun cabinet to suspect serena melton of killing a man she thought was her sisterinlaws lover was ridiculous and yetand yet i had seen for myself how deep her grief and anger ran if shed found someone she believed was the guilty man and there was no way of proving it what would she do for one thing she wouldnt have a weapon handy in the event she needed to use it that was a very different thing from being so angry one could lash out with the first thing that came to hand besides lieutenant fordham was a soldier with a soldiers reflexes he wasnt likely to let someone walk up to him revolver in hand and fire at him i was letting my imagination run away with me but as much as i didnt want to believe it there was most certainly the possibility that marjorie had had more than one lover and lieutenant fordham could have had his own guilty conscience and so i didnt tear up the reply to inspector herbert and start again i left the query in my letter but scotland yard never answered not even to thank me for helping them with their inquiries chapter six finally i wrote to simon brandon he had been my fathers batman his friend even though he was less than half my fathers age and eventually his rms his regimental sergeantmajor a position of some responsibility as well as prestige if anyone could find the answer to my question without involving the police or causing a stir it was simon his contacts were myriad and they had long memories of service together i knew my father well enough to be sure hed find the answer to my question and then want to know why i had asked it the colonel sahib as we called him behind his back was accustomed to commanding troops in battle raising a daughter wouldhed thoughtbe as simple as taking a seasoned company on maneuvers he could do it blindfolded hands behind his back by the time i was walking he was in full retreat from that position shell be running the british army before shes ten hed warned my mother it wasnt long before all the servants and half the men in his command were enlisted in a conspiracy to keep me safe not to mention our indian staff and all their relatives the army has a code of its own i had been well taught not to air its dirty linens in public and in india my father would have made short work of finding out who had been involved with lieutenant evansons wife and seeing to it that he was disciplined or learning how captain fordham had shot himself it would have gone no further been dealt with quietly and appropriately we werent in india now but the same circumspection was still there inbred in us a letter came back faster than id expected it occurred to me that simon had somehow arranged to have it sent with dispatches the post where i was presently stationed was notoriously slow and sent with dispatches the letter wouldnt pass through the hands of the military censors i opened it quickly eager to see what he had discovered bess its been hushed up i cant discover why whats this about do you know this man before i could answer simon we were moved again this time to the tiny village of la fleurette so destroyed by war and armies that i could find nothing to show me what it might have looked like once upon a time there was a pitted street half buried in piles of rubble only the west wall of the little church still forlornly standing and miraculously a stone barn that had somehow escaped damage it was whole even its roof intact praise god sister benning said looking up at it now to see if we can do anything about the inside the lane into the barns forecourt was no more than a muddy and rutted track the barnyard was already jammed with lorries and ambulances jostling for room and we had orderlies clearing up the interior as fast as they could so that we had a space in which to work the walking wounded were already sitting on benches shoulders drooping bloody bandaging around heads torsos or limbs sometimes all three stretchers with the worst cases were being set across frames made from mangers and a surgeon was already at work calling for us to hurry and bring him what he needed the first of the dead had been taken away out of sight in what had been the milking shed it was chaos and we were accustomed to it having packed in such a fashion that we could find anything we wanted immediately ambulances were coming in now in twos and threes and i was meeting them trying to sort the wounded into those who could wait those who needed immediate attention and sometimes offering up a brief prayer as i came across a soldier who had died on the way to us we worked almost thirtysix hours without respite on one broken body after another someone had managed to brew tea and we drank gallons of it without milk or sugar to stay awake i took my turn at the tables where dr buckley was operating my eyes on his hands and the wound ellen benning on the other side was constantly mopping his brow and as i looked up i realized he was flushed perspiration rolling down his face and i wondered if he were ill at a break while the patients were being shifted i led him outside and asked sir whats wrong he looked at me his eyes so tired that they seemed sunk in his head lined and puffy with lack of sleep im well he told me irritably dont hover i said nothing more letting him go back to work without protest and then as suddenly as the flood had begun it started to taper off i saw dr buckley huddled with one of the ambulance drivers their faces grim we had reached a point where we could actually catch our collective breath when dr buckley began to load the wounded ambulatory and stretcher cases into whatever vehicles we had sending them back down the line the empty vehicles were returning for their next load when i quietly asked what was happening the germans are about to break through along the front were moving out as quickly as possible the army is trying to hold them but i dont think theres much of a chance now best to be prepared it was the story of this wara few yards gained at horrendous cost then lost again with even more casualties from trying to hold on against all odds a retreat today an advance tomorrow and then retreat again before the next advance like a bloody tug of war i nodded and went about helping him smiling and offering comfort where i could assuring the soldiers wed just patched up that this was too exposed a location and theyd be better off in one of the trench hospitals down the line one of the scots officers agreed this wasnt supposed to happen wed won the ground hq told us we could hold on to it but their intelligence was wrong we were down to the last half dozen walking wounded who were being handed into ambulances and the staff was packing one with what was left of our stock of supplies a lorry was filled with the dead i looked around in the pale morning light feeling rather exposed here in this shattered place id been too busy to notice before this still i was tired enough to sink to the ground and sleep where i was dr buckley had come out of the barn to supervise the last of the stretcher cases those he had waited as long as possible before moving i was just about to go and help when i heard a faint new sound in the distance almost in the same instant i recognized what i was hearing above the rumble of the german guns down the line it was an aircraft and it was coming closer searching the sky for it i felt my heart rate rise i dont know why but something some instinct born of working so near war at its worst warned me why was an aircraft heading this way the british aerodromes were west of here was it in trouble and then i saw it coming low and fast the shape was distinctivethe two wings and the different body of an albatross i had only a second to wonder how a german pilot could have flown this far behind our lines and then remembered that our lines were collapsing i was already running pointing shouting to everyone to take cover one eye still to the sky the orderlies patients and nurses clustered around the great doors of the barn probably couldnt see what i did but my alarm was all too apparent they glanced up then heard the aircrafts motor and dashed for the security of the barn the german flier perhaps on a simple reconnaissance mission to see how the wavering front was holding had seen us as well and he veered in our direction one of the spandau machine guns already stuttering angrily ripping up the earth and tracing a line across the bonnet of one of the ambulances it burst into flames as the orderly who had taken cover behind it flung himself to one side i could see the bullets coming my way and dove behind one of the horse troughs and then he was gone only to swoop past and swing around to bear down on the barn itself i saw one of the wounded with a rifle in his hand and he stood there in full view carefully taking his aim firing and then waiting for death to come but the pilot hadnt seen him and fired at the barn instead i could see dr buckley standing there his mouth opened wide in a wordless shout his fists raised above his head cursing the pilot i realized he was trying to distract the german at the stick and just as the pilot veered a tiny plume of white smoke showed beneath the aircraft turning black quickly and growing larger by the second until it was a column trailing the aircraft like the shadow of death i knew what was comingid seen lieutenant evansons burns and those of other fliers dr buckley and the barn were forgotten as the pilot pulled up sharply and turned away in a frantic dash for his own lines by some marvel of aim that soldier must have hit the german i was already at the barn climbing into one of the other ambulances ramming the burning one to one side where it could do no harm to the barns wooden doors just at that moment the german albatross exploded into flames spiraling toward the earth a cheer went up and then sister benning was pointing saying something to me that i couldnt hear over the explosive sound of the crash i closed my eyes for a second against the sound then turned in the direction shed indicated and there was dr buckley on the ground in a heap all i could think of was that hed been hit i ran to him as sister davis asked isnt anyone going to see if that pilot survived no one stopped to tell her that hed burned alive in that conflagration bending over dr buckley i searched for blood a wound then felt for his pulse it was slow labored an orderly was there and i told him to put dr buckley into one of the ambulances we ought to be going i added if that albatross got through our lines the rest of the german army may be on its heels sister williams caught my own alarm and called hurry we got dr buckley into the nearest ambulance there was no room with one ambulance destroyed for six of us and sister benning said well its shanks mare then the lorry with the dead was already pulling out and the ambulances followed we began to march in its wake and i thought that all we needed now was for one of us to twist an ankle in the ruts and pits of the road i was concerned as well for the wounded bounced and shaken in spite of the care their drivers took to spare them the worst of the ride sister davis was saying theyre getting ahead of us what if the germans are closer than we know keep walking sister williams answered her sternly and pay attention to where youre putting your feet theres no one to carry you if you stumble or fall i looked over my shoulder the black plume that marked where the german flier had gone down was dwindling as the fire had consumed the wooden body of the albatross and there was less and less fuel to feed on i tried to put it out of my mind and did as sister williams had askedsilently concentrating on each step my main worry was that another pilot from the same squadron seeing the telltale black smoke might come to investigate we could still be spotted wed marched nearly three miles through desolation and the french summer sun thirsty and wishing for nothing more than an hours rest sister benning had already asked if we needed to find some shade for five minutes of respite from the heat but we all knew it would be the height of foolishness and then a lorry came barreling toward us crashing about like an erratic monster and it slowed in a shower of dust and loose stones get in the sergeant at the wheel shouted to us standing on no ceremony we lost this round and the hun will be at la fleurette in twenty minutes we didnt need a second invitation we scrambled into the back of the lorry and held on tight as the driver swung it in a wide circle to make his turn then we were heading back the way hed come gripping whatever we could find to keep ourselves from being thrown about i could feel the bruises accumulating but we were safe and that was all that mattered the driver slowed after what seemed to be hours of torture and he called back to us we should be in the clear sorry about the rough ride i asked if there was news of dr buckley but the driver shook his head no idea sister but not to worry well be back in la fleurette soon enough word is the huns cant hold what theyve gained today and then he turned back to the wheel and sister benning said well i know what it feels like to be on the rack now as we gathered speed again but i wasnt fated to return to la fleurette although later i was told that wed regained the lost ground just as the sergeant had predicted and a dozen yards beyond it but at the cost of how many lives how many wounded who would never be whole again dr buckley was being sent back to england he resisted going at first and then relented finally asking if i could escort himshe doesnt fuss he had told the worried doctors who had examined him at the same time i was informed that i was to be given leave although i knew very well that in the rotation i had weeks to go i never knewalthough i had my suspicionsif my leave had to do with dr buckley or if inspector herbert had had some say in it that was rather farfetched but stranger things id learned in dealing with the army could happen it was entirely possible that simon brandon had pulled some strings between them he and my father knew everyone from general haig to the lowliest subaltern down the line of command it was simon who met my train as it came into london and id sent no telegram chapter seven simon greeted me took my satchel away from me and walked with me to the motorcar that was waiting outside the station my fathers motorcar in fact simon smiled its home for you miss crawford orders from the colonelinchief that was my mother none of us disobeyed her when she issued a command i had delivered dr buckley to a doctor waiting for him in the hospital in portsmouth once hed been settled and the papers id been carrying about his condition were handed over to matron who took charge of them and dr buckley with quiet efficiency i had been free to leave i was just as glad to be going home again standing at the rail of the ship bringing us into portsmouth id watched the smooth waters of the solent and the irregular shape of the isle of wight rise out of the darkness like some fantastical place in dreamsquiet and peaceful at the back of my mind unbidden were the sounds of that spandau machine gun firing round after round and then an officer of the wiltshire fusiliers came to stand beside me looking out toward the busy harbor i miss the lights he said without turning i could pick out the villages by their lights as we came into port they had been turned off to make the enemy blind portsmouth across the solent was a major port and a tempting target for submarines i looked up at him but it wasnt the face id hoped to see and that encounter had brought marjorie evanson back to mind i still had her photograph turning to simon as we drove toward somerset i said what did you learn about lieutenant fordhams death its still under wraps a police matter how did you come to hear about his death your letter was brief i was worried about the censors scotland yard wanted to know if he was the man id seen with marjorie evanson at the railway station the day she died and was he no i cant even be sure he knew mrs evanson he was just in the same regiment as the officer the yard is looking for to help with their inquiries as they say scotland yard might even have asked me just on the off chance it would connect the two cases apparently they havent made much progress in finding her murderer that explains the fact that so little has come to light about fordhams death the yard kept it out of the newspapers did you know that but then fordham was from a prominent family i suspect theyd rather believe he was murdered than that he killed himself he was a serving officer recovering from wounds suicide smacks of not being able to face going back into the line was there an inquest it was adjourned at the request of the police i did ask inspector herbert for the particulars when i answered his letter but he never replied where does the fordham family live do you know in wiltshire leave it to the police bess i know they have more resources and all that i gave the matter some thought then asked was lieutenant fordham married i dont know bess he turned to look at me taking his eyes off the road for a moment and that was when i realized that he was not telling me everything i know simon brandon as well as he knows me theres something else what is it simon he was concentrating on passing a small dogcart driven by a heavyset man asleep on the seat the pony trotting purposefully toward its destination as if it had done this a thousand times before i waited until we were safely past pony and cart you might as well tell me theres nothing to tell i smiled must i spend my entire leave making your life miserable wheedling and pleading and issuing ultimatums his profile was like stone ill even cry he laughed then i havent seen you cry in years i let it go we drove in silence for some time finally simon said all right a fortnight before he died lieutenant fordham was invited to a weekend party at melton hall i stared at him melton hall but i stopped then asked and did he accept he refused the invitation there could have been any number of reasons for refusing but what had serena melton made of that how on earth did you discover that quite by chance i was asking someone about fordham but she hadnt seen him for weeks and then she added that in fact shed just missed him apparently shed attended a party where shed been looking forward to seeing himshe had heard he was to be a fellow guest but he never came when she asked her hostess if he was all right she was told that fordham had pleaded another engagement when she learned afterward that hed died she had wondered if his wounds were worse than she knew i was a guest there one weekend simon he must have known marjoriethats the only reason hed have been asked to the party thats why i didnt want to tell you i knew youd jump to conclusions i let it drop but the rest of the way home to somerset my mind was busy inspector herbert had asked me if the face in the photograph was the man id seen in the railway station with marjorie evanson and id replied that he wasnt granted a good deal ot time had passed since that night but inspector herbert must have believed that i could still recognize him otherwise why send the photograph if there was some evidence i didnt know about why hadnt he said so something that pointed to lieutenant fordham something to show that the man at the station had had nothing to do with marjories death later that night yet hed asked if they were one and the same surely he wouldnt simply close the case now whatever evidence he had uncovered and never identify marjorie evansons lover yes lieutenant fordham had taken his own life there could be no trial the matter could be hushed up and the familys good name protected but what about justice for marjorie and her good name the silence keeping the facts of the lieutenants death out of the press adjourning the inquestit all made a certain sense whether i was comfortable with it or not after all it was her murderer scotland yard wanted it didnt matter about her private life if that private life had nothing to do with her death even if it had been responsible for her husbands suicide the police could wash their hands of the case that seemed so unfair to marjorie so unfair to her husband and to the families that grieved for them youve been quiet are you all right simon was asking as we came down the street and could see the house gates just ahead a little tired thats all thinking that i must be remembering what id left behind in france he said if you need to talk to someone he left the rest unfinished i thanked him and then i was being welcomed with open arms there was no fatted calf there not being one handy for this occasion or any other but i was safe and at home it wasnt until after dinner that i found a moment to put through a call to scotland yard i only wanted to be reassured told that i was wrong about lieutenant fordham a constable at the other end identified himself and asked how he could help me i asked for inspector herbert your name please i gave it im sorry miss crawford inspector herbert isnt in at present when do you expect him to return i asked i cant say miss tonight tomorrow i cant say miss i waited for him to ask if there was a message but there was only silence i thanked him and put up the receiver then i went to find my mother for someone who had spent most of her married life following my father around the world she seemed to know half of england my father always explained that without any difficulty in the first place hed told me soon after wed returned to britain she needs to know anyone of importance with an eye to providing you with a suitable husband shocked id blurted ill find my own husband thank you im sure youll try hed replied doubtfully in the second place if youve never noticed it for yourself your mother has a winning way people flock to her wanting to be her friend ive never understood it to tell you the truth but ive found that fact helpful more times than ive chosen to tell her laughing id answered come to think of it youre right and lastly who will people think of the instant they suspect trouble is stalking them complete strangers mind you but theyll turn up on our doorstep seeking an audience with your mother for her advice i could clearly remember asking my mother when i was a child in india why there were always people at our door natives and europeans alike shed answered i never know my dear i think the wind blows my name to them and for days id watched and listened hoping to hear her name in the wind for myself at the moment knowing half of england was going to come in handy my father had gone out to walka habit left over from his days in the armyand my mother was reading in the small sitting room she used most often she looked up there you are i thought there was something on your mind i sensed it at dinner drawing up another chair she said is it france not france do you think mother you could arrange an introduction to someone who lives in or near little sefton in hampshire and what pray is in little sefton that takes you away just as youve walked in the door my suspicious mother wanted to know its where marjorie evanson grew up she repeated the name then said isnt she the woman who was found murdered in london not so very long ago she picked up her knitting in fact yes i knew her husband he died of a broken heart after she was found dead he had a long recovery ahead of him severe burns i expect he had nothing to live for after that he was devoted to her one of your wounded i see meddling again are you i tried a smile to see if it would help not so much meddling as trying to understand why the police havent made more progress or if they have why theyve kept it quiet most of us live in london peacefully we arent murdered in our beds or on the streets and tossed into the river i should hope not my mother said not losing a stitch your father has gone to great lengths to enlist mrs hennessey in his campaign to see you safe i had to laugh still i answered her i can take care of myself the words were no sooner out of my mouth than i had a flash of memory of the german pilot firing his machine gun and the bullets tearing up the earth toward me im quite sure marjorie evanson felt exactly the same she reminded me yes i began ready to argue the point then thought better of it the truth is i have a photograph of her i went on to explain how i had come into possession of it im not suregiven the circumstancesthat marjorie evansons family will want it any more than serena melton did i thought perhaps i should find out before i sent it and quite right my mother nodded tell me more about this man you saw at the station why do you think hes never come forward i have no way of knowing whether he has or not i rather think not but something happened recently that made me believe the police are looking in the wrong direction perhaps he has a good reason for not contacting the police thats to say if he knows theyre looking for him either hes married or hes in a position that would make an affair with a married woman bad for his reputation depend on my mother to reach the heart of the matter it doesnt speak well for him i agree are the police quite sure he had nothing to do with mrs evansons death she turned the heel of the stocking she was knitting then she looked up at me they felt it was possible but not likely i dont see how he could have managed it once they find him theyll know whether he met his ship on time or not has it occurred to you my dear that if youre the only person who can identify this man it might put you in some danger especially if he killed mrs evanson and even if he didnt i dont think its very likely that he even knows i exist i wouldnt be too sure about that if you saw him how can you be so certain he didnt see you standing there staring at the two of them he didnt look my way he was staring straight ahead but you were looking at mrs evanson a point well taken i said all the more reason to rid myself of this photograph as soon as may be and put the evansons out of my mind but i wasnt sure i could do that and so i added to ease some of the worry i could read in my mothers eyes he could be dead of course for all we know dont make excuses for him and scotland yard can find him without your help the thing is they have no name no photograph only my description i sighed its been long enough now i have a feeling mrs evansons murder will never be solved and i find that abominable he was my patienther husbandand that makes it personal yes you always did have an extraordinary sense of fair play for better or for worse well perhaps it would be wisest if i helped you and made certain you dont come to grief she sat there staring into space thinking i said nothing almost afraid that if i spoke she might change her mind finally she said do you remember dorothea mitchell she was a school chum of yours weve kept in touch all these years and ive met her in london a time or two for lunch ill have a word with her i was reminded of what my father had said in his second point about my mother that she won and kept friends easily and so it was that dorothea mitchellnow dorothea worthwas engaged to find someone in her own vast acquaintance who could provide an introduction into little sefton for me it didnt take her very long mrs worth knew someone in gloucester who had a friend in st albans whose younger sister happened to live in little sefton hampshire it was that simple armed with a letter from my mother i drove myself to little seftona good fourhour journeyand presented myself at the door of one alicia dalton id expected someone of my mothers age but the woman who answered my knock was only about ten years older than i was she was fair with blue eyes and her smile was warm miss crawford how nice to meet you do come in the house was stone with lovely windows and colorful flower beds that ran down the short drive to the gates inside it was cool with high ceilings and paneling in the hall stairs running up to one side and a passage to other rooms on the left ive been looking forward to your visit ever since my sister wrote to me she didnt tell me why you were so interested in little sefton but i was delighted to have your company even if only for a short while my husband just went back to france and ive been fighting tears and melancholy for two days im interested in marjorie evanson i told her truthfully i knew her husbandhe was one of my patients after his last crashand her death has been on my mind as well as his i thought perhaps it would help if i came here and tried to put the past to rest that wasnt the whole truth but it would do as a start i knew marjorie of course not wellshe was a rather private person even as a child but do come in youll want to settle yourself in your room and then we can sit in the garden and talk as she led the way upstairs she said over her shoulder youre in luck actually were having a garden party to raise money for children whose fathers have been killed ill take you around and introduce you to people she chattered all the way to my room which was down the passage to the left and when she opened the door i smiled the room was large and airy with windows looking out across the gardens toward the church that stood on a slight rise to the north the rooftops of cottages clustered around it the coverlet on the bed was a soft yellow with flowers embroidered in a circle in the center and the window curtains were cream with pale green ties how lovely i said im glad you like it its gareths sisters room shes in london awaiting the birth of her first child its a nervous time and she wanted to be near her doctors ill leave you to freshen up come down the stairs go to the second door on your left and ill have tea waiting i thanked her changed out of my traveling clothes and into a dress that was more comfortable in the afternoon heat then went down to find alicia she was in a small room with delicate french furnishings a very feminine room with walls painted a soft rose and trimmed in cream we were soon on firstname terms and i discovered that she was a fund of information about marjorie she has a sister you know victoria marjorie was always in her shadow a quiet girl who never fussed about anything tried hard to please and was never in trouble of any kind marjorie is younger than victoria oh no victoria was several years younger but youd never guess it really she was domineering from childhood always wanting her own way always making certain that no one forgot her i thought her quite bossy and said as much to marjorie one day when we were twelve she gave me her quiet little smile and said yes its simpler to give in than to fight theres peace at home when victoria is happy i told her that was arrant foolishness that victoria needed to learn her manners and her place but her father doted on her you seevictoria i meanand he thought her behavior was a mark of strong character in truth she was quite spoiled and marjorie always let her have her way at least while she was living at home but when marjorie went away to school and then to live with her aunt in london on her next visit here she surprised us all by telling victoria she was a bully publicly i laughed and what did victoria have to say about that she left in a huff vowing never to darken the door of any house where marjorie might be invited but it must have given her pause because marjorie and she were on better terms for a time does this aunt still live in london she died just after marjorie and meriwether were married theres a distant cousin helen calder but no other family that i know of i found myself wondering how serena melton lieutenant evansons sister and victoria marjories sister had got on like oil and water very likely they were both strongwilled women did the family approve of marjories marriage to meriwether evanson alicia refilled my cup as she answered it was a very good match i think mr garrison was pleased victoria wasnt all the same she was soon enjoying being the only child in the bosom of her family and until her fathers death she showed no interest in leaving home the garrison house was left to her did you know lieutenant evanson well i stayed with marjorie and meriwether in london for two weeks in the autumn of id seen gareth off to the france and i needed cheering up how did they get on it was a love match you know they were quite happy i think marjorie had hoped that she might have a child before very long but it never happened probably for the best with both parents dead now it was a very practical point of view but i thought perhaps alicia was convincing herself that it was just as well she had no children yet if victoria and marjorie hadnt got on id probably come here on a wildgoose chase still sudden death could change attitudes smooth over rifts as if shed read my thoughts alicia said i couldnt believe it when i heard that marjorie was murdered ive never known anyone who was murdered it was rather frightening i couldnt help but wonder how it had happened i mean no one walks up to you and says hallo ive just decided to kill you its hard to comprehend she shivered i said i expect there must have been a reason love hate fear greed passion some strong emotion that got out of hand they did say that her purse was missing it doesnt bear thinking ofkilled for a few pounds and then meriwether dying so soon afterward i saw serena melton at her brothers funeral and she was in such distress i heard her say to the rector its not fair you know for me to lose merry on her account meaning marjorie i thought it was a terrible thing to say but they were close serena and her brother i remember marjorie telling me once that their parents had died at a very young age and the two of them had depended on each other for support their guardian was not particularly good at dealing with distraught children and left them to their own devices a roof over their heads clothes on their backs food on their table and he felt his duty was more than satisfactorily done it explained serenas feelings for her brother serena and meriwether had been thrown together in a time of grief when there was quite simply no one else to comfort them it was a powerful tie i also understood why marjorie might not have turned to her own sister in her distress then where had she gone what about marjories mother how did she feel about her daughters shes dead alicias answer was short marjorie had been utterly alone no wonder she had been crying as if her heart were broken if anyone had a reason for suicide she did and yet shed been murdered the garden party the next day was held at the rectory and according to alicia it was a pale shadow of former days when food was plentiful and twothirds of the male population wasnt away fighting a war the food was makeshift the women were in black rather than the usual array of summer dresses bought or made for the occasion with matching hats to protect ones complexion and except for the rector the men were in uniform little sefton was small enough for everyone to know everyone and i was one of the handful of outsiders in their midst alicia and i walked across the green lawn to the booths set out on the grass their poles decorated with loops of flowers and bows of ribbons and bright fabrics people nodded to us as we passed and children ran about playing chased by excited dogs alicia was saying let me present you to rector stevens hes a lovely man do you play chess by any chance he quite fancies himself as the best player in hampshire not wanting to spend my afternoon in a chess match i hemmed and hummed a bit and alicia said well never mind one of the wounded is sure to oblige him i had seen far too many of those walking with canes arms in slings or even being wheeled in invalid chairs she began to point out people to me that woman in puce she was housemaid to marjories mother she puts up the best pickle relish in the county over there the one with red hairshe was a friend of marjories mother the list went on and then alicia stopped what is it i asked victoria is here id never have guessed it i owe the rectors wife a dozen brown eggs you had a wager on whether or not she was coming oh yes i was nearly certain that with everyone discussing poor marjories death she wouldnt wish to be here i looked at marjories sister she was about my height with fair hair and hazel eyes but her mouth unlike marjories more generous one was thin lipped and i found myself thinking that i shouldnt like to cross her a family resemblance was there all the same especially around the eyes but i wouldnt have picked victoria out on my own as marjories sister victoria turned away as we came nearer and the rector was engaged with an older man who was speaking earnestly to him alicia said thats mr hart a gentleman farmer he owns the largest farm in little sefton hes kind enough to send his workmen around to help with things like repairing chimneys or patching roofs or heavy lifting its a blessing with gareth in france she turned away to allow the two men a little privacy and that handsome devil sitting in the white elephant booththe one with his arm in bandageshas been breaking hearts since he arrived a few weeks ago hes staying with the harts their nephew i could see the man she spoke of an officer in the wiltshire regiment tall very fair a deep voice and a laugh that began in his chest and a smile that was devastatingly sweet but with a roving eye as well i watched him try his charm on a girl of perhaps fourteen who blushed to the roots of her hair then he switched his attention to her mother but she must have been used to it i heard her say oh behave yourself michael one would think you were the prince of wales the way you carry on he laughed and leaned across the booths counter to kiss her cheek dear mrs lucas if i ever marry anyone it will be you she nodded yes and what shall i tell henry when we elope henry must have been her husband because michael dropped his voice to a conspiratorial level and asked must we tell him he looked around come to think of it i havent seen him today his back again sadly yes hes gone to see a doctor in salisbury she moved on and he turned our way ah a new blossom in our garden he exclaimed seeing me and who is this pray he asked alicia alicia took me across to the booth presenting me bess crawford this is michael hart hes not to be trusted he bowed over my hand and welcomed me to the fete close to i could see the lines of strain around his mouth and the shadows in those wonderfully blue eyes how is your shoulder i asked never better but it was a lie ill be returning to the front by september they tell me how many surgeries have you had enough for a lifetime he replied tersely and then laughed to cover his lapse alicia left me there while she spoke to an elderly woman leaning heavily on a cane michael hart said do you need a white elephant he was pointing to oneliterallymade of porcelain it was quite charming and so i bought it and he wrapped it carefully before handing it to me i paid him and was about to turn away when he caught my hand in his good one and said in a low voice no dont go out of the corner of my eye i could see victoria bearing down on us and i stayed for the opportunity to meet her but when she realized that i had no intention of leaving even after my purchase was completed she veered away do you know her i asked interested to hear what he had to say i knew her sister he said in that same terse manner marjorie he was beckoning to a woman just coming up the grassy avenue mrs hampton would you mind the booth for a bit she came over to him and said at once do go and sit down michael you must be in terrible pain i thought someone was to assist you no one came he told her ill be back in half an hour take as long as you like she noticed the little box stuffed with coins and said i see youve done quite well i told the rectors wife you were the perfect one to sell our little treasures once more i began to turn away but michael took my arm and said stay with me chapter eight i did as he asked the debonair officer had vanished and there was perspiration on lieutenant harts face a tightness to his mouth id seen this happen with wounded men off parade so to speak they let down their guard and admitted that they were in pain we walked together along a short path that led to the side door of the rectory he reached for it out of habit but i was there first and held it for him inside it was cool and dim and i realized we were in a small plant room where secateurs and trowels baskets and pots lined the shelves on either side below were vases of all kinds a dry sink where plants could be repotted or divided held a vase of wilting blossoms here flower arrangements were made up or cuttings were prepared for setting out my escort led the way through the second door and into a wider passage then up a short flight of steps to a booklined room that was clearly the rectors study no one will think to look for us here he sank into a leather armchair to one side of the desk and closed his eyes i took the one opposite him after a moment he opened his eyes and said youre a good sport sister crawford thank you i smiled not at all is there anything i can bring you water a pillow im all right which i translated as dont fuss after a time as the pain eased he said i didnt know victoria would be here today i shouldnt be telling you this but i owe you some explanation victorias sister was killed some weeks ago victoria appears to think i know something about that she hounds me every time she sees me i couldnt deal with it today and do you know something hed closed his eyes again i dont make a habit of killing women which wasnt precisely an answer to my question youll hear about it soon enough if you stay in little sefton for very long he went on after a moment as if hed made up his mind marjorie evanson was murdered in london she was a friend of mine her sister is not i didnt know mrs evanson but i was in charge of the wounded when her husband lieutenant evanson was brought home with burns those marvelous eyes opened and seemed to spear me were you indeed a small world i liked merry you know the first time i met him i knew hed be right for marjorie alicia told me you were a nephew of the harts i often stayed with my aunt and uncle on school holidays my father was in the army and my parents were half a world away most of the time thats how i came to know marjorie she lived close by a sweet girl i liked her immensely i wasnt in love with her he added hastily but i liked her we played together as children and sometimes shed confide in me and i in her i think our two families are related somehowa distant this or that so we called each other cousin marjorie and i she had no brother and i had no sister it was a good relationship i believed him there was the ring of truth in his voice now i read something about her death did the police ever discover who had killed her i dont know that theyve made any progress at all although id had my suspicions that something was wrong had you about five or six months agoyou wont say anything to alicia about this will you i promised and he went on about five or six months ago late winter anyway her letters changed they were shorter and not as full of news distracted unlike her i put it down to worry about merryhis squadron had been posted to france and then the letters were fewer as if shed written out of duty when she remembered she owed me one did you see her after that he sat up as a clock somewhere in the house struck the hour i must return to the booth i dont know what possessed me to agree to man it i considered him friend or not cousin or not michael hart was very attractive but he wasnt the man id seen with marjorie evanson in london i was tempted to ask him if he knew lieutenant fordham but they were in the same regiment and simon had told me that the lieutenants death had been kept out of the newspapers instead i asked there might have been another man had you thought of that his eyes sharpened and an ugly twist reshaped his mouth what do you mean what have you heard i shrugged you suggested there was a change in her theres usually a reason for it perhaps there was something she didnt want to tell you or was afraid youd read between the lines in her letters he got up and swung around the room as if he were trying to find a way out of it like an animal pacing his cage at a zoo thats nonsense besides it doesnt explain her murder does it when i said nothing he went on as much to himself as to me i cant drive and im forbidden to take the train i need to go to london to talk to her friends there was a womens group she belonged to they met every week i asked my uncle to drive me there but he has his hands full with the farm just noweveryone is shorthanded i know thats true but still he took a deep breath its been weeks already what does victoria have to say surely marjorie confided in her she wouldnt tell me even if she knew the name of marjories killer she was an insufferable little beast always prying always tattling neither of us could abide her marjorie tried to make peace with her but confide in her never he considered me have a motorcar here do you yes i excellent you can drive me to london if you please ill start with the servants theyll talk to me i helped her choose most of them when she opened the house it was tempting but i said my family lives in somerset ill be going back there not to london how long have you known alicia he asked shrewdly you dont strike me as old friends ive known alicia for years and ive never seen you in little sefton before you said you knew meriwether did his sister send you here i wouldnt put it past her i told you the truth i brought lieutenant evanson back to england to laurel house he had a photograph of his wife and it was pinned to his tunic where i could see it every day he wouldnt let it out of his sight i couldnt help but see it i didnt tell him that it was even now in my valise at alicias house but i found myself adding i was told by matron that lieutenant evansons family didnt want it buried with him under his breath he swore with some feeling serenas doing very likely i think she felt as elder sister she ought to have a say in the woman evanson married shed introduced him to several friends of hers but nothing came of that i could hear people talking in the passage we should go out to the garden theyll be looking for you ive lost interest in the blasted white elephant booth it is for a good cause i reminded him id rather give them the money and be done with it thats charity suddenly he chuckled that same deep rumble that began in his chest before erupting into deep laughter youre an extraordinary woman sister crawford i think marjorie would have approved of you cradling his shoulder he added with resignation come along then but think about it wont you driving to london i mean we walked together out of the rectors study down the passage and back to the fete as we stepped out into the gardens alicia raised her eyebrows at the sight of us together and on the other side of the palm readers booth victoria was staring i could almost read their minds as they wondered how i had so successfully cornered the prince of wales behind me michael hart said just loud enough for me to hear him is this where you slap my face and walk away unable to stop myself i smiled broadly but michael had already slipped away and left me standing there alone the rector stepped into the breach and introduced himself welcoming me to little sefton and asking where i was from somerset i told him and then we played the social game of do you know we did indeed have a connection in common it seems that the chaplain of my fathers old regimentnow long since retired to grow roses and tomatoes in derbyshirehad been a friend of the rectors father and with those bona fides i was accepted into the bosom of little sefton the afternoon turned out to be lovely in every sense i found i was enjoying myself as the rector and alicia between them presented me to everyone i took my turn in the white elephant booth and even sold tickets for the little raffle michael was least in sight and i heard someone a woman say hes probably gone to have a lie down he told me that sister crawford had advised him to rest and take a little something for his pain my back was to the speakers and so i couldnt see who answered that remark i wonder if she knows that hes altogether too fond of that little something for the pain another womans voice just as i turned to see who it was i found myself almost facetoface with victoria i had wondered ifwhenshe might speak to me she had no way of knowing who i was but seeing me with michael had for some reason ruffled her feathers as if to prove it her first words were have you known michael very long approximately two hours i answered with a smile refusing to be drawn alicia told me she hadnt realized you were acquainted with him or she wouldnt have invited you to little sefton she doesnt care to be used in this way alicia had said nothing of the sort she knew why i was here how odd i replied it was she who introduced us she did mention that he was considered the exclusive property of someonevictoria i believe she was her face went beet red im victoria garrison and that man is of no interest to me im elizabeth crawford i went on are you by any chance related to marjorie evanson its clear to me that youve been reading the london papers who told you that garrison was her maiden name alicia of course our little scandal attracts all manner of curiosity seekers as a matter of fact i answered her serenely i was lieutenant evansons nurse while he was in hospital in france that stopped her cold but she recovered quickly did serena melton send you here to annoy me intrigued by the fact that both she and michael hart had leapt to that conclusion i hesitated a second too long she turned away then swung around again to face me well you can tell her for me that while a murder in the family is not something to cry from the rooftops a suicide is even worse and she walked off her shoulders stiff with anger i stood there thinking it was sad that two families had been torn apart by one act of violence rather than being brought together in common grief behind me mrs hart said quietly poor girl shes taken her sisters death hard they were never close perhaps she has come to regret that now i hadnt heard her come up behind me id have liked to disagree with her but said im sorry victoria takes after her father he was a hard man to like marjorie was more like her mother which is probably why mr garrison was fonder of victoria she shifted the course of the conversation alicia tells me youve come just for the weekend have you known each other long shes the friend of a friend who thought we might enjoy each others company i answered and we have i must say shes missed gareth terribly of course there are no children thats been a sorrow for both of them one might say early days but for the war one can only pray that gareth returns safely i fear for michael youre a nursing sister will that shoulder heal cleanly i dont know what theyve said to michael he puts up a good front and we try not to ask too many questions i do know he secretly dreads the possibility that he might lose his arm ive heard him cry out at night dreaming theyre taking it its too soon to judge these things i said the only hope i could offer not knowing the details of the case im surprised hes out of hospital but thats a good sign you know when was he wounded it was no more than a fortnight if that after dear marjorie was killed when the news came i said to my husband that i wondered if michael had got careless worrying over her death they kept him in hospital as long as they could but hes not one to be penned up he brooded too much we were happy to have him back and safe i remembered him pacing the rectors study hes no trouble at all she went on he can do everything for himself except dress but he wont take his morphine when he needs it he says fighting the pain is good for the constitution she smiled sadly she moved on to speak to a friend and i went to find alicia the garden party was coming to a close and she was helping to pack away the remnants of food from the stalls preparing to take them around to those who werent able to attend i volunteered to help and she and i crisscrossed little sefton answering questions at each door about who was at the affair and who was not and of course having to explain who i was and why i was here in little sefton along the way alicia pointed out the garrison house it was stone and unlike its neighbors was set well back from the road with lovely roses climbing almost to the windows of the first storey and a low wall around the front garden which was ablaze with blooms of every kind the hollyhocks just coming into their own tired and ready to put our feet upwith a little sherry alicia suggestedwe returned to her house but when we got there she discovered a letter from gareth had arrived in the post and she quickly excused herself to run up the stairs and read it in private there was a knock at the door before shed come down again and i went to answer it michael hart stood on the doorstep ive just been to see dr higgins he informed me lightly he says im fit enough for london if i dont drive carouse or chase unsuitable women how dull for you i responded but im not going directly to london im returning to my parents home in somerset he could see that i was on the point of refusing him and he said in quite another voice dont let me down bess crawford this is important to me and theres no one else surely theres someone in little sefton who would agree to drive you undoubtedly but the reasons why im so set on going would be common knowledge in the village even before wed cranked the motorcar let them believe ive taken a fancy to youthat my broken heart has finally begun to mend do you have a broken heart i asked curious there was a girl before the war one i liked very much she preferred someone else it was generally assumed i was devastated but the truth was i liked her i wasnt passionately in love with her was he talking about marjorie michael was glib in my opinion it could be the truth or it could be what he thought i wanted to hear but then it dawned on me that if he were not so handsome people might well see him differently and accept everything he said at face value if you go with me to somerset youll have to put up with the scrutiny of my family i dont as a rule bring young men home with me in fact i never had he sensed this and said you knew meriwether surely you must be curious about what happened to marjorie i dont mind if you are there when i talk to the staff or her friends lieutenant hart michael michael i have only so much leave one day thats all i ask let me think about it i said to be rid of him i could hear alicia coming down the stairs he must have heard her too he smiled at me and was gone the next day i went to the early service with alicia it was a gray morning and the small church was only half full as we took our places alicia said not many people here today im afraid but then most of them met you yesterday their curiosity is satisfied i smiled and said softly never mind ive enjoyed my visit alicia nodded yes so have i the organ wheezed into life in the dampness and i noted that neither michael nor victoria was present as we walked home i waited until we were out of earshot of everyone else and said to alicia ive been meaning to ask you did you know a lieutenant fordham did he come to little sefton do you know lieutenant fordham i dont believe ive ever met him and if he came to little sefton i was never aware of it i wondered if perhaps he was a friend of marjories i have no idea she answered but it was clear id inadvertently sparked her interest is there any reason i should have heard of him i was prepared for that question and smiled he died not long after marjorie and the same inspector was looking into his death as well as hers coincidence or connection did someone from scotland yard come to little sefton i never saw him but there was someone who came down he broke the news to victoria and asked about marjories solicitor and the like he spoke to constable tilmer and the rector as well then left but marjorie hadnt lived here for years so i expect he spent most of his time in london did he question michael hart he was in france at the time michael told me victoria believes theres something he knows about the murdershe keeps demanding that he tell her ive seen her corner him in the street and even in the churchyard that explains why hes taken to avoiding her what does she think that perhaps marjorie wrote something to michael she didnt know what was about to happen to her that doesnt make sense i hadnt considered letters when i didnt answer straightaway she turned to look at me it was robbery wasnt it marjories murder i dont think her purse has ever been found we had reached alicias house and as she lifted the latch she said michael has asked me at least twice to drive him to london he feels that he could learn something that the police missed or overlooked it seems so unlikely and im not comfortable driving gareths motorcar i told him so hes bound to ask you i think he feels helpless and needs to be doing something even if its a wild goose chase i didnt tell her he already had asked me twice im not going to london i said im returning to somerset but i was still thinking about letters he can be very persuasive she said doubtfully you dont know how close i came to giving in even against my better judgment and im used to the blandishments of wounded men i answered he wont sway me when i walked through the door in somerset with michael hart in tow it was worth any price to see my mothers eyes widen as i introduced him she was in the sitting room writing letters to her circle of correspondents and rose to meet us as i said mother may i present lieutenant michael hart hes on his way to london tomorrow and i offered to give him a lift since he cant drive himself this is a pleasant surprise my mother said recovering her manners in an instant will you be staying with us lieutenant hart ive already taken a room at the four doves he told her smiling indeed said the colonel sahib coming into the room behind us to be introduced in his turn do sit down my mother said hastily and rang for tea chapter nine michael was of course invited to dine with us and my father swept him off to the stables to see a new foal i went up to my room changing my clothes quickly and found my mother waiting for me as i came down again simon is coming to dine as well she informed me how cozy i replied my father and michael came in at that moment he said i met michaels father once in delhi he was there as part of a commission on its way to burma the earlier frost in the air had warmed almost to cordiality we had drinks in the drawing room and talked about the progress of the war and the garden party at little sefton we were just moving on to changes that the war had brought to london when simon brandon came in greeted me and shook hands with michael as he took his chair on the other side of my mother simon passed me an envelope this came for you earlier today i thanked him and shoved it into a pocket until i could read it but as we were going in to dinner simon falling back to walk beside me said in a low voice that came by special messenger from scotland yard i met him in the drive earlier as i was coming to borrow your mother for half an hour i let him go ahead of me turned to one side and tore open the envelope there was just a brief message inside and another photograph did you by chance see this man at the railway station on the day in question hes wanted for the killing of three women in oxford they were apparently accosted on the street then followed home the previous victims were shopgirls he escaped the police and may have traveled to london its possible he saw mrs evanson just as you did inspector herbert dismayed i read the message again was it possible theyd found marjorie evansons murderer i turned quickly to look into the face of a man i was sure id never seen before it was an older photograph and i recognized the background the gates of one of the colleges in oxford he appeared to be of medium height neither fat nor lean with a long face that was too ordinary to draw attention he had what looked to be light brown hair and dark eyes and a mouth that was too small he could have been a shop clerk or a lorry driver or the man sitting across the way in an omnibus i stared at the photograph for a moment searching my memory and then i went to the telephone and put in a call to london and scotland yard inspector herbert was not available but i left a message for him telling him that i hadnt seen the man in the photograph but as i went in to dinner i thought how easily he could come up behind someone on a rainy street and not even turn a head everyone was waiting for me in the dining room and i apologized for the delay without explaining why it was necessary as michael and my parents carried the burden of conversation i was silent thinking about the dead shopgirls and whether marjorie evanson blindly walking out of the station into the rain might have attracted the notice of someone like the man in the photograph it could have happened that way he could have followed her but there were a good four or five hours between the time marjorie evanson was at the railway station and the time shed died inspector herbert had said as much himself was he clutching at straws id have liked to ask michael what he thought but it would be difficult to explain a communication from scotland yard without confessing how id been drawn into the case i happened to look up as the chutney was passed to me and i met simon brandons dark eyes watching me speculatively and it was simon who volunteered to drive michael back to the four doves when they had gone my mother said to me my dear do you know what youre doing im only taking michael to london to speak to the staff at marjorie evansons house he wants to hear about that morning before she left the house or if something was worrying her but surely the police i shook my head of course they must have done but consider if the police came here would lois or timmy or anyone else who worked for us tell them things they believed we might not want the police to know for whatever reason id expect them to tell the truth and they probably would if you were innocent and the truth would help but if you were guilty of some indiscretion and they knew that if they told the police it would ruin your reputation what then she was fair she was always fair and so michael hart hopes they will confide in him charming he may be but their first loyalty will still be to their mistress dont you think hes healing he needs to focus all his energy on that and instead i think marjorie evansons death is weighing heavily on his mind if he learns nothing of importance hell still be satisfied that he did all he could for her and if he does discover something then he can take it to the police that would be the wisest move was he in love with her do you think that would explain his resolve he was in france when she was killed and wasnt eligible for compassionate leaveshe wasnt his wife or mother yes i see what you mean this is the least he can do for her my mother usually did see i kissed her good night then and went into the passage toward the stairs simon brandon was waiting for me in the shadows by the door he took my arm opened the door and led me out into the warm summer night the sun had not yet set and the distant horizon was a lovely illusive opal that turned the tops of the trees to a soft gold a jackdaw sitting in the top of the nearest tree was singing to it his breast a shimmering black like wet paint i walked a little way down the drive knowing what was coming listening to the crunch of stones under my shoes finally he said how well do you know this man i dont but hes trying to find out what happened to his childhood friend and to do that he wants to go to london you can see for yourself he cant drive i promisedsince i was going to london anywaythat id take him when he said nothing i added i didnt suggest that he stay here nor did he were you going to london anyway iin the long run simon i saw the man with marjorie evanson the night she was killed he got on the train and left her there now the yard thinks she might have been the victim of a man who fled oxford after three women were killed there they were interested in lieutenant fordham before him the yard doesnt seem to be making any progress at all and the only person who might answer their questions about where she intended to go after leaving the station is either dead or refusing to come forward if michael hart can learn anything useful its all to the good if he doesnt hes done no harm i understand why you feel you have a responsibility to this woman he began i saw how desperate she was that night where did she turn perhaps she trusted the wrong person i reached into my pocket and pulled out the message from scotland yard you see inspector herbert has been using what i know to help him sort through suspects im not involved not officially but he can send me a photograph and ask me a question he was staring up at the jackdaw this isnt the first time the yard has asked you for information how many photographs have you looked at for them only these two stay out of it bess you know what nearly happened the last time you got yourself involved in the troubles of another family leave this one alone its michael hart who is involved at the moment he turned to look at me theres something you ought to know the colonel has already spoken to me and i have my own suspicions michael hart may not be what he seems what do you mean did you know him before this ive never seen him before but i wouldnt be surprised if hes become addicted to the medicines his doctors have been giving him to control his pain when i took him back to the inn just now his hands were shaking and his mouth was dry youre a nurse be more observant and think what it is you may be getting yourself into im not getting myself into anything i told him furious at the lecture i dont intend to marry michael hart im only driving him to london besides fatigue and pain could cause the same symptoms simon grinned indeed good night bess and he walked away down the drive leaving me there to look after him torn between calling him back to tell him what i thought of his interference in my life and letting him go as i turned toward the house i remembered what mrs hart had said about michael hart that he had refused sedation and was fighting his own way through the pain but had my father been suspicious or had simon simply brought him into the conversation to back up his own views i walked in the door shut it and continued down the passage to the study where my father was sitting with a book open in his lap good night i said i hope to get an early start tomorrow be safe bess he said but he didnt smile as he usually did when wishing me a safe journey i said thank you for being kind to michael hart i remember when i broke my arm last year how frustrating it was for me being dependent and helpless hes strikingly handsome my father said finally smiling but i wouldnt introduce him to any of your flatmates hes being ridden by his own devils drugs i asked baldly i dont know what his devils are hes very amusing he answers questions openly and apparently truthfully and he doesnt trade on his charm but theres something behind the bonhomie that gives him no peace it isnt your place to put that right as i told simon i said im just driving him to london not marrying him see that you remember that he said and turned his attention to his book good night bess i took my dismissal with the best grace i could muster and went up to pack snapping my valise closed i found myself wondering if i had completely trusted michael hart even before simon had made his remarks on the whole i thought i did i couldnt have said why except that he hadnt turned the full force of his charm on my mother the next morning i retrieved michael hart from the four doves and drove both of us to london he asked me where the four doves hotel had got its name for the sign showed only four gray doves the house that once stood there was the pilgrimage guesthouse of a convent that had already fallen into ruin by the time of henry viii the last of the nunsfour of themwere very old and had come to live in the guesthouse because there was nowhere else for them to go but they still kept it open for travelers in the care of a man they trusted when henrys men stopped there on their way to burn out the abbot of glastonbury they remembered that the house had once belonged to a convent and they asked the manservant if there were any nuns still there he told the soldiers that the only females he knew of were four doves in the ancient dovecote in the garden henrys men decided they would have the doves for their dinner the servant was in great distress because the dovecote had been empty for years and that was where hed hidden the nuns he went out there sick with fright and told the nuns what hed done they said but didnt you know there are four doves here roosting for the night and when the manservant lifted his lantern he saw that they were right he served henrys men their dinner and sent them on their way and ever after there were always four doves in the cote and the elderly nuns lived out their lives in peace michael was silent for a moment then he said its too bad life doesnt have such happy endings i replied here is what i know about marjorie evanson she had a sister but often there was no love lost between the two of them her parents are dead but victoria was her fathers favorite and he appeared to spoil her marjorie went away to school and never really came back to little sefton she married meriwether evanson and her father seemed to make no objection to the match while lieutenant evanson was in france marjorie must have taken a lover because she was pregnant when she died i could have bitten my tongue i didnt know that he said his voice strained is it true yes it was discovered in the postmortem it wasnt made public that would explain why meriwether killed himself wouldnt it hed known he wasnt the father he thought about that for a moment and does anyone know who this man might be he still hadnt got full control of his voice hes a mystery the police asked anyone who had seen marjorie the day of her death to come forward and he never has now i understand why serena melton asked that the funeral for her brother be private and why he and marjorie werent buried together neither victoria nor i were invited to the service but she went anyway and the meltons didnt attend the service for marjorie that caused talk i can tell you but most people accepted the fact that they were still in mourning he cleared his throat angry with himself i didnt know it seemed vengeful to me you couldnt have known id thought it was because marjorie was murdered as if that had been her fault murder doesnt happen in nice families i quoted he said something under his breath the words whipped away by the wind as we drove east toward london i had a suspicion he was swearing serena melton do you know her very well not well at all we met at the wedding and at a party or two in london after that i didnt like her very much mainly because she didnt seem to care for marjorie merry was all right and jack serenas husband who could have been marjories lover someone she knew a stranger she happened to meet on a train or in a restaurant or at a party i dont know i told you she changed her letters changed yes all right i was in france and its difficult writing very personal things that the censors will read before the person at the other end does but i hadnt thoughti dont know what i thought he ended its hard knowing your husband could be shot down any day he flies i thought that might have put strains on marjories marriage that she was afraid to love him too much we drove in silence for a time then michael said easing his injured shoulder she was in love with meriwether a blind man could have seen that i dont know what could have gone wrong he crashed twice he was badly burned the second time it must have been frightful to realize that the man you knew and married was so disfigured that you might not even recognize him she could have turned to someone for sympathy and his kindness made her vulnerable she had only to sleep with him once she neednt have loved him or he her in some way thats worse michael hart turned to look at me you seem to know what she was feeling how such things happen its not surprising i told him ive dealt with soldiers of every rank ive written their letters home and ive read them their letters from home marjorie wasnt alone in her fall from grace three years of war had had other costs besides the long lists of dead and wounded i think its time you told me the truth were you in love with marjorie garrison he wiped his good hand over his face as if to conceal the agony there god help me i was we said nothing more for the rest of the journey we were coming into london when michael roused himself and said i havent been very good company have i i was thinking marjories house was also her husbands home youve been assuming that the staff would speak freely to you but what if they wont out of loyalty to him as well as to her ive considered that too but it was marjorie in troublemarjorie who was murdered i dont think victoria came here to question the staff i dont know that she cared enough she would have left that to the police as for serena she sent her husband to box up meriwethers belongings she never even told them merry died she left that to the family solicitor how did you know this i telephoned the house as soon as i came to stay with my aunt and uncle i wanted to know about marjories things what was to happen to them i suddenly remembered alicias remark about letters why is the house still open if both marjorie and her husband are dead i cant answer that but i rather think victoria and serena are squabbling over it and until that is settled its being run as if evanson and his wife are expected to return fully staffed i was surprised as fully as any house can be staffed today theyre paid to the end of the quarter anyway but if marjorie died first and then lieutenant evanson died i dont understand the problem if she willed everything to him then all their property was his to dispose of and so serena must now be the owner of the house its not that simple marjorie inherited the house you see it was in her mothers family and her mothers sisterher auntlived there until her death marjorie could have wished it to stay in the family weaving through traffic i said it takes time to settle affairs but i understand now why you were so intent on coming here london was crowded men in uniform looking for places to stay families coming to see loved ones off to france or hoping to meet them on leave everyone demanding a room and no rooms to be had but michael found one he walked into the marlborough not far from claridges and came out again in a quarter of an hour saying a room for four nights i doubt ill be here that long but a bird in hand is wisest i wondered how he managed it but i had no intention of asking hesitating unsure how to put my question i said can you cope with one arm strapped to your body well enough its awkward as hell but i can do up buttons on my own comb my hair shave and even brush my teeth what i cant do are laces but theyll send someone up im not the worst case theyve come across i nodded told him to be ready the next morning at nine and left him and his suitcase to the tender mercies of the ancient doorman chapter ten when i reached the flat diana and mary were there eager for news then diana was off to make her train in time and mary said youre braver than i am bess to do what youre doing for a woman you dont know it will be ages before you have another leave like this dont waste it chasing shadows but i did know marjorie in a sense that was the problem id watched her photograph give her husband hope and then id seen her in person unaware of why she was crying or who the man was but a witness to such wretchedness that she couldnt hold back her tears even in this very public place and whatever she had done she hadnt deserved to be stabbed and thrown into the river to drown unconscious and unable to help herself i could still see her rush away into that sea of umbrellas and if id had any idea what lay ahead id have found her somehow and brought her back to the flat with me i dont know how i could have solved the problems she was facing but id have tried that was hindsight and i couldnt dwell on it yet in a way i was i met michael hart at nine oclock the next morning as promised he was waiting for me on the steps of the hotel when i drove up and he directed me to the evanson house in madison street it was tall three stories with two steps up to a pair of ionic columns supporting the portico roof curved railings to either side graced the steps and above the porch was a balcony with a white balustrade i lifted the knocker wrapped with black crepe and let it fall smiling at michael hart to cover the trepidation we both suddenly felt no one answered the summons and then out of the corner of my eye i saw the flick of a drapery as someone peeked out it was quickly pulled to again after a moment a middleaged woman in the black dress of a housekeeper opened the door apologizing profusely to michael mr michael im so sorry sir truly i am but weve been besieged by newspaper people and curiosity seekers there was a woman here a fortnight past swearing she could find the murderer for us if she could come into the house and touch something belonging to the dead that was the last straw i shut the door in her face and we decided that we wouldnt open it again to anyone she was ushering us into the small square hall and then into a drawing room decorated in pale green and cream urging us to be seated how are you sir we heard about that shoulder you must have been in great pain i dont see how you can bear it even now i saw michaels mouth twist in the beginning of a grimace and then he smiled and said i try not to think about it mrs white this is sister crawford my nurse she agreed to accompany me to london im not yet well enough to travel on my own mrs white made polite noises in my direction clearly relieved that i represented nothing more than michaels nurse i understand mr michael truly i do my grandson just came home with half his foot shot off he cant bear to put it to the floor yet changing the subject he said i dont know whats happening mrs white i know marjorie is dead that she was murdered victoria hardly speaks to me and she wont tell me what progress the police are making this is the first time ive been able to come up to london i want to find out anything i can that will help there was an inquest sir i was there and horrible hearing it was mrs evansons death was put down to person or persons unknown and left open for the police to pursue their inquiries but i dont think they have any they came here after her poor body was found and searched the house for evidence but i dont know what they was hoping to find and then the solicitor mr blake came to look for her will and he left emptyhanded as well i told him shed been speaking of changing it but i doubted anything had come of it he knew nothing about that the police came again asking us more questions about her state of mind who might have called at the house who she might have gone out to meet i gave him the best answers i could but i really didnt know much she wasnt herself these past months how so she had one of her meetings here of the ladies with husbands who fly those aircraftfebruary i believe it was and it upset her they talked about such terrible things mr michael i heard them discussing how burned flesh feels when you touch it and what its like to lose fingers or toes to fire and the like one of the women arrived in tears and i think her husband had just been reported dead burned alive in his sopwith i felt a shudder remembering the pilot of the albatross going down in flames as angry and frightened as id been at the time he too had a family somewhere grieving for him before michael could ask another question mrs white was saying earnestly mrs evanson cried herself to sleep that night i could see how red her eyes were the next morning she went out in late afternoon and although shed told me shed be at home for dinner and there would be no guests she didnt come in until close on to ten oclock and that wasnt like her to stay out with no word but i smelled cigarette smoke on her coat as i put it away and helped her get herself into bed and she didnt tell me anything usually it was oh i ran into such and such a one and we decided to have dinner together and tell me what shed had to eat and how dreary the menu was or how bad the service or how kind the waiter had been when she couldnt even cut her meat with a knife it was so toughshe was lonely she missed the lieutenant something fierce and i was there to listen if i could but it all stopped that night i thought she must have been angry with me a woman beginning an affair or one caught up in an emotional tangle and turning to the first sympathetic ear and then having to be secretive unable to speak freely and so falling back on silence that gave me an interesting time frame february her husband was in france just joining a new squadron his first and last crashes in the future id been told that lieutenant evanson was a very good pilot with quick reflexes an understanding of the machines he flew and the good sense to know when to fight and when to run most of the young green pilots joining a squadron had to be restrained from trying to be heroes before they had even learned the rules of engagement with the very welltrained german fliers and often they died in their first encounters with the enemy too easily tricked into doing something rash that exposed them to a sure shot the germans liked to hunt in packs lurking where they couldnt be seen but ready to come in for the kill when the opportunity arose michael was asking if any of the other staff had found mrs evanson more willing to talk about her days and evenings nanyou remember her sir shes from little sefton mrs evanson brought her to london with hershe remarked to me that mrs evanson was quieter and later she told me she thought she was worried that she cried in the night we put that down to the lieutenants first crash but he walked away from that one still it must have frightened her to know how close he came to dying then did she bring any strangers to the house thats to say women or men you didnt recognize someone she hadnt known before merry went to france she didnt no except of course for the ladies whose husbands flew that changed from week to week it seemed but one of her friends mrs daly stopped by and as i showed her into the drawing room here i heard her exclaiming marjorie at last i havent seen you for ages come and dine with us tomorrow night but i dont think mrs evanson went i didnt help her dress for such a dinner no letters from strangers no messages noflowers or the like you mean was there a man hanging about i was beginning to wonder myself when she paid particular attention to how she looked and then she was at home nearly all the time morning noon and night refusing all invitations and sometimes not leaving her room until late in the afternoon whats more she wasnt eating properly skipping a meal saying she wasnt hungry and would take only a cup of soup the day shedied i asked what happened that day she turned to me as if she hadnt expected me to have a voice miss she shot a quick glance at michael and he must have nodded because she answered still looking at him as if hed asked the question the police wanted to know as well she was unsettled in the night mrs hall the cook came down to start the morning fires and she found mrs evanson in the kitchen her eyes red and she said shed been horribly sick before dawn could mrs hall make her a cup of tea as soon as the fires were going mrs hall got her the tea and a pinch of salt to put on the back of her tongue to stop the nausea and she went back to bed but later she got up dressed and went out she said she had a train to meet she didnt come home and we thought perhaps shed met the train and stayed with the friend she was expecting i thought she looked very upset to be meeting a friend but we supposed it was someone from her womens group who had had bad news and no messages came for her no one stopped here looking for her there was the note before she left brought round by messenger did she read it i asked for the first time feeling that we were making progress i dont know if she did or not miss she put it in her purse because she was in something of a hurry and her purse had never been found i asked remembering serena meltons lie was she wearing any special jewelry when she left that day a brooch or a bracelet a fine ring something that might tempt a desperate man to rob her of late she hadnt worn much in the way of nice pieces of jewelry mrs white answered id have noticed if she had we stayed another half hour speaking to mrs white for a little longer and then to nan and another maid and finally to mrs hall the cook and the scullery maid who helped her mrs hall told us that if she hadnt known better shed have guessed mrs evanson was in the family way shed been so ill in the night but of course the cuts of meat the butchers boy brings us these days you never know whether theyve turned or not was anyone else ill that night michael asked her no sir just mrs evanson no one could tell us who had been on that train id have given much for a name to hand over to the yard michael thanked them all for their care of their mistress and promised to see they were given good references when a decision was made about the house i could see that they were grateful and relieved outside we found the day had turned from early sunshine to clouds that seemed to hang over the city and hold in the heat like a wet blanket i was grateful for my motorcar rather than trying to find a cab take me back to the hotel michael said abruptly in as dark a mood as the day i nodded cranking the motorcar and driving us to the marlborough as the man at the door helped him to descend michael said find a place to leave this thing will you and come in ill be in the lobby with some misgivings i did as hed asked and when i got there hed found a table in one corner of the lounge quiet and private and had already organized tea for us as i sat down michael said his voice low and angry if she had to turn to someone why not me you were in france i pointed out yes damn the french and their war we wouldnt have been drawn into it save for them i couldnt point out that it was the belgians we had come into the fighting to save he wasnt interested in logic he was looking for somewhere to lay the blame i dont think she really loved him i began but he gave me such an angry look that i broke off do you think it makes me feel any better to know that she picked someone she didnt love to give her comfort i didnt mean it that way michael and you know it i think she was usedthat she was vulnerable and unhappy and whoever it was saw that and took advantage of it dont make excuses for her i stopped trying to talk to him and lifted the lid of the teapot it had brewed long enough and i filled our cups i didnt really want tea but it gave me something to do with my hands while he mourned for a love hed never really had except in his own heart after a time i asked what would you have done if shed come to you michael no dont bite my head off im trying to think this through he glared at me all the same but after taking a deep breath he said id have tried to comfort her id have offered her a friendly shoulder to cry on and fought down whatever feelings i had so that she wouldnt know id have taken her somewhere quiet for dinner and talked to her tried to make her see that she couldnt do anything about her problem except cry it out then face it and id have stood behind her whatever it was until she was all right again she wouldnt have wound up in my bed i wouldnt have done that to her or to meriwether but someone must have done perhaps not that first night but on another its what must have happened and she might not have foreseen where it was leading or she might have seen it and needed that reassurance that she was loved and wanted swept away on a tide of feeling that as soon as it passed would leave her hurt and ashamed and possibly pregnant i knew of three nursing sisters who after a very difficult time in france came home with nightmares and an emotional void that led them in the end to turn to someone to reaffirm that life went on a love affair a foolish liaison and sometimes slashed wrists had been the outcome and all three had returned to france chastened and quiet there was often no real outlet for shattered nerves except the courage to see them through alone michael was saying i still find it hard to believe not marjorie youve seen her differently thats all and part of it is what you wanted to find in her only marjorie evanson could really know marjorie i need a drink he retorted not this damned tea no you dont are you going to fail marjorie as well did she disappoint your expectations and so youre going to walk away angry and hurt because she wasnt as strong as youd have liked her to be damn you you see things too clearly he said almost turning on me but then he settled back in his chair you have a point im no better than anyone else am i its not marjorie that im crying over right now its my own hurt a very real hurt but it wont help us to find out who killed her no but when we do find out im not going to the police they can have him when ive finished with him i left michael sitting there and walked out of the hotel coming down the steps i looked up in time to see two men in quiet conversation on the pavement not ten feet from me they shook hands and the older man the one facing me touched his hat politely as he was about to enter the marlborough the other moved on i had seen only his back but i had a feeling i knew him i had already taken a half dozen steps in the opposite direction when i realized that the other man must be jack melton i turned and went after him calling to him a very forward thing to domy mother would have been appalledbut i wanted very badly to speak to him he swung around frowned at me and then said miss crawford in a very cool tone of voice as he removed his hat and stood waiting impatiently for me to explain myself im so sorry i said lying through my teethi was no such thing do you have a moment im late for a meetingbut yes i have a moment it would have been better to return to the hotel but michael hart might well still be in the lounge just off reception i said rather too quickly i made no mention of it when i was a guest in your home i thought it out of place to bring it up so publicly but i think you should know that i saw your sisterinlaw marjorie evanson the evening she was killed perhaps this will help you narrow the search before your wife i broke off his face lost all expression smoothing into flat planes of light and shadow without any emotion indeed the police never said anything to me about this you were with her he left it there waiting no i saw her id just come in on the train from hampshire she was standing directly in my path i hesitated she was crying terribly upset i couldnt help but notice and there was a man with her he boarded the train and she walked away alone i lost her in the rain and the crowds i never saw her again how could you possibly have recognized mrs evanson his voice was cold now and very hard what is it you want young woman is this an attempt at blackmail i was so angry i stared at him speechless then i found my voice commander melton i said in the tones of a ward sister dealing with an unruly patient i didnt wish to distress mrs melton while i was at melton hall but i nursed lieutenant evanson in france and had just accompanied him and other patients to laurel house the day mrs evanson was killed your sisterinlaws photograph was with him day and night id also seen it not half an hour before taking the train to london i couldnt possibly have mistaken his wifes face even in such distress he had the grace to look ashamed imsorry this has been a terrible business and my wife is still grieving for her brother we have both been under considerable strain he broke off aware he was running on then he asked tightly did you also recognize the man with her please tell me who he was im afraid not he was an officer in the wiltshire fusiliers and i have a good memory for faces i believe id know him if i saw him again he digested that and have you spoken to the police of course and i told them what id believed at the time that she was distraught enough to have done herself a harm instead she was murdered i cant help but wonder why she was in such great distress surely that was obvious she was saying goodbye to her lover who else could it have been there was contempt in his voice i dont know i told him weve all assumed i realized then that there could be another reason for the officers coldness perhaps he was sent to offer her promises or more likely considering her distress to tell her she couldnt rely on the other man rather cowardly of him if thats true to send an emissary and what sort of man would be willing to take on such an onerous duty even for a friend i liked marjorie he admitted after a moment if she had turned to me id have quietly found a way to help her even though i disapproved of what shed done but she didnt ive had to watch my wife suffer through the shock of her death and then meriwethers death just now i find it hard to feel any sympathy for marjories despair whatever happened on that railway platform that person bears some responsibility for marjories death if it hadnt been for him shed have been at home out of danger my voice trailed off as i looked up at the entrance to the marlborough at that moment michael hart was standing there glaring at me he couldnt have overheard what id been saying not at the distance between us could he jack melton followed my gaze in time to see michael hart turning away walking stiffly back into the hotel serenas husband looked from his departing back to my face then he said sharply if you want to know who marjorie could have turned to theres your man and he started to walk away he was in france i said stopping mr melton with an outstretched hand out of reach who else was he out of reach melton asked i would have sworn he was in england and he was gone leaving me there in the middle of the pavement in the path of those passing by by the time id collected myself and gone back up the hotel steps and into the lounge there was no sign of michael hart i asked reception to page him for me and then to send someone to his room but he was nowhere to be found at the flat mary was washing up the last of the dishes i went to my room murmuring something about letters to finish and instead sat by the window thinking about what jack melton had just said about lieutenant hart truth or lies but why should he lie id seen the fleeting expression in his eyes when he recognized michael hart at the top of the hotels steps antipathy certainly anger as well but was the anger directed at michael or what jack and id been discussing impossible to know the answer still id made a mistake talking to him about marjorie but id heard his attempts to rein in serenas vehement emotions and id believed we might discuss marjorie evansons last hours and look for something anything that could lead us to the truth i remember my mother telling me as a child bess my dear you cant always expect others to see things as clearly as you do i didnt always remember that lesson id failed to take into account that the man was also a husband but id learned something in the encounter with jack melton marjorie must have met that train with high hopes that she could share the burden she was carrying and she walked out of the railway station knowing that there was no help in that direction whether the officer shed met was her lover or someone she thought she could trust whats more her husband had just returned to england and she must have felt the pressure of time catching up with her she might not have known the exact date but she would have known from meriwethers letters that it would be soon and if she was three months pregnant it would be increasingly difficult to hide the fact something had to be done was she considering ridding herself of the child finding a place for it with another family but that would mean leaving her husband for six months while she hid herself away somewhere and it would very likely destroy her marriage did she expect the father of her child to marry her if she were divorced by her own husband did she love him at all impossible to know but that rejection as the train pulled out most certainly sharpened her need to find help somewhere but if she had known that michael was in london i caught up my hat and purse and with barely a word of explanation to mary went down to my motorcar marjories housekeeper wasnt happy to see me again it struck me that she thought i was meddling behind michaels back weve told lieutenant hart all we could she began yes of course you did i answered quickly before she could shut the door in my face he forgot to ask if you could give him the names of one or two of her closest friends ive come alone because he needed to rest is he in terrible pain she asked sympathetically there were new lines in his face i dont remember them being there before he was never one to take life seriously always a smile she stood aside and i stepped into the entrance he tries not to be dependent on drugs it was what his aunt had told me thats good to hear there was a footman once when i was a girl he was addicted to opium mr bensonhe was the owner of the house where i was maidlocked the poor man in his room for a week to cure him i never heard such screams and cries begging to die one minute and cursing us all in the next breath we thought surely hed die it must have been terrifying she took a deep breath as if shoving the footman back into the past where he belonged i wondered if shed had a fondness for him once names you said at a guess her two closest friends were mrs calder and mrs brighton mrs brighton lives one street over at number ive returned a book mrs evanson borrowed thats how i know perhaps she can tell you how to find mrs calder calder i knew that name a distant cousin was this the same woman and the ladies who attended the group meetings for wives and widows were they close to mrs evanson they came and went you see there was no time to make real friendships i could understand that thank you i told her this is a beginning i left my motorcar where it was and walked the distance but there was black crepe on the door of number encircling the knocker the folds were still crisp and new i hesitated and then lifted the knocker anyway and a redeyed maid came to the door she said immediately mrs brighton isnt receiving if you care to leave your card im so very sorry to intrude i said and prepared to turn away then i asked ive just come to london from somerset i was to meet mrs calder herei didnt know i gestured to the black crepe she must have tried to reach me and i missed her message do you know how i could find her im afraid i left my diary in the hotel a shot in the dark but it found its mark she called only this morning the maid said and gave me what i wanted before she quietly shut the door again i drove to hamilton place and found the house i was looking for at the corner of its tiny square as i got out i stood to one side as a nurse wheeled a wounded man along the pavement he was in a chair his eyes bandaged one arm in a sling a leg missing i smiled at the sister and then went up to knock at the door mrs calder was in i was shown into a small sitting room and she rose to meet me a query in her glance she was a tall woman rail thin with fair hair and blue eyes i introduced myself as a friend of the evanson family and she frowned indeed i dont recall meeting you at marjories she said suspicion in her tone im not surprised i said easily ive been out of the country her eyes dropped to my uniform i was one of lieutenant evansons nurses you know hes dead sadly yes matron told me on my last visit to laurel house what brings you to see me i was in little sefton only a few days ago i understood from alicia dalton that youre related to marjorie evanson she was still wary i searched for a way to convince her i meant no harm it seems to me that very little progress has been made in finding out who killed mrs evanson and it matters to me because her husband died when he shouldnt have not medically hed passed the crisis he was counting on seeing his wife as soon as possible someone took that away from him i dont want her murderer to escape justice but why come to me you should be speaking to victoria garrison marjories sister if it was a test i was ready for it with respect i dont believe i should we had words in little sefton she thought serena melton had sent me there to spy and were you no helen calder sighed theres no love lost between them a pity but there you are even tragedy failed to bring them together theres more i have reason to believe that marjorie had met someone perhaps six months ago its possible ive seen this man i dont know his name but she met him at waterloo station the night she died i happened to be coming up from laurel house and it was sheer coincidence that our paths crossed marjorie had a good many friends it could have been any one of them she was so distressed crying in fact i dont think that was like her do you after a moment she said no she wouldnt have made a scene not marjorie but im afraid i cant help you it would beprying and shes dead this polite conspiracy of silence is all very well and good i pointed out a little angry with her but i think marjorie would approve of a little prying if it meant her killer was found out helen calder studied my face for a moment and then nodded youre absolutely right you know weve all taken such pride in closing ranks to protect her memory i never considered the fact that we were protecting her murderer as well but you see people do ask about her death and ive gotten quite good at fending off gossipmongers heaven knows there have been enough of them but even if i answer your questions what possible good will it do i myself stepped forward when there was a notice in the newspapers asking for any information about mrs evanson on that last day of her life i met with an inspector herbert at scotland yard it was not as difficult as id expected i smiled sadly i dont think what i told him about seeing her at the railway station was very useful but it did fill in a part of their picture about her movements after leaving her home earlier in the day she said yes all right there was a man i dont how she came to meet him she told me he was in london just for the day and they talked for a bit and then he asked her to join him for dinner i know this because marjorie mentioned it casually in another context that it brought home to her just how much she missed meriwether and the things they often did together it pointed up her loneliness she said and she was left to face that i shant do that again she told me its too painful did she tell you the mans name no and i really didnt care to ask i didnt want to make more of the event than she already had done i was hoping it would come to nothing but she saw him again she must have done i met her coming out of a milliners shop with a hatbox in her hand she greeted me sheepishly as if she hadnt wanted to run into anyone she knew i was about to tease her when it occurred to me that perhaps she was dining with that man again there was almost a schoolgirls furtiveness about her can you be sure it was the same man i must believe it was marjorie wasnt the sort to take up with strangers and it was no more than a month after the first dinner what happened next it was almost a month latertwo months after that first dinnerand she was standing waiting for a cab and i saw shed been crying my first thought was that shed had bad news about meriwether and she answered that shed had a letter from him only the day before and he was all right she shook her head looking back i wonder if shed broken off with this man it was the last time i saw hershe began to refuse invitations keeping to herself after that there was this group of women she worked with i told myself at the time that listening to their experiences was doing her more harm than good i should have made an effort to see her but i had my own worries and i kept putting it off to tell you the truth i thought she might feel compelled to confess and i didnt want to know do you perhaps know of a lieutenant fordham i asked mrs calder frowned ought i to know him do you think he was the man marjorie was seeing i have no real reason to believe it his name came up in a different connection but id like to ask if marjorie were in troubleof any kindwould she have turned to you for help and if not to you where would she go she didnt come here my housekeeper would have told me if she had called i wish she had she shook her head theres really no one else she was close to except for michael hart but of course he was in france if you could ask among her friends it could lead somewhere yes by all means im ashamed now that i didnt do something youre very brave to take on this search it should have been me but she hadnt wanted to know i told her how she could contact me and thanked her sadly we were still no closer to finding marjories killer i was outside on the pavement preparing to crank the motorcar when i realized that she hadnt asked me if marjorie was pregnant did she know already or was this something else she didnt want to hear chapter eleven as i was about to pull over at the marlborough hotel i saw a face in a cab window that caught my attention serena melton she appeared to be very upset i swerved back into heavy traffic ignoring a horn blown in disgust and fell in behind her cab wondering where she might be going although it was more likely that she was coming from somewhere instead but i was right she was going i trailed her back to the house where her brother and his wife had lived she asked the cabbie to wait and went up the steps to knock at the door there was no answer she waited for a moment and tried again and again no one came to answer the summons she was coming back down the steps when i turned in behind the cab and called to her serena imagine running into you in london could i take you somewhere she looked at me and after a moment paid off the cabbie and came to join me in my motorcar what brings you to london she asked i thought you were in france again how are you i asked her instead of answering then is anything wrong ive just had a most unpleasant conversation with someone who knew my brothers wife it was very upsetting in that house the one you were just coming out of no no thats my brothers house i was hoping to have some tea and a lie down before taking the train home are you any closer to finding out who killed your brothers wife it was baldly put but there was no other way to ask how did youoh the weekend at melton hall she sighed pulling off her gloves and then after a moment putting them on again its been the most hopeless task but the police are still sitting on their hands doing nothing i spoke to the inspector in charge this morning he tried to assure me that everything possible was being done but it isnt i know it isnt its likely i began but she interrupted me turning toward me with anger in her eyes his latest theory has to do with someone from oxford i dont know that marjorie even knew anyone there hes grasping at straws i couldnt explain what id been told about the reason the police were searching for that person it wasnt my place to pass on such information if the police had not and so i said do you have any idea what your sisterinlaw did that day the police have told me that she went out in the early afternoon and never came back she knew merry would be arriving that day and id assumed she would go at once to see him i was intending to visit him the following day when he was a little more rested from his journey but of course the police were at our door before i could go and it was left to me to tell him what had happened i couldnt understand how shed come to die in london i thought there must be some mistake theyd had some difficulty in identifying herher purse was takenand if her housekeeper hadnt spoken to the constable on their street the police wouldnt have known who she was as soon as they did it was for the most part what michael had learned from marjories housekeeper we were nearing kensington palace i said you remarked earlier that youd just had an unpleasant conversation i left it there i wish you hadnt reminded me this woman had the audacity to say that people were talking about marjorie long before she was killed and that she was asking for trouble walking down by the river at night on her own she made her sound like a common tart looking for custom it was there in the tone of voice she used what sort of talk was there that she was avoiding her friends insinuating that she must be in some sort of trouble well someone in london knows where she was that evening why wont he or she tell us the truth her voice was rising again and she fidgeted with her gloves as if they had offended her not the woman i blame helen calder she ought to have noticed something marjorie would have listened to helen if shed spoken up in the beginning before it had got too far but she shut her eyes didnt she the sort of woman who wasnt willing to put herself out for anyone safe in her own rectitude it was a harsh indictment not really warranted but id seen helen calders willing detachment even when she suspected that marjorie was growing too fond of the man shed been seeing i didnt believe that she could have changed the situation but i could understand serena meltons feeling that she might have made a difference there must be a reason why she i began but she interrupted me for a second time were speaking of behavior that led to murder i would have said something if id had any inkling that marjorie was being talked about id have confronted her and told her what i thought of such selfish conduct are you saying that herthat an affair had something to do with her death she cast a withering glance in my direction when you flout the rules of society you leave yourself open to the consequences of your actions if shed been at home if shed been with respectable friends she would still be alive and merry would still be alive all pretense that marjorie had been killed in the course of a robbery had been dropped i dont think serena was aware of it the volatile mixture of distress and anger grief and frustration blinding her to everything else we drove in silence for a time and then she said i might as well go home i dont feel like facing any more blank faces and lies the people who could really help me are marjories closest friends but theyre fiercely loyal or else victoria has told them not to talk to me i wouldnt put it past her she flicked a glance in my direction marjories sister i cant abide her and neither could marjorie the pentup feeling of helplessness driving her must be exhausting i thought for there were new lines around her mouth and circles beneath her eyes i said would your brother want you to go through this anguish trying to get at the truth i dont know whether he would or not but if the shoe were on the other foot hed have moved heaven and earth to find out who had killed me i can do no less just because im a woman im not going to walk away from this i couldnt have said whether lieutenant evanson would have felt that way but then he hadnt lost his sister while i was caring for him i couldnt have guessed how angry he would have been or if hed have left matters to the police would you mind dropping me at the station im sorry to ask you to turn around but it would be a kindness i did as she asked and when she had left the motorcar she turned back to me and said if you hear anything about marjorie anything at all you would let me know wouldnt you now there was a conundrum i hadnt told her what i knew and i couldnt in good conscience promise to keep her informed and i wasnt sure i trusted her to act wisely if she did learn the truth serena i began but she said bitterly youre just like the rest arent you no i said sharply i will go to the police if i hear anything thats helpful in finding her murderer thats what everyone should do liar she answered turning her back and she was gone marching toward the station as if she were marching to war in a way she probably thought she was i took michael still protesting back to little sefton ive made a promise to your doctors i told him over his protests when i finally ran him to earth at the marlborough after i keep it youre free to do as you like he was not in a good mood as we threaded our way through londons trafficmostly bicycles military convoys or vehicles omnibuses and the occasional lorry trying to make deliveries to the next shopi let him sulk he did it beautifully but i was immune to his blandishments when we were in the clear and running through the countryside beyond london i said i came looking for you earlier where were you at first i was sure he wasnt going to tell me finally he said i went to scotland yard surprised i asked and did they have news for you they would tell me nothing there was suppressed anger in his confession apparently im a suspect in marjories death butyou said you were in france yet jack melton had told me he was not he turned to look at the passing scene as if he hadnt heard me then grudgingly he went on i havent said anything about it i was given fortyeight hours leave a foreign object in my eye i was sent to a specialist in london my men were in rotation i could be spared he removed the particle gave me drops and a patch and i went straight back to the line i didnt actually lie everyone thought i was in france i let them go on thinking it but the yard stumbled on the truth i dont understand i hadnt heard from marjorie for three months justsilence i wrote to victoria but she wouldnt answer that worried me more i tried to get word to meriwether to ask him if everything was all right but it didnt get through when my eye was inflamed they thought i might lose it and i was given the choice of seeing someone in paris or in london luckily i knew a chap in school whose father was an eye surgeon in harley street and the doctors at the front approved and did you see marjorie no i sent her a telegram the day before telling her where i would be begging her to come and sit with me for a bit either she didnt get the message or she had something else on her mind she never came he was staring at a field where cows grazed and so i couldnt read his face and you didnt go to the house why not i was told not to leave the surgery not to move for twentyfour hours i waited all that day and the next for her and she didnt come you went back to france not knowing shed been killed he didnt answer michael he turned to me his face twisted with grief and anger do you know how many times ive wondered if she was on her way to dr mckinleys surgery when she was killed how many times ive wondered if she might have lived if shed been with me instead of out on the street somewhere and vulnerable and marjories housekeeper had said she went out earlier in the day and never returned from the train station could she have been on her way to see michael was the timing right catching sight of the next turning i asked as i slowed for it you couldnt leave the surgery dr mckinley told me not to jar the eye in any way he left me in a darkened room and his wife brought me my dinner and my breakfast the next morning so you werent supervised i was there whenever they looked in on me he said which wasnt necessarily the same thing i let a little time pass was it your child she was carrying no he said quietly it was not and this time i believed him we arrived in little sefton late in the afternoon i took michael directly to the house of his aunt and uncle as i helped him get out of the motorcar stiff from the drive down he said thank you bess crawford for taking me to london im sorry it wasnt more helpful it made me feel less useless as if id at least tried to find the truth he nodded to me picked up his valise in his good hand and walked up to the door there he turned and with that smile that seemed to light up the world he said give my regards to sergeantmajor brandon i laughed in spite of myself i went on up the street to alicias house and knocked at the door she was surprised to see me but greeted me with friendly warmth i didnt expect to find you on my doorstep but do come in ill put on the kettle and make sandwiches i thanked her and joined her in the kitchen as she worked it was her cooks day off and she was rummaging in the pantry for cold chicken and a pudding as she said this is my dinner but i dine alone far too often it will be nice to have someone to share my meal we ate it in the kitchen and talked about everything but the war im tired of knitting and growing vegetables to save room in the holds of ships for war materiel she said as we ate our pudding im restless i want to do something useful really useful but gareth wont hear of turning the house into a hospital or my going to london and finding work i type you know do you youll be in demand i think what he really wants is to know that nothing has changed at home not the village not the house not me that its all there to come back to a good many soldiers feel that way its what sees them through he sent me photographs in the last letter but one would you like to see them his father gave him a camera for his birthday and hes been using it to capture memories he said id love to see them i had a long drive ahead of me but she had been good enough to invite me to dine and i owed her a few minutes of my time she went off to find the letter and i finished my pudding looking out at the kitchen garden and the outbuildings and the quiet peace of late afternoon alicia came back with the envelope and took out a sheaf of photographs he found someone who could develop these for him they cover a year or more i was so pleased to have them because now i know what his world is like but the photographs were not his world as it truly was it was a tidy look at war that made me want to cry had gareth chosen to spare his wife or was he afraid that the censors would object to the truth and confiscate these photographs there were tents pitched in neat rows well behind the lines like an encampment for troops on parade artillery that was silent the gunners standing grinning in front of a jumble of empty casings a group of french children smiling for the camera their faces unmarked by fear and despair i turned it over to see the name of the village where this was taken and it was well south of the lines too there were several photographs of his fellow officers posing absurdly as if they hadnt a care in the world but i could see the tension around their eyes belying their antics there was even one photograph of meriwether evansons aircraft with meriwether standing proudly with a hand on the prop his face only partly shadowed by his cap alicia pointed him out to me i should have sent that to marjorie but i couldnt part with any of these for a while she let the words trail off as she handed me a few more photographs from another envelope here were another group of officers standing together at a crossroads a line of soldiers and caissons and wellladen lorries passing behind them i recognized the uniformsthe wiltshire fusiliers and third from the left was a face i knew staring at it i said do you have a glass id like to see this one a little more clearly i think theres one in gareths desk she went away and i tried to contain my excitement while i waited alicia came back with a small magnifying glass that she said was a part of gareths stamp collection and i took it from her holding it above the photograph id been right the third officer from the left was the man id seen with marjorie evanson at the railway station i turned the photograph over the caption just read friends meeting by chance do you know who these friends are i asked her just the two on gareths right i dont know that one could i possibly borrow this if i promise to return it safely i asked just for a few days she was reluctant to part with it but in the end allowed me to take it with me i thanked her for my meal and set out for somerset the light was with me most of the way the long light of an english summer evening a warm breeze blowing through the motorcar the world looking as if it had never been at war and then i caught up with a field ambulance carrying wounded to a nearby house that had been turned into a clinic taking the rutted drive in first gear my first thought on leaving alicias house had been to find michael and ask him if he recognized the man standing at the crossroads with gareth but i wasnt sure that was wise and so i went to the one person i knew would find the answer for me without asking questions simon it was beginning to rain hard as i drove up the drive and put my motorcar in the shed where it lived while i was in france i pulled the shed doors closed and made a dash for the side door of the house my mother startled by the apparition meeting her in the passage said oh i didnt hear you coming im not surprised its pouring down out there mother did simon come to dine tonight is he still here i expect he is wheres your handsome young artillery officer back where he came from you decided not to keep him i laughed his heart belongs to someone else i said lightly and went up to change out of my wet clothes at the sound of voices simon came out of my fathers study he greeted me with raised eyebrows have you abandoned young hart to the tender mercies of the four doves again alas i was afraid he might be taken up for murder i responded simon laughed but it was wry amusement in fact i was telling the simple truth but that reminds me i went on taking the photograph from my pocket id like very much to know the identity of the man third from the left its important simon still had contacts with men hed known while serving both in my fathers regiment and in others that had crossed his path it was very likely someone would recognize that face he looked at the photograph read what was written on the reverse noted the uniform then regarded me with interest where on earth did you find this it was quite by accident i told him a matter of pure luck let me see what i can do he pocketed the photograph and turned to speak to my mother as she came into the room id always thought she was the only person on earth simon brandon would obey without questionnext of course to the colonel sahib he would have walked through fire for her sake there were those who whispered that he was in love with the colonels lady but his devotion had very different roots my father eyed me with interest as i came into his study what no lost sheep no crusades to lead youve abandoned all hope of saving some poor soul i laughed sorry im between causes at the moment thats rare he said his suspicions aroused but he said nothing more changing the subject with the ease of long practice we were just going up to bed when our village constable bicycled to the house and asked to speak to me i went to the sitting room where hed been shown and my father accompanied me constable boynton greeted me and said theres been word from inspector herbert at scotland yard miss crawford someone took a shot at lieutenant michael hart in little sefton an hour and a half ago michael i exclaimed bracing myself for bad news is he all right hes unharmed in fact he reported the incident himself he was walking in the garden no one heard the shot no one saw the shooting inspector herbert wishes to know if you could put a name to his assailant my first thought was serena melton i wouldnt have put it past her to shootand misswith the weapon that wasnt in the gun cabinet where it belonged but id seen her onto the train no id dropped her at the station i corrected myself i had no idea which train shed taken on the other hand i could see that michael hart could easily have invented the entire incident to take himself off the yards suspect list and mine please tell inspector herbert i cant help him in this matter i wasnt there and i dont know who could have tried to shoot the lieutenant im sorry but if i learn anything more ill be in touch thank you miss and my apologies to mrs crawford for disturbing you so late constable boynton said and took his leave as the door closed behind him my father said youre making a habit of being consulted by an inspector at scotland yard these days not really consulted i said trying to make light of what had just happened i was there in little sefton only a few hours ago but how had inspector herbert known that the constable in little sefton must have remembered my motorcar and reported that id just brought lieutenant hart home from london the fact that inspector herbert knew such details indicated all too clearly his interest in michael which told me that the murderer from oxford hadnt proved to be the yards man in spite of what the yard had told serena melton indeed my father was saying thoughtfully i dont believe you were telling the whole truth when you refused to help constable boynton the colonel sahib knew me too well i didnt refuse i just didnt want to make false accusations i answered him not when i had no real proof to support them very commendable and is there any remote possibility that we shall be in danger in our own garden if in fact someone actually shot at lieutenant hart it would have been a very personal matter and not one that im likely to be involved with im delighted to hear it perhaps i should have a word with this inspector herbert i dont care to see you dragged into inquiries i wasnt dragged into anything i happened to be a witness to two people having a conversation in a railway station i knew one of them but not the other and the one i knew was later murdered but hours later long after i was sound asleep in my flat the trouble is the other person the one i didnt recognize could probably give the police a great deal more informationthat is if he could be found hes been conspicuous by his absence there it was out in the open the whole story mostly and michael hart is involved how hed known the dead woman for many years but hes not a suspect i hesitated a heartbeat too long in answering that my father gave me a straight look but said no more he held the sitting room door open for me simon had gone and my mother was waiting to speak to my father after i went up the stairs i knew very well shed have the story of constable boyntons intrusion before they followed me up to bed i couldnt sleep i dressed then went quietly down the stairs and out the door looking up at the wet night the trees softly dripping rain the sounds of night creatures loud in the stillness simon wearing rain gear came up behind me as i started to walk along the steppingstones that led around the house i wasnt going farther than the little gazebo my father had put up in the garden there for my mother but of course he had no way of guessing that he said if youre thinking of going to little sefton tonight ill drive you i shook my head theres no point in it id come no closer to the truth than the police have done did my father tell you what constable boynton wanted to speak to me about of course he said grinning your mother had it out of him as soon as you were out of the room he walked down to see me afterward what did she have to say about the shooting as i recall her exact words were i wouldnt worry if i were you richard i think young mr hart is looking for sympathy trust my mother to see into the heart of the matter i said if he came to speak to you what are you doing here its late i had a feeling you might decide to go to hampshire this time you were wrong i could see a flash of something in his eyes before he turned away it occurred to me that lieutenant harts deathif hed been killed tonightwould bear a striking resemblance to lieutenant fordhams i hadnt linked the two yet but simon was right in time i would have i woke up the next morning with a headache rare for me because i seldom had them but i hadnt been able to sleep until close on four oclock because my mind was trying to sort out the tangle of events a nurse is trained to observe its her duty to see what is happening to the patient in her chargeshes the eyes of the doctor on the case any changes must be noted and shes expected to know what they represent a sign of healing of a worsening of the patients condition the onset of new symptoms or a simple matter of indigestion were expected to know when to summon matron or the doctor and when to cope on our own use that training i told myself dont jump to conclusions there had to be some evidence somewhere marjorie had spent five hours that were unaccounted for she could very well have walked to the nearest hotel and used a telephone to reach someone but that person hadnt come forward she could have taken a cab to the house of a friend but according to helen calder she had been cut off from her friendsshe had told helen herself very little for that matter and then only in the early stages of the affair she could have confided in a complete stranger in a tea shop someone who would listen but not judge that person hadnt come forward either she couldnt have traveled very far between the time i saw her and when she was killed perhaps an hour in any direction if she were meeting the person shed telephoned but no restaurant or other public place had contacted the police to say she had been seen very likely she never left london and michael was in dr mckinleys surgery marjorie knew that had she walked the streets for a time working up her courage to talk to an old friend and then made her way to the surgery after hours when the doctor was least likely to look in on his patient she wouldnt have wished to arrive with her face blotched by tears i could see the police point of view there i wondered who had told them that michael was in love with marjorie otherwise they would have interviewed him and moved on since he had no apparent motive was it victoria of course police suspicions would have been aroused by the fact that he had said nothing about seeing her that night unless he swore she had never come there michael could hardly have stabbed her in the surgery and if he disobeyed orders and left he risked the doctor finding him gone where could one go to commit a quiet little murder if someone had intended to throw marjories body in the river surely it was easier to do the deed nearby rather than having to transport a body any distance it was dark there with london wary of zeppelin raids a welllit river was a navigators delight that might explain why marjorie was still alive when she was put into the waterit would be impossible to make sure she was dead michael had said that he was haunted by the possibility that marjorie had been killed on her way to meet him if that were true had marjorie told someone where she intended to go and that person had prevented her from reaching the surgery walk with me for a little while we can talk by the water its quiet there then you can go on to the doctors surgery that was a far more realistic possibility than encountering a stranger back then to someone she knew had she told the man at the railway station where she was going i hadnt seen him descend from the moving train although inspector herbert had asked me specifically about that point but there was the next station first lieutenant fordham then michael hart the only person i could think of who would have a reason to shoot both men was serena melton she was obsessed searching for the babys father and i wondered if jack suspected that if it had been the reason hed been afraid of blackmail id fallen asleep on that thought ignoring the headache as best i could i dressed and went down to breakfast my parents had already eaten theirs and gone the sun was out again the rain only a memory i could imagine my father driving to london to have a word with inspector herbert but he had a good head start id never be able to catch him up i drank a cup of tea ate some dry toast and went out to the shed where id left my motorcar it was low on petrol and i was about to take it to the smithycumgarage to see to that simon was coming around the corner of the house he had a tennis racket in his hand and i realized that he and my mother must have been playing who won i asked i did by the skin of my teeth where are you going i told him ill see to the petrol then im off to sandhurst business or pleasure i hoped it was my photograph that was taking him there ive to see someone there on war office business he said after that i intend to bring up the photograph i thanked him and then asked if he knew where my father had gone something came up hes on his way to portsmouth to meet someone thats how i was dragooned into a game of tennis in his place i wasnt sure whether to believe him or not portsmouthand london afterward and then i did when simon said youll stay close to home while were away i dont like the idea of shots flying about in gardens besides your mother wouldnt mention it but i think shed like a little time with you id have liked to go to little sefton and ask michael hart about the shots fired at him but i could hardly knock at the harts door and boldly ask about an event that had occurred hours after i left i persuaded myself that if simon was successful in identifying the man i could return the photograph to alicia as promised and she was sure to tell me what had happened and it would seem very natural to speak to michael then besides simon was right about my mother i promise i told him and with a nod he was gone chapter twelve i was just coming up the avenue of lime trees later that day when i heard simons motorcar pulling in behind me were you able to put a name to that face i asked hope rising unfortunately no my spirits plummeted oh was all i could manage to say simon smiled i cant work miracles bess hes in a territorial regiment they come and go those charged with their training barely getting to know them before theyre shipped to the front besides its not a very clear likeness and at the moment i must go up to london to my eyes it was or had i wanted it to be the right man with his cap on shading his facebut thats how id seen him at waterloo station let me go with you i put on my most innocent face he was instantly suspicious why i have some shopping id like to do he nodded all right after breakfast then i was ready the next morning when he came knocking at the door a little after seven my mother had given me a long list of things she needed and couldnt find locally we drove in silence for a time and then he said look bess this is all well and good but you need to spend more time with your family i feel guilty enough i told him but i also feel responsible day after day i watched lieutenant evanson cling to that photograph of his wife and on the long journey home i helped him count the hours until he saw her again he was stoic never complaining only i was the one who saw herhe never did he wasnt even well enough to attend her funeral then he killed himself slowly patiently until hed succeeded he was one of mine simon he should have lived he reached over and took my hand his was warm and safe and comforting you cant save all of them bess he said gently thats the trouble with war men die your father and i close our eyes and see a thousand ghosts we know theyre there but we cant stare too long at their faces we have to move on put the living first there are already enough monuments to the dead his voice was bitter as he finished i said nothing too close to tears and i knew how he disliked tears after a while he released my hand and then he changed the subject simon hadnt particularly cared to see me go into nursing but when the war came it was what i wanted to do if i couldnt fight with my fathers regiment as a son would have done i could at least keep men alive to fight again another day simon had decided that the rigors of learning my trade would discourage me but mopping floors changing dressings and bedpans sitting with the dying and standing by without flinching when horribly wounded men came through the tent flap had toughened me in ways i hadnt expected if my fathers son could face death on a battlefield my fathers daughter could certainly face the bloody ruins of brave men india and the other places where my father had been sent in the course of his career had also helped me cope with the ugliness of what i had chosen to do death and disease poverty and despair were just outside the compound gates in agra and other places i had only to ride a mile in my mothers carriage to see maimed lepers and begging children ashcovered holy men lying on a bed of hot coals or a starving family covered with sores i knew early on that life for some was very hard and for others much more comfortable a penny my companion said as we drove through the next small village i was thinking about india i dream of it sometimes do you yesoh simon stop please i reached out my hand on his arm he did as id asked pulling in behind a bakers cart i was out of the motorcar almost as soon as it came to a halt captain truscott i called to the army officer just walking into a bookshop he turned and recognized me at once miss crawford how good to see you what brings you to maplethorpe i was passing through on my way to london im leaving for london myself in half an hour have dinner with me tonight the marlborough yes indeed shall i come for you i told him where to find me and that mrs hennessey was the guardian at the gate let her see that you are the most responsible officer in the entire army and shell come upstairs for me he laughed seven then seven and i was back in the motorcar before the baker had finished his delivery at the tea shop next to the bookstore youve thrown over the dashing young lieutenant for a captain i see he was at the meltons house party he knew marjorie evanson and her husband which explains why you leapt out of a moving motorcar to chase that man into a bookstore and beg him to take you to dinner tonight i did no such thing i answered indignantly simon laughed thats how your mother would see it that was true i dont know why i had rushed after captain truscott but it had been a spurofthemoment decision it was a bit of luck to find him again at all we reached london and simon set me down at the flat where i went up to look for anyone who might be there but i had it to myself and i decided that my first order of business was to speak to inspector herbert he was not at the yard having been called away to deal with a problem in bermondsey the elderly constable who escorted me to his office and back down the stairs again took pity on me when he saw my disappointment hes got a meeting tomorrow at eight oclock with the chief superintendent if you are here at nine oclock hell make time for you i thanked him and left id expected id be staying over in london anyway the problem would be persuading simon to stay too by the time i reached the flat again having stopped along the way to find items from my mothers list i discovered simon waiting for me leaning against the wing of his motorcar arms crossed i gave him my packages and he stowed them in the motorcar three more he carried inside for me where mrs hennessey gave him permission to take them up the stairs to the flat while she watched with an eagle eye hes a very attractive man friend of the family or not she murmured to me and there are standards to maintain the families of my young ladies expect it i suppressed a smile if mrs hennessey didnt trust simon the most trustworthy of men i wondered what she would make of lieutenant hart temptation incarnate but dear soul that she was she did her best to safeguard those of us who lived in the flats above and we all loved her when simon came down again we went to his motorcar and he took me to lunch id wanted to ask him what hed learned but he was in a dark mood and i knew better than to push we talked about other thingswhere id gone shopping what id heard from my flatmates news of mutual friends everything under the sun but what was uppermost in my mind and then at the end of our meal as the waiter set our trifle in front of us and walked away he finally said ive found the name of the man in that photograph are you sure you want to hear what ive learned or shall i send it along to this inspector herbert of yours and let it be finished is it someone you knowor my parents know i asked suddenly worried no then tell me please hes jack meltons brother i sat there stunned i hadnt expected the man to be someone i knew but then id never actually met him i reminded myself only his brother serenas husband still it was too close to home for comfort what is his name i couldnt remember ever hearing it raymond melton hes a captain in the wiltshire fusiliers and in france at the moment i took a deep breath it cant be no i dont think he would dareserenas brothers wife you know nothing about the man what sort he may be simons voice was harsh go to scotland yard tell herbert what youve learned and leave it to him but it doesnt make sense i said dabbing at the trifle with my spoon not wanting to meet simons eyes thats because you dont want to believe it it will break serena meltons heart shell never forgive him and she will blame jack as well why because her brother died of grief she didnt care all that much for marjorie even when they married but she loved her brother with all her heart i had wanted to find this man to keep the inquiry on track and as is common with most meddling what id learned would have repercussions once raymond melton was questioned serena would give jack no peace until he told her all he knew still so much fit together marjorie would have met raymond melton and if she had run into him in london one day she would have had no qualms about dining with him even mrs hennessey a stickler for propriety wouldnt have batted an eye why was he in england five or six months ago it couldnt have been an ordinary leave he must have been here longer than most he was seconded to general haigs staff and he was coordinating supply shipments they were being held up finding transport was a problem with the german submarines taking such a toll london was his base from there he could visit manchester or birmingham or liverpool with relative ease he also had a staff motorcar at his disposal i cant imagine what she could possibly have seen in him i said crossly he seemed sodistant michael hart is so much better looking if it was a fling she was after and he loved her he wouldnt have walked away from her and left her there all alone raymond melton didnt kill her he couldnt have i asked he caught the train and reached france precisely when he should have but trains were slow he could have borrowed a motorcar using the excuse that hed missed his connection simon was saying something that i didnt catch sorry hes married bess raymond melton is married they have two children i recalled the boy and girl id seen at melton hall the day mary and i arrived raymond meltons children very likely though shed referred to them as cousins oh dear god what am i to do simon it will ruin their lives this is why i didnt want to tell you he signaled the waiter ill take you back to the flat and then speak to inspector herbert myself hell know how much will have to come out during the inquiry and how much he can keep from the newspapers for the time being leave it to him then ill drive you back to somerset he didnt say bless him that i should have handed gareth daltons photograph to scotland yard then id have been ignorant of the connections like the ostrich with her head in the sand i have a dinner engagement with captain truscott i answered distractedly it would be unkind to break it besides inspector herbert is away then ill wait and drive you home tomorrow rousing myself i said no thats not the right way to handle this simon i made a promise to inspector herbert i told him id let him know what i discovered ill speak to him myself we argued that point for a good five minutes and then simon capitulated it may be the best way after all he said he settled the bill and then led me out of the restaurant what matters is to put this behind you as soon as you can we had reached the pavement when i remembered something hearing a quick indrawn breath simon turned to me what is it i ran into jack melton outside the marlborough hotel when i was in london with lieutenant hart i felt an obligation i dont know why to tell him that on the night she died id seen marjorie with a man i didnt recognize and i think i said something about the yard searching for this man to help them with their inquiries and he told me that i ought to be looking instead at michael hart little did he know i paused or did he no somehow i have a feeling that raymond melton keeps himself to himself simon swore under his breath in urdu thinking i wouldnt recognize the words but i did bazaar life is very colorful a childs ear soon picks up bits and pieces of hindi and urdu i quickly learned which words i could and could not repeat in front of my elders how close is he to his brother do you know i cant answer that i told him then the sooner you get to the yard the safer you will be he shook his head theres something wrong with this whole affair bess dont you feel it as well something rathersinister youve learned too much for one thing and for another the murder of marjorie evanson was particularly vicious dont tempt her killer whoever he may be to try again but raymond melton is in france i wasnt as convinced as simon was for the moment do you think he knows where she was going after the train left would she tell him perhaps she would to make him jealous what had been set in motion that rainy evening in the railway station was that only the tip of the problem the more visible half what about michael hart i realized all at once that we were standing in everyones way as they came and went from the restaurant forcing them to part like the red sea around us we cant discuss it here simon took my arm and led me to the motorcar holding my door for me he turned the crank with more than his usual vigor then got behind the wheel we cant talk in your flat either where would you like to go when i didnt answer he said scotland yard even if inspector herbert isnt there well tell someone else what you know it will be finished bess yes i said reluctantly but i knew he was right as it happened inspector herbert had just returned from bermondsey and we had to wait half an hour for him to make his report to his superiors finally i heard his footsteps loud on the bare floorboards as he came down the passage and then he opened his office door and was shaking hands i explained simons presence and after that we all sat down i had a distinct impression of cold feetthey wanted to carry me back out of the room again as fast as possible but it was too late well inspector herbert was saying what brings you here miss crawford simon opened his mouth but i forestalled him inspector herbert listened carefully as i told him what i knew about the man at the station and he asked to see the photograph that id given simon it belongs to someone i promised to bring it back to her as soon as possible he was busy scanning the face of raymond melton after a moment he reached into his drawer and drew out a looking glass youre quite sure this is captain melton he asked after a moment still bent over the picture he reached up to turn on the lamp at his elbow and brought it closer i thought to myself that by the time he gave that photograph back to me inspector herbert would have memorized meltons face straightening up he turned off the lamp set the glass back inside his drawer and leaned back into his chair what did marjorie evanson say to this man on that rainy evening in london he mused what did it set in motion that meeting she may have kept her own counsel simon pointed out given his conduct yes thats possible i expect she was too upset to dine anywhere and she wouldnt wish to be seen by anyone she knew weve looked into tea shops between the railway station and the river churches are more difficulttheyre often empty at that time of day she could sit quietly in one until shed recovered with no one the wiser it seems unlikely that shed turn to a friendno one has come forward at any rate ill try to bring melton back to england for questioning although since hes made no effort to contact me i dont have much hope in that direction at least we have a witness who puts him there with mrs evanson weve tried to find others but the stationmaster tells us it was very busy and a weeping woman seeing a soldier off is too common people try to pass by without looking give them a modicum of privacy if hes jack meltons brother simon commented he cant claim he didnt know shed been killed i confessed ive told his brother about seeing a man with marjorie the night she died but i didnt know then who he was i was trying to help jack melton get to the truth before his wife did shes frantically searching for someone to blame serena melton is likely to do something rash and it wont bring her brother back inspector herbert was staring at me weighing up what i was saying yes well i dont think any harm has been done he leaned forward his elbows on his cluttered desk since you didnt know his brother and you arent likely to meet him commander melton wont be unduly worried the likelihood is that his brother hasnt confessed his adultery anyway especially if he learned mrs evanson was murdered that evening is captain melton married do you know yes it was simon who answered so ive been informed there are two children all the more reason to keep hisrelationshipfrom everyone doesnt speak well of his character does it inspector herbert turned to me its amazing that you found this photograph well done i said giving credit where it was due it was sergeantmajor brandon who put a name to the face inspector herbert smiled you can safely leave this matter to us now which reminds me about michael hart i had done enough damage talking out of turn i see no reason for him to lie if he says he was shot at then he was the local people will probably discover it was boys who came across their fathers service revolver and were tempted to try it i cast about quickly for a way to change the course of the conversation you havent told mehas that man from oxford been found he was apprehended in derby i dont think we need to concern ourselves with him any longer and lieutenant fordham ah thats another matter i waited and after a moment he said finally lieutenant fordham knew marjorie evanson in london before she was married his mother was a friend of her late aunts as he had never married we wondered if the friendship had been renewed while he was convalescing mrs evanson escorted him to medical appointments on a number of occasions he was one of several wounded she volunteered to work with she would meet a train see that the patient got to his destination and then back to the train that explained why no one in little sefton knew of him and why marjories staff didnt know the name they had been hired after her marriage to meriwether evanson michael had helped select them but why had she let her aunts staff go it seemed that everything i learned generated more questions i thanked inspector herbert and he nodded finding this photograph was a piece of luck weve been on the point of setting this inquiry aside for lack of new information he smiled ruefully at simon youd think in a time of war when england is fighting for her life people would put their petty differences aside and work together but crime never goes away were shorthanded here at the yard but the number of cases seems to climb by the day it was a way of reminding us that he was busy but i had one more question for him captain fordham i said how did he die you never told me the outcome of your investigation at first i thought he would tell me it was police business and not mine but he said thats a very odd affair there is a small lake on the fordham property at one end a bridge crosses to an island just large enough for a stone table and benches summer picnics and that sort of thing as far as we can determine he walked out onto that bridge one evening and shot himself he went over the low parapet into the water but he was already dead the weapon went with him and we havent found it yet the water is rather deep just there and quite murky was it really a suicide i asked we believe now that it must have been but we cant be sure no note you see and his family cant think of a reason for him to take his own life he didnt use his service revolver that was still in the armoire with his uniform he was wearing trousers and a white shirt when he died his family is adamant that he wasnt grieving over mrs evanson they refuse even to consider suicide which leaves murder or was his wound severe enough to drive him to do something drastic a stomach wound he said very unpleasant im told he reached for a folder pulling it in front of him but not opening it a sign that our visit had ended we exchanged polite farewells dismissal as well telling me that the yard no longer required my efforts he rose as i did reached across the desk to shake hands with simon brandon and came around to accompany us to the door where a constable was waiting to see us out of the yard simon had nothing to say until we had reached his motorcar and then he turned to me before he opened my door it was really very clever of you to discover who the officer with marjorie evanson was it was more a matter of seeing what was before me and of course making alicias acquaintance in the first place she wouldnt have thought to show those photographs to an inspector from the yard i dont think her husband knows raymond melton by the way alicia did recognize the other two men he probably just happened to be with one of the other men at that crossroads i smiled remembering i like alicia shes been busy matchmaking you know she suspects theres a growing attachment between michael hart and me there was of coursea murder simon laughed in spite of himself youre impossible he said opening my door and then he was suddenly quite serious one hand on my arm to make certain i was paying attention but mark me miss elizabeth alexandra victoria crawford you will heed the advice of inspector herbert and leave the death of mrs evanson to the proper authorities to solve youre in enough danger in france i dont wish to spend every leave pulling you out of trouble before it comes to your mothers ears he invariably brooked no nonsense when he used my full name i wisely said nothing when he got behind the wheel he added for good measure and that includes the suicide of the unfortunate captain fordham i was actually thinking about his death and wondering if the weapon would ever turn up deep end of that lake or not as if hed read my mind which i was sometimes convinced he could do simon turned to me and said bess chapter thirteen i spent the afternoon in mrs hennesseys apartments ironing the uniforms id soon be packing to take back to france it was cooler there and getting the collars and cuffs stiff enough was always hard work i had had to do one set over again mrs hennessey was having tea with one of her friends i was grateful for the use of her iron and having to concentrate on what i was doing kept my mind from dwelling on marjorie evanson and captain fordham simon had gone to his club refusing to leave london without me if i do youll just get up to mischief of some sort hed told me you arent showing up in the marlborough hotel to sit across the room and scowl at poor captain truscott are you id demanded before shutting the door behind me the poor mans hands shake badly enough as it is captain truscott appears to be a decent enough sort no ill wait here on the street to make certain he brings you home at a reasonable hour mrs hennessey may even ask me in for tea i slammed the door in his face and heard him laughing all the way back to the motorcar ironing cuffs and aprons isnt a soothing activity by the time i was dressed and waiting for captain truscott to call i was not in the mood for dinner and was beginning to wonder why on earth id been so eager to see him again he arrived on the dot and mrs hennessey bless her climbed the stairs to our flat and told me he was waiting he smiled as i came down saying it was good to see you again im looking forward to dinner frederick truscott turned out to be a very nice dinner partner it made up for the marlboroughs very indifferent menu we had a number of friends in common and that kept conversation rolling comfortably all the way to the hotel ive borrowed terrence hornsbys motor he told me and so like cinderella i must have you at home before the stroke of twelve hes driving to wales tonight to visit his family i havent seen him in ages how is he bullet clipped his ear still looks rather raw there but hes glad it wasnt his head he says he needed it although some of his friends are in serious debate over that which sounded just like terrence i laughed while we were on the subject of absent friends i said quite casually i only discovered today that jack meltons brother is a serving officer a captain in the wiltshire fusiliers i dont think jack mentioned him when we were at melton hall someone told me they were estranged though not why ive never met him hes married i think i couldnt say we swapped other names and then against my better judgment i asked did you know captain fordham his face lost its humor sadly i did a loss there he was a good officer was he by any chance acquainted with marjorie evanson strange you should mention that the police asked his family about a connection when they came to inquire into his death apparently he did know her how well ive no idea really marjorie was good company i was fond of her myself changing the subject he asked when do you go back to france in another five days bad luck i leave the day after tomorrow said my goodbyes at home and came up to london to put that parting behind me easier that way where is your family somerset i havent spent as much time with them as id promised was that your elder brother in the motorcar with you good heavens no thats simon brandon he was my fathers sergeantmajor at the end of his career a light dawned behind his eyes youre not colonel richard crawfords daughter are you when i nodded guessing what was coming captain truscott said my god he was a fine officer weve a man in the fusiliers who served under him he knows more about planning battles than half the general staff i could agree with that there had been complaints that the generals were fighting the wars of the past my father and simon often refought the battle of the somme over cigars and it always put them in a rotten mood we discussed my father for a bit and then suddenly wed finished our pudding drunk our tea in the comfortable lounge and it was time to go i said as we walked through reception and out of the hotel can you think of any good reason for captain fordham to kill himself i dont know that we need a reason freddy truscott answered somberly what keeps you going is your men you dont let them down fordham lost most of his men in a charge ordered against a section of line that reconnaissance had indicated was poorly defended and certain to fold but the germans had put in a concealed machinegun nest during the night and they held their fire until fordham and his men were within easy range they were wiped outhe was one of only a handful of wounded who somehow made it back to their own lines the rest were dead before they knew what they were up against he blamed himself for trusting hq he felt hed betrayed the dead and refused all treatment when they got him back to the nearest aid station one of the nursing sisters put a needle into his arm and that was that he was more sensible when he came out of surgery i recalled the incidentalthough i hadnt known it was captain fordham whod fought the nursing staff diana had been there had witnessed the struggle to treat the wounded man and she had told us about it even she hadnt learned why the officer had gone mad only that in spite of his severe injuries hed fought like a tiger but this went far to explain fordhams suicide still if hed been intent on taking his own life why wait until he was nearly mended trying for a lighter note on which to end the evening i asked freddy if i could write to him in france he said i was trying to get up the courage to ask just that and then it was time to say goodbye as we stood outside the door of mrs hennesseys house i wished him safe in france and he held my hand longer than was needful thank you bess for a happy evening ive enjoyed it more than i can say with that he was gone walking to the borrowed motorcar with swift strides not looking back even as he drove away i watched him go watched his taillights vanish around the far corner of our street and with a sigh said a silent prayer that he would come home whole then i turned and went inside where had simon got to i hadnt learned a great deal about raymond melton and only a little about lieutenant fordham but as i climbed the stairs to my flat calling good night to mrs hennessey who had come out to ask me if id enjoyed my evening i wondered why jack melton and his brother were estranged because he knew what sort of person raymond melton was what had been the fascination there for marjorie attention when she needed comforting her fears for meriwether smoothed away sometimes very cold men could be utterly charming when it served their purpose i preferred someone like michael hart who made no bones about flirting enjoying it and expecting no harm to come of it like the woman at the garden party i remembered as i drifted into sleep henrys wife who had been amused by michaels flattery gave it back in full measure and made both of them laugh someone was knocking at the flat door i heard it in my dreams before i realized that the sound was real surfacing from sleep i tried to think what time it was and if id overslept i fumbled for my slippers and my dressing gown and made my way through the dark flat but the windows told me it wasnt the middle of the night as id first thought or late morning dawn had broken and the first rays of the sun were touching the rooftops opposite i opened the door to mrs hennessey her gray hair in a long plait that fell down over the collar of her dressing gown what is it whats the matter i asked thinking she must be ill my dear its sergeantmajor brandon he says its most urgent that he speak to you i do hope it isnt your parents my mind was racing ahead of me as i brushed past her and went headlong down the stairs nearly flinging myself into simons arms as i tripped on the last three steps what is it i said again tensed for the blow to come i told mrs hennessey not to frighten you he said angry its a police matter but important enough to make sure you were safely here mrs hennessey had seen me come in she could have told simonand then i realized that he had been frowning with worry until he saw me on the stairs do you know a mrs calder he continued and i tried to concentrate on what he was saying calder yesshes a friend of marjories marjorie evanson she was attacked last night and nearly killed she i began and had to stop to catch my breath nearly killed mrs hennessey had made her way down the stairs and said to simon if you wish to use my sitting room he thanked her and we went into her flat where a lamp was burning in the small room where she sat in the evening she asked if wed like a cup of tea but simon shook his head with that she left us alone but knowing mrs hennessey she wouldnt be far even though she knew that simon was a family friend her staunch victorian upbringing wouldnt allow her to eavesdrop but she would be able to hear if i screamed or had to fight for my virtue since i was not properly dressed to receive a gentleman simon must have read my mind because he smiled grimly and said you had better sit over there god forbid that we should not observe the proprieties i sat down on one side of the hearth and he took the chair on the other mrs calder i reminded him she had gone to dine with friends mr and mrs murray put her into a cab at the end and she went directly to her house thats been established but she didnt go in the maid waiting up for her was drowsing in her chair but she would have heard any disturbance on the doorstep then it was someone mrs calder knew i said she wouldnt have gone anywhere with a stranger not after what happened to marjorie evanson i tried to think have the police found the cabbie they have and he doesnt recall anyone walking along the street or standing in the shadows of a tree but hes an old man he might not have noticed at any rate she got down at hamilton place paid the cabbie and the last he saw of her she was walking toward her door an hour later a constable walking through hamilton place heard something in the square and alert man that he is went to investigate he discovered mrs calder lying in a stand of shrubbery stabbed and bleeding heavily shes in hospital now and undergoing surgery no one has been able to question her but she wasnt robbed or interfered with in any way because of the unsolved attack on mrs evanson someone probably the metropolitan police thought to bring in inspector herbert oh dear i put my hands up to my face pressing them against the flesh trying to absorb everything simon was telling me and then i realized that it was simon telling me letting my hands fall i said how is it that you know all this inspector herbert put in a call to somersethe must have thought you were going directly home but he was taking no chances you father called me at my club i came directly here he paused bess how much did this mrs calder know about marjorie evansons love affair did she know the name of the man she told me she didnt but serena melton believed mrs calder knew more than she wished to tell even the police that she found her cousin marjories behavior distasteful and was trying to distance herself from it serena melton believes she does and if thats true someone else could as well michael hart had not suggested we talk to helen calder the thought rose like a black shadow in my mind had he believed that if helen knew the name of the man marjorie had been seeing it was possible that she also knew marjorie intended to meet him that evening i pushed the thought away there could be a little jealousy there because helen really was a cousin and michael was not but the thought lingered simon was saying the police cant be certain that her attack is related to mrs evansons death but theyre treating it as likely she must know who it was she isnt the kind of woman who would take risks is shewill she survive with critical stabbing wounds infection was often the deciding factor in living or dying simon shook his head its touch and go i should think my first responsibility was to look in on you to see if youd also been lured out into the night mrs hennessey couldnt stop a determined killer he was right if someone knew just what to saythat my mother had suddenly taken ill or something had happened to simon or my fatherid go with them especially if i thought mrs hennessey had allowed them in this emergency to come directly to my door it would never occur to me that she was already dead what then had someone said to mrs calder that made her turn away from her door and follow himor her im wide awake i said its no use going back to bed do you think if we went to the hospital matron might tell me about the surgery and what the prognosis is for helen calder its worth trying i left him there in the sitting room and went up to dress i decided to wear my uniform though i sighed when i put on the nicely starched cuffs and apron that id ironed only hours ago simon drove me to st martins hospital where we made our way to the surgical wards but mrs calder was still in surgery i was told and not expected to be brought into the ward until she was stable i asked where she had been stabbed but the sister i spoke with shook her head i havent seen her file only that im to expect a female patient with repairs of severe knife wounds frustrated i went to where simon was sitting in the room in which families awaited news and said she isnt out of surgery yet it could be some time it was worth a try he said ill take you home and well come again in a few hours i was agreeable to that but we met inspector herbert as we walked down the passage hed been in the small staff canteen helping himself to a cup of tea he looked tired surprised to see us there he said to me youre in uniform indeed i hope you werent thinking of interviewing mrs calder before the police spoke to her he smiled but it was also a warning i was worried i met her for the first time only a few days ago did you indeed he gave me his undivided attention and what did she have to say to you she couldnt give me the name of the man mrs evanson had been seeing but shed been concerned for some time about what she believed to be a developing affair and she was under the impression that mrs evanson had broken it off several months before her death well before she could have known she was pregnant but i didnt say that to mrs calder i went on to tell him what little i knew inspector herbert nodded this time her purse wasnt taken and so we had her identity at once then when the police went to inform her family her mother said dear god first marjorie and now helen that was when we made a connection between the two women and i put in a call to somerset he looked down at the hat he was turning in his hands i must say i never expected a second murder he looked up again and after a brief hesitation he added the constable who found her said that she was barely conscious when he bent over her but she spoke someones name her voice lifted at the end as if she were posing a question michael she said michael i repeated before i could stop myself erwhat is her husbands name alan oh oh indeed i said if youre thinking that michael hart did this youre mistaken he couldnt given his injuries ask his doctor i tried to remember a dr higgins hed given michael permission to accompany me to london he must know the case well enough to make such a judgment ill be speaking to his physician he assured me but for all we know he could be malingering i thought about the pain id read in michaels eyes the struggle with the sedatives the whispers that he was addicted to them but i didnt bring these matters up my testimony would be considered biased it will be hours before mrs calder is awake i told him if shes still in surgery now we might as well all go back to bed but he shook his head that isnt what the yard pays me to do ill be there the instant she opens her eyes just then matron came down the passage calling to inspector herbert mrs calder is being taken to a private room she isnt awake and wont be for some time she said echoing what id just been telling him myself but you may go in and see her if you wish he turned to accompany her i gave simon a swift glance and followed in inspector herberts wake matron was saying the damage is considerable but well know more tomorrow whoever her attacker was he stabbed her twice she was wearing a corset and luckily the staves deflected his knife there is a laceration along her ribs the bone scraped cartilage torn but the blade didnt reach her lung then he stabbed her in the stomach and nearly succeeded in killing her we went into the small private ward and looked down at the patients wan face i didnt think shed be speaking to anybody for some time she had lost quite a bit of blood and the surgery had been stressful as well i studied her face she was no longer the vigorous woman id seen only a day or so ago even with the bandages she seemed to have shrunk into herself thinner and somehow vulnerable i felt a surge of pity if she had been thrown into the river as marjorie evanson had been she wouldnt have survived at all matron was saying youll observe that she was also struck on the head from behind we saw that injury as we were pulling her hair back she gently turned mrs calders head and parted her heavy hair to show us the wound i would say that she was knocked unconscious and then coldbloodedly stabbed while she was unable to defend herself then theres a chance she didnt see her attacker inspector herbert bent down for a closer look true matron eased the patients head back onto the pillow and arranged her hair inspector herbert then turned to me any thoughts you were at her house the servants entrance is just below her doordown the stairs behind the railing and into a kitchen passage i should think it was a common enough arrangement if someone waited there the cabbie wouldnt have seen him but hed have had to be quiet as the cabbie left it might have covered the sound of his footsteps coming up inspector herbert agreed ill speak to one of my men well see if another cab dropped off a passenger earlier the question is how did he know she was out or when she would return he may have been there earlier and seen her leaving and waited he nodded whoever it was took a great risk one cry and someone might have come to a window unless he persuaded her to walk into the square then struck her from behind that may be why she said the name michael the way she did as he came up the tradesmens stairs she must have been surprised and called out to him matron gestured to us and we walked out of the ward together closing the door behind us inspector herbert asked that an extra chair be brought to him and he sat down before the closed door he pointedly bade me good night i left having pushed my luck as far as i thought it ought to go i accompanied matron back to the hall where simon was waiting my mind busy with the problem of why a dying woman had spoken michaels name i went over what shed said to me when i called on her i hadnt brought up michaels nameand neither had she simon took me to the marlborough hotel and commandeered a breakfast for the two of us i sat there toying with my food thinking about mrs calder it makes no sense i finally said aloud it isnt supposed to you arent inspector herbert i smiled i dont think hes exactly happy with this turn of events either eat your breakfast i did as i was told i wanted something from simon and the easiest way to persuade him was to cooperate at least the breakfast was better than the dinner the night before and i was hungry how was your evening simon asked echoing my own thought captain truscott is a very nice man you neednt use that tone of voice what tone of voice the one that sounds disapproving and nosy simon laughed actually i think youre probably right about truscott he told me something about captain fordham that made a lot of sense he groaned i thought youd been warned off that topic i was i cant help it if freddy knew the man i see youd better tell me i did simon nodded as i was finishing the account hes right simon told me theres delayed shock you know as long as captain fordham was recovering from his wounds he could put france out of his mind but as soon as he knew he was nearly ready to return to the front the truth had to be faced then why didnt he use his service revolver i expect he didnt wish to i expect he didnt feel he had a right to use it that was a very interesting observation i sighed poor man he wouldnt be the first and he wont be the last dont you remember color sergeant blaine it was much the same story i did remember it was in lahore and color sergeant blaine was in hospital recovering from wounds he slashed his wrists one night without a word to anyone and my father said sergeant blaine blamed himself for losing his men in an ambush on the frontier he felt experienced man that he was that he should have foreseen it no one could have my father told my mother but sergeant blaine had never lost a troop before youre very wise simon but what became of the handgun that captain fordham used solve that mystery too its buried deep in the mud under the bridge where he was standing it fell from his height and through the height of the bridge enough force to bury it in the soft soil at the bottom of the lake but the police had searched and still hadnt found it i finished my tea and sat back in my chair will you drive me to little sefton id like to speak to lieutenant hart before inspector herbert sees him do you think thats wise simon asked i dont know whats wise anymore but inspector herbert has a second victim now hes probably already under a good deal of pressure to take someone into custody michael hart would solve all his problems as soon as the inspector speaks to helen calder hell order michaels arrest see if he doesnt that could be later this afternoon or evening are you convinced that michaels shoulder wound is as serious as he claimed you know as well as i do that severely wounded men can go on to do heroic things before they collapse hes a soldier he could stab her if he had towanted to what would be impossible for him to do is carry or drag her into the square afterward i bit my lip then added because i knew inspector herbert was already considering it it could explain why she was found in the square and not taken to the river as marjorie was yes id considered that myself he signaled to the waiter ill take you to little sefton only because i feel safer with you under my eye and then youll go back to somerset and stay there i promise but i crossed my fingers behind my back just in case simon took me to little sefton then did as i asked driving away after leaving me on alicias doorstep he was to return in precisely two hours he wasnt happy with that arrangement but i promised to stay with alicia i had the excuse of returning the borrowed photograph but i neednt have worried about my welcome she was delighted to see me from the twinkle in her eye i knew what she was thinking that i couldnt stay away long because my heart was given to michael hart she said nothing about that as she led me into her sitting room and asked if the photograph had helped indeed it has i told her the only problem is that officer is in france just now looking at the photograph id given her she said he looks like a nice sort and if hes someone gareth photographed he must be all right i changed the subject asking if the village had been reasonably quiet since my last visit thats right you havent heard have you i knew what must be coming whats happened michael hart was walking in his aunts garden pacing it more likely mrs king was passing by and she said he had the face of a bear so she didnt stop to speak and not a quarter of an hour later he went raging in to see constable tilmer claiming someone shot at him but constable tilmer couldnt find anyone whod heard one shot much less two and with all the windows open because of the warm evening youd have thought someone must have heard it what happened then constable tilmer searched the gardens and the back lanes and told the harts that all was well the excitement was over but michael wouldnt hear of it he demanded that the constable ring up scotland yard and report the incident directly and then we all went home to bed and that was the end of it who could possibly want to shoot lieutenant hart thats what everyone is asking jason markham claims it was a jealous husband she laughed at that if so he had very poor aim the village was taking the incident very lightly finding amusement in it but why should michael make up such a story too many drugs everyone says hearing things she shrugged is that true i dont know how the rumors got started but they did i imagine it was when michael first came here to rest after they had worked on his shoulder he wasnt himself at allbarely able to speak and even when he did he didnt always make sense slept much of the day and paced his room at nighti could see for myself once or twice that his lights were on until the small hours and his shadow passing between the lamp and the window back and forth back and forth even when he finally came outside where people could see him he was pale and often sweating and his eyes looked right through you such wounds can be terribly painful and the shoulder is awkwarddifficult to sit down difficult to lie down difficult to stand so you dont rest even when youre so sleepy you can hardly stay awake i hadnt thought of it that way alicia admitted it sounds pretty grim doesnt it it is grim i said and something to help with the pain is necessary he told the rector when he first came here that the next surgery would be drastic and he didnt want to survive it i could understand michael was used to being noticed he was handsome and charming and amusing people enjoyed his company but a man with only one arm was usually pitied not admired and amputation at the shoulder would be ugly alicia suggested a walk and i agreed thinking that if michael saw me with her he might come out and speak to us saving me from having to find a proper excuse for calling on him it helps the day go by faster she admitted as we leisurely strolled by the hart house walking knitting taking care of the gardensanything is better than worrying about gareth and i was right not five minutes later as alicia and i were retracing our steps michael hart came out his door and moved purposefully in our direction we were just by the churchyard when he caught us up alicia hastily recalled that she must have a word with the rector about flowers for the coming sunday services and left me alone you came back michael said as soon as he was near enough i could see that he had taken his pain medication last night for his eyes looked dull and his hands shook a little alicia was just telling me about your narrow escape hardly that he said an edge to his voice since i imagined the entire incident im surprised scotland yard didnt call to inform you of my delusions it was too close to the truth for comfort yes they do seek my advice regularly they dare not make a move without me he had the grace to apologize im sorry i wrenched my shoulder ducking the first shot afterward i had a long couple of nights men who had been at the front often ducked when a motorcar backfired or there was some other loud noise it was a reflex action learned to save their lives and not as easily unlearned in a peaceful setting like ones uncles garden and you never saw anyone or heard anything except for the shots you sound just like constable tilmer he told me sourly if id seen who it was i could have named him to the police or lacking that described him what makes you so certain it was a man i asked that gave him pause i just assumed it was he said after a moment and why would someone shoot at you i dont know unless someone believes i learned something in london that made me a threat such as he surprised me with his answer if someone learned that i went to scotland yard heshecould believe i went there to pass on information then why kill you now if the yard already knows what youve learned i havent worked that out yet are you sure you heard shots i mean as opposed to something that sounded very much like shots ive spent two years in france do you think id confuse a farmer scaring crows with a shotgun for a pistol shot no i walked a little way toward the church then turned again and walked back to where he was standing how did two shots miss you both of them think what you like he snapped and strode away i shook my head at his attitude then hurried after him michael be sensible listen to me he stopped and turned a stony face toward me already rejecting what i had to say if whoever it was missed you both times then it tells me the person aiming at you wasnt used to firearms and was either out of range or couldnt hold the weapon steady i wouldnt put it past victoria he answered bitterly but i thought it was more likely to be serena shed talked to inspector herbert and so had michael for all i knew she had seen him leaving the yard if it was serena this could be the second time shed fired at a human being and the first time she had hit her mark which would have frightened her if she hadnt intended murder i remember the first time i fired a revolver i missed the target and nearly hit a troop of monkeys in a tree it was six weeks before they ventured that near again he was smiling at the story about the monkeys but his mind wasnt on what i was saying did the police at least search for the spent bullets a cursory search i went back later to look on my own but its a garden for gods sake and finding anything would be a miracle lets have a look together he was about to refuse me but i stood there waiting and finally he said disagreeably all right then i wanted very much to tell him that handsome is as handsome does but that would be sinking to the same childish level still i was tempted and what would alicia think when she came back to find id gone off with michael hart that her stratagem had worked we walked in silence to the house where he was staying with his aunt and uncle the grassy path branched about threequarters of the way to the door and steppingstones led to a gate in a welltrimmed hedge through that i found myself in a very pretty formal garden small boxwoods lined the paths in a geometric pattern dividing the beds along the far side of the garden matching the hedge at the front gate was a bank of lilacs which must have been beautiful in the spring their fragrance wafting to the chairs set out on a narrow stone terrace rising above two shallow steps whats behind the lilacs the carriage drive to the stables beyond that a small orchard so someone could have come as far as the lilacs without being seen yes that was what the police suggested as well and where were you standing i was in the center by the little sundial my back to the lilacs the house had felt stuffy and id come out here but i couldnt sit still so i walked as far as the sundial stood there for several minutes and was just turning back to the terrace when i heard the shots he was right finding the spent bullet amongst the beds of roses peonies larkspur and other flowers in full bloom much less the loamy earth they were set in would be a miracle but i looked anyway if only to satisfy my own ambivalence about whether or not there were any shots at all i asked him to stand where he had been at the time and then i cast about looking under leaves in the earth even in the blossoms themselves after ten minutes he said impatiently i cant stand here much longer you arent going to find anything anyway lets sit on the terrace before i fall down he did look rather gray in the face i am stubborn just ask the colonel sahib go ahead and sit ill look a little longer and five minutes later my fingers scything gently through the soil around a rosebush in the next bed over came up with something hard i picked it up brushed it off and looked at it it was a readily identifiable bullet triumphant i carried it to michael and dropped it into the palm of his hand persistence i said simply he grinned at me and your fingers are filthy i regarded them wryly so they are now perhaps someone will believe me but there still remained a shadow of a doubt michael hart possessed his service revolver and he could just as easily have fired that shot into the rosebushes himself in the hope that the police would believe his story i sighed i must go back to somerset im here on sufferance anyway my family is convinced that youre a blackguard and im in danger of being shot in your company the grin deepened its a lie your mother adored me stay and ill take you to dinner somewhere i shook my head thank you but i must go i rose to leave and then said michael what if we never discover who killed marjorie if the police cant do it its not likely that anyone else will succeed where they failed and they keep jumping about first this and then that likelihood they wont keep searching forever ill keep looking if it takes me the rest of my life he told me grimly i wont desert her as everyone else has i said goodbye and left alicia was watching for me and smiled i saw you walking with michael hart to his aunts garden beautiful isnt it i agreed and then told her i must return to somerset she said you two didnt quarrel did you several times i answered silently then told her hes not at his best today dont let that discourage you i think he rather likes you i smiled and said with heavy irony thank you alicia you send me away happier than when i arrived did he tell you she went on that victoria marjorie evansons sister had a very public quarrel with him just this morning i dont know what precipitated it he was walking toward the church when she stopped him and suddenly there were loud voices and everyone turned to see what was happening what were they saying marjorie was buried here in the churchyard did you know that not with her husband but with her family when her body was released meriwethers sister refused to let her be laid to rest in their family plot i dont know if meriwether was told what her decision was i think hed have been very angry but she told victoria in no uncertain terms that marjorie was no longer considered a part of their family i hadnt known that or i would have visited her grave when i was here for the garden party but i should have guessed that serena would carry her anger that far she hadnt come to the service alicia was saying at any rate victoria accused michael hart of spending too much time there i know hes been there a few times not what i would call an inordinate number but she seemed to feel that having caused her sister so much grief in her life it was keeping the scandal alive for him to be seen there so often she believes that michael hart was the other man i think shes always been very jealous of the attachment between marjorie and michael and so she thinks it was an unhealthy one what does the rest of the village have to say theyre of two minds at a guess those who liked marjorie believed the best of her if she fell from grace they say it was out of loneliness those who are closer to victoria and her father seem to think that marjorie betrayed her family as well as her husband never mind what the truth might be never mind she agreed nodding with a sigh she said i know how easy it is to fall from grace i miss gareth so terribly sometimes that i cry myself to sleep im always afraid to answer the door for fear mr mason is on my doorstep this time to deliver bad news sometimes after his leave is over and hes been gone for months i cant quite remember the sound of my husbands voice or see his face as sharply as i did before and one day someone comes along who is kind thoughtful his touch is real and hes there and one is so hungry for companionship for someone who admires ones hair or makes one laugh or just brushes ones hand as he helps one into a motorcar that one is susceptible suddenly one is alive again and you tell yourself that you might well be a widow already and not even know it she broke off flushing with embarrassment a little silence fell then she said ive never succumbed ive been faithful in thought and deed but id be lying if i said that i could throw the first stone at marjorie wryly she added thats why i so enjoy your feelings for michael it lets me feel something vicariously misreading my expression of annoyance she said ive made you selfconscious havent i im sorry lets change the subject all right then why would victoria make such a public display of her feelings why not speak to michael quietly privately and ask him to be more discreet i rather think she wants the world to see him as an adulterer she wants him to be an object of contempt or shes jealous i leaned back in my chair and regarded the ceiling do you think victoria might decide to shoot at him at michael but why should she i dont know i told her truthfully perhaps to frighten him to make him leave little sefton and return to that clinic to make him a laughingstock or to return to the idea of jealousy to rid herself of him so that she wouldnt be reminded day in and day out that he still cares for marjorie but cares nothing for her i hadnt thought of it in that light alicia said considering my words but shes always had an uncertain temper spoiled children often do she might very well decide to shoot at himknowing that she would miss him i meanjust to be vindictive would you walk with me to the churchyard and show me marjories grave yes of course let me get my shawl she was back in only a moment i took one last look at the photograph id returned and then together we walked down the street to the churchyard there were any number of new graves the earth still brown and others where the grass was just a tender green i tried not to think that for every man who died of wounds here in england hundreds of others were buried in makeshift cemeteries in france the garrisons were buried in a cluster of graves on the right side of the church besides marjories mother and father there was a brother who had died at the age of six and her grandparents two uncles and their wives and a number of oldergeneration garrison relatives marjories grave was on the far side of her brothers as if victoria had elected to keep for herself the space that was next to her father after all marjorie the first to die was in no position to argue there were colorful fresh flowers on the raw earth i recognized some of them as varieties id seen in the garden belonging to michael harts aunt and uncle i could in a way understand victorias complaint for these tokens were there for all to see and speculate about they also pointed up the fact that victoria hadnt planted any flowers by the headstone herself there were pansies and forgetmenots and other lowgrowing blossoms rampant on the other graves michael was making it plain that marjorie didnt deserve to be ostracized by her family as well as her neighbors we were standing there together when the rector came around the corner of the church and spoke to us he remembered me from the fete and told me he was happy to see me again alicia has been rambling about in that empty house long enough he went on its nice that friends can come and stay we hope well see more of you i smiled and thanked him looking down at the grave he said did you know mrs evanson i told him the truth that i had nursed her husband and brought him home to england to recover from his burns and i left it at that he was a very fine man the rector told me the sort youre happy to see marrying one of the young women in your parish a tragedy that he should die of his wounds after coming so far yes i gestured toward the grave at my feet tell me about his wife a thoroughly nice young woman i shouldnt wish to speak ill of the dead but she was not really happy here she didnt see eye to eye with her sister or her father i never understood what lay behind that i was glad when she made a life for herself in london did victoria visit her there she went to london a few times he said frowning but i dont know that she visited marjorie i remember asking for news once when victoria had been up to see a play she told me shed been too busy to call on her sister he smiled sadly a shame really they had only each other he left us then and alicia said you know you really ought to speak to mrs eubanks shes the rectors cook now but she was the garrisons cook until she had words with victorias father and walked out that was ages ago before the war id all but forgotten i glanced at the watch pinned to my apron a cook would be starting preparations for dinner very shortly but it wouldnt take long to ask my questions im so glad you remembered and theres just time i started for the rectory ill go with you alicia said eagerly no thats probably not a good idea if shes kept any secrets all these years she might well not wish to make them public now and you live in the village but thats not fairit was i who told you about her alicia think about it for a moment she was angry ive helped you thus far its really unkind of you to shut me out now and i was the one who introduced you to michael alicia no youve just used me thats all i should have guessed victoria said you would you know the day of the fair i told her she was trying to make trouble but i see now she was right she turned and walked away hurt and disappointed i felt my own anger rising i liked alicia i wouldnt have upset her for the world but thanks to victorias meddling she had taken what id said in the worst possible light i called to her told her i was sorry but the damage had been done she kept walking and disappeared through her door without looking back i started after her and after a few steps stopped it was useless even if i could persuade her that id been wrong about mrs eubanks alicia would think i was apologizing because i still needed her help not because i meant it otherwise she would have come back when i called to her i couldnt help but wonder what else victoria could have said then recalled alicias parting words about michael hart she had enjoyed matchmaking but victoria had poisoned that as well with a heavy heart i crossed the churchyard to the rectory gardens and made my way to the kitchen yard and up the path to the outer door it led into a passage littered with boots and coats and umbrellas that had seen better days and thence into the kitchen i opened the door and the woman up to her elbows in flour and dough looked up ready to say something then stopped short ohyou arent rector if youre looking for him he should be in the vestry just now at the church are you mrs eubanks i asked but of course she must be short and compact she was graying although her face was unlined i put her age at perhaps fiftyfive i am and who might you be miss my name is elizabeth crawford im a nursing sister and one of my patients was lieutenant meriwether evanson i began i was with the convoy that brought him to england for treatment of his burns i explained that i was visiting with mrs dalton and she nodded i think i saw you with her at the garden fete yes i was here then as well the poor man we heard that he barely survived a fortnight after his wifes death i met him a time or two you know he came here to speak to rector in regard to marrying miss marjorie ive been learning a little about her as well alicia dalton said that you could tell me more about her than anyone else in little sefton would you mind we talked for a while about the evansons and it was clear that mrs eubanks would have been glad to go to london with them as their cook but she had already as she said gotten used to rectors little ways and he to mine i understand there was no love lost between marjorie and her sister mrs eubankss lips thinned into a hard line after a moment she said i know rector preaches that its wrong to hate anyone but i come as close to that as never mind when it comes to miss victoria shes a piece of work she had been making dough as i came in and now she turned it out onto a floured board and began to knead it vigorously i hoped it wouldnt be tough as nails as a result was she always so rude mrs eubanks turned her head to listen decided that no one could overhear us and said rudeness isnt the half of it my sister nancy god rest her soul worked with dr hale and when miss marjories dear mother went into labor prematurely he took nancy with him to help she was very good with women in labor and newborns she had that way about her did she thats a gift to be sure it is well mr and mrs garrison had only been married the seven months when miss marjorie was born and she had that breathing trouble that so often carries off those little ones born before their time but my sister and dr hale kept her alive and though she was sickly for months she survived and began to thrive it was a miracle and mr garrison paid my sister handsomely for her services so grateful he sang her praises to everyone who would listen i couldnt quite see where this was going but i looked encouraging and hoped she would continue but she set aside the dough and put the kettle on as if the subject were finished i could do with some tea she said getting out cups and the milk pitcher and a bowl of precious honey to sweeten it then she went to a cupboard and brought out a plate of biscuits that done she and i sat down at the table and she picked up the thread of her story all was well then the next child a little boy was born in winter with a weak chest as well and he didnt live very long after that came victoria and she was a lusty healthy little one kicking and crying with such strength you wouldnt believe it possible there was only four years difference in their ages and miss marjorie adored her sister but when victoria was about twelve their mother died the kettle was on the boil and mrs eubanks stopped to make the tea when she had poured our cups she sat down again miss marjorie and her mother were always close i expect because she nearly died and miss victoria was closer to her father they were always out and about together she followed him everywhere as soon as she could walk slowly with malice that girl set out to turn her father against her sister little things at first the spilled milk the broken vase any small mishap and it was blamed on miss marjorie even when the old dog died victoria swore miss marjorie had poisoned it when she was old enough to understand such things she told her father she didnt believe that miss marjorie was his true daughter that her mother must have been pregnant when she married and she would point out little thingsthe fact that miss marjorie looked more like her mother and not at all like her fatheri dont know what all the housekeeper was a friend of mine and shed tell me tales that made me want to cry but in the end victoria garrison got her way and mr garrison came to hate his own daughter hated the sight of her and nothing her mother could say changed his mind miss victoria had her fathers love but now she wanted all of her mothers and when she saw she wasnt going to get it she made the poor womans life a misery and her father stood by letting her do it it was as if he didnt have the courage to come right out and attack his wife himself but he enjoyed seeing her unhappy in spite of the tea i felt cold how vicious i said are you sure oh im sure once i found miss marjorie sitting in a corner of the rectory porch crying her eyes out and wet to the skin her sister had flung a pan of hot water at miss marjorie then told her father that miss marjorie had spilled it on purpose to get miss victoria into trouble i took her home and dried her off in my kitchen and fed her her dinner there too before sending her up the back stairs of her own house to her bed the next morning her father wouldnt let her eat her breakfast until shed apologized for lying but did you tell the rectoranyonewhat was going on i thought about it but i could do more for the child than rector could because i was there and if id told id have been sacked mr garrison had been a wonderful man stern but fair but hed changed he was cruel and cold then after his wife died he turned bitter you might say a child couldnt do such things but she did then what happened when the will was read mrs garrisons i mean shed left money to miss marjorie and as soon as she was of age she walked out the door of that house went to london and never set foot in it again even when her father died and she came for his service she stayed here in the rectory youve given me food for thought i told mrs eubanks and ill keep what youve told me in strictest confidence oh you can tell whoever you like i dont mind mr garrison is dead himself now and theres nothing miss victoria can do to me rector wouldnt let me go for a dozen miss victorias hed not know where to find anything and would starve to death if he had to cook for himself or do the wash she was secure in her own worth but i wondered if shed have spoken quite so freely in alicia daltons presence it was one thing to assert that the rector would keep her on but the parish priest served at the discretion of his vestry tell me about your sister nancy died young her and dr hale were killed one icy morning coming back from a difficult lying in mare slipped first then overturned the carriage and horse carriage and my sister went into the river dr hale was thrown out and his back was broken he lived a few hours long enough to tell everyone what had happened otherwise id not have been surprised to find miss victoria had had something to do with the accidentyoung as she was the venom in her voice was palpable i think she had talked to me not because id known marjories husband but because this had been bottled up inside for so long it was like a boil in need of lancing the pressure was so great and so painful how old was she at that time i couldnt help it i had to know the story had left me shocked as it was fourteen we finished our tea i saw mrs eubanks eyeing the chicken ready to garnish and put into the oven and i knew that now shed told her story she was ready to get back to work on the rectors dinner i thanked her and rose to leave she said i dont lie miss crawford i never did what i told you is the truth not that it matters now with miss marjorie gone and all but its been on my mind of late hearing of how she died i left her to her cooking and walked around the rectory toward the road i had hardly got to the end of the rectorys drive when i saw policemen just coming out of the harts house and between two constables walked michael hart his face black as a thundercloud in front of them strode inspector herbert mouth grim eyes looking neither right nor left chapter fourteen i stood there rooted to the spot not sure what to say or do for all of several seconds and then i was striding across the street and brushing past victoria garrison who was standing in the middle of it a gloating expression on her face she said as i passed her in a voice pitched for my ears only hes going to the hangman and theres nothing you can do to prevent it i ignored her she wasnt the only person watching as lieutenant hart was being taken into custody alicia was there looking stricken and others i recognized from the church fete i caught up with inspector herbert as he came through the harts gate he started with surprise when he saw me then glowered what are you doing in little sefton miss crawford visiting friends i snapped and its just as well im here to tell you youre making a mistake mrs calder isnt completely out of danger and they are keeping her sedated but the doctors and the nursing sisters have told me that as she rouses a little she repeats the name michael over and over again when she does shes restless and they believe shes afraid in whatever limbo shes in a deeply rooted residual fear from her attack that she cant face it made sense of course but i wasnt ready to give up so easily nonsense i said briskly thats merely one interpretation ive sat beside men who were hardly more than boys as they recover from surgery they call for their mothersor if theyre married sometimes for their wives am i to believe that these soldiers feel their mothers are responsible for their wounds its not the same he began how can you be so certain ive never once heard them cry out the name of a german soldier or the kaiser youre being ridiculous but i could see he was weakening by this time michael and his escort had caught up with us he said sharply elizabeth stay out of this oh do hush i retorted barely glancing at him turning again to inspector herbert i asked what other evidence do you have that lieutenant hart is guilty of murder he was in london the night that marjorie evanson died and again last night i turned to michael surprise in my face but thats impossible he had the grace to look ashamed im sorry we found the marks he dragged her hes strong enough to do that onehanded he gripped the collars of her clothing and dragged her into those shrubs we found the bits of grass and earth on the heels of her shoes i swallowed hard and no one saw him it was a summers evening and no one was looking out a window on hamilton place to see a man loitering or to see him with mrs calder or in the square no one i had men canvassing the street at eight oclock this morning how did he get to london he required permission from his doctors before i could take him there if youll step out of the way miss crawford well finish our business here and take lieutenant hart to london behind them i could see michaels aunt in the door her face white her hand to her mouth next to her stood her husband his face pale with shock i turned to michael who took you to london whose motorcar did you use my own he said harshly victoria agreed to drive me i stepped back then where was she when you were supposed to be killing mrs calder ask her i left her at the theater she wanted to see the man who vanished i whirled on inspector herbert have you verified that i spoke to miss garrison earlier she paid for her ticket handed it in and took her seat that much is certain she was waiting outside the theater when lieutenant hart was to return for her i have three witnesses to that a voice behind me said let it go bess it was simon i didnt know he had already come back for me i said but and he repeated let it go i took a deep breath and moved out of inspector herberts path he went directly to the motorcar he had waiting and michael passed me without a glance taking his place in the vehicle as ordered one of the constables was driving and he slowly moved through the spectators cluttering the street i felt like bursting into tears not from frustration but from anger helpless furious anger at inspector herbert at victoria garrison and at michael hart as well i let simon guide me to where hed left his motorcar and got in without a word im sorry bess he said as he stepped in beside me truly hes not guilty inspector herbert will come to his senses and realize that for himself very likely looking over my shoulder i could see alicia her expression was pity vying with doubt you dont mean that youre just trying to make me feel better i added as the village disappeared behind us im not my dear girl im agreeing with you i glanced at him and saw that he was telling me the truth i thought you didnt care for the handsome lieutenant he said after a time you certainly put up a brave defense on his behalf i respect the fact that a scotland yard inspector has a great deal more experience in these matters than i have but hes been floundering from the start simon there could be any number of reasons why mrs calder is saying michaels name over and over again inspector herbert should have waited until she could speak before taking any action whats more it could be that victoria is lying but i knew she wasnt the police had already looked into that too then where had michael gone when he left her at the theater simon glanced at me if hes innocent bess inspector herbert will have to let him go you neednt worry i closed my eyes trying to read michaels face as the policemen had brought him out i could see it still and what i read there was anger not innocence he hadnt protested i had and i could feel my cheeks burn with the memory not because i was ashamed of my defense of him but because i knew that inspector herbert would see it very differently like everyone else who had been a witness to that scene to him it would point to my feelings for michael rather than any objectivity on my part and then i knew what i had to do there might not be another chance pleasesimoni must go back its important i told him urgently he slowed but said its not wise bess it took several minutes to convince him but in the end he reluctantly turned back toward little sefton i touched his arm in silent gratitude the crowd had dispersed although a few people stood about in knots whispering i ignored their stares as we passed i left simon in the motorcar and went up the walk to the harts door someone had already begun to draw the drapes as if trying to shut out the stares of neighbors feeling every eye in little sefton pinned to my back i knocked at the door and after a time an elderly maid opened it and told me that the family was not receiving today i understand i began and then mr hart was in the passage behind her saying its all right sarah let her come in he led me into the drawing room the walls painted a pleasing yellow with white trim and a soft green in the drapes they had been pulled making the room seem dark and rather claustrophobic as if he sensed my reaction mr hart went to a table and lit the lamp sitting there he appeared to have aged his face still pale lines etched more deeply than i remembered i said forgive me im so sorry to intrude you defended him out there i dont believe hes guilty could you tell me what the police said and what happened when they told michael what they wanted to do i feel its my fault he said taking the chair across from mine hed asked me again if i would take him up to london but i wasnt very keen on driving that far and besides this is our busiest time at the farm i asked him why it was so important to go just then he told me he needed to speak to helen calder i dont know if youre aware of it but shes related to marjorie on her mothers side he didnt say why only that he wanted to see her in person rather than telephone her it was an arduous trip for himthe last time after hed gone there with you he was exhausted for two days in my minds eye i could still see helen calder lying there on her cot pale and unresponsive after her surgery i dont understand if it was so important why didnt he call on her when i drove him to london mr hart shook his head michael has always been impetuous it might not have mattered then you know and with this wound he seems to be unable to settle to anything i know hes in great discomfort at times i hear him pacing at night the doctors think hes developing a tolerance to the sedatives hes been given and it requires higher and higher doses to help now i wondered what relief hed be given in a prison infirmary or cell did he tell inspector herbert about wanting to see mrs calder im afraidin my ignorance you seethat i told him michael was sleeping when they came and his aunt went to rouse him sometimes thats difficult meanwhile the police asked if hed just returned from london and i told the inspector that he had i was asked why hed gone to london and i told them i saw no reason not to and i had no way of knowing why they were here and that had been damning were you present when they questioned your nephew oh yes i insisted on being present weve always had him in our care you see and i could tell from michaels face that something must be wrong did he tell them hed spoken to mrs calder he told them hed gone to her house and apparently they already knew that but she wasnt at home he told the maid at the door that he would wait for a time but after a while his shoulder was hurting badly and he left mr hart took a deep breath inspector herbert told me mrs calder is very seriously injured and hasnt regained consciousness after her surgery its true we can only hope that when she does shell remember who attacked her and why but even as i said the words i knew it was very unlikely that mrs calder would remember anything after leaving her friends house not after such loss of blood and the ensuing surgery the mind has a way of blotting out what it doesnt wish to think about i must apologize for asking this i said but its important had michael been violent as a child angry moody sometimes acting rashly or has he acted this way only on his leaves from france if there was anything like that in his army records it would be used against him no no mr hart said alarmed theres been nothing of the sort he came to us while his parents were abroad and as a boy he was very much the way you see him now nor has the war changed him although ive seen a darker side of him of late this wound has tried his patience he was never one to sit idle whatever mr hart preferred to believe war did change men id seen it in india and in the wards of the wounded it was just that some were better at hiding it than others and the darker side he spoke of might be a sign that michael could explode into violence in the right conditions if only helen calder had come to her senses before inspector herbert came down to little sefton i thanked mr hart and told him id let him know as soon as i heard anything about helen calder poor woman i didnt know her well he said as he walked with me to the door she and her mother didnt come to little sefton very often and she was a little older than marjorie with his hand on the latch he turned to face me and i could see the effort he was making to hold himself together i cant quite come to grips with any of this my wife is making herself ill with worry if michael isnt released soon i hesitate to think what will become of us i wished i could offer some comfort i smiled and said early days mr hart well face that bridge when we must cross it he nodded but the heart had gone out of him as i stepped out the door i cast a glance toward the street but the curious onlookers had gone about their business there was only simon waiting for me in his motorcar mr hart quietly closed the door behind me hoping not to disturb his wife simon opened my door and as i settled myself in my seat he reached out and without speaking held my hand until we had left little sefton far behind us when we arrived in somerset my mother was full of plans for a dinner party she was giving the next night a chance for me to see and greet old friends her enthusiasm was jarring in the mood i was in and the colonel sahib gave me a quizzical look one that said he sympathized but that i owed my mother the courtesy of entering into the event in the spirit shed have wanted simon the coward had vanished the instant the words dinner party were spoken and there was no one left to spare me mothers good intentions and so i was swept off to see what the kitchen could manage that was halfway edible and there was no time to sit down and think through events that clearly was everyones intention i barely had time to wonder how michael for his sins was faring languishing in gaol i hoped he was absolutely wretched my mother did ask in passing if i would wish to invite that handsome young lieutenant as well i realized that she hadnt heard the latest turn of events i didnt have the energy to explain them to her and so i told her that i didnt think he would be available the colonel sahib having spoken privately to simon wondered as i walked into his study if he should anticipate a passionate plea for his intervention if matters looked grim for my lieutenant hes not my lieutenant if he was anybodys lieutenant he was marjorie evansons besides im sure simon also told you it wasnt likely that michael would be in custody for very long he did seem to think that lieutenant hart had acted rather foolishly going in to london the worst part of it is i said wandering from the window to take a chair across from his the woman he was desperate enough to ask to drive him to london is no friend of marjorie evansons i think she was pleased to see michael taken up are you certain about that i told him what mrs eubanks the cook had had to say of course servant gossip cant always be relied on for truthfulness he pointed out but when theres heavy smoke theres often fire i think she told the truth as she sees it i agreed she didnt like victoria and so she was ready to lay all the blame at her door but everyonealicia the rector michael himselfhad also told me that there was no love lost between the sisters marjorie left home as soon as she could after her mother died and her father did nothing to stop her from going the wonder is he didnt think of disinheriting her once mrs garrison was dead and that may well be victoria garrisons problem in spite of all shed done to make him believe the first daughter wasnt his in the end he had doubts i looked at him you are clever i said it would explain so much after a moment i went on granted i havent known these people for very long but i was drawn into their lives because i was a witness to what happened if the police had found mrs evansons killer straightaway that would have been the end of it not every murder inquiry leads to someone being taken into custody much less tried and convicted god forbid that mrs calder should die but if she does and there is no explanation of why she had called the lieutenants name in extremis a shadow will hang over him for the rest of his life it might be better to have a trial and clear him of any culpability what if hes convicted theres that risk as well my father paused who would you suggest as the murderer the police are looking for i shook my head feeling tired suddenly i dont know then you can understand inspector herberts dilemma i smiled against my will i would very much like it to be victoria my father laughed from what simon tells me this inspector herbert is no fool he tells you that because inspector herbert advised me to stay out of the yards affairs good advice for what was left of the afternoon i helped my mother plan her dinner shaking out the best table linens stored away in lavender and helping with the polishing of the silver and then i washed glasses and dried them carefully she and i worked side by side in contented silence or chatted about whatever i needed for my return france and all the while my mind was busy with what the colonel sahib had asked me who had killed marjorie evanson i was no closer to an answer by the end of the day the menu given all the shortages of food presented a problem sighing my mother said do you suppose we could ask our guests to bring their own chickens i laughed then changing the subject as she so easily could when one least expected it she added you may as well tell me what is going on it will save me from having to cajole your father i was savedquite literallyby nell appearing in the doorway miss elizabeth she said theres a message for you the boot boy sammy from the four doves just brought it round i took the folded sheet she held out to me and opened it a hasty scrawl read ive just been told is it true please will you come and talk to me it was signed serena melton i refolded it and turned to my mother we might not need those chickens after all as i left the room she answered i hadnt had my heart set on them you know i drove to the four doves wondering all the way there if serena melton had somehow discovered scotland yards interest in her brotherinlaw raymond i didnt see how she could have found that outor my role in identifying him her husband jack was important in the cryptology section but that gave him no influence with the police or even the home office but then news sometimes had a way of leaking out someone else could have heard and then called him id already confessed to him that id seen the man the doors to the inn were standing wide allowing late sunlight to pour through into the small reception area gilding the polished wood of the floors the woman behind the desk greeted me warmly as i came in grayhaired and grayeyed she could pose for one of the original doves but she had taken her sons place running the little inn when he went off to war and had managed to keep it up despite the lack of nearly everything from paint to food good afternoon mrs cox i said ive just received a message from a visitor is she still here yes i put her in the small parlor she was reluctant to come to the house heaven knows why i knew why the last time wed met serena had called me a liar i thanked mrs cox and started for the parlor shall i bring you tea we dont have any biscuits today im afraid i knew she needed the business and agreed that that would be nice but i doubted serena melton would stay long enough to drink it she was standing when i walked into the little parlor as if she had been pacing the floor while waiting to see if i would come to her or not miss crawford she said as soon as she saw me bess hello serena we hesitated decided not to shake hands and i sat down it took her a moment to rally herself and then she said i hope youve forgiven me for the things i said when we parted at the railway station i was under considerable strain and it seemed then that everyone was set against me i felt an obligation to find out who the man was in marjories lifei owe that to my brotherbut it has been a very difficult task ive set myself and i have no experience to guide me it was a long preamble i was beginning to feel a little ill at ease i can appreciate your determination serena but i think the police are better at getting to the truth but they havent in all this time until now im told you were there and i need to know if i can believeif its true is it the same man who seduced her ireally dont know serena im as much in the dark as you but you were there she pressed you must know something i dont fault you for not telling me not after the way i behaved earlier still for meriwethers sake if not mine perhaps youll tell me what you know thinking she might be more willing to reveal her sources now when she wanted something from me than after id answered her questions i said first id like to ask you how you knew that i was present the door opened and mrs cox came in with the tea tray smiling she set it down on the table next to me and then quietly withdrew busying myself with the pot and the cups i asked serena how she preferred her tea all the while wondering how much i could safely tell her about that night in the rain when id seen marjorie evanson i nearly dropped the cup i was about to hand her when she said victoria garrison telephoned me she felt i ought to know i cant think whyshe and i had words over where her sister was to be interred to be honest under the circumstances i didnt want marjorie lying next to meriwether and victoria didnt want marjorie to be returned to little sefton even when merry was alive i didnt see victoria very often and i could tell she and marjorie never got on i wasnt sure whether she was gloating or intended to be kind when she telephoned me oh dear i thought rapidly reassessing what it was she must be wanting me to tell her id come all too close to revealing more than i should because it was on my mind and not hers do you mean when michael was taken into custody yes yes the police had come to arrest him for the attack on mrs calder as well as marjories murder is it true did he do those things id suspected he and marjorie were close even before she married my brother but if he killed her was he also her lover i must know michael always struck me as someone who used his charm for his own advantage i never could tell when he was serious or not but hes been in france or so id thought and it never occurred to me to look in his direction until now i think the police have probably made a mistake i said i dont know michael all that well you see i was there yes but i couldnt quite understand why the police feel he killed marjorie he admits he was in london at the time so i have heard she interrupted eagerly he was there he had the opportunity id persuaded jack to find out who was in england around that time but i never even thought about michael but he was here to have his eye treatedand hes recovering from other wounds now its hard to believe he could have managed either attack physically i mean you dont know what men are capable of when they put their minds to it she informed me darkly you arent married you dont know how determined they can be no you dont understand he ran a terrible risk medically if his eye had hemorrhaged he could have lost his sight and now he was likely to do serious damage to his shoulder after all the surgeries and the pain hes had to endure i dont see him taking that chance it could mean losing his arm and he realizes that it would be foolish it might seem foolish to you she told me but we cant know what was in his mind if he was her loverand im not convinced of thatwhy should he then wish to kill her and i asked myself why was she weeping copiously on raymond meltons shoulder if it was michael who had got her pregnant unless michael not knowing he would be in london had asked a friend to act for him she might have told him it was over that meriwether was coming home and she wanted to go back to him jealousy is a powerful emotion sometimes people who are as handsome as michael cant accept rejection theyre used to being adored she had worked it all out in her mind just as inspector herbert had done yes of course thats possible i argued but then why should he want to harm mrs calder perhaps she just found out he was in london then and marjorie had already told her about a man she was seeing helen calder realized what that must mean and she could have told michael what she intended to do giving him the opportunity to do the right thing and turn himself in i dont know helen calder well but she is very conventional isnt she or maybe she herself really didnt want to get involved with the police mrs calder was rather conventional it would explain why michael urgently wanted to go up to london could serena be right but why had he told his uncle he was intending to see mrs calder why not claim he needed to visit a doctor why did he take a knife with him when i hesitated serena said he couldnt be sure could he that she wouldnt go to the police herself its possible he only wanted to persuade her she was wrong serena youve made a very strong case but its mostly conjecture theres no way of knowing how true it really is her face hardened victoria told me youd argued with the police inspector and youre standing up for michael now she set her teacup aside she told me too that you were in love with michael hart all i wanted to know is was victoria right can i believe her that the police actually took him into custody that hes not just helping them with their inquiries marjorie didnt trust her sister can i i let out my breath in a sign of frustration in the first place im not in love with lieutenant hart ive told you i hardly know him in the second its true he was taken into custody and that i was present and yes i did argue with the inspector i thought his case a very poor one medically i didnt see how michael hart could have attacked those two women but inspector herbert is convinced that it was possible and finally victoria garrison is a troublemaker the only reason i can think of for her to telephone you and tell you about michael is to stir up your grief all over again she settled her score with you dont you see standing she said i shouldnt have come i just want to see the end of this business so that my brother can finally rest in peace i felt like telling her that her brother might have found that peace if she herself hadnt told him the whole truth about his wife it had been unnecessarily hurtful the only reason i could think of for her not to shield him was her own jealousy that she was both shocked and gloating that marjorie had fallen so far from grace and now it was serena who needed to find some peace i said serena i can understand that you want to see marjories murderer caught he got around you just as he got around marjorie didnt he you cant see beyond that but i can i can see him clearly she marched to the door selfrighteous indignation in every stride i waited until she had reached it then asked serena someone shot at lieutenant hart earlier this week whoever it was missed him both times was it you that stopped her cold i added there was a weapon missing from your husbands gun cabinet a revolver at a guess you are grasping at straws arent you jack carries a weapon when hes in london for selfprotection because of the work he does id hardly call that missing and she was gone i could hear the outer door of the four doves shutting with what might be called some force setting the cups back on the tea tray i went to thank mrs cox and settle the account for our tea she said your visitor was crying when she left is everything all right surprised i answered she hoped for good news mrs cox nodded we could all use a little of that i just wished helen calder would regain consciousness and tell us what she remembered good newsor badbut better than this limbo the dinner party went exceedingly well our cook outdoing herself with the chickens and even with a lovely french tart for the sweet i couldnt help but wonder where she had found the sugar for the glaze most of all i enjoyed the guests many of them friends of my parents a few of them friends of mine diana was in london and arrived in high spirits flirting with simon although mary had told me it was likely she would be engaged by the autumn another of my flatmates elayne was a surprise i hadnt seen her in weeks and we had much to catch up on she too was expecting a proposal she said and i was happy for her even melinda crawford had traveled all the way from kent she and my father were distantly related and both her husband and her father had served in india in their time as she leaned on simons arm as we went in to dinner she said when this wicked war is finished i want to go back to india ive unfinished business there will you take me overhearing that i made a promise to myself that i would go with them throughout that dinner i enjoyed watching my mothers face she loved entertaining did it well and was a clever hostess i smiled at her down the table and won a smile in return my leave was nearly up i felt a twinge of regret knowing how much this time meant to my parents chapter fifteen i had wanted to see alicia dalton before i left for france to apologize again for hurting her feelings but there was much to do the morning after the party and i couldnt leave all of that to my mother and nell and i was waiting for news of helen calder diana had promised to find out what she could simon had driven melinda crawford to the train and my mother had taken the last of the chicken made up as a fricassee to two elderly women in the village my father had been summoned to sandhurst for a ceremony of some sort and i was rather at loose ends remembering that victoria had telephoned serena i decided i would return the favor as the call was being put through i realized too late that i should have left well enough alone this was borne in upon me by the coldness in victoria garrisons voice when i told her who i was i should have thought i would be the last person you wished to speak with she said after what happened the other day refusing to be drawn i asked miss garrison did lieutenant hart tell you why he wanted to go to london why dont you ask inspector herbert ive told him what i know it was you who took michael there and so im asking you someone had told him i had tickets for that play i didnt twist his arm he came to me he said he would very much like to see it i was surprised but i was glad of the company driving back after the performance and then later when we reached london he hurt his shoulder getting out of the motorcar and he was in pain he couldnt sit still and even before the curtain went up he walked out saying that he needed air i offered to go with him but he told me to stay there he wouldnt be gone very long when he hadnt returned by intermission i went to look for him i missed a part of the play searching the doorman told me he thought hed seen the lieutenant leave the theater i couldnt think where he might have gone i went back to my seat and toward the end of the last act he was there looking as white as id ever seen him his hands shaking i drove him home and he had very little to say for himself i was very angry with him i thought him selfish to ask to come and then to ruin my evening did he tell you where hed been he said hed walked until he was too exhausted to walk any longer he found a cab and was driven back to the theater did you believe him i didnt know whether to believe him or not i wondered if hed had no interest in the play after all and had only used me to bring him to town could the people who had the seats nearest you swear that you were alone until the end of the play she was angry then are you suggesting that i wasnt there either i hadnt been id just wondered if shed been lying but she was furious and said you wont get him off you know however much you try i tell you i was lucky that he didnt decide to kill me on the way home i didnt know then that he was a murderer but i dont understand why you should think he would harm marjorie or had any reason at all to attack helen calder if he couldnt bear to sit still he might well have tried to walk instead there was silence for a moment and then she said there was a dark smear on his sleeve i pointed it out to him and he said hed stopped for a glass of wine and spilled some of it then tried to wash it out with cold water the sleeve was still damp it must have been true i couldnt decide if she was telling the truth about that her voice seemed a little different somehow or had i imagined it that still doesnt explain the next day a friend telephoned to tell me about helen calder she knew that helen was a connection on my mothers side she lives across the square shed watched the police come and go from the garden and shed sent her husband to find out what had happened he told her that helen calder had been the victim of a knifing and he thought she must be dead but his wife had seen an ambulance come and then leave i expect she hoped that i might know more about the attack she said helen calders assailant hadnt been found i still dont see the connection with michael hart i pressed my friendmrs dalytold me she herself had seen a young officer with his arm in a sling come to helen calders door earlier in the evening he spoke to the maid then left to sit in the garden for a time before walking away my heart sank whether that maid knew michael by name didnt matter her description of the caller would be enough that coupled with victorias statement about the stained sleeve would be telling evidence do you really believe he killed marjorie i asked as soon as i could collect my thoughts oh yes once the police asked me if i was aware that he was in london on that same day i knew it must be so someone got her pregnant did you know that the police told me she was pregnant when she died if michael had found that out i think he would have killed her out of sheer jealousy i was convinced from the start that she must have written to him in france and confided in him that shed had an affair she always had confided in him why shouldnt she turn to him now i kept after him to tell me if he knew the name of the man shed been seeing and he swore he didnt i was starting to believe him did you know he hadnt even told his aunt and uncle that he was in london that night but he must have told marjorie hed found a way to get leave and confront her her voice changed again and i wished i could see her face he never got over her marriage did you know that he always thought shed marry him i remember him at the wedding looking as if hed like to snatch the bride up and ride off with her across his saddle bow that made a dreadful sense after the man at the station raymond melton walked away from her marjorie would very likely have turned to michael but why should he kill helen calder how should i know perhaps hes still trying to find out marjories lovers name for all i know michael intended to kill him next but helen hadnt known who the man was at least she told me she didnt someone shot at michael perhaps it was the same person who killed marjorie and tried to kill mrs calder you are pathetic she said dont you know what that was about i knew the minute i heard about it michael was trying to kill himself and he failed he couldnt quite bring himself to do it so he invented someone shooting from the bushes to spare his aunt and uncle the truth someone was bound to have heard the shots i felt ill unable to think of anything to say i hadnt considered suicide victoria interpreted the silence and laughed its rather shocking isnt it to realize hes in love with a dead woman he hasnt let her go but youre like all the rest thats why you came to his defense when the police wanted to take him away even dead marjorie still has him in thrall there was a sudden break in her voice and i realized that she was talking about her own sense of loss not mine and then before i could answer she added harshly her voice hardly recognizable they wont hang him you know until that shoulder is fully healed but hang him they will mark my words and it will be my testimony that will put the noose around his neck there was a click at the other end of the line victoria had hung up before she gave herself away i stood there for a moment the receiver still in my hand then put it up victoria was angry vindictive but michael had sealed his own fate when he lifted the knocker on helen calders door if the maid knew him by sight or could identify him the police had all the evidence they wanted for a fleeting moment i wondered if victoria had tricked michael and while he was walking off the pain in his shoulder she had taken advantage of his absence to kill mrs calder herself from the start id been surprised to hear that michael and victoria had gone anywhere together much less london why had he asked why had she agreed could victoria stab two women i could have asked michaelbut he was beyond reach feeling closed in i went out into the gardens thinking to refresh the vases wed arranged for the dinner party now that he had michael in custody would inspector herbert still summon raymond melton to england to make a statement or would that be left to the kc who was preparing the prosecution i wanted to hear just what had been said at that meeting in the railway station if captain melton had made promises he had given them grudgingly and they had provided no comfort marjorie deserved better i was ready to go back to france but i wanted very badly to be here when helen calder regained her senses and time was running out my father met me as i came through the garden doors into the passage hallo he took one look at me ive seen pathan warriors with happier faces care to talk about it i smiled i just had a conversation with victoria garrison she could probably hold the khyber pass singlehandedly with a fork as he laughed i went on ive been trying to decide if lieutenant hart is the sort of man to want to kill himself do you mean before his trial no earlier according to victoria no one fired at him as he walked in the garden the only reason i can think of for a suicide attempt is guilt and why two shots its hard to miss with a revolver if youre serious about using it he led me to his sanctuary the study full of trophies from his years in the army and offered me the chair across from his especially twice unless one intends to miss in which case its a cry for help if it was a cry for help he covered it up very well indeed i stared into the golden glass eyes of a bengal man hunter a tiger that had killed fourteen villagers before my father brought it down more important id like to know if he lied to me and if he did what else had he lied about conversely if it was victorias lie it could have other implications theres a big difference between being shot at and shooting ones self i turned to look at my father i also have to wonder why victoria agreed to drive him into londonand id give much to know what they talked about on the way i do know he didnt tell her who he expected to see while there it would be wiser dont you think to leave the entire matter in the capable hands of inspector herbert i have done it doesnt stop me from wondering or from weighing up what i know or suspect and youd be content to see victoria garrison as a murderess its entirely possible that she could have killed her sister and tried to make it appear that it was a random act of violence on the part of someone nameless and faceless in london thats a damning comment yes but victoria is so filled with somethinghate envy jealousya wantingthat she might have seen her chance and taken it before shed even considered what she was doing women dont usually carry a large knife in their purses which was an excellent point i smiled youve just shot down my best argument for victoria as a murderess im not saying it couldnt be done only that she would have had to plan carefully he considered me ill be just as happy to see you back in france if you want to know the truth out of reach you ask too many questionsif the police are wrong about michael then you will need to be cautious being shot at by germans is preferable to being stabbed by englishmen absolutely just dont tell your mother i said that he paused if you must go back to london before you leave do take simon with you i promised and felt the eyes of the bengal tiger follow me from the room my distant grandmother who had followed her officer husband to brussels in june and helped nurse the wounded brought in from waterloo was not certain until well into the next evening whether her husband was among the living or the dead reports had come in placing him in the heat of the battle and various accounts had listed him as dead severely wounded or missing but she had held to her faith in his ability to survive and her words to him as he finally walked into the house they had taken in brussels had been my dear im so sorry there seems to be nothing for your dinner my mother dealing with the ravages of this wars shortages still managed to put a decent meal on the table and i was reminded of marys remark that a country house fared better in trying times it was simons night to join us and we were finishing our soup when he said youll never guess who i ran into as i was coming out of my meeting today i thought he was talking to my father then looked up to realize that he was speaking to me i named several retired officers wed known in other campaigns and he shook his head each time i give up tell me jack melton i stared at him you didnt mention his brother did you i wouldnt have put it past simon to have engineered the meeting for the sole purpose of finding out what i would like to know about raymond melton i did ask how his brother was it was the decent thing to do he said smug as a cat with a mouthful of canary feathers well then hes presently near ypres you might keep that in mind when you go back to france next week little good that will do me ive no idea where ill be sent next what else did you learn i asked that melton wasnt particularly at ease talking about his brother his answers were short as if it wasnt a subject he was comfortable with simon brandon had dealt with men all his adult lifesoldiers prisoners angry villagers men in trouble afraid lying angry vindictive he could read them without effort because it had become second nature i knew he could read me as well and oddly enough it was one of the things that made me trust him i set aside my soup spoon when i learned that the man was his brother i found myself wondering if what id said to jack melton outside the marlborough hotel in london might not have put him on to raymond as the man id mentioned i didnt describe him of course but jack was rather short with me as well almost rude in fact still he must not have said anything to his wifeshed have brought it up when she came to somerset to see me very likely not my father put in on the other hand by the very nature of his work in cryptology melton isnt likely to be talkative he cant afford to be given what he reads every day in dispatches and intercepts after a while secretiveness must become a way of life its more likely that he prefers to steer serena away from suspecting his brother was the man with marjorie shes angry enough to cause trouble and that wouldnt go down well with his superiors either id had a taste of how angry she could be and how hurtful but its rather twofaced of him isnt it protecting the man who seduced his brotherinlaws wife i expect my mother said surprising us all mr melton feels that since marjorie evanson is dead and her child with her theres no point in ruining his brothers marriage career or life its finished and so he can simply put it behind him it was a very perceptive remark and now she went on perhaps we can dispense with murder as a subject for dinner conversation not five minutes later i was summoned to the telephone i almost failed to recognize the voice at the other end this is matron speaking i thought she meant matron at laurel house and was about to greet her warmly when the voice continued at st martins hospital in london yes matron this is sister crawford i thought perhaps youd want to know that mrs calder is out of danger and has been removed from the surgical ward to the womens ward we have kept her heavily sedated to keep her quiet but thats been reduced and i expect her to regain consciousness in a few hours i should like very much to be there i said will i be permitted to see her i see no reason why not unless scotland yard objects ill be there i promised and if she awakens before i arrive will you tell her that im on my way ill be happy to she said and rang off i hurried back to the dining room i must go to london tonightas soon as may be simon was already pushing his chair back ill drive my mother said to me i suggest you finish your meal first my dear ten minutes shouldnt matter not with simon at the wheel and so we finished our dinner in almost indecent haste and then i was rushing upstairs to change and fetch my coat i was tense on the drive to london the hours crept by and simon said little his concentration on the road intense it was late when we walked through the doors of the hospital and asked for matron she greeted me and with a warning not to tire her patient she turned me over to a young nursing sister simon was asked to remain outside he touched my arm and said quietly ill wait in the motorcar i nodded grateful and then i was shown to a bed near the middle of the ward a small lamp burned above the bed leaving the rest of the room in darkness i could hear the quiet breathing of other patients and one moaned softly helen calders eyes were closed and she appeared to be sleeping as well as i took the chair by her bedside she must have heard the slight rustle of my skirts for she stirred a little and bit her lip as if in pain i said in a low voice that i hoped would carry only to her ears helen do you remember me its bess crawford she opened her eyes focusing them with some difficulty at first and then she said faintly oh yes of course how kind of you to come and see me my family has just left then youll be tired i just wished to be sure that you were recovering is there anything i can do to make you more comfortable is there anything you need the young woman in the bed behind me coughed a little and then slept again the sisters have been so good she said but i hurt ill ask them to look in on you i promised i was so shocked by the news i went on do you have any memory of what happened i remember dressing and leaving the house looking forward to dining with friends and then i woke up here and didnt know where i was she frowned im told i was attackedknifed as i came home alone is it true im afraid so but who would do such a thing a tear ran from the corner of her eye down her pale cheek ive never harmed anyone not ever her voice trailed off youre safe now i touched her hand let the police deal with it her fingers closed tightly over mine bessits frightening that i cant remember they tell me it happens the shock they said she moved restlessly im told it will all come back only im not sure i want it to if it starts to return ask a nurse to send for the police i said trying to soothe her theyll want to know it will help them apprehend whoever did this yes thats what inspector hemmingsno thats not right she closed her eyes i didnt imagine him she was still drifting in and out of consciousness inspector herbert i said from scotland yard was he here did you see him ive spoken to him before about marjorie evanson thats right you were anxious to find out who killed her did hedid inspector herbert ask you about lieutenant michael hart i cant think why he wished to know if id seen him last nightno it wasnt last night was it im so confused it doesnt matter i answered her though i felt myself go cold he told me id been calling michaels name when i was found and brought to hospital but that makes no sense id have asked for my husband wouldnt i not for michael perhaps you were thinking about him not at dinnerafterward i told myself that i must stop now before i heard more than i wanted to hear if she brought back some fleeting memory that would damn michael it would all be my doing but truth is something id been taught to value i couldnt walk away from it whatever the consequences afterward i asked before my courage ran out but she had drifted into sleep and i recalled my promise to speak to one of the sisters and tell them she was in pain still i sat there for another several minutes in case she awoke again then after a brief conversation with the ward sister i left feeling very depressed for helen calders sake and my own i was just walking down the steps of the hospital taking a deep breath of the cooling evening air after the familiar smells of the wards and nearly passed inspector herbert without noticing him so distracted that i just registered a man coming toward me miss crawford he said stopping me he frowned not questioning my witness i hope im a nurse i replied shortly and the patient is someone i know he nodded how is she she wasnt making much sense earlier the ward sister tells me shes doing as well as can be expected the fear as always is infection from the knife from bits of cloth driven into her wounds from the surgery itself shes healthy and thats in her favor theyre still sedating her for her pain it was a cowardly comment but i told myself that it was also true i was just on my way home and decided to stop and ask if she was awake again shes asleep at the moment or she was when i left the ward did you speak to her briefly she told me you had called earlier and that she couldnt remember what had happened she added that she was afraid to remember i tried to assure her that she was safe now and it would be all right which of course isnt really the truthif she does remember shell relive that night for years if not while shes awake then in her dreams is there any possibility that you could send for her husband it would be a comfort to her i hadnt thought of that ill see what i can do will you let me see lieutenant hart i asked im going back to france in a few days id like to hear what he has to say about his arrest i dont think thats useful inspector herbert told me hes allowed no visitors only his lawyers may i write to him and expect an answer i wouldnt advise writing him i took a deep breath what if all this evidence is just circumstantial will you hang the lieutenant and let the real murderer go free hardly circumstantial i should think he answered a little annoyed with me youve been a great help with this inquiry miss crawford but as ive said to you before you must now leave the rest to us he started to walk through the hospital doors but i stopped him have you found captain melton theres no hurry there hes at the front and weve time before the trial to interview him i think even you will agree that hes not our murderer he can speak to marjorie evansons state of mind i wanted to add that men died at the front waiting was a calculated risk and you have already done that quite admirably he touched his hat and went through the main doors holding them open for a pair of sisters just coming off duty there was nothing i could do simon was waiting for me but i said i need a little time he nodded and i began to walk to clear my head but id not gone twenty paces when i heard inspector herbert call to me i stopped and he caught me up i wanted to askits not my business to ask but are you in love with lieutenant hart i must have looked as exasperated as i felt if anyone else asks me that question i will gladly box his ears or barring that kick him in the shins he smiled im sorry as a policeman i must know how to judge your evidence it has been impartial to a certain point its necessary to understand if that has in any way changed if im asked to testify in court you may be sure i shall tell the truth as i will have sworn to do i answered stiffly it wont come to that your statement will be sufficient good night miss crawford i wish you a safe journey back to france and hope that you will return to england safely when your tour of duty is finished he touched his hat again and went back the way hed come i stood there looking after him as he passed through the hospital doors without looking back thinking to myself that he was a fair man but like many fair men once hed made up his mind he wasnt likely to find any reason to change it chapter sixteen i must have walked another hundred yards or more and then someone spoke just behind me and i nearly jumped out of my skin it was simon brandon hed been following me at a distance its late bess and that direction isnt wise i realized that id left the hospital well behind me and ahead was a short cluttered street with rather rundown shops and a pub or two their doors shuttered the street itself was dark empty dustbins casting long shadows at the far end two men stood in the shelter of a doorway the lighted tips of their cigarettes glowing red they seemed to be intent on their conversationi could just hear the murmur of voicesbut i turned and together simon and i started back toward the motorcar how is she he asked i saw inspector herbert come out again to speak to you the clanging of an ambulance speeding toward the hospital drowned out my voice after it passed i told simon what helen calder had said its very likely shell never remember bess and that leaves lieutenant hart in a limbo of sorts she could have cleared his nameor she could have condemned him it might work in his favor that she doesnt recall the attack on the other hand there may be assumptions that arent true entered into evidence we had reached his motorcar and he held my door before continuing there are witnesses who heard her call out to michael hart and the police will act on that evidence instead he turned the crank and then got in next to me why did she call his name do you think she was in great pain bleeding heavily why not call for her husband or a sister someone connected with her family i dont know i told him truthfully and when i asked her she told me michael wasnt at the dinner party then she added afterward did she mean that shed seen him after the dinner party or was she going to tell me something else theres no way to know you must prepare yourself bess this case is going to trial and theres nothing to be done about it i turned to him simon attend the trial for me if im in france i want to know everything what witnesses are called on either side what they testify what the rebuttal is and the verdictyou must be there to tell me what the verdict is i dont think theyll give me leave inspector herbert told me that my statement was sufficient please i need to know all of it shall i sketch their faces as well thats not amusing simon he nodded threading his way through light traffic sorry i was trying to lighten your mood i hadnt realized that i had been so intense please he turned to me his face in shadows cast by the canvas roof i promise bess if it will give you any comfort but theres nothing more you can do dont let it haunt you your patients will suffer if you do he wouldnt let me see michael or write to him inspector herbert i mean he doesnt want me to contact him in any way will you try to see him i want to know how hes planning to fight these charges ill do my best i settled back into my seat as we left the busy city streets behind us and found the road leading to somerset thank you simon and simondont tell mother or the colonel sahib that youre doing this for me it will only worry them i saw simons mouth tighten into a straight line and im not to worry i didnt know how to answer and so i said nothing my mother closed my valise sighed and said when your father went off on a dangerous mission i was so grateful to have a daughter she would never walk in harms way i told myself i wont lose a nights sleep over her out in hostile territory my only worry will be whether or not she chooses wisely when it comes to marriage and look at what this war has brought me it was the closest shed ever come to admitting to worrying and i thought perhaps it had been the sinking of britannic last year while i was aboard that had brought her fears out into the open with a broken arm i couldnt have fended for myself in the water if we hadnt had time to launch the boats and i could well have drowned i smiled glad i hadnt told her about the german aircraft strafing us at la fleurette i shant be in any danger its my patients you must say a prayer for every day my father came just then to carry the valise down to the motorcar after hed gone my mother said he would prefer that i didnt tell you bess but i think you ought to know this your father has been in touch with lieutenant harts aunt and uncle suggesting a good barrister if they havent already found one to their liking they were in such a state of shock and were grateful for his advice i felt a mixture of shame that i hadnt thought of calling on them again and a surge of hope that my father believed michael was innocent i said then the colonel sahib agrees with me but she dashed my hopes almost at once i think its more a case of the army looking after its own whatever ones regiment the lieutenants own commanding officer hadnt called on them yet hes still in france thank you for telling me id like to know why youre so sure hes innocent i drove him to somerset and then to london and back to little sefton id have known if he were a murderer and i didnt feel it hardly evidence that would sway a jury she said i embraced my mother and she returned it fiercely be safe she whispered into my ear then let me go as i walked out the door to where my father and simon were waiting with the motorcar i found myself remembering a lesson in ancient greek history how the women of sparta sent their loved ones into battle with the brave words come back with your shieldor on it how many women over the millennia had fought back tears to smile and wish their men safe the door shut behind me and i didnt look back my father held my door for me while simon turned the crank and then we were on our way my father walked me to the gangway of my ship took me in his arms for a brief moment then stepped back smiling as simon bent to kiss my cheek i murmured dont forget and then i was at the rail waving and we were pulling out our escort already under way i wondered afterward what premonitions my family had felt before my departure id had the strongest impression of an undercurrent of concern it hadnt been like simon to kiss me nor my father to put his arms around me whatever foreboding there was i began this next posting far from the front lines and well out of range of danger id been there several weeks when i heard from simon he had gone over inspector herberts head and found a way to speak to michael it must not have been a very successful visit for simon reported that the shoulder was healing well although it appeared that lieutenant hart wasnt recovering the use of that arm vad therapy wasnt available in prison and so there was no hope for a successful convalescence with gallows humor michael hart had told simon that it wouldnt matter he wouldnt live long enough to worry about it but simon rather thought he was worried my father reported that michaels family had retained the barrister recommended to them and they felt he might well save their nephew it occurred to me that my father had written those lines to encourage me as much as to report on the legal issues we were sent shortly after that to a new hospital one with severely wounded patients from all over the front this was well behind the lines too and i was beginning to think my father had had a word with someone about his only daughter i was becoming a favorite surgical nurse among the staff and this kept me too busy to think or worry about anyone myself included and then i was sent to another forward hospital a receiving station for wounded brought in by stretcher bearers rather than ambulances we could hear the guns see their flashes all night long and sometimes their screams as they raced overhead deafened us we had just cleared out a contingent of our own wounded when the front moved forward three hundred yards in that salient and suddenly the men i was working with wore the field gray of german uniforms id heard several nurses state flatly that they wouldnt touch german wounded edith cavill fresh in their minds she had been shot by firing squad for staying with her duties to her own wounded when the germans had overrun that part of belgium they had called her a spy and rid themselves of her but as i looked at these men some of them so young and frightened others stoic in their pain i could hardly turn them away i spent endless hours working over them sorting the more serious cases from those we couldnt move until they were stabilized listening to the ragged breath of the dying holding the hands of those facing surgery trying to discover the names of those who couldnt speak i soon forgot that this was the enemy but for their uniforms and their language they could have been any soldier from our own armies i gave them all the care at my command and cried when one of them died in my arms their officer his foot badly lacerated by shell fragments hobbled around the tent speaking to each one of his men comforting and reassuring them taking down their names in a little leather book along with a description of their wounds so that there would be a record of where they were and why twice i asked hauptmann ritter to sit down and let me examine his foot but he shook his head continuing his rounds finally i stood in front of him forcing him to stop and face me you are risking infection that will cost you your foot and possibly your leg as well it might even kill you is that what you want if so its a poor example for these men who are letting us care for them i wasnt certain he understood me until i saw a flash of anger in his blue eyes and he said in passable english i am responsible the colonel sahib would have liked him in other circumstances they saw eye to eye on the duties of command yes well you can be just as responsible once ive cleaned and disinfected that wound then bandaged it he gave me a look that was withering and then as he turned he saw that the men on cots around him were listening with open interest to hear what he would say it must have taken enormous effort to quell his pride and let me lead him to one side where his foot could be examined properly he refused to let his men out of his sight but i found a bench where he could sit and rest his foot on a wooden crate and it was a nasty wound i summoned one of the doctors and he came to have a look as well you could lose this you know he told herr hauptmann and with it your career in the army he fetched what he needed and began to clean the foot and remove any fragments still buried there i watched as the muscles in our patients jaw tightened and i knew what sort of pain he was enduring refusing to show weakness i realized that not only the german soldiers but dr newcomb himself was watching captain ritter with interest dr newcomb did what he could with the wound then said this will require surgery we must get him and those five men over there back to where they can be taken care of ritter wanted no part of being separated from his men the walking wounded already being lined up to be taken under guard to a processing center for prisoners the others to remain here until they were fit to move it took some argument and persuasion before captain ritter accepted the fact that he had no choice in the matter he finished the entries in his small notebook then reluctantly allowed us to put him in the ambulance waiting outside i was the transport nurse and after making certain the other critical cases were as stable and comfortable as possible i climbed into the seat next to the driver captain ritter called from the back claus is bleeding again i got out and stepped into the rear of the ambulance and claus had indeed pulled at his bandaging blood already welling in the wound in his chest i worked to stop the bleeding and finally succeeded captain ritter said bitterly the war is over for him i dont know whether to mourn for him or congratulate him i stayed with claus sending captain ritter to take my place next to the driver who gave me a long look i knew what he was askingif this german officer was to be trusted next to the driver where he could try a mischief i said captain ritter understands i am exchanging places in order to keep this soldier alive he will give me his word to respect this decision captain ritter smiled at me and i knew hed been weighing his chances but he nodded and closed the ambulance door on me before hobbling painfully to the front of the vehicle we set off along the rutted road lurching and swaying like some mad creature in the throes of despair it was always a wonder to me when a severely wounded man survived this ride i felt bruised and battered as we pulled in at the hospital and i could turn my patients over to the staff waiting there captain ritter thanked me for my care of his men and then said i have learned one thing in life at least when i have given up all hope there is still something to live for i swore i would never be taken prisoner and here i am a prisoner but i shall write to my wife now and tell her that very likely i shall survive the war after all she will have a little peace knowing that it will be my good deed theres no shame in being taken prisoner i told him you are no use to your country dead he smiled i shall remember that goodbye fraulein and he was gone supported by two orderlies followed by an armed guard i was to think about captain ritter when my mail at last caught up with me when i have given up all hope there is still something to live for michael hart was speaking almost those same words to simon brandon that same afternoon only i wouldnt hear about it for another two weeks chapter seventeen when simons letter arrived the envelope was worn and splattered with mud at least i hoped it was mud i opened it gingerly and drew out the sheets inside unfolding them i looked at the heavy angular strokes of his pen and i had a premonition of bad news bess it began i am writing in haste as there is a chance i shall be able to send this letter tonight as you asked i attended the trial it was brought forward because mrs calder regained some memory of events the night she was stabbed only a partial memory as it turned out but she was able to tell the police that shed received a message from lieutenant hart asking her to meet him this was verified by her maid who had brought the letter to her from the post she replied that she had a dinner engagement that nightwould it be possible for him to come another evening he answered that he would meet her at nine thirty if her dinner party ended in good time she agreed and was surprised that he wasnt waiting in her house instead he came toward her from the shadows at the corner of her house and she called to him to join her that was the last thing she remembered because the doctors had ordered a long and careful period of convalescence it was decided to move the trial date to accommodate the medical needs of the chief witness i spoke to the barrister who had taken harts case and he felt that judgment could go either wayconviction or acquittal depending on the view of the jury when the evidence was presented he believed your evidence regarding events at the railway station would be crucial as it indicated that hart was not mrs evansons lover and therefore had no reason to kill her to protect himself from charges that he was the childs father as she was already married hart could hardly be considered a jilted lover or cuckolded husband this removed one motive for murder and such circumstantial evidence as there was required a suitable motive and mrs calder could be shown to be recovering still and perhaps not perfectly certain about what she thinks she remembers he had told hart how he expected to conduct the trial and had every expectation that his principal agreed with the plan the trial began on a monday and the general feeling was that it would last five to seven days your father had told me he had also arranged to attend and we met outside the courtroom taking our seats just as hart was brought in his shoulder had healed sufficiently for the more conspicuous bandaging to be reduced to a padded sling his counsel objected to the prison doctors decision believing it gave the jury a false impression of his ability to use that arm still it was rather obvious that the shoulder was held awkwardly as he came up the stairs into the dock i thought he appeared to be under considerable strain but otherwise he seemed to be in control and aware of his plight when he was asked how he would plead his counsel rose to speak but hart was there before him and to the absolute horror of most of the spectators he said quite clearly and without emotion i plead guilty to both charges pandemonium reigned for all of a minute his counsel begging for time to confer with his client and nearly drowned out when the bailiffs had restored order the judge turned to hart and said do you understand the consequences of your plea and hart replied quite steadily that he did and was ready to accept them i put the letter down staring at nothing as the words brought me so close to that courtroom that i could imagine the scene quite clearly lieutenant hart in the dock his counsel and the kc staring alternately at him and at the judge unable to fathom what was happening after all everyone had been prepared for a trial not for the rug to be pulled precipitously from under their feet and in the center of this maelstrom his face pale but determined was michael hart the effect on the jury must have been momentous the trial couldnt continue but what in heavens name had possessed him why had he thrown his chances to the winds and ignored the advice of the barrister retained to save him from the gallows i sat there my head reeling my heart plummeting to the soles of my shoes it was the very height of foolishness and it made no sense after a time i picked up simons letter again and turned to the second page justice bromley asked if hart had any more to add to his plea and he was answered by a single shake of the head then a very firm no i neednt tell you what happened next the court had no choice but to accept the plea before them and i thought of you when the judge reached for his black cap he declared that the circumstances of the two attacks both on women alone and vulnerable and the brutal stabbing before one had gone into the river and the other abandoned to bleed to death on the pavement left no room for compassion or understanding and he condemned michael hart to be hanged the words seemed to roll around my head echoing through the room where i sat in the early twilight unable to reach out and turn on the lamp beside me light would make it true sitting here in the shadows i could almost pretend that this letter had never come or that michael hart had offered something some crumb of comfort or explanation to his bald statement why even if he had done these thingswhich i still doubtedwhy had he admitted to them was it conscience how had i been so wrong about him i picked up the letter again hoping that simon had an answer to that question but he didnt he and my father had left the courtroom with the rest of the spectators all of whom were talking about this shocking turn of events simon ended the letter with a final paragraph i tried to speak to his barrister but the man refused to hear me i had the feeling he was too angry to trust himself to talk to anyone the colonel and i decided the best move now would be to see hart if we can gain access to him if he will see us i have considered tearing up this letter or not sending it until weve heard what he has to say but in all fairness to you my dear girl it had to be sent i wish i could be there when you read it i wish i had better news and it was signed with his name nothing more i reread the letter still trying to absorb it why would michael hart condemn himself what did he know that had made him confess to murder whether he had done that murder or not and the answer was there in front of me i went back to the letter and looked for the words again and there they were simons discussion with michaels barrister he believed that your evidence regarding events at the railway station would be crucial as it indicated that hart was not mrs evansons lover and therefore had no reason to kill her to protect himself from charges that he was the childs father as she was already married hart could hardly be considered a jilted lover or cuckolded husband michael had confessed because he didnt want the world to hear about marjories lover marjories infidelity marjories shame it would have had to come out it would be in all the newspapers the gossip of london a ninedays wonder and at the end of it marjorie would have been seen as the woman who betrayed her severely burned husband the husband who had killed himself rather than live with the truth whether michael was guilty or not he had given her one last gift of lovehis silence still the colonel sahib would have something to say on that subject gallantry he often told his men is an act of great courage under fire of bravery beyond the call of duty but if it kills your comrades as well or puts the battle in jeopardy then it is arrant pride and foolishness learn to know the difference but then michael was only putting himself in jeopardy i set the letter down and went to my small trunk lifting the lid i searched through my belongings for the photograph of marjorie evanson that i still carried with me because no one else seemed to want it i found the frame turned it over and looked at the face of the dead woman trying to think what it was about her that had made two men love her so fiercely she was quite pretty with fair hair and what must have been blue eyes but that wasnt the person only an outward reflection there must have been some quality that the camera couldnt capture something in her smile or a vulnerability that appealed to men there were prettier womendiana my flatmate was certainly far more beautiful possibly raymond melton had seen her as a challenge some men liked that it occurred to me that i should send this photograph to michael hart if he hadnt killed her he would take comfort in it perhaps he would whether he had killed her or not but it seemed a betrayal of her husband who had clung to this photograph through the darkest hours of his life and how victoria garrison and serena melton must be celebrating now they had got what they wanted both of them i took a deep breath and put the frame back in my trunk and closed the lid the practical question now was what to do about michael did i take him at his word or should i go on searching for a murderer i turned pulled on my boots and went to see matron if i could have leave i could go to england and try once more to get to the bottom of marjorie evansons death but matron swamped with wounded refused to consider my request for leave although i told her that it could be a matter of life or death were shorthanded sister crawford and your love affair will just have to wait it isnt a love she cut me short you arent the first nursing sister to come to me with such a request nor will you be the last i was young like you i can appreciate the fact that your world feels as if its coming to an end but men are dying here and i will thank you to concentrate on their needs not your own selfishness has no place on the battlefield with that she dismissed me and i had no option but to walk out of her office and return to my quarters consoling myself as best i could i wrote a letter to simon and set it out for the post if only hed told me when the date of execution was but perhaps he didnt know i had a feeling that michael would ask that it not be delayed and he would go to the gallows before christmas a thought came to mind inspector herbert had been in no hurry to send for captain raymond melton because he believed that my encounter with marjorie in the railway station had sufficiently explained his role in her life lover rejecting her unwilling to believe the child she was carrying was hisbut in no way connecting him to her murder his alibi was about as sound as one could be but what if i could break it i had two hours before i was scheduled to return to duty i set about searching for raymond melton my father had commanded a regiment there were soldiers from that regiment scattered across france combined with other units making up the armies in the field i only had to find one or two of its present officers and the rest would be easy it was three days before someone from my fathers regiment was brought in to our station and he was walking wounded his arm laid open by machinegun fire i asked the sister who was already cutting away his sleeve if i could attend to the young lieutenant he smiled as i came over to him and i think he believed i must be flirting with him when i asked his name timothy alston he said and yours sister i told him and added i expect you might know of my father colonel crawford my god yes he answered giving me a very different sort of look and then he winced as i began to clean his wound how is he fighting this war from london much to his chagrin they still tell stories about his time in india you know he went on i never had the pleasure of serving under him i joined after he retired but id have been proud to be one of his men he would be very pleased to hear that i told lieutenant alston truthfully he misses his command there was the tiger hunt that nearly killed a maharajah has he ever told you about that the beast leapt right into the blind directly in the face of the maharajah and no one could move the maharajah was certain to be clawed to death and then your father swung a rifle and gave the tiger an almighty whack on the side of his headthere was no room to shoot too dangerous but the tiger turned looked at your father and everyone in the blind thought he was going to attack then the tiger wheeled about and leapt out of the blind disappearing into the high grass before anyone could bring a gun to bear they say he came back to that blind you know the day your father marched away and stood there head down mourning the loss of a brave man id heard the story from others and those who told me his bearers among them swore it was true but i said only i expect the tiger was still looking for the maharajah lieutenant alston laughed as i was binding the wound i asked casually by the bye have you run into a captain melton in the wiltshire fusiliers ive been trying to find him i was at his brothers birthday party melton name doesnt ring a bell but ill put the word out if you like one of us is bound to come across him i thanked him turned him over to the doctor for suturing told him to keep the bandaging clean for at least three days and then he was gone back to the fighting i wondered if hed remember my request but ten days later i received a message from lieutenant alston he told me that captain melton had been seen not three miles away where he was in rotation from the front this time with matrons blessing and the excuse of needing medical supplies i commandeered an ambulance and went to find the fusiliers they were well behind the lines men stretched out on cots even on the ground or smoking and pacing writing letters shaving readinganything to put the war behind them for a few precious hours the rows of tents gleamed in the morning sun and i felt at home as i walked down between them the guns were loud here our own and the germans and the sharp chatter of a vickers could be heard faintly in the distance but tired men ignored everything but the pursuit of peace for as long as possible i smiled and asked for captain melton the young officer who had risen to greet me looked around him and then said i expect hes still in hospital sister alarmed i asked is it serious um id rather not say which usually meant dysentery i thanked him returned to the ambulance and found my way to the rear hospital where more serious casualties were taken the first sister i met as i walked through the door was young and flushed with excitement rumor says the prince of wales is coming here to speak to the wounded she exclaimed everything is at sixes and sevens i gave her a list of the supplies i needed then asked if there was a captain melton in the officers ward she pointed the way then rushed off to finish my errand before the prince arrived she was right that the hospital was at sixes and sevens another sister told me that the prince was coming to pin a medal on someone victoria cross she thought someone else said that the prince was coming to see one of his former equerries who was just out of surgery for lifethreatening wounds threading my way to the busy ward i went down the row of cots and looked at each patient hoping to find captain melton without drawing more attention than necessary to my visit a few patients were heavily bandaged and i asked quietly captain melton only to receive a shake of the head in return i nearly missed him he was at the far end a weak and exhausted man who had lost several stone of his original weight his skin was gray and his eyes sunken but a second glance confirmed that this was indeed the man i recalled from the railway station i went to sit beside him and after a moment i spoke his name softly to see if he slept or was awake he turned his face toward me and his eyes when he opened them were those of a dead man no life at all in their depths as if he had given up all hope severe dysentery could kill but i thought hes weak not dying when i said nothing he spoke in a thread of a voice whatever you gave me seems to be working thank you sister he was so far from the cold heartless man who wouldnt comfort the distressed woman clinging to his arm that i felt a wave of compassion and was torn about bringing up the past but this might be my only chance whenifhe recovered he might be sent anywhere and the next big push might be his last steeling myself against softer feelings i said my name doesnt matter captain melton but i happened to be at waterloo station when you were saying goodbye to marjorie evanson just before you sailed for france i gave him the date and the time told him that it was raining hard a summer rain that made it impossible for me to find marjorie again as she was leaving he listened his face changing to a coldness that made him seem more familiar to me than the wasted man lying on the cot as id approached what of it he demanded the police asked me questions about her and about you i didnt know your name then i found it much later when i saw some photographs taken by the husband of a friend i hoped i could still consider alicia a friend i had met your brother jack only a few weeks before i saw that photograph and so i know who you are youve got the wrong man he said turning away from me please leave it isnt a mistake i knew marjorie by sight and i have a good memory for faces i also recognized your cap badge you dont look like your brother i would never have guessed who you were but cameras dont lie you were with marjorie that night he said nothing keeping his face resolutely turned toward the far wall she was three months pregnant did she tell you that no response though i saw a muscle twitch in his jaw it struck me that he was angry not ashamed she was murdered that same evening were you lovers if you were perhaps you can tell me who marjorie evanson would turn to in her distress after you got on that train and left her to cope alone i was guessing at some of what i was saying please if you know anyone she might have seen after your train left it would help the police enormously and might even lead to finding her killer hes been found the three words were clipped and i was right about the anger i was on the point of asking him who had told him and then of course i remembered that he was jack meltons brother jack would have passed on the news but had he realized when he did so that the man he was telling was marjories lover i wondered too who had initiated that telling of events had raymond melton asked or had jack melton volunteered perhaps a little of both it was after all expected to be a sensational trial and indirectly the meltons were involved through serena and her own brother the question is have the police got the right man im not very sure of that i kept my voice steady interested but impersonal i have to be impartial and while i dont believe you could have killed herafter all i saw you board that traini cant help but think your evidence would be helpful as mine was for it told the police that she was alive at five fortyfive that day he showed no interest in what i was saying and so i pressed a little harder havent the police asked you to provide proof that you didnt leave the train at the next stop and then find someone to drive you to portsmouth so that you reached your transport just before it sailed his head turned and his eyes met mine there was fire in their depths shocking in so weak a man get out of here i should like your word that you never left the train and then i will walk away even though youve done nothing to help the woman you seduced and then left to deal with the aftermath on her own i would have believed in her suicide that night its amazing that you never gave that possibility even a thought i never left the train my word wed kept our voices low in order not to disturb other patients or draw the attention of the ward sisters i sat there looking into his eyes trying to plumb their depths for truth my word he repeated and i had to believe him as i rose to walk away i watched his face something stirred there and i wondered what it was satisfaction satisfaction that hed managed to drive me away with only a portion of the truth i wondered how hard michael harts counsel had tried to find this man and establish his alibi even if the crown had not but then i reminded myself they might have done and when it was shown he hadnt left his train they had not felt it worthwhile to bring him back to england there was no getting around the fact that raymond melton had been in france when mrs calder was stabbed i thanked him and turned away as id promised feeling deflated and uncertain but then i went back to his bedside and said has anyone told you that helen calder was also attacked in the same fashion as marjorie evanson and presumably by the same man or woman the two stabbings so close together are most likely linked because mrs calder was a garrison before her marriage and a cousin of marjorie evansons he stared at me i know helen calder he said eyes wide now with disbelief i was at mons with her husband is she dead as well she ought to be but she was found in time in spite of loss of blood and emergency surgery to repair the damage done there will be weeks of recovery ahead of her but shes alive he went on staring at me trying to absorb what id said then he asked surely she was able to identify her attacker she has no memory of what happened what little she recalls of the hours before she was stabbed point to the man the police took into custody hes been tried and will be hanged i fought to keep my voice steady as i said the words captain melton closed his eyes and lay there spent then he said poor devil he must be out of his mind with worry i understood that to mean mrs calders husband i couldnt help but think that this man had shown more pity for a fellow officer than he had for the woman hed used if not loved i left then walking swiftly down the center of the ward and in the distance i could hear shouting loud huzzahs and assumed that the prince had finally arrived a piper began to play the pipes wheezing and then settling into the melody id always liked the pipes and listened for a moment to what the man was playing it was i realized god save the king in honor of the princes father i slipped out a side door in low spirits and not in the mood for a spectacle for thats what it would be and rightly so men needed to know that the royal family remembered their sacrifice reaching the ambulance i discovered that the sister id given my list to had set several boxes in the rear where the stretchers usually went grateful to her i drove back to my own unit and turned the boxes over to the nurse in charge of stores and then i went to my own quarters and sat there as darkness fell and the rains came again turning mud to a treacherous slickness and breeding a miasma of odors that seemed to cling to the walls and my sheets and the very air i was breathing i could understand now why inspector herbert far more experienced in such matters than i could possibly hope to be had discounted finding captain melton he had indeed taken the train to portsmouth and boarded his ship as scheduled and landed in france at the required time while it had been important to identify the man with marjorie evanson and the likely father of her child the instant hed stepped into his compartment on the train his alibi was secure then where was there any small overlooked fact that would save michael hart or was the right man going to hang at the time set for him to climb the stairs to the gallows why was it that i couldnt be satisfied with what was looking more and more like the truth chapter eighteen the next two and a half weeks were busy i was coming to realize that this war was producing nothing but dead and wounded men no glorious victories no great advances into germanheld territory there was talk that the americans would be coming to france but even so it would be months before they could take the field and make a difference by that time it appeared that england and france would be bled dry i was too tired to do the arithmetic but it seemed to me that for every yard of ground won or lost the toll was enormous if i a nurse in the field could see this happening why did the men in staff positions the men who made both the daily and the longterm decisions about fighting the enemy not look at the casualty lists and find another way to win i was reminded of my greatgrandmother at waterloo there the english squares held despite charge after charge by napoleons best troops and at the end of the day in spite of the slaughter the squares still held and napoleon was forced to retreat not a very decisive victory attrition at its worst and without the backing of bluchers men arriving in the nick of time the tide might have turned the other way but at least the battle lasted only that one day and by the next evening my greatgrandmother knew whether or not her husband still lived i was coming off duty when i encountered dr hall just coming on we smiled wearily at each other and he asked do you sleep not very well i answered truthfully he nodded nor i well we do our best yes sir ive had word were to be relieved in the next fortnight this was news i hadnt heard it revived me a little and i said another convoy home very likely would you like to be listed as the transport nurse i would indeed he nodded a second time id heard that you had approached matron about leave some time ago was it important or perhaps i should ask is it still important i told him the truth an officer i know has been convicted of murder id have liked to have been at his trial since then ive not received any news of the date hes to die either that or no one wishes to tell me when it will be i keep hoping for some fresh evidence to prove that hes not guilty id like to see him a last time and hear what he has to say dr hall regarded me with interest hes more than a friend no sir justa friend but i feel rather responsible for his situation i was a witness in the case though not called on to give evidence in court i was in the right place at the wrong time and what i saw proved to be important an attempt on my part to help the police uncover the identity of one man in the case led them to another man but it seems to me that there were problems with evidence and circumstance conspired to put the worst possible interpretation on that evidence given my friends wounds in two instances i cant see how he could have committed the crimes he was charged with but the police surgeon must have seen the matter differently and so my friend will hang interesting dr hall said what sort of wounds i told him about the particle in lieutenant harts eye and then about the damaged shoulder dr hall looked at his watch i dont have time to pursue this now but if youll meet me when i come off duty id like to hear more i thanked him thinking he was trying to be polite and would have lost interest by morning but i was wrong i was sitting in the canteen finishing my tea when dr hall came looking for me he took the chair across from me and said im so tired i could sleep on my feet but talk to me and if i can stay awake ill give you my opinion it wont make any difference to the crown or to the case in hand still i might be able to set your mind at ease on the medical issues i tried to marshal my thoughts and then told him as concisely as i knew how the way the murders had occurred and what michaels physical condition was at this time after his shoulder had healed at least to the best of my knowledge which was superficial at the very least dr hall stirred his coffeehe had picked up the french habit of drinking coffee as so many others had done during this warand considered the medical implications he could have done these things in spite of his injuriesthat is to say if he didnt care about the physical damage and was prepared to take the risk i wondered if his barrister had ordered a physician to examine michaels eye he hadnt complainedbut then he wouldnt have would he if hed disobeyed the doctors instructions he must have read my face my dear you must understand that people who kill are not marked by the brand of cain they appear no different from you or me its hard to believe sometimes that someone we know wellor think we know wellcould do horrible things but they can he was right of course he was i smiled trying to make it appear bright and accepting thank you i needed impartiality he cocked his head to one side the position as transport nurse is still yours sometimes its better to learn the truth firsthand he was a small man graying early lines forming around his eyes that would not go away even when he slept for a week but his hands were gentle in the operating theater and they worked miracles with torn flesh and sinew and bone i sighed youre very kind no he said finishing his coffee and getting to his feet im just very tired we brought the wounded to england and i discovered id been given ten days leave i went home and surprised my parents as i stood in the doorway they stared at me as if i were a ghost then they rushed to greet me talking at the same time laughing with excitement sweeping me into the family circle with such warmth it was as if id never been away i said nothing about michael hart not then nor at dinner but after my parents had gone to bed i pulled on a sweater against the nights chill and walked the mile to the cottage where simon brandon lived he hadnt come to dinner he hadnt come to welcome me home my parents hadnt mentioned that he was away so where was he i could hear a night bird calling as i went up the lane and came to the path to the cottage door the house was in darkness except for a single lamp in the front room i stood for a moment on the step then lifted my hand to the knocker it was shaped like an elephants head simon had had it made in agra at a little shop where a man sat crosslegged and spent his days carving useful objects a rectangular length of brass had been fitted to the back of the head and the plate was also brass it had a musical ring as i let it fall i didnt think he was going to come to the door but after what seemed like a very long time the door opened and simon stood there in shirt and dark trousers i was waiting he said and stepped aside to allow me to enter i had always liked the cottage it was strictly a mans home of course filled with a lifetimes treasures and memories but as tidy as a sergeantmajors quarters in camp i moved into the parlor as simon closed the door behind me and i took the chair that had always been mine by the window overlooking the garden the news isnt good he said coming in to join me but not sitting down hes stubborn your michael hart he asked that his sentence be expedited mrs calder isnt doing well preparing herself for the trial has taxed her strength and of course there was no trial as such hes not my michael hart simon nodded then said the execution is set for a fortnight tomorrow i couldnt stop myself from reacting i had thought before christmas months away more than enough time surely but there was almost none you didnt write i accused him no he refuses to see you he asked me to wait to tell you until it wasover he did it for her you know to prevent what shed done being opened up for the public to gawk at and whisper about i think he did it for himself as well that arm will probably be useless for the rest of his life he cant live with that so why not die for a good reason its stupid there was a chanceyou said so as wellthat the trial could have ended in an acquittal at what price to mrs evansons reputation well he hasnt considered one thing and i intend to bring it to his attention can you or the colonel arrange for me to see him i told you he refuses to see you he may refuse but you might tell him that i am bringing a photograph of marjorie to take with him to the gallows simons face had been in shadow but suddenly i saw the gleam of his teeth as he smiled my dear girl i bow to your brilliance but where will you find a photograph of mrs evanson in ten days time ive had it since i went to hampshire and learned that meriwether evanson had killed himself serena refused to put it in his coffin matron couldnt bear to throw it away and so i took it i had thoughtif id considered the matter at allthat i might somehow put it by lieutenant evansons grave you had told me the photograph went with evanson from france to the clinic but not that it was now in your possession it waspersonal whatever she did whatever reason she might have had for doing it he loved her more than living simon went to the sideboard in the dining room i could hear him collecting two glasses and a decanter it was whiskey he brought back with him and a small carafe of water as well he poured a small measure of the whiskey in a glass added water to it and passed the glass to me then poured himself a larger measure without the water holding his glass out to me he said welcome home bess i drank the whiskey they say queen victoria drank a small tot each night before retiring if she approved of it for herself it would do me no harm but i wasnt sure i really cared for the taste of it a smokiness that caught at the back of my throat and belied the smoothness of the first swallow simon smiled and took my glass from me before id finished it setting it on the table its late ill see you home i can find my own way im sure you can but i shouldnt care to face the colonel tomorrow if i allowed you to walk that mile alone he drained his own glass and set it down who killed her simon if michael didnt i dont know who had the most to lose i stepped through the door he was holding for me and out into the night raymond melton he had a career in the army a wife he could have lost both if the affair had come to light as it surely must have done but he was on that transport ship we walked down the path side by side and turned into the lane victoria she was jealous of her sister from childhood why then why wait until that moment because with the child of her affair she would have had to come home to little sefton and back into victorias life possible of course on the other hand victoria might well have relished her sisters fall from grace theres that serena then for what marjorie was about to do to meriwether thats far more likely except that serena told her brother the truth about marjorie after she was dead i think that was her own pain speaking she hated marjorie and wanted her brother to hate his wife too i sighed a tangle isnt it which brings us full circle back to michael we walked on in silence shoulder to shoulder as simon lifted the latch on the door to my parents house he said ill go to london tomorrow and im going to little sefton i want to speak to michaels aunt and uncle after that i must go to london and look in on helen calder she must be feeling rather awful after her testimony sent michael to trial simon said good night and waited outside as i shut and locked the house door i stood in the darkness at the bottom of the stairs and watched him out of sight then i turned toward the stairs intending to go straight to my room my heart leapt into my throat there was someone on the stairs standing there in silence watching me all at once i recognized the shape of my father he must have known somehow that i had gone to see simon he said only is everything all right yes simon is going to london tomorrow im going to little sefton myself and then to london there isnt much time for what its worth my dear i dont believe he killed marjorie evanson my father knew men hed fought with them led them listened to them disciplined them little escaped his notice and he was a good judge of character i went up the stairs to him and hugged him thank you for telling me that i said you smell of whiskey brush your teeth before your mother comes to kiss you good night i promised and we went up the remaining stairs to bed between my own fatigue and the whiskey i slept soundly i wondered if that was what simon had intended the next morning i said goodbye to my parents and set out for little sefton it was well into september now id first taken this road in early june with high hopes that i could in some fashion bring to light a name that would lead the police to marjories killer now i drove with a sense of desperation goading me a fortnight today thats all the time i had and even if i found new evidence the courts would have to be persuaded to hear it and act upon it the urgent order of business however was mending my fences with alicia the first person i saw was the rector who greeted me warmly and asked if id been in france again i told him i had and then said still i heard about the trial it must have been terribly trying for michaels aunt and uncle he shook his head ive offered them what comfort i could and ive written to michael to ask if i could serve him in the days to come how has he answered sadly with silence he looked up at the weathervane on the church tower as if it could point him in the right direction ive never counseled a man facing the gallows ive prayed to find the right words when the time comes im sure you will do i replied do you think i could speak to mr and mrs hart i know michael pleaded guilty but i also believe i know why he did if im right then it may be that hes innocent of murder the rector stared at me you mustnt raise false hope he warned it would be very unkind they have been in seclusion i dont believe it would be wise which is worse for them thinking michael is a murderer or watching him die knowing hes innocent ive wrestled with that question for hours i think id find comfort in knowing the truth in knowing that my own flesh and blood is dying for what he believes in not because he has done something appalling but he remained steadfast in his belief that i would do more harm than good i left the subject there and asked instead how has victoria garrison taken this news the rector said walk with me to the rectory wont you i nodded and as we crossed the churchyard he went on victoria garrison troubles me she was eager to give her evidence and when proceedings were halted almost before they had properly begun she was beside herself with anger i was there that first day myself i felt it was my duty you know if young hart looked out at the crowded courtroom i thought it might be steadying to find a familiar face victoria was waiting with the other witnesses and when the trial ended abruptly a bailiff must have gone to tell them that they were free to leave and so we ran into each other on the stairs and i was shocked i had expected distress disbelief even but her face was flushed with fury i asked if she was all right but she turned on me and said ive been cheated in such a savage tone that i stepped back and she hastened out the door and into the street ive been at a loss ever since to understand i thought i did understand victoria had wanted her pound of flesh to hear in open court a discussion of the sins of her sister i couldnt imagine that michaels fate moved hershe had been eager to see him taken into custody i had wondered before if a woman could have stabbed both victims it was possible but was it likely given victorias hatred of marjorie it could have happened but how did victoria know about the love affair before her sisters death or about the child surely marjorie hadnt confided in her and so victoria couldnt have killed her there was the problem if marjorie had been living her life quietly in london victoria had no reason to be aware of her situation the rector suspecting my inner struggles invited me to have lunch with him my excellent cook always makes more than enough sandwiches for one person he ended it will be no imposition and so i did there was a plate full of sandwiches with a dish of summer apples stewed in honey weve been keeping bees the rector told me have you tried honey in your tea there were also small potatoes baked in milk and grated cheese we talked about the village and i confessed that id come to mend fences with alicia he smiled she was saying on sunday last that she wished it had never happened i think if you go to her door she will be glad to see you i wasnt as certain but i promised i would try after our meal against his advice i went to knock at the door of the hart house a maid opened it and told me that mr and mrs hart were receiving no visitors will you tell them that elizabeth crawford has called and would like to speak with them she went away and after several minutes came back to say that the harts would see me surprised and grateful i thanked her and was taken to the small sitting room with its comfortable furnishings and a lovely turkey carpet i could see at once that mrs harts eyes were puffy and red from crying mr hart appeared to have aged in only a matter of weeks he said as i was shown into the room and the maid had closed the door behind me miss crawford and indicated a chair to one side of his own i answered at once i cant express what i feel i wasnt allowed leave to come home for the trial i doubt if i could have made a difference if i had but i wanted to try mrs hart said michael expressly forbade us to attend the trial he told us that it would be distressing and hurtful and he didnt want us to see that he didnt want to sit there in the dock and watch our faces now i think he knew even then what he was intending to do and thats why he asked us to stay away and it was the most horrible shock when the rector came to tell us what had happened i refused to believe it then and i still do but most of little sefton feels that we stayed away out of shame for what hes done and to make it all even worse he wont let us come to see him one last time im unable to sleep i cantwe had him from a little boy and theres no meanness in michael i want him to know that we love him still and would do anythinganythingto keep him with us my dear you mustnt her husband began dont tell me not to cry he was like my own child how shall i go on knowing what theyve done to him she turned to me you stood up for him there in the street when they came for him i never said a word in his defensei was so shocked my tongue seemed as paralyzed as the rest of me but you kept your wits about you and defended him i will always be grateful for that miss crawford you will always be dear to me because you did what i couldnt i took her hand let me tell you what i think it may not ease your suffering but it could explain what happened in that courtroom michael was informed while he was in prison that although his shoulder has healed he wont regain the use of that arm i dont know if thats true or not there are trained people who are doing wonders with such wounds i do know that he isnt the only solder to feel his life is over because hes lost the use of a limb or an eye it isnt an easy truth to live with id like to believe that he decided then to protect marjories name and reputation by stopping the trial before it had begun hes always loved marjorie it would be like him to see this as a noble gesture a very good reason for dying and ending his own wretchedness mr hart stared at me iif i hadnt been so blinded by my own grief i would have seen that for myself its possible very possible he smiled for the first time although there were tears in his eyes that foolish boy but dear god what are we to do i dont know i answered truthfully but perhaps if we talk about the people who knew marjorie best we might find something that could help victoria mrs harts voice was cold and angry she tried to ruin marjories life and now shes ruined michaels did you know miss crawford that she went to meriwether evanson shortly before the marriage to tell him that marjorie was very likely illegitimate he showed her the door and said that if she ever said as much to any other living soul he and marjorie would take her to court for defamation of character i think she was a little afraid of him after that he came to michael afterward to ask what sort of person victoria was and michael told him how shed alienated mr garrison and marjorie to the point that marjorie went to live in london meriwether swore michael to secrecy and he never broke his word until a week before he was taken into custody he wanted us to know what meriwether had saidthat victoria was evil to beware of her then why did he let her drive him to london because he was desperate to go there mr hart replied and im really not comfortable driving such distances now he put his hand to his heart as if in explanation i asked him to wait a few days that id find someone to take him but he was impatient he said there was something he had thought about that he must ask helen calder although he wasnt about to tell victoria his real reason for speaking to her michael had been rereading marjories letters to him but he didnt have all of them he believed mrs calder might remember what he was searching for i leaned forward what was it he was hoping to ask her i expect to see mrs calder tomorrow perhaps i can ask her instead i wish i knew he replied i didnt understand the urgency you see or id have risked the journey myself ive regretted that bitterly i would have been with him instead michaels alibi which victoria couldntor wouldntgive him could victoria have been suspicious enough to follow him i asked if she was jealous of marjorie she could have been jealous of helen calder as well she might have jumped to the conclusion that he had used her to see mrs calder but even as i said the words i thought about mrs calders long thin face and she was a few years older what was there to be jealous of but jealousy didnt always heed reason small wonder victoria was eager to testify at the trial she would have enjoyed twisting the truth if it put michael hart in the worst possible light just how much did victoria know about marjories life in london i asked after a moment did she go up to london often after her fathers death if you want to know what i think mrs hart said she went to spy on her sister my dear her husband cautioned we couldnt be sure where she was going when she left here well you saw her often enough at the station in great sefton where else could she have been going at that hour but to london it isnt as if trains pass through great sefton as often as they do in waterloo station or charing cross there are only two a day the morning train to london and the evening train to portsmouth she was fond of the theater and the symphony her husband reminded her and mrs toller mentioned that victoria volunteered there arranging programs for the wounded ive told you before yes thats all well and good it doesnt convince me she wasnt spying on marjorie i said perhaps there was a man someone she cared about but they would have none of that not victoria they said they werent even certain shed cared for michael except for the fact that he belonged to marjorie she wanted him because she couldnt have him mrs hart declared and what she cant have she despises i tried to pin mr and mrs hart down to precise dates when theyd seen victoria in great sefton but too much time had passed when i left the harts i wondered if michael had weighed the grief his decision had inflicted on them protecting the dead was admirable but the living counted too from there i went to call on alicia her face was cool when she answered the door i said quickly before she could shut it again please im so sorry that i made you angry on my last visit it was wrong of me to exclude you when i spoke to the rectors cook i thought i was being wise and i was only being selfish i stopped seeing no softening in her expression ive only just come back from france i couldnt get leave for michaels trial and hes to be hanged next week i wanted her to know that i hadnt been in england since the day of our quarrel i was shocked by your behavior when he was taken into custody to argue with the constable and that man from scotland yard on a public street was unseemly it embarrassed me after all id introduced you to everyone here i didnt think that had bothered her as much as my interviewing the rectors cook on my own but i said it was the only chance i had to speak up i had to stand up for what i believed to be true at the time and he confessed didnt he to murdering one woman and attempting to murder another i couldnt believe it but i expect he did it to save his aunt and uncle the ordeal of a trial at least in that he showed some courage i didnt argue what good would it have done after a moment she said what brings you back to little sefton i came to offer my support to mr and mrs hart they are guilty of nothing except perhaps for loving michael and still believing in him he wasnt their child as victoria has been busy pointing out i dont think they consider whose child he was only that they are losing him before very long i hesitated and then said speaking of victoria i hear she was often in london did you ever go with her to a play grudgingly she answered me i did once yes i didnt enjoy it very much i didnt know anyone there and i felt guilty enjoying myself while gareth was in france i understand that no you cant you arent married the man you love isnt likely to be killed in the next push or at risk of dying in an aid station before you even hear that hes been wounded i realized then that she hadnt heard from him for a while and looking more closely i could see that she had passed sleepless nights as well im sometimes the last caring face they see i told her gently i often write letters for the dying i know that their last thoughts are for those they love she burst into tears then unable to hold them back burying her face in her hands you dont know no one can know i took her arm and led her into the house then sat with her as she cried after a while i went to the kitchen and found the kettle put it on and made a pot of tea she was quieter when i came back to the sitting room and drank her tea obediently sniffling at first and finally dully sitting there worn and worried im so sorry she said in a muffled voice ive been out of sorts worrying theres been no news for weeks and weeks if there is bad news you will know it wont take weeks and weeks taking a deep breath she set her teacup aside thank you bess she said simply and im so sorry about michael i feel responsible i introduced you to him i didnt dream no thats all right i rose to take my leave will you be all right now yes sometimes it just overwhelms me the worry about gareth following me to the door she added i am sorry about michael i know you were beginning to care for him but youll forget in time there will be someone else i didnt contradict her i thanked her for the tea and asked her to write to me if she felt like it i had reached the walk heading for my motorcar when she stopped me bess i turned i think victoria was seeing someone in london in the winter but it must not have come to anything it was over by the spring did you know who it was she shook her head i only heard the gossip someone told me he was an officer and mrs leighton swore that he was married she saw them coming out of a mean little restaurant near hampstead heath those were her words a mean little restaurant and she interpreted this as proof he was married because he hadnt taken victoria somewhere nice in london i thanked her glad we were parting as friends and walked back to the church where id left my motorcar id just turned the crank and stepped back when someone came up behind me i turned expecting it to be alicia again but it was victoria garrison i thought that was your vehicle hidden in the shrubbery where no one would notice it hardly the shrubbery if im not mistaken those are a stand of lilac what is it you want miss garrison to gloat well you wont be marrying michael hart ive seen to that i stood there stockstill feeling my jaw drop i snapped it shut and tried to think of something to say that wouldnt tell her how angry i was do you mean you were so willing to drive michael to london because you thought he might be falling in love with me he wanted to go i accommodated him i didnt stab poor helen and he did you dont believe that something flickered in her eyes how do you know what i feel she demanded in a different tone of voice how dare you even suggest you know me you just suggested that you knew me well enough to believe i was in love with michael hart and he with me well let me disabuse you of that notion what drew the two of us together was your sisters murder nothing more nothing less i liked michael i still like him but if he were freed tomorrow i wouldnt marry him im not in love with him and never will be alicia said she stopped ah the power of gossip and the damage it can do alicia has been matchmaking shes a happily married woman and she wants everyone to be just as happy because its all she can cling to with gareth at the front im sorry if ive disappointed you i got behind the wheel and she came to stand by my door pinning me there i dont believe you perhaps thats because you were in love yourself not long ago and like alicia expect that everyone else is looking for someone to care about for an instant i thought she was going to step closer and slap me i could see her hands clenching at her side a mixture of emotions passed across her face anger and something else that was barely controlled id wondered if she could kill and now i knew she could i drew back a little but she leaned toward me after looking around to be sure no one was near she said through clenched teeth have you ever seen someone die on a gallows that handsome face will be black and swollen hardly recognizable and i hope thats what you see in your dreams for the rest of your life i caught my breath meriwether evanson had called victoria evil and now i knew he was right what she had done to her mother and father to her sister what she had hoped to do to michael and what she had just said to me spoke of a deepseated streak of cruelty driving away before she could change her mind and do something rash i was glad to see the last of little sefton i was halfway to london before i was calm enough to go over again what id said to victoria garrison id been angry and yes a little frightened by her so the words were lost at first in the end they came back to me what id said hadnt angered herit was the fact that i knew something she wanted to hide if victoria had had a romantic fling in the winter it hadnt survived i couldnt help but wonder if he whoever he was had thrown her over for someone else married or not i turned the bonnet of my motorcar toward london and when i got there i went directly to the flat it seemed a haven just now it was late afternoon and mrs hennessey was out i climbed the stairs with a heavy heart and reached for the latch of our door but it opened under my hand someone was here i walked into the flat and mary glanced up from the letter she was writing after one look at me she frowned have you lost your last friend or your last penny she demanded and capped her pen before setting it aside and moving into what we euphemistically called our kitchen to make a pot of tea im in low spirits i admitted ive just been very rude to someone who was rude to me first and im trying to save a good friend from hanging and i am in the early stages of panic because he goes to the gallows next week she looked up from measuring the tea and said whos going to the gallows next week anyone i know michael hart he was convicted of the murder of serena meltons brothers wife marjorie evanson and of attacking a distant cousin of marjories with the intent to kill you do have an unusual range of friends bess she retorted i hope youre saying hes innocent god knows the evidence against him was strong but the feeling was he could very well be acquitted he had a very good barristermr forbes for the defensewho was certainly sanguine about his chances and then to everyones amazement and shock he changed his plea to guilty in the first minutes of the trial ah i remember now hes extraordinarily handsome i saw his photograph in some broadsheet or other no doubt they thought it was going to be a notorious scandalous trial and instead he disappointed everyone mary brought the tea to the table and set out the cups drink this and then tell me everything from the beginning you know a part of it doesnt matter start at the start i wont be able to see any solution if i dont know it all i didnt like telling mary all about the garrisons and the harts and the meltons she knew serena after all but mary is the soul of discretion and what i said to her would be treated like the confidence it was the afternoon had faded into early dusk by the time id finished and the teapot was empty the biscuits shed found in the cupboard hard and stale as they were had been finished as well theres something about eating a sweet that raises the spirits i sat back tired by the tale and tired from the emotions of the day and the long drive well there you have it she picked up the cups and the teapot to do the washing up and it was while she was working that she said i hesitate to tell you this bess but youre right the evidence is very strong against your lieutenant hart he isnt mine i said testily although everyone is busy insisting that he is all the same yes i know but theres just enough doubt my voice trailed away then i said but why do i have this sense of failure im a fairly good judge of character mary how could i be so wrong about the man i expect the reason is that you dont believe strongly in his motive that he killed marjorie evanson because she was seeing someone else but he knew her husband and it seems to me that a decent man wouldnt kill a married woman because shed been dithering with someone else instead of him he was more likely to lecture her on her behavior and make certain that the man was out of her life altogether simon would have done that wouldnt he if you stood in marjories shoes well you arent married of course but you know what i mean it was typically convolutedmary was good at convolutingbut she was also very sensible and practical it was what made her an excellent nurse i do see i was already feeling better and even if he went to helen calders house i cant understand why he would have a reason to kill her but thats the problem she can remember that he was coming but not why or if he was the one who stabbed her who knew he was going to her house his aunt and uncle unless of course victoria was suspicious and followed him who would victoria tell mary asked if she saw him at the calder house and was angry enough to do a mischief iim not sure i said slowly why would she tell anyone you said there was speculation that shed been seeing someone in london a man what if he was the same man who killed marjorie that makes no sense it would do if she has made a practice of spoiling marjories chances but he wasnt the one who got marjorie pregnant you cant be sure of that but i can i told you i spoke to raymond melton while i was in france he was the man i saw with her at the railway station that evening she was dead only a few hours later and he was on his way to portsmouth he couldnt possibly have killed her were back where we began didnt you say he denied leaving that train yes what if hes telling the truth what if he wasnt her lover i saw the way marjorie was clinging to him in distressdespair i gave it some thought youre saying that he was there at the station with her and shed told him the truth about her circumstancesbut he wasnt her lover id dismissed that idea earlier i went on slowly but if she did indeed confide in him and he wasnt the man responsible for getting her pregnant then he must have known who that man was thats why he was there i remembered the small flicker of satisfaction in raymond meltons eyes when i confronted him in the ward he had told me the literal truthbut not the whole truth and she contacted him because the other man refused to speak to her after the affair was over that happens mary said all too often in fact remember nan wilson who was in love with that frenchman who was here with the diplomatic corps he was some sort of military attache and when he went back to france and she found herself in trouble he sent her letters back unopened marked address unknown i did remember it would explain so much id wondered why marjorie evanson had let herself be seduced by raymond melton after all her own father had been the same sort of cold and uncaring man i understood why hed offered no comfort kissed her cheek so perfunctorily i remembered how hed walked away without looking backeven if the love affair was overto make certain she was all right he had done his duty he had listened to her pleas for help told her he could do nothing about her situation and calmly boarded his train it was such a calculated and callous act that i was stunned who would raymond melton do such a service for the answer was simple his brother jack chapter nineteen jack melton i whispered the name aloud as if by hearing it spoken i confirmed it and then i thought poor serena how frantic she had been to put a name to the man who was responsible for marjories plight and id heard her husband pretend to advise her as if it were his dearest wish as well that those weekend parties be successful and all the time the man she was after was within arms reach hed let her anger and her determination make her life a misery and hed even expressed his concern about her to me had she also secretly prayed that the man she was looking for wasnt her own husband it would explain so much about her her shrillness her rudeness her frustration what had made her suspect him of having an affair did she suspect him of murder as well as adultery surely not i remembered the day id encountered jack melton outside the marlborough hotel he had known that michael hart was in england the night that marjorie evanson was killed but how could he have known unless she had told him herself how easy it would have been for raymond melton to find a telephone in portsmouth on his way to the docks and put in a call to his brother to say that the meeting with marjorie hadnt gone as well as expected or that shed made threats as a last resort she could even have brought up michaels name hes in london tonight ill speak to him and well see how jack feels then about not talking to me himself it wasnt out of the realm of possibility still conjecture wouldnt stop michael from hanging i said to mary im so sorrythese are your friends she answered me with a sigh then said serena is my friend and she will need me when the truth comes out as it must bess dont you see shes a victim too shes already lost her brother we cant leave her to the mercy of a man like that what if she discovers hes a killer i found a telephone and called my parents first to tell them that i was in london now and second to ask my father if there was any news from simon my father said gently bess my dear i dont think michael will wish to see you you mustnt let yourself hope but how can we do anything for him if he wont answer questions his aunt and uncle are grieving he ought to think of the living as well as the dead will it do if simon or i go to see him my heart plummeted i wanted to see michael i wanted to see for myself how he was bearing up and whether pleading guilty had weighed heavily on his conscienceor freed it i wanted to see whether he had any use of his shoulder and arm or if the case there was as hopeless as hed been told but how to explain this to my fatheror for that matter to simonwithout arousing their protective instincts thinking to spare me added grief if michael was guilty i could accept it if he wasnt it was a terrible waste of a mans life and reputation to die in the misplaced belief that he was sparing marjorie i couldnt stand in judgment of herbut her affair had touched other lives led to her murder the death of her husband the attack on helen calder i saw no good reason to add another death to that list especially since it could mean that the real murderer went free i wasnt sure we would ever know what drove marjorie evanson into a love affair the truth may have died with her that was how it should be my fathers voice came down the line bess are you still there please if he can be persuaded to see me i still want to go if he absolutely refuses then simon should go in my place michael knows him ill make a list of what i need to learn its important otherwise i wouldnt insist it would help if i knewhave you any information that could overturn the verdict ill speak to inspector herbert if you have im not sure im leaving nowim going back to little sefton theres something i must do there not tonight bess thats not wise wait until morning there arent enough mornings left i tried not to let what i was feeling seep into my voice wailing would do no good please will you speak to simon i promise that was enough for me if you promise not to drive anywhere tonight i was caught on the horns of a dilemma finally i said yes all right i agree ill leave a list of the questions with mrs hennessey tomorrow morning will that be all right as long as it isnt a letter and if you have a personal message let simon give it orally prison officials are strict bess and you dont want him to be turned away yes thank you good advice i hung up and left the hotel deciding to walk back to the apartment to clear my head the exercise was good the air cool and fresh the streets for some reason nearly empty then i recalled that it was the dinner hour and most people were at home where they belonged as mrs hennesseys house with its wartime flats came into view down the street i thought how helpful mary had been in putting what id learned into perspective despite her friendship with serena id been fortunate with my flatmates diana and mary and the others had been good friends and the sort of women who made sharing a flat bearable mrs hennessey was dependable caring and willing to look in on us if we were ill i felt safe here opening the outer door i saw her peering out her own door and then she came to greet me you look tired have you just come home from the front ive been in somerset i told her but that wasnt altogether true she came closer as if to see me better you arent grieving for that young man they just took up for murder no not grieving just sad im not sure hes guilty if a judge feels he is then he is she said nodding theyre nobodys fools are judges no i didnt feel like arguing with her but talking about michael suddenly reminded me of inspector herbert i turned around and started back through the door id just come in if mary comes down to ask for me tell her ill return shortly i thought about driving then decided to find a cab but that wasted precious minutes and i was almost on the edge of my seat as i reached trafalgar square scotland yard was within walking distance now the constable guarding the door told me that he thought inspector herbert had already left for the day its very important could you ask to be sure he must have heard those wordsits very importanta thousand times over but he nodded and went away to find out where inspector herbert might be i felt i had waited an hour or more but then the constable came back and with him another man a sergeant miller who led me up the stairs and down the passage to inspector herberts office i thanked the sergeant took a deep breath and knocked lightly on the door inspector herberts voice bade me enter but as i walked through the door his face changed they said a young womanno one gave me your name they werent sure you were here may i speak to you if its about michael harts execution theres nothing i can do to prevent it i havent come about that but id like to knowwere you in the courtroom when he pleaded guilty he hesitated yes i was he said finally what did you think what did you feel surprise like everyone else id been told our case was sound but that it wasnt a certainty for one thing hart is a handsome man he had some public sympathy a male jury wouldnt be swayed by that of course but even jurors have wives and daughters i was prepared for anything to tell you the truth but not for a guilty plea i expected hart to take his chances do you know why he did it i have my suspicions the prison surgeons report that harts arm is likely to be useless was a factor im sure in fact i was told he was put on a suicide watch after the doctor completed his examination have you visited michael in prison inspector herbert who had been speaking directly to me as i stood there before his desk looked toward a filing cabinet against the lefthand wall no i saw no point in going there i dont think hed have cared for my sympathy the other reason for his plea was to spare marjories memory and reputation he wouldnt have wanted her name to be dragged through the court theres that he conceded can you arrange for me to see lieutenant hart i dont feel thats wise besides hes asked to have visitors turned away there was a list he fished around on his cluttered desk and came up with a sheet of paper reading from it he said victoria garrison is at the top of the list shes the sister of his first victim i made no answer looking up he said irritably do sit down miss crawford i dont bite i sat down and waited the next names on the list are his aunt and uncle after theirs comes yours i took a deep breath id expected that but it still hurt he set the list aside for what its worth i believe he cared for you miss crawford thats nowhere near the truth inspector and you know it he loved marjorie evanson no one else i believe he liked me as i liked him that was as far as it went caught in trying to be kind inspector herbert was flustered he set the list aside and turned to look out at the reflection of londons lights against the low clouds that had been rolling in for the past hour or so when he turned back he was himself again miss crawford just what is it you want i want to tell you a story you owe it to me to listeni gave you considerable help in closing this inquiry i dont have time i shant be long i wasnt overawed by scotland yard as a nurse id learned to deal with patients their families matronwho could be far more intimidating than inspector herbertimpatient doctors and officers of every rank still i would need to be brief on the mark or id lose this one chance for one thing i spoke to captain melton in france hes in hospital thereor was before i left he admitted to being in the railway station with mrs evanson but wouldnt admit that he was her lover id thought he was and for a time so did you in fact you had decided not to pursue questioning him as his statement was irrelevant to mrs evansons murder his alibi was the train to portsmouth he was wary now and thats it he was very smug during our conversation he finally told me that he had not left the train before portsmouth i realized later he could have telephoned someone before boarding his ship remember i couldnt understand why he left her there without even seeing that she had a cup of tea in the canteen or someone to take her home why he was so distant very callous of him i agree but get to the point if you please that is my point if he wasnt the childs father why was he there that day because melton knew the man who actually was her lover and he had been sent there to deal with marjorie if he could somehow i wasnt surprisedraymond melton was hardly the sort of man to attract someone like marjorie evanson whats more i also realized he was too much like her father youre concluding that we still dont know the name of her lover does it matter if you had seduced a married woman and suspected she was carrying your child how many people would you tell and if you needed a friend to help by meeting a weeping woman in a very public place where would you turn inspector herbert hesitated then against his will he said i doubt id have told anyone id have dealt with it myself i smiled because youre an honorable man you wouldnt have enticed marjorie evanson into doing something that was going to ruin her life then i asked do you have a brother inspector herbert if you dared not be seen in a compromising situation because you were often in london and your face was known because you were at the admiralty would you have asked your brother to meet this nuisance of a woman for you after all he was passing through on the train and in the short stopover here he could give her a message for you and the message was since the affair had been over for months now you couldnt be sure the child she was carrying was yours and that you were sorry but there it was i dont have a brother he paused watching me but melton does of course if your brother had agreed to do this for you youd want to knowbefore he sailed for francewhether hed been successful in putting this distraught woman off youd ask him to find a telephone before he took ship miss crawford you told me that youd not come here to stop harts execution i havent i said i thought perhaps youd like to hear what went on after that conversation i witnessed at the railway station ive tried to piece it together from actual facts it isnt all my imagination yes i understand and its just as well to have this matter closed he cleared his throat and there are telephones to be found in portsmouth are there not it would be possible to put in a call perhaps only three words i got nowhere then report to your transport in good time and arrive in france in good time yes all right of course allowing for the time to travel from london to portsmouthseveral hoursyoud probably await your brothers call in london not at home at the marlborough hotel for instance or a quieter place where you werent readily recognized there was always the possibility that it would take more than three words that there was a problem that the brother couldnt handle in your place inspector herbert said nothing you would have had to know where to find marjorie of course and your brother would have been instructedin the event something didnt go as plannedto ask her to meet you at a time and place where you could deal with the unpleasant situation i paused ill have to call jack when i reach portsmouth meet him at nine oclock at this park or that small restaurant where neither of you is known or by the river where youd have a little privacy and marjorie would have walked for a while to get her emotions under control then hurried to make sure she wasnt late at the designated place just in case it was a trick of some kind you might say you hadnt seen her and left or that you were early and couldnt wait which meant she would have to see michael afterward when she knew for certain what she wanted to tell him she would have met you and walked a little way with you along the river talking about what was to be done she wouldnt have been afraid and so you could have stabbed her at any time it was raining there werent many people strolling by the river on such a night and youd take your chance when it was offered whatever you had to promise in the meantime it was too dark to see if she was dead so for good measure you shoved her into the river to drown a very neat reconstruction miss crawford i doubt that its more than that yes well jack melton had a better reason for murdering marjorie than michael hart had whats more he gave himself away when i spoke to him outside the marlborough hotel weeks ago i told you about that encounter because id lost my temper and confessed to him id seen the man with marjorie at the railway station he lost his temper as well accused me of blackmail and then told me that michael hart had been in london the night she was killed if jack melton was spending a quiet evening at home how would he know that no one did except for the physician who treated michael and possibly marjorie evanson if she knew about his eye she might well have told jack melton what she was planning to do a threat to hold over him to make him keep his promise shed had time to think about it four hours at the very least id finished before he could reply i stood up and added my reconstruction is as valid as yours i think who knows which is actually right probably only jack melton and michael hart although i think jacks wife is beginning to wonder what will happen to her if she works it out as well thank you for your time inspector i am sorry that i ever led you to michael hart but thats water over the dam im afraid as i reached the door he said to me we would have found him in time or would you have interviewed raymond melton as i did and seen that brief flicker of satisfaction when he told me he never left the train before portsmouth of course he never left it he neednt have goodbye and i closed the door before he could say anything else a constable was waiting to escort me to the street and i stepped out into the night air feeling it cool and fresh on my face and found myself thinking that michael would see the light of day for the last time when he went to the gallows one more day gone but not quite i went to see helen calder to my surprise she was at home but i was informed that she wasnt receiving visitors tell her that its bess crawford ask her if shell see me for just a few minutes and she did i was taken back to the sitting room which had been transformed with a bed and chair and the other accoutrements of a sickroom mrs calder was already in bed her hair brushed and hanging to her shoulders wearing a very becoming nightgown in a pale lavender covered by a darker lavender shawl miss crawford she said and i could hear the wariness in her voice i havent come to worry you i told her straightaway im here to ask how you are i havent been back in england for very long or id have come sooner are you recovering on schedule for she seemed pale her hands restless on the coverlet the doctor says im quite recovered but i dont feel that i am i seem so tired and i dont have the energy to go anywhere or do anything this bed should have been taken down days ago but i still find it difficult to climb the stairs there was the underlying complaining note of the invalid beneath the words you look so well i said asking silent forgiveness for the lie i was hoping for good news i havent slept well in some time not sincenot for some time i understood not since her words had sent michael hart to trial i said never mind that will come in time youve been very ill you know it isnt surprising that you still feel a little uncomfortable it isnt pain i mean to say i dont hurt im just dreadfully tired and that was depression her feeling of guilt a burden she didnt recognize do you want to talk about michael i asked gently perhaps youll feel better afterward she began to cry i cant help it he was coming to see mei expected himand his was the name i spoke when that policeman found me in the garden you told the truth you know as far as you remembered it theres no guilt in that but hes to hang and how am i ever to forget that it was my words that sealed his fate what if i havent remembered it properly what if its confused because of my injuries and i only remember next month or next year when its too late he condemned himself he did it for marjories sake ive no doubt of that he would do when things appeared to be so hopeless anyway he could at least spare her she found a fresh handkerchief but the tears hadnt stopped i find it so hard to believe that he could have killed her not when he loved her so if he were that sort of person hed have killed her before she could marry meriwether i lay awake trying to see the face of the person who attacked me i try and try and nothing comes what am i to do whenaftermichael is dead and i see that face clearly and know beyond a shadow of any doubt that it wasnt him i felt pity for her her life would never be the same through no fault of her own and she was right she would be forever haunted whether the face came clearly to her or not there would always be that uncertainty and that burden of guilt i said to change the subject were they able to bring your husband home from france oh yes he came i was so grateful i felt so safe when he was with me but he had to go back once i was out of danger compassionate leave they called it he was so angry you know he said if he could find the person who did this hed kill the man with his bare hands and i think he would have done i never told him about saying michaels name over and over again then he was gone and it was too late it was the only thing you could do i hesitated tell me did you ever see marjorie with someone named jack melton or hear her mention him i know him of course i do hes serenas husband he was at the wedding but afterward more recently perhaps did marjorie tell you that shed run into him by chance i dont think so she frowned trying to remember but she probably wouldnt have hes in london from time to time hes taken me to lunch once or twice and im sure hes taken marjorie as well you know how it is london is so full of strangers these days one walks down the street and feels as if one is in a foreign city when one encounters a familiar face its almost a relief i tried to think of another way to bring up jack melton without giving her more reasons for feeling terrible about michaels fate but then i remembered victoria and switched the subject again did victoria come often to london to see marjorie oh never she was at the engagement party of course and the wedding thats about the only time i remember seeing her at marjories house and she never came here she knew how i felt about her the way shed treated her mother im told she did come to london often for several months in a row and then she stopped coming the harts wondered if she was spying on marjorie spying on her i cant imagine why well marjorie did say that she had run into her while looking for a wedding present for a friend that was in may i think but that was it marjorie was in a hurry and got out of the encounter as quickly as possible she said victoria wanted to know how meriwether was and seemed inclined to talk but marjorie wasnt in the mood and had victorias curiosity been tweaked and had she followed her sister to see where she was in such a hurry to go i wouldnt put it past her what is it that makes victoria carry such a grudge was it just michael she seemed to have everything else she wantedthe house marjorie settled out of sight and mind in london what else was there to take away its the will not many people know the garrison house was left to victoria of course but the estate was divided fairly evenly much to victorias chagrin let me tell you there was a scene in the solicitors office id gone with marjorie as moral support and i was very glad i had although it was a dreadful time i must say and on top of that was the way the trust was constructed i dont understand all of it but from what i gatheredwhat marjorie gathered from the actual reading and told mewas distinctly odd neither daughter inherits anything outright he forgave marjorieor at the end felt some doubt about what hed been told by victoria im not so sure you see while both girls could draw on the income from their share of the trust the capital wouldnt be distributed until both of them reached fifty past childbearing age at that time the trust would be dissolved however if either daughter bore a child before that and it was given its grandfathers name the house and the entire trust would go to it at age twentyone there would be nothing left for marjorie and victoria i caught my breath it was a cruel provisionit pitted sister against sister and i had the fleeting thought that perhaps victoria had inherited her fathers mean spirit after all hed turned against his wife and his daughter and in the end hed punished both daughters for that as victoria had tried to punish marjorie but marjorie was expecting a child unless meriwether was willing to acknowledge it and give it his name the child would be a garrisonmarjories maiden name what a revenge against her sister for all the grief that marjorie had suffered it was almost shocking to contemplate what victoria might do given that knowledge after all her scheming she would have lost everything did anyone else know the contents of the will i asked the servants were there for the reading of course there was a small bequest to each of them then we were asked to leave the final provision was read only to victoria and marjorie as i mentioned there was a terrific row and none of us knew where to look you could hear it but not the words of course victoria screaming and once marjorie laughing if mr blake hadnt been there theyd have been at each others throats i expect marjorie told her sister that as a married womanthe wedding was to be that october you seeshe might soon see victoria evicted how long ago was this when did mr garrison die in the winter of six months before the war began meriwether had already told marjorie that he wanted to fly that he wanted above all things to be a pilot marjorie told me later that victoria had said if theres a war i hope hes shot down and killed it will serve you right three years ago the wounds would still be raw and when victoria had asked after meriwether when the sisters met in may it had not been a friendly overtureit had been a reminder that marjorie hadnt had her child and that meriwether was still at risk but if thats how the trust stood why didnt victoria marry as soon as possible and have a child of her own and lose her house and her substantial income to it besides i think she wanted to marry michael and throw that in marjories face she might have taken the risk for him i could almost believe that it was victoria who killed marjorie that perhaps marjorie had gloated about the child she was carrying it would make sense oh im sure victoria isnt a murderer but it might explain as well why helen calder herself had been stabbed if marjorie had told her about the peculiar provision and now she was about to tell michael was that the question he was burning to ask helen it gave victoria the perfect motive for murder had i been wrong about jack melton i hadnt known about the will when i spoke to inspector herbert and i couldnt go back to scotland yard helen calder must have read the uncertainty in my face you surely dont believe that victoria attacked marjorie or me no she may be vicious and uncaring but shes no murderer shes my cousin as if that prevented murder from happening in a family helen calder leaned back against her pillow you have successfully diverted me from thinking about michael that was very kind of you bess i said did you know that victoria tried to persuade meriwether not to marry marjorie he was furious with her i thought she was just being a spoiler but perhaps she had the will in mind i wouldnt be surprised it was just the sort of thing she might do the harts had called victoria evil but i wondered if seeing all her schemes come to nothing she must have been beside herself with fury and perhaps helping to destroy michael had been the last act of vengeance open to her in addition to seeing her sisters name dragged through the scandal sheets im tired now but im so glad you came to see me bess im glad too i told her meaning it but remember im a nurse i know wounds if you languish here youll never recover get up and dress and go out for lunch somewhere it will do you the greatest good youll see but she shook her head i couldnt enjoy myself knowing that michael is counting the days down to his last perhapsperhaps when its over ill feel more like going out there was nothing i could say that would change her mind i held her hand for a moment and then left my own mind was in turmoil none of the questions id left for simon had anything to do with victoria only with jack melton if helen calder believed she carried a burden of guilt she had no idea of the depth and breadth of mine at this moment i found a cab and gave him the direction of mrs hennesseys house then sat back in the anonymous darkness and told myself over and over again that i wouldnt fail that i wouldnt be too late chapter twenty to my surprise when i reached mrs hennesseys house and the cabbie had been paid it was simon brandon who held the door for me to step out have you been to see michael those were the first words out of my mouth im doing my best to arrange it have you had any dinner you look distressed standing there on the street looking up at him i burst into tears he held me for a while letting me cry into his lapels then he said briskly if you arent starving i am he led me to his motorcar and put me inside coming around to the drivers door he went on where would you like to go nowhere ive been crying so you have he drove through london through the city and came out on the far side of the tower down toward the river it was hardly what anyone would call a restaurant just a few tables and a counter where during the day workingmen might sit and eat their lunch except for one man who looked half asleep at a table by the window the place was empty we walked in and simon nodded to the aproned man who stuck his head out of what must have been the kitchen seeing who had come in he nodded then disappeared we took the table in the far back corner and i expected to find it dotted with crumbs and spots of grease from the diners before us but it was spotlessly clean though worn and the man reappeared from the kitchen with a cloth for it and our silverware he brought simon an ale and asked what id have simon answered for me tea he said the man disappeared again intrigued i said he knows you ive come here from time to time he was a cook in the regiment this was what he dreamed about a small place of his own where there were never more than twenty people to serve at any one time i smiled in spite of myself i can appreciate that he wont remember you well leave it that way shall we nodding i said what do they serve fish it comes in fresh he never says from where but i would guess essex there are enough tiny coves and waterways there for a fleet of fishing vessels to hide if they even smell a german ship or uboat people have to eat theres precious little food as it is i thought all the channels were mined those who saw to it were absentminded we waited in silence until our plates were brought steaming on chargers and smelling heavenly of wellcooked fish todays bread and a surprising array of vegetables we began to eat and i realized just how hungry i was halfway through the meal i said do you want to know not here just eat your dinner and put it all out of your mind i did as i was told grateful actually for the respite when wed finished and id drunk my tea simon got up to settle his account with the owner and then we went out to the motorcar driving back the way wed come he found a place in a street above trafalgar square and we left the motorcar there walking down to the square and settling ourselves near the ugly lions there was no one about and even the traffic heading down the mall was light all right im listening he said i began to talk slowly at first then with gathering assurance as he listened without interrupting when id finished he leaned back against the wall behind him and considered me youve hardly been in england three days and already youve managed to confuse yourself and me i laughed as hed intended then i said what am i to do simon will any of this help michael we need to take what we know to his barrister name of forbes find out if the man will listen to us at all he was in an almighty fury when hart did what he did i should think he might have been he must have felt betrayed and people like that dont care to be ignored its losing face in a sense ill try to get in to see michael if hell see me but i think he might you should keep your fingers crossed shall i try to see mr forbes he considered me a pretty face might have better luck but i think the evidence in both victoria garrisons case and in jack meltons as well has merit on the surface they cast doubts because they are as good as the evidence herbert gave the crown whether they would hold up if investigated is another matter simon there isnt time for a lengthy and thorough investigation my voice had risen and a passing constable turned then walked our way everything all right then miss he asked i smiled as best i could sad news thats all thank you constable he nodded and walked off simon watched him go then turned back to me i dont know what to tell you bess youve done wonders no one could have done more if only wed known before the trialbut there was no way to know what youre saying i retorted is that the chances are slim to none and michael will hang well i wont be satisfied with exonerating him after his death you have to face it your mother is worried about that she wonders if you aretoo fond of him i wont die of a broken heart i told him but i will have a hard time forgetting you still must remember one thing bess he may be guilty theres always that chance no i said resolutely he wouldnt have killed marjorie for the reason given he loved her enough to let her live her life as she chose even if it included marrying meriwether evanson and having an affair with a married man he was silent for a time his mind a long way away from me and then he came back and said well its late ive bespoken a bed at my club time to return you to the dragon mrs hennessey isnt a dragon and you know it he laughed and gave me a hand to rise it was warm and comforting then we walked in companionable silence to where wed left the motorcar i slept that night mainly because i was very tired emotionally drained and had taught myself to snatch sleep where i could and when i could that training stood me in good stead once more mary was up making tea before i dragged myself out of bed and walked into the kitchen drawing the sash of my robe around me anything new she asked casually and when i didnt say anything right away she added i did glimpse simon waiting for you last night nodding i told her about seeing inspector herbert and then speaking to helen calder its such a pity that she cant remember anything really useful about her attack it would make a difference we cant count on it no on the other hand if you want my vote ill plump for victoria shes a nasty piece of work anyway you look at her if jack was marjories lover hes no better he knew she was married he knew whom shed married it was a malicious thing to do to his wife never mind marjorie i know jack melton mary said i dont know victoria be glad i must go and speak to a mr forbes today he was michaels counsel forbes she frowned i think i went out with his son a time or two i dont envy you he has a reputation for eating prosecution witnesses alive i laughed know where i can find him not a clue i never met him ill try the inns first wear your uniform it might get you in to see him clever thinking i went off to dress wondering if mr forbes might be in court today i prayed he wasnt as it happened when i reached his chambers not far from the inns of court he was preparing to leave to interview a witness i was taken down a narrow passage to a room nearly overflowing with briefs and law books a ladder leaning against the tall shelves an empty hearth surrounded by a victorian mantelpiece that would have done justice to a french chateau it was so massive and a desk with nothing more on it than an inkwell a tray of pens a blotter and a small statue of blind justice sitting on a purbeck marble base mr forbes regarded me with impatience which was rather more daunting than lack of interest he was a spare man with graying hair that would have suited an oxford don overly long and quite thick the spectacles he wore hid sharp blue eyes that were unpleasantly piercing a feeling of unspecified guilt materialized from out of nowhere and swept over me when i told him my reason for coming he said shortly lieutenant hart made his decision he took the case in the direction he chose not the one i was prepared to follow he refused any appeal young mr hart is a fool i washed my hands of him give me five minutes of your time mr forbes and then tell me what advice you would give him now young woman i dont know what reason you have to involve yourself in the affairs of a man condemned by his own words and sentenced to hang but i suspect that if your parents knew you were here today they would be appalled colonel crawford is well aware of what i am doing well not completely but he knew how i felt about getting to the bottom of things and i knew hed back me up then lecture me privately the question is a very simple one mr forbes do you believe that lieutenant hart is guilty despite his chances of acquittal on all charges when he didnt answer i added do you believe that michael hart deliberately set out to damage your reputation by changing his plea at the last minute or did he act out of despair and a misguided attempt to protect marjorie evansons good name he stood up looming over me his mouth a long thin line and then he said i suggest you leave while i remember that you are young and in love i am not in love i told him taking my courage in both hands and remembering that an attack is often the best line of defense i have certain facts to present to you and you may well discover that they have some merit to them but you wont know if you dont listen to them it could be that michael hart hangs on the day allotted ill be back in france by that time but i should like to see his name cleared in the end thats probably all i can do for him i believe he deserves that final redemption i wasnt sure where the words had come from they were suddenly there on the tip of my tongue and my emotions were already running high mr forbes sat down again very well he took out his pocket watch and set it on the table before him you have your five minutes miss crawford proceed i was certain hed agreed because he thought that i would make a fool of myself stumbling over emotional attempts to be clever then he could put me in my place and show me the door he had overlooked the fact that i was a nurse and accustomed to thinking clearly in a crisis i collected myself as i had done in inspector herberts small office and outlined as i had done there the case against jack melton and then with equal brevity i outlined the case against victoria garrison mr forbes sat there listening with his eyes on the watch before him nothing in his face indicating whether he was actually heeding me or simply marking time i finished and rose to go i could see his watchi still had thirty seconds of my five minutes you would do better he said before i was out of my chair to have taken your facts to scotland yard i did present my arguments regarding commander melton to inspector herbert sadly i didnt know about mr garrisons will or i would have told him about victoria garrison as well did you know that mrs evansons solicitor couldnt find her will the staff told us that she was considering changing it she had a child to protect and she must not have been certain her husband would accept it perhaps she wanted something from its father tooa promise to recognize it as the price of his own sins after all the meltons have no children mr forbes said miss crawford casting doubt on the facts of the case will not help lieutenant hart i remind you he confessed of his own free will in open court then what would stop this execution if mrs calder remembers the night she was stabbed and can tell the police who attacked her assuming naturally that it wasnt hart it was so unfair ive spoken to her shes been made ill by trying to remember its a medical problem not a parlor game is there no other recourse of course give the police the murderer himself or herself i thought he was playing with me now that made me angry after a moment he added i know mr melton i refuse to believe hed kill someone even in anger then you should never have taken michael harts brief i retorted id failed but mr forbess remark most certainly reinforced the fact that jack melton fearing damage to his own reputation had sent his brother to meet marjorie evanson mr forbes picked up his watch restored it to his pocket and made a fuss of settling the chain across his vest i thought my words had stung a little i rose and walked to the door thank you for your time mr forbes my hand was on the knob when mr forbes said you must also surmount the obstacle of lieutenant harts refusal to be helped i turned to stare at him accepting for the first time the fact that michael would hang someone should have reminded him that while hes being gallant and selfish marjorie evansons murderer will live a long and happy life he added i quietly closed the door behind me as i walked down the passage past the clerks rooms i told myself that id done everything that was humanly possible i could do no more nevertheless i refused to be reconciled to michaels fate as i stepped out into blindingly bright sunlight after the dim paneled walls id just left mr forbess words echoed in my head give the police the murderer himself or herself and that was going to be a challenge for a fleeting moment i wondered if mr forbes had meant it to be chapter twentyone i walked nearly a mile before i looked for a cab to take me back to the flat i needed the exercise to counteract the depression settling over me but it did little to help i reminded myself that men could be incredibly stubborn and unconscionably blind at times and that also failed to bring me any consolation would simon brandon have any better luck talking to michael in his prison cell simon could be very persuasive when he wished to be but chances were michael had already reconciled himself to dying id seen soldiers do thatmake peace with the knowledge that they would very likely not survive so that survival didnt enter into any decisions that they would have to make on the battlefield as the cab made its way around buckingham palace and the royal mews turning toward mrs hennesseys house and the flat i looked out at the afternoon sunlight slanting across londons landmarks and wondered what to do next i felt at a loss with no purpose how does one find a murderer in a matter of a few days in my careful reconstruction of the evidence against jack melton and victoria garrison there had to be a flaw but where i closed my eyes reviewing everything id said and then i sat back in the cab breathless for a moment everything had fit to perfection except for one thing how had jack melton known that michael was intent on speaking to mrs calder coincidence accident if i knew the answer to that i could eliminate him from my quest what had driven jack melton to murder a second time it wouldnt do to appear at melton hall and ask questions serena would show me the door if her husband didnt i bit my lip thinking but my mind was a blank all right then save time and eliminate victoria garrison from the role as murderess we were just pulling up in front of mrs hennesseys door i hastily returned to the present and got out paying the driver as i did above my head the lateafternoon sun was turning the windows of our flat to gold it was the only time beauty entered the sensible little flat designed to be a home for a few of the hundreds of people who had descended on london at the start of the war to work in one capacity or another i went inside and climbed the stairs if only michael would listen to simon and decide to help at last in his own defense wishful thinking indeed how many people facing the gallows suddenly proclaimed their innocence no one would even listen but at least i could find out what he knew i had begun to make myself a cup of tea now i set the tin back in the cupboard put the cup and saucer on the shelf caught up my coat and went flying down the stairs it made no sense to sit here in london i needed to talk to victoria i stopped at mrs hennesseys door and knocked she didnt answer but as i was about to turn away the door finally opened her eyes still heavy with sleep she said oh bess dear i was just doing a little ironing i smiled she never liked to be caught napping in the afternoon i have to travel to little sefton mrs hennessey thats in hampshire the train leaves in half an hour sergeantmajor brandon will be coming here looking for me will you tell him where ive gone tell him its important or i would have waited of course dear ill listen for his knock should you be going on your own like this youd make so much better time driving with him given the way the trains are these days but i had no idea when i could expect him i must hurry if im to find a cab please dont forget mrs hennessey no dear and i was out the door hurrying down the street to the corner by the bakery where i hoped to find a cab nothing i all but ran to the next block heads turning as i passed more sedate pedestrians finally a cab saw my wave and slowed down just in front of me waterloo station if you please i said slamming the door even as i spoke it was the same train that captain melton had taken and i nearly missed it crowded with soldiers the corridor filled to capacity and no seat to be had i resigned myself to an uncomfortable journey and then a young private noticed me sister he shyly offered me his place in the first compartment thanking him i sat down struggling to catch my breath scraps of conversation floated around me and over my head but i paid no attention i was hoping that mrs hennessey wouldnt fall asleep again and miss simons knock at her door settling myself at last i watched the outer villages of london slip past and the sun begin to sink in the west a great red ball of flame that cast long shadows over already misty landscapes lights were coming on in village houses facing east and in the increasingly frequent farms the weathervane on a church spire reflected the sun long after the churchyard below it lay in purple shadow too beautiful an evening to be hunting a murderer the soldier on my left asked where i was going and i smiled to myself he was very young i must have been two years his senior at the very least but he was tall broad shouldered and about to do a mans job so i listened to his stories about growing up in the fen country and how different it was from the scenery turning dark before our eyes and then great sefton was the next stop and i turned to wish him well wondering if one day id see him in a surgical theater or if he would even survive his first weeks in the trenches the lamps were lit in the station as i stepped down from the train and i went inside to ask the stationmaster if he could find someone to take me to little sefton ill be glad to miss he finished the list he had been making looked at his pocket watch and then the waitingroom clock if youll have a seat on that bench ill find sam he came back a few minutes later with a girl of perhaps seventeen driving a dogcart she smiled at me as i stepped out of the station here you are miss he said sam will see you safe to little sefton i thanked him and opened the gate of the cart stepping in and taking my seat do you drive people to little sefton often i asked fairly often my father kept a carriage for station use but the horses were taken away ive got only the pony left we trotted out of great sefton leaving behind a comfortable little town that had a pretty high street and a handsome church set on a green up the hill from it as the air cooled with sunset a mist rose turning the dark countryside a ghostly gray the lanterns on either side of the cart seemed to encircle us in a soft dancing light as the flames flickered but if the mist worried sam or her pony neither showed any sign of it do you know victoria garrison i asked to pass the time miss garrison yes she used to travel to london frequently but that stopped after several months she said she was bored with the company in london oh yes indeed i couldnt imagine being bored with london id give much to go there myself but my mum says she cant do without me and besides london is a pitfall for the unwary she laughed as she said it im the youngest and she holds on tight yet she allows you to drive strangers in the dark its safe enough mr hale the stationmaster wouldnt call me out if he didnt think it was all right which sounded like a good enough plan i could see she managed the pony with ease on the dark road and knew the way so well she could see it in her head every dip and twist every turn and how long the straight sections were the pony too was at home out here in the dark i wasnt sure i would like driving back to great sefton aloneeven though it couldnt be more than three miles but sam seemed to like the night and the silence we came into little sefton on the far side of the village from the part of it i knew best passing closed shops and even a small pub light from its windows spilling out into the dark street turning the mist to a murky orange the shops thinned and houses took their place and i caught a glimpse of the church through a tear in the mist where were you thinking of being put down sam asked slowing the pony from a trot to a walk suddenly i didnt feel comfortable walking up to victoria garrisons door i realized i should have waited for simon but it was already late and by the time he reached little sefton everyone could be in bed um do you know the hart house yes indeed i see him doing his banking in great sefton he always has a kind word i heard his nephew is to be hanged next week sad that i dont ever remember having a murderer in this part of the county sad indeed i said she drew up in front of the house but it appeared to be dark to me as if the harts were away or had retired early wait here will you for a moment im not sure anyone is at home dark as the grave she agreed and i stepped down i walked out of the carts comforting pool of misty lantern light and up to the door i could feel the clinging mist and shivered glad of my coat i found the knocker lifted it and let it fall it sounded overloud in the night but that was mostly my imagination i could feel my nerves taut with what lay ahead when no one answered my summons i tried again would anyone answer my knock at this hour the harts had grown reclusivethey wouldnt care to be disturbedand after all they had no way of knowing who was at their door what to do now i lifted the knocker again and gave it a substantial blow against the brass footplate i was on the point of turning around and walking back to the cart when i saw a light quivering in the window on the other side of the door then the door was opened the light from a lamp almost blinding me mr hart i asked unable to see who was behind the light miss crawford he exclaimed in astonishment what are you doing here at this hour is everything all right have you had news of michael could i come in and sit for a while i want to go to victoria garrisons house but not just yet would you mind no certainly not i forget my manners do come in as i did he saw sam waiting in her cart did you come by train he asked me and when i nodded he called out thank you sam ill drive miss crawford back to great sefton good night she called a good night to him and then lifted her reins i heard her soft walk on to the pony and then i turned back to mr hart im so sorry to disturb you had you retired for the night i asked as he shut the door behind me weve taken to sitting in the room at the back of the house people see no light and dont come to call it was a pity that their lives were so changed by what had happened i thought to myself that if michael could see and understand this tragedy he might take a different view of his own actions but he couldnt think of anyone but marjorie mr hart led me back to the room where his wife was sitting as the light preceded us down the passage she called who was it dear miss crawford shes come to sit with us awhile we had arrived at a sitting room where two other lamps were burning and i saw mrs hart get to her feet and stand there trembling its not tonight is it she asked me as if i had come to share their watch when michael died ive been in london today mrs hart i spoke to several people there i wanted to come and talk to you she sank back into her chair relief leaving her face pale her eyes still haunted thats so kind of you my dear we were just having tea would you like a cup oh yes please i would her husband disappeared and came back shortly with another cup and saucer she poured a cup for me and passed the dish of honey and the jug of milk the cup warmed my hands i didnt know whether it was the night chill or my own anxiety that made them feel cold i said i wonder if you knew the provisions of mr garrisons will his will mrs hart nodded i heard that the bulk of it was divided evenly between marjorie and victoria although the house went to victoria well not too surprising as marjorie had a home of her own in london nothing else i asked the usual bequests to the servants and to the church mr hart answered this time there was another provision and i told them about it i cant believe mrs hart began as shocked as i had been but then in the last year or so of his life mr garrison didnt seem to be himself i put that down to his illness but perhaps it wasnt spiteful i call it small wonder victoria never married although i often wondered if she would have changed her mind if michael had paid her the least attention mr hart said michael told us youd said that marjorie was expecting a child it would have inheritedthe will as i was told about it didnt specify a child in or out of wedlock only that it bear mr garrisons name which of course it would do if meriwether evanson refused to acknowledge it serves her right mrs hart said shortly victoria i mean mr hart said are you suggesting that victoria killed marjorie i dont know i admitted its possible if she had any reason to believe marjorie was pregnant she would have reacted strongly she stood to lose everythingher house her income she would have viewed it not as an unintended pregnancy but as marjories means of cheating her out of what she believed was rightfully hers just how far victoria would have taken her fury is anyones guess i wouldnt put it past her to have a spy in marjories house mrs hart said it was the sort of thing she would do since she wasnt invited there unless there was no way to avoid it michael had told me hed helped choose marjories servants but that didnt mean that one of them hadnt been amenable to bribery for telling tales i thought about that missing will marjorie was on the point of changing a spy would have been richly rewarded for passing on news that marjorie was suffering from what appeared to be morning sickness and had begun to reconsider her own will do you really think thats possible i asked turning to mr hart servants are as greedy as the rest of us he answered a few pounds added to their wages it would have been tempting and youve come to little sefton to ask victoria about this matter mrs hart wanted to know my dear why dont you stay the night and face this visit first thing in the morning ill be happy to lend you whatever you need the guest room is always ready it will be no trouble at all i believed her and was sorely tempted but i would lose another day and besides simon was coming to little sefton for me youre very kind mrs hart but if im wrong about victoria i must look elsewhere its too late to call on the meltons tonight but i can be in diddlestoke very early tomorrow mr hart was staring at me the other person was serena melton i sat there my cup halfway to my lips and looked at him over the rim what the other person you say i set my cup on the small table at my elbow i dont understand i didnt think to mention it she came to little sefton to see victoria it was the day michael went to the play but victoria wasnt at home and apparently the maid and the cook had been given the afternoon off she came here next to ask if michael knew where victoria had gone and how long it would be before she came back she apologized she didnt know anyone else in little sefton to ask buti didnt think those two got on well together victoria and serena they dont you see theres the matter of the house in london the two of them havent agreed on whats to become of it mrs melton feels that since meriwether died after marjorie he inherits victorias contention is that the house had belonged to marjories aunt on her mothers side and therefore reverted to the garrison family i expect mrs melton came about that she did say something about papers he smiled we hear the gossipand of course michael knows a little about marjories affairs i remembered something michael had said about the house in london remaining fully staffed while the question of ownership was being resolved id have thought theyd meet in londonneutral ground apparently she hadnt been able to reach victoria and as she was coming up from visiting a friend who lives south of us she decided to stop by and you told her that michael had gone to london with victoria i couldnt help the undercurrent of surprise in my voice it was so unexpected i saw no reason not to he said defensively of course he wouldnt have while the harts disliked victoria they would have told serena the truth if asked unaware of what might happen as a result of a few words i shouldnt worry about it if i were you i replied not wanting to add to their distress but im glad you told me i hadnt given it another thought he went on until you mentioned the meltons and that was probably true as well the point of serenas visit had been to find victoria not to betray michael did you tell michael about mrs melton stopping by i dont believe i did wed retired long before he arrived home and mrs calderdid you say anything about michael going in search of her no no mrs melton said she might catch them up before the curtain rose she asked if they were having dinner before the play i told her i thought not as michael wished to see a friend before dinner at that point she said she thought shed go directly home instead that she was already rather tired i think you did mention mrs calder mrs hart said im sure of it absolutely not i just said a friend id have remembered it doesnt matter by the time serena reached melton hall and told her husband he couldnt have reached london in time to kill anyone unlessunless of course he was in london already and she telephoned him to tell him she had arrived safely but had missed victoria after all she wasnt there you wont believe this but she and michael hart are attending a play together marjorie must be turning in her grave no i dont know what playprobably the one everyone is talking about even so even if such a conversation took place it didnt link helen calder michael hart and jack melton nothing had changed i looked at the clock on the table by the window i couldnt wait much longer it would be too late to call on anyone i said i hadnt realized the time i must go mrs hart started to say something then changed her mind mr hart rising said ill go with you let me fetch a coat and a light he paused to look out the window i dont think that mist has lifted no you mustnt i began then thought better of it caution my mother often told me was the best protection he was gone only a few minutes returning with a lightweight coat over his arm and a torch in his hand youll be careful wont you mrs hart asked him her eyes on me not that i expect any trouble but you never know do you we left her sitting there and i wondered if she would go to a window and watch our progress once the door was closed behind us i wrapped my arms around me against the damp then realized that i was cold because of nervousness matching my pace to mr harts using the torch as my guide i tried to get my bearings the mist gave everything a strange softness changing shapes obscuring distances i thought in passing that the mist would delay simon he wouldnt care for that we walked in silence past other houses shadowy forms with no details their windows only a smudge of brightness i heard laughter from one as a door opened and then closed a brief rectangle that loomed and vanished a dog barked sudden and shrill sending my heart into my throat i thought we must be near the church on the other side of the road but there was nothing to see three more houses one with a cat sitting on a low stone wall jumping down to twine around our legs as we came closer before trotting back to wait for the summons to its dinner when we reached the walk to victorias door through gardens that were black shapes until the torchlight touched them mr hart stopped here you are he said gesturing to a house i could barely perceive i said will you wait here she might speak more freely if i seem to be alone he was about to protest but i said dont worry ill stay within calling distance i promise he didnt like it but he stopped flicking off his torch and i went on up the walk nearer the door white flower blossoms glowed in the darkness on either side of the flagstones guiding me to the door where two stone urns held topiary trees i lifted the knocker still uncertain about what i would say to victoria when she opened the door but she didnt i knocked again nothing i called victoria i know youre at home its elizabeth crawford please let me in its important i thought she would ignore me but she must have been near the door because after a moment it swung open she was standing there in the sudden glare of lamplight from the entrance hall her face in shadow i could feel her antipathy ive told you hell hang and theres nothing you can say to me that will move me to do anything about it her voice was quite calm unyielding i want to ask you about jack melton that caught her by surprise she must have been expecting me to begin a passionate defense of michael hart instead what about jack melton her voice now was wary but her face was still expressionless i couldnt read anything there or in her eyes he was marjories lover did you know we all thought it must have been his brother captain melton but it wasnt what we dont know is how jack melton found out that michael was on his way to london with you the night helen calder was attacked but serena told him didnt she i was probing to see where it led i dont know what you are talking about she was hereserena meltonthe day you drove up to london to see the play she went to speak to michael when you werent at home but his uncle told her michael had gone with you so she drove on to melton hall and she must have told her husband why shed missed you victoria laughed you are desperate arent you i dont see how else it could have happened it was almost as if victoria couldnt bear to let serena take credit for something she hadnt done jack was in the theater that night he was with several american naval officers when i realized that i hoped he would see me there with michael but michael hadnt come back he was off somewhere nursing that shoulder of his but you told him michael had come to the play with you just before the curtain went up jack noticed the empty seat beside me and came over to speak to me he thought id come alone and he made some snide remark about that it irritated me and so i lied i told jack that i was expecting michael to join me at any moment but he was close to discovering the name of marjories lover from someone who knew her secret and he must have lost track of the time i said it to annoy jack and it did he went back to his seat and just as the lights went down he made some excuse to the americans and quietly left hed mentioned that they were sailing for new york the next day so they werent likely to gossip about his absence were they you sat there in the theater and let it happen you must have guessedjust because michael let you down you made jack angry enough to go looking for him but jack took you at your word didnt he and instead of hunting for michael he must have gone directly to helen calders she was the only friend who was likely to know marjories secrets and when she came home from her dinner party he must surely have believed that shed been out with michael telling him everything victoria dont you see that your malicious remarks nearly got mrs calder killed when jack came up behind her she even thought it was michael because she was expecting him dear god none of this needed to have happened none of it i felt sick i went to see a play and i saw it she was unrepentant and i caught a glimpse of that child who had tried to rearrange her family to her liking and you still cant prove which of them killed marjorie can you there was triumph in her voice she was rightshe would most certainly lie in the witness box but i said surelyyou deliberately taunted jack about something you should have stayed out of victoria if he killed marjorie and attacked helen calder whats to stop him from killing you after michael is hanged just to be sure his last link with your sister is broken youve put yourself at risk dont you see youre wagering your life that michael is the murderer jack told me michael had killed herthat michael was in london the night she died she didnt die victoria she was stabbed then thrown into the river to drown thats murder what if it was she brought it on herself didnt she if you want to know what i think she wanted a child she wanted to see me thrown out of this house they hadnt had any children she and meriwether and it was very likely they wouldnt i think she looked elsewhere even if that affair cost her her marriage there was always michael faithful michael in the wings or so she must have convinced herself i wanted to tell her about marjorie at the railway station about the despair and the desolation instead i asked how did you learn about marjorie and jack melton did she tell you i couldnt believe marjorie had even out of spite i saw them together quite by accident they didnt see me and i could tell by the way she stood there hanging on his every word that they were lovers so i made it my business to take him away from her she was peering past me into the milky darkness whos out there she demanded who did you bring with you its only mr hart michaels uncle he very kindly walked me this far because of the mist he has his torch with him to guide me back i dont want him here i promised i dont care what you promised send him away i turned and called to mr hart its all right will you wait for me near the church i wont be long im not sure he began unwilling to leave me here in the dark but i stopped him before he could say more truly its all right please the torch flicked on and after a moment it moved away toward the church on the opposite side of the street i doubted he could see me very well from there but at least he could hear if i shouted for him youve got your way i told victoria i should have turned and left then too but there was more she could tell me and for michaels sake i stayed you tried to trick me she accused angry now no such thing if id wanted a witness id have brought him to the door with me i doubt if he could have heard more than our voices i tried to warn meriwether that marjorie was just like our mothernot to be trusted and i was right she had an affair didnt she i was proved right and jack melton turned his back on her when she got pregnant i retorted defending marjorie that was hardly something to be proud of she studied my face you dont understand do you i really didnt like my sister i felt nothing when she died but relief she was going to winwhy should i weep over her or that child but murder i tell you it was as if it had happened to a stranger someone you read about in a newspaper cluck your tongue over her death and then turn the page michael told me you believed he knew more about marjories death than he was telling you jack said marjorie had gone to see michael that night before she was killed i wanted to know if it was true she looked away and i knew then that she hadnt been sure whether to believe jack melton or not but in the end shed decided to sacrifice michael hart because it was her last chance to destroy everything that marjorie had cared for jack melton meant nothing to her just a conquest if michael had shown any fondness for her would she have protected him instead and thrown jack to the wolves did you really sleep with jack melton just because marjorie had i just let him think i would hes a very attractive man and he likes women i thought imagine that serenas husband a philanderer and i knew it would make marjorie wretched when he turned to someone else why not me besides theres the house in london serena is being an idiot about it she wants it to punish marjorie i want it because it was marjories i thought if it appeared i was going to lose it i could convince jack to put in a good word for me with michael up for murder jack owes me a favor it was amazing to see her vacillate but at the moment she needed jack melton for reasons of her own for how long if he didnt persuade his wife to let the house go to serena were you ever in love with michael hart i asked her i dont know she said truthfully whether i wanted him to spite marjorie or because i loved him over the years the two feelings got so entangled i couldnt sort them out any longer i was always afraid that when he looked at me he remembered marjorie and in the end i didnt want that she moved slightly im tired of standing in the doorway and im not about to invite you in why dont you leave i thought perhaps id touched a nerve that in spite of her denials she had cared too much and then as if shed read my thoughts victoria said in a tight voice i couldnt marry him even if michael loved me a dozen times over i cant marry anyone my father saw to that in his will so michael might as well hang and be done with it marjorie would hate that just as much the sad thing is she isnt here to see it but if theres an afterlife shell find out she looked toward the church i dont see the torch mr hart hasnt come sneaking back up here has he i will deny everything you know if you try to use me to free michael ill tell the world that you were so besotted with him that you were willing to perjure yourself to save him so dont bother to try i could make a very good case for you as the murderer i countered in fact i already have to michaels barrister she stared at me then said contemptuously im sure you could try but who would believe you helen calder cant remember who stabbed her i called on her in hospital to see she held out her hands do these look like they could drive a knife into someones chest look at them she drew her hands back clenching them into fists we were standing full in the light pouring out of the open door i thought i was safe as long as that was so mr hart could pick out two figureseven mrs hart at her window must be able to tell there were two of us although we were blurred a little by the mist i turned looking for mr hart by the church but then i saw a light bobbing toward the harts house up the walk to the door then shutting off victoria had seen it as well i felt suddenly vulnerable she laughed he got tired of waiting for you mr hart i dont blame him im here alone in the house i could kill you quite easily now and there would be no one to see she was trying to frighten me i laughed with her you could try i said youd find i was your match i turned to go but she pulled a revolver from her pocket dont be so certain of that i stared at it its from jacks collection he gave it to me because i was traveling back from london on the train at all hours and a girl had been raped and murdered two villages north of here by a soldier who got off at her station and followed her home she held it in her hand like a gift admiring it if you want the truth i think jack used it on someone and then wanted to be rid of it he never said but i expect i know who it was an officer whose sister jack had seduced hed told jack that as soon as he recovered from his wounds he was going to hunt him down and kill him she looked up at me but thats jack you never know when hes telling the truth and when hes having you on youve already shot at michael havent you i asked trying to distract her i think jack was hoping id kill michael but im no fool i let the police deal with him instead still i thought perhaps she had shot at him and was reluctant to say so even here with no one listening i turned and walked away my skin crawled as i did knowing that she had the revolver and not knowing what kind of shot she might be i was halfway down the walk when she went inside and slammed the door i reached the street and turned toward the church and beyond it the hart house hoping that i didnt break an ankle on my way back the mist was still heavy and i felt enclosed in it smothered i couldnt understand why mr hart had deserted me it was so unlike him and i felt very much alone and then someone put a hand on my shoulder and i thought my heart would stop chapter twentytwo i didnt scream bottling it up in my throat instead i drew back my foot and came down hard on the instep of whoever was behind me simon brandon swore damn it bess i whirled but he shushed me at once just keep walking he moved closer and took my arm watch where you go he went on when we were out of earshot of the house i was there at the corner of the garden where she couldnt see me hart had warned me to stay out of sight i heard most of it you couldnt have i didnt see your motorcar i left the motorcar at your friends house alicia i thought you were there when she told me she hadnt seen you i went to the hart house mrs hart sent me here and i found hart just by the church i thought it best to send him home did you see michael i asked remembering why he was here why he was late is he all right please tell me hell let us help him i could deal with anything once i knew michael was willing to work with us he wouldnt see me simon was curt clearly still angry about what had happened at the prison short of a full cavalry charge there was no way to reach him did you leave a message for him anything that would make him see the light i told him he was a damned fool to hang for another mans murder whether the guards will carry that to him or not i cant be sure the only person who could get in to see him now would be his lawyer i saw mr forbes i dont think he was impressed by what i had to say i turned my ankle and nearly pitched forward but simon steadied me he told me to bring the police mrs calders attacker and then theyd consider listening to me i was still bitter about that we had reached the hart house i must go and thank them and tell them about victoria no they live here its not wise they know part of the story already i protested listen to me bess in less than a week they could very well lose michael dont make it any harder for them to face that they sent me to victoria she knows mr hart walked with me to her house he let me have my way they were expecting us and opened the door almost at once i thanked them for all theyd done to help as for victoria i began and saw hope shining in their eyes even though anything id learned was not evidence as for victoria i went on shes so twisted by hate that she cant see herself clearly or anyone else for that matter but i dont believe she killed marjorie what about melton serenas husband mr hart asked is there any hope there i think it would be best if inspector herbert spoke to him im going to london now to try ill stay in touch their faces had fallen into the sadness id seen when i arrived they thanked me mrs hart gave me a kiss on the cheek and they both wished me godspeed but i could see all too well that i had intruded on the careful shell theyd built around themselves this last week and for a little time had made them feel anything was possible and now they must build it up again and mend the cracks id caused to carry them through what was to come simon and i wished them a good night their door shut behind us with what sounded like finality and we walked on through the heavy mist toward his motorcar didnt you think to bring a heavier coat he asked as i shivered no it was warm enough when i left london this one will do exasperated he opened the boot and brought out a rug handing it to me i got in and hugged it to me waiting for the shivers to subside but they were the aftermath of my encounter with victoria not the nights chill he started the motorcar and said to me where do you want to go bess home i said but i dont have that luxury scotland yard without answering he pulled away from alicias house and turned the bonnet toward the northeast i sat huddled in my seat thinking about jack melton as the miles slipped by it was late when we reached london simon threaded his way through what was left of the evenings traffic and found a space to leave the motorcar a few steps from the entrance to the yard coming around to open my door he said do you want me to stay here or come with you i spoke to him before let me try again the constable on duty told me that he thought inspector herbert had gone home could you send someone to see please its quite urgent but i was told that inspector herberts door was closed and his light off is there anywhere i could sit to write a message something that can be given to him as soon as he comes back here in the morning they showed me to an anteroom and brought me pen and paper i sat in the timescarred chair and tried to think what to say how best to say it finally i wrote a few lines signed my name and folded the message it read simply i know now how jack melton discovered that michael hart was in london to visit mrs calder he was at the theater with several american visitors and he saw victoria garrison in the audience they talked victoria was angry that michael hadnt returned she told lies concerning his whereabouts afterward jack melton made his excuses to his guests and left the theater victoria continued to sit there doing nothing to stop him i believe he saw this as an opportunity to throw suspicion on lieutenant hart just as hed done before that means he could have attacked mrs calder mr forbes told me that if i could bring you evidence that showed someone else had stabbed her you would consider reopening michael harts case well ive done that its up to the yard to fill in the details one more thing i think youll discover that jack melton seduced lieutenant fordhams sister and fordham swore hed kill jack melton when hed recovered from his wounds victoria garrison has in her possession acaliber revolver jack melton gave it to her id see if melton had used it to murder lieutenant fordham i wouldnt be surprised if she shot at michael as well if you solve the fordham case you owe it to me to pursue michael harts innocence it would be a tragedy to discover after his hanging that you were wrong i found a bullet in the hart gardens if you look youll find its mate there as well i handed my message to the constable and asked him to see to it that inspector herbert received it as soon as he came in the next morning id marked it urgent all that i could do simon waiting by the motorcar for me said that was quick were you shown the door his office was dark hes gone home i left a message he held the door for me then got behind the wheel bess there are circles under your eyes youve had no rest since you got home youve done everything thats humanly possible more in fact than anyone ever dreamed could be done michael doesnt want to be savedfor the wrong reasons i must admit or perhaps he is guilty after all and its hard to accept who knows i fidgeted with the fringe of the rug if i could talk to jack melton id know whether or not he was guilty i dont think victoria is shes just vicious cruel wanting to hurt because shes hurt if shed killed her sister i think shed have met me at the door with a knife in her pocket not that revolver it was probably to protect herself not to shoot me she knew who was at her door shed had time to plan what to do simon chuckled in the darkness of the motorcar a deep chuckle in his chest that reminded me of michael whats funny i demanded angrily nothing you rationalizing why you werent killed tonight well i retorted if youd thought i was in any danger you wouldnt have let me walk down that path with my back to the woman his mouth tightened into a hard line you should go back to somerset tonight he said finally its safer i have a bad feeling about this business i know but i cant abandon michael in spite of all youve done you cant be certain hes innocent your theories are no better and no worse than the one that put him in jail i know but by the same token i cant be certain hes guilty i dont want his death on my conscience there must be something else i can do ill think of something im sure i will and i want to be here in london where i can act on it it takes hours to drive in from somerset besides inspector herbert knows where to find me hes not going to listen bess hes already got his man there are too many hurdles to leap now he wont risk his career on what michael harts friends have to say then tomorrow we go back to michaels defense counsel i have a witness now hell have to listen and if he wont well go to the newspapers they wont risk lawsuits to print your accusations i was tired my mind wasnt working as it should but a nights sleep would make a difference i said stubbornly i wont go to somerset tonight if i have to tomorrow ill go to serena and tell her what i know or to jack melton himself i tell you it isnt safe mrs hennessey is there ill be all right he stopped arguing with me then all right he drove on turning toward the flat his face in the shadows i knew he was very angry with me i knew hed seen me take a risk i shouldnt have speaking to victoria alone but i couldnt go home simon he said nothing driving in silence and i subsided into my seat the problem was michael had confessed and because of that all doors were closed simon was right battering at them was a useless exercise i collected myself swallowed my frustration and the feeling of helplessness that made me so angry we were halfway to the flat now simon give me one more day please and then ill go to somerset i promise you i was drawn into this business because i nursed meriwether evanson i wish now hed carried a photograph of gladys cooper like thousands of other men in france none of this is your fault bess you must understand that it would have happened even if you had never recognized marjorie evanson that night at waterloo station and that was true her fate had been decided months ago when she embarked on a love affair i took a deep breath one more day please all right against my better judgment one more day ahead was the house there were no lights showing mrs hennessey had gone to bed and mary wasnt in i could pace the floor or sleep it wouldnt matter thank you simon he walked me to the door and saw me inside waiting until i had climbed the stairs and unlocked my door i went to the window and drew back the curtains then turned on my light he lifted his hat to me and got back into the motorcar for once i wished mrs hennessey wasnt the dragon at the gate that simon could have come upstairs with me and had a cup of tea before leaving id have known then that he was over his anger sighing i locked the outer door and made a cup of tea for myself i sat there sipping it my mind finally slowing down enough to sleep and then finally i went to bed chapter twentythree i dont remember turning out the light but i must have done for i woke up some hours later to find my room dark with only the star glow from the windows telling me it was still hours until dawn i drifted off again dreaming that i was a witness to michaels execution standing there like stone as he climbed the steps to the gallows and his sentence was read to him by the warden then the executioner slipped a black bag over his head i was thinking that the last thing hed seen was a bare prison yard and my face overhead the sky was cloudy not even the sun shining for him one last time and i wanted to cry but couldnt there was a priest just behind michaels shoulder and as he turned to say something to the warden i recognized jack meltons face it was he who stepped forward to throw the lever not the executioner and i made myself wake up before the trap fell and michael died i lay there breathing hard from the effort trying to shake the last remnants of the dream and then i heard something that brought me wide awake in seconds someone was trying to open the flat door everyone here had a key unless we were to be away for some time in which case we often left it with mrs hennessey elayne and diana werent due for leave for a while and mary was staying with friends pat had been in egypt these past six months or more the flat below us was empty as well its occupants in poona india just now i got up very quietly and stood at the bedroom door listening it hadnt been my imagination there it was a second time the scratch of something hard against the plate it was very dark at the top of the stairs and finding the keyhole wasnt always easy my flatmates and i could locate it blindfolded from long experience someone was trying to get into the flat my throat was dry now i ran through a swift inventory of possible weapons there was the knife we used to cut bread and make sandwiches but i didnt think the blade was stout enough to drive into someone and i had no intention of getting that close diana had a golf club in her room she was trying to learn to play and sometimes amused herself by putting into a glass wedged between the door and her trunk i wasnt sure i could reach it before whoever it was got the door open i didnt want to be caught emptyhanded my tennis racket wouldnt do much damage think for a fleeting moment i hoped it was simon come back to look in on me to be sure i was all right but he wouldnt have come upstairs not without mrs hennessey in tow and he would have knocked the lock was old and it didnt take long to force it open whoever it was stood there on the threshold for a moment letting his or her eyes adjust to the small amount of light there was in the flat i couldnt tell if it was a man or a woman i stood still not breathing and heard the rustle of clothes and a first tentative step inside there were five tiny bedrooms which way would he turn he made a move toward dianas roomnearest the doorand i caught the flash of light from the window on something in his hand a knife i was barefoot and it occurred to me that i could reach the flat door quietly and lock the intruder inside if i was fast enough before he realized what was about to happen my fingers searched for my key which was lying on the bedside tableand they knocked it to the floor the clank was so loud it could have awakened the entire street but i knew it had shocked him as well taking advantage of that i caught up my hairbrush and ran on silent feet reaching with the other hand for one of the chairs in the sitting room sending it spinning across the floor toward dianas bedroom as i went it too seemed to make a tremendous racket and i heard someone swear as he tripped over it i had reached the open door i was out of it in a flash slamming it shut behind me and flinging the hairbrush over the banister to skitter its way down the stairs for all the world like flying feet but before i could turn the key and then conceal myself in the shadowy alcove on the opposite side of our door it was flung open in the same instant a hand came over my mouth and an arm encircled my waist lifting me off my feet shoving me into the alcove frantic i began to kick but just as suddenly i was released and as i regained my balance whirling to defend myself i realized with astonishment that i was alone and someone was clattering down the stairs no two people my intruder was trying to escape but who was at his heels i rushed to the top of the stairs and leaned over the banister to peer into the dark well below and then in the faint light from the windows by the street door i saw the second figure make a flying leap to close the distance between them and take the other figure in a headlong fall down to the entrance hall there were flailing fists and feet grunts and a curse broken off in midsentence i went down the stairs after them and reached the bottom just as the two men crashed into mrs hennesseys door then rebounded into the far wall hes got a knife i exclaimed and then saw that it was in the hand pinned high against the wall a long wicked blade that wavered then flew from open fingers as the intruder cried out he was spun around as the knife slid across the floor and the two struggling men went thudding into the outer door i could just see the knife and i dashed forward to pick it up then moved out of the way just as i did the sound of a fist hitting hard and landing squarely sent one of the combatants staggering back to collapse at the foot of the stairs almost colliding with my bare feet the fight had been all the more deadly for being so silent and not knowing who had won i slid along the wall groping for the entry light switch simon brandon turned swiftly toward me blinking in the brightness of the light i reached out to touch him needing to be sure he was all rightthere was blood on his cheekbone just under his right eye he said you should have stayed in your room i wouldnt have let him reach you he put a hand on my shouldera comradely gesture id seen many times among soldiersand then his fingers gripped hard before releasing me he gave his attention to the man who had fallen on his face by the stairs after a moment he turned him over with one foot wary of a trick and i knew as i saw his profile that it was jack melton i looked at the vicious knife in my hand and shivered he came to kill me simon his voice brusque said he had to you asked too many questions you might have overturned mrs hennessey was opening her door her hair in a long gray plait down her back and a castiron frying pan in one hand shouting ill have the police on the lot of you for breaking into my house and then her voice quavered to a stop she saw me standing there barefoot and in my nightgown that wicked knife still gripped tightly in my hand and then her gaze moved on to simon breathing hard by the door and examining bruised knuckles i couldnt think when id seen him so angry she stopped at the sight of jack melton still slumped where hed fallen showing no signs of regaining his senses its all right mrs hennessey i said quickly trying to reassure her that man by the stairs broke into my flat simon stopped him before he could do any harm men arent allowed upstairs she said primly and i felt a rising bubble of nervous laughterthe reaction to what had just happenedand i quickly suppressed it im so sorry mrs hennessey i began i didnt want him there i assure you hes killed at least one person and injured another rather badly if youll hand me a coat or something ill see if i can find a constable youll do no such thing she told me go upstairs at once and dress you cant be seen down here like that ill find the constable at a look from simon i did as i was told it didnt bother me going up those dark stairs to dress knowing that simon was there by the outer door and jack melton was beyond harming anyone for the moment but i wondered how i was going to feel later when the dark at the top of the stairs once friendly and safe loomed ahead of me and i couldnt see what was in the shadows i dressed in record time still buttoning my sleeves as i hurried down the steps again simon had found some rope somewhere probably from mrs hennesseys flat and had tied jack meltons wrists he was busy now with the mans ankles and none too gently i said to simon after a glance at jack melton what were you doing upstairs you know its not permitted i told you i didnt like the idea of your staying in london i left the motorcar round the corner and came back mrs hennessey was nowhere to be seen so i waited in that dark corner you yourself were going to use but we wont tell her that if you please i was down here in the entry jack melton was just beginning to stir shaking his head to clear it then coming to the conclusion that his hands were bound he tried to stand up saw his ankles were tied as well and slumped back against the stairs raising his head he glared at me i was reminded then of his brother any charm erased by cold anger you were in my way at every turn he said through clenched teeth i thought his jaw must achei hoped it did simon had hit him very hard the outer door opened and mrs hennessey was back with constable vernon a burly man with a square face and large hands id seen him often on the street and hed nodded in passing he came into the hall now and looked to simon for an explanation simon introduced himself pointed to me and said this man tried to kill the young woman you see there the knife he was carrying is there on the table mrs hennessey can swear that sister crawford is one of her lodgers and im here in place of her father colonel crawford who is presently in somerset thats true mrs hennessey said nodding i know her family if youll go upstairs to my flat youll see how he broke in i was lucky to escape i shivered in spite of myself inspector herbert at scotland yard knows this man i ended pointing to jack melton hell confirm everything weve said the constable nodded you can be sure well notify him no one had said anything about michael hart but i was beginning to think we could at least hope i felt almost giddy with relief after inspecting both locks the constable took jack melton into custody and the rest of us accompanied him to the nearest station where i told a sergeant my story supported by mrs hennessey and simon i realized that mrs hennessey was the one they listened to most intently their impartial witness little did they know jack melton said nothing his head down his shoulders stiff with suppressed anger refusing to give his name simon quietly supplied it trying to keep me in the background then he added i suggest you send for inspector herbert at scotland yard he may have an interest in this man that will take some time the sergeant on night duty said looking from jack melton back to simon he was a middleaged man face lined and hair graying it doesnt matter simon answered him just see to mr melton and well be happy to wait the sergeant turned to me were you harmed miss you say he came into your flat did he hurt you the flat was dark i didnt even know who was therea man a womanbut i saw the flash of what i thought was a knife and so i ran slamming the door while he was in one of the other bedrooms looking for me he followed me but i was hidden and i threw my hairbrush down the stairs so hed think id gone that way why did you believe youd seen a knife i was afraid i was alone in the flat mrs hennessey was on the ground floor asleep and i happened to know helen calder who had nearly died from stab wounds after she was attacked i didnt want to be a victim too he considered me for a moment then he summoned a constable and gave him quiet instructions the man left and we sat there on the hard wooden benches waiting there was a largefaced clock high on the wall i watched the hands creep through the minutes and then an hour simon got up and paced mrs hennessey nodded where she was her head sinking to her chest her breathing heavy i tried to keep myself from yawning partly from reaction and partly from sheer fatigue another hour passed and i realized as i gazed across the room to where jack melton sat on one of the benches along the far wall that his anger had faded and he was busy thinking a harshness in his face that made me look away he must have followed michael harts case he must have known who inspector herbert was he must have realized that he was in an almost untenable position but he was a very intelligent man and he was slowly coming to the conclusion that he would be able to talk his way out of this the question was what would he say and i thought i knew he would claim that i had invited him to the flatlured him therein some foolish desperate attempt to clear michaels name everyone knew how hard id fought for michael and he could swear simon was a part of the plot his head came up and his eyes met mine i looked away unable to hold his gaze i saw the slight smile as if hed already won we were into the third hour now and suddenly the outer doors opened and inspector herbert walked in followed by two other men he nodded to the desk sergeant glanced at jack melton then turned to me miss crawford he said i realized that he looked very tired there were circles under his eyes and lines about his mouth that hadnt been there before i got to my feet inspector turning to the sergeant he said is there a room where i could speak to miss crawford in private just there sir second door inspector knoless office inspector herbert nodded then waited for me to join him simon who had been sitting next to mrs hennessey moved to follow us but inspector herbert shook his head after the briefest hesitation simon sat down again but i could tell he didnt like it i followed inspector herbert to the door of the office and he held it for me then shut it behind me youve been busy he said and stubborn i had to be sure you were hanging the right man his smile was a grimace why are you here with jack melton it appears that he and sergeantmajor brandon have bruises on their faces and hands tell me why i explained what had happened i sent for you i ended because you knew what it was i feared and why otherwise what happened tonight seems inexplicable but jack melton was in my flat and he was armed and i was there alone i could have been badly hurt like helen calder or killed like marjorie evanson tell me why this man was in my flat i cant think of any reason except the fact that i knew too much about what hed done i didnt invite him theremrs hennessey can tell you i was in my nightgown when she came out of her flat to find simon brandon trying to stop jack melton from escaping he had listened patiently his eyes on my face i was out concluding a case when you came to scotland yard tonight i returned to find your message i went to little sefton to have a look at that revolver while i could when did you see miss garrison i explained about my visit yesterdaywas it yesterdayand speaking to the harts before going to see victoria i touched on her threat and you tell me she was alive and well when you left her yes of course sergeantmajor brandon can confirm that and the harts indirectly i felt the first surge of unease why when i arrived in little sefton i found the local constable a man named tilmer in miss garrisons house the sound of a shot had been reported to him and he was investigating it when he discovered her lying on the floor of her sitting room there was a revolver by her hand and on the desk a sheet of paper and an uncapped pen it appeared she was preparing to write a note then stopped victoriamiss garrisonis dead i hadnt liked her shed been destructive and cold and willing to inflict hurt but her death shocked me but i dont understand i couldnt imagine her taking her own life there was too much hate in her people killed themselves for all sorts of reasons but not for hate a mrs whiting reported that a motorcar stopped in front of her house her dog barked and she looked out the car stayed there for half an hour then left she didnt know the motorcar she didnt know where the driver went but the shot was heard before the motorcar drove away any thoughts on that i dont believe ive met mrs whiting but i must have heard her dog bark when i was walking by in the mist there arent that many motorcars in little sefton shed know most of them do you think that miss garrison was killed by melton its possible i think he was afraid her anger would lead her to say things she shouldnt he wants michael to hang you see and the case closed but theres nothing to indicate it wasnt suicide i shook my head she wouldnt i just know hardly evidence to present in a courtroom i dont know how jack melton got to my flat there must be a motorcar somewhere he looked at me and then excused himself leaving me there in the cluttered little office and then he was back asking me again to go over what had happened in the flat i told my story a second time inspector herbert thanked me accompanied me to the reception area and then asked for mrs hennessey for a moment she looked a little confused and frightened then her back straightened and she marched ahead of him like a christian on her way to meet the lions i didnt look at or speak to simon after ten minutes mrs hennessey came back chatting comfortably with inspector herbert about her girls and he thanked her for her assistance simon was the last to be taken away and he was gone for a very long time jack melton restless and impatient his hands no longer tied took out his watch three times and then simon was back his face inscrutable finally it was jack meltons turn i watched dawn creeping in the station windows the lamps paling before the suns growing brightness the dingy paint and the wooden benches seemed shabbier than before the floorboards scuffed and worn there was no money no paint no men to wield brushes and all of us had realized slowly but surely that the cost of war was reflected in many small ways no one had ever imagined in the autumn of when it had all begun inspector herbert returned nodded to simon and mrs hennessey and then said to me mr melton is for the moment helping us with our inquiries i see no reason for you to stay any longer you must be very tired id like to know i said choosing my words carefully whats to come of this matter whether mr melton will be releasedwhether i will be in danger again he said wearily its been a long night miss crawford but i think it is safe to say that you have little to fear from mr melton in the future youll compare that knife with the wounds mrs evanson and mrs calder suffered i think i know how to handle this inquiry do youdid he kill victoria im leaving for franceplease wont you tell me i cant discuss an ongoing investigation he said my advice to you is to go home and go to bed and leave this matter in our hands i stood there trying to find the words to ask him if this would have any bearing on michael harts case but he turned away shook hands with simon thanked mrs hennessey again and walked back to the door of the small room where hed interviewed us shutting it firmly behind him was jack still there waiting or had they taken him away out another door where we couldnt see i looked at simon but he shook his head and i followed mrs hennessey out the door toward simons motorcar we drove in silence back to the house and then mrs hennessey said i dont know when ive been so tired bess dear do you think you could make a cup of tea for all of us it would help me rest i wanted nothing more than my own bed but we went into her small flat and i made tea while simon found bread sliced and buttered it and added a small bottle of preserves to the tray mrs hennessey her face lined with weariness sat and watched us i wondered if she was afraid just now to be alone in spite of the daylight sifting through her lace curtains pretending to eat i managed to swallow a little of the bread with a bit of marmalade preserve perched on one corner and i drank my tea surprisingly it did make me feel much better mrs hennessey wanted to know why that man as she called jack melton should wish to break into her house and attempt to murder one of her nursing sisters simon said circumspectly it has to do with one of besss patients i shouldnt worry about it melton is likely to find himself in far more trouble than he expected but you were here i didnt understand how you could have been here i have quite strict rules you see simons glance met mine i followed him into the house that made perfect sense to her she nodded and addressed her food with an appetite finishing her tea then turning to simon once more asking him if he should care to rest on her settee before going back to somerset he promised her again that all would be well and i washed up tucked mrs hennessey into her bed and shut the door behind me when i had finished simon was waiting on the stairs sitting there as id seen him sit so many times in india able to sleep without lying down or losing touch with his surroundings i myself had learned to do much the same in the field catching what little rest i could when i could he looked up as i shut the door of mrs hennesseys flat i asked him what this would mean for michael harts situation he said that at the moment he could see no connection i didnt need to ask who simon meant inspector herbert did he tell you that victoria had shot herself i dont believe it for an instant oddly enough id warned her about jack and surely there is some way to see if this was the same knife that killed marjorie its out of the ordinary he had a collection of american weapons the postmortem perhaps it would be wise to see that mr forbes is told that melton is in custody and why he wasnt interested before i said because it was only your word without proof or the sanction of an arrest try again that made sense even to my tired mind ill write it now i said pushing away any thought of my pillow and ill deliver it personally no let me deliver it his clerk wont turn me away and then simon i want to go home i heard the plaintive note in my voice in spite of every effort to suppress it give me four hours then well see to the letter before leaving london he promised i looked over my shoulder if hes releasedif he can talk his way out of this nights workwill mrs hennessey be safe i have a feeling hes cleaning house shes not important to him you are thats why its best for you to leave london and let inspector herbert sort this out i went up the stairs righted the chair that id left overturned braced my door and sat down at the table that served as a writing desk two tries and a lot of thought later id finished what i felt was a fair representation of the nights events by that time it was half past nine i got myself together went lightly down the stairs so as not to rouse mrs hennessey and went to find a cab i was lucky on the third try and i gave the driver helen calders address the maid answered and i apologized for calling so early but begged to see mrs calder on urgent business after a wait of some minutes i was taken to helen calders bedroom she was awake and lying on a chaise longue with a coverlet over her knees she was dressed this time and not in her bed but her face was still wan without spirit she greeted me warmly looked again at my face and said with concern bess i dont think ive ever seen you so weary its been a long night helen is there any way you can be sure who was waiting for you when you were stabbed ive tried my dear heaven knows ive spent hours trying to remember which was sometimes the wrong way to go about it but that was neither here nor there jack melton tried to kill me last night and its possible he murdered victoria though the police at the moment arent certain whether it was suicide or murder her eyes were wide with alarm are you all right she looked me over as if expecting to find bandages bulging beneath my coat or my skirt i was lucky i got away but it could have ended very differently the police have jack melton in custody and are talking to him i hoped i was right and he was still there at the police station i dont think you have anything to fear from him but a word of warning if hes given bail turn jack melton and his wife from your door if they come here just to be safe she said are you suggesting that it was mr melton who attacked me not michael hart i dont know how to answer that yes i believe its possible whether its right or not i dont know i hope the police are looking at the possibility that the knife he had with him when he attacked me could have been used to kill marjorie and wound you but that may not match after all im just suggesting prudence frowning she said yes prudence by all means im so confused you mustnt be i rose to leave it wouldnt do for simon to find i was not there at the flat its for the police to look into these things and to make interpretations we can only trust to them to find the truth helen calder said earnestly i have given so much thought to what happened to mebecause i dont want to believe it was michael i dont wish the meltons any harm i have no reason to want them to go through what ive gone through over marjories death but the truth will be a blessing bess poor victoria im sad for her and i wish her life could have turned out differently i think in the end her father punished both his daughters for what they had done between them to ruin his marriage i think as he aged he drew into himself and wanted to believe he hadnt been wronged by his wife i said goodbye and she replied will michael die god knows and the crown she nodded and i saw that her eyes were heavy with tears as i shut the door i was back at the flat a mere fifteen minutes before simon came to fetch me i looked in on mrs hennessey made her a fresh pot of tea and set the tray across her knees before saying goodbye youre going back to france again do be safe my dear child i will pray for you mary will be here tomorrow or the next day tell her goodbye for me as well and then i was gone out the door into simons motorcar and we were on our way to mr forbess chambers simon said nothing and when we had found a place to leave the motorcar he went in with the letter in his hand i had wanted to do it myself i had wanted to see this finished but he was right he would hand the sealed envelope marked private and confidential to mr forbess clerk and the clerk would hand it to mr forbes and it would be read we drove on to somerset and were silent for most of the journey i slept a part of the way finally giving in to the need for a little respite it wasnt until we were pulling into the drive that simon said again you have done all you can and inspector herbert will not wish to have an innocent mans death on his hands we must leave this to scotland yard and mr forbes if in spite of everything michael hart goes to the gallows as scheduled it is his choice bess you must see that and respect it i touched my face with my hands as if to relieve the pressure i felt behind my eyes i will have to wont i but it seems such a waste how many soldiers have you watched die because they lost the will to live too many thats what michael hart has done whatever gallant name he attaches to his decision thank you simon for everything one final thing let the colonel take you to the train in london i think he wants to do that i nodded understanding and then for the next several days i played the daughter of the house on leave and gave neither of my parents a moments anxiety but my thoughts were in that prison with michael and i couldnt pull them back my train left the day before michaels hanging my father drove me to london and waterloo station to see me off for portsmouth this time i stood there thinking that it had all begun here that i had stood here and watched marjorie evanson in tears talking to a man who was nearly as callous and coldhearted as his brother i had been an impartial witness then i had tried to keep that personal distance but events had drawn me further and further into the vortex of a murder investigation i had got too close to people and perhaps hadnt been as objective as i could or should have been but simon was right i had tried and there had been no messages for me from inspector herbert either in london or in somerset i wanted so badly to ask him if there was any hope but i knew he wouldnt tell me i chatted brightly with my father and then watched as the train pulled into the station steam roiling in the cool night air knowing that in a matter of minutes i would be on my way to war again we had said our goodbyes in somerset but i held the colonel close for a moment and kissed his cheek ill be all right i said youd better be he told me lightly or the kaiser himself will answer for it i laughed as hed intended me to do i had just turned to face the train when there was a flurry of movement to one side of us and the crowd of people seeing off or waiting for loved ones parted a little a woman came hurrying through the gap and i didnt recognize her at first her face was streaked with tears a handkerchief in one hand and before i could catch my breath or even move serena melton was upon me she lifted her fists and beat against my coat blows that forced me back a step and i felt the presence of my father just behind me his hands reaching for my shoulders to move me behind him out of danger you selfish monster serena was crying her fists flying and heads turned to stare at us you came to my house and betrayed us callously without thought for anyone but michael hart you used us and everyone you met to save him i know all about you i know what sort of woman you are my husband has never hurt anyone in his life do you understand me my father had come between us and her blows fell on his outstretched arms its serena melton i managed to say but she wasnt finished her voice was strident thick with emotion and shed lost all sense of anything but punishing her tormentor i wondered what lies jack melton had told her and where he was you used us you cold uncaring bitch sister of mercy indeed youre a disgrace to that uniform youre wearing and i hope the germans do for you what i cant shoot you down like the animal you are and then she was gone in a whirl of skirts shoving her way through the staring throng a policeman had come up drawn by the screaming anything wrong sir he asked not seeing serena as the wall of watchers closed around her my father said quite clearly a demented woman ive never seen before just attacked my daughter without any provocation as witnesses will attest will you see us to the train constable its been a very trying moment my daughter is very upset it was true the colonel had never met serena but the words were comforting even though they were partly lies i didnt know how my father looked i knew my own face was flushed with shame and horror and one of serenas fists had caught me on one cheek it ached and i was close to tears angry tears helpless tears but i held my head high and walked with my father and the constable toward my compartment on the train i saw the constable have a word with the conductor i was settled in my seat by the window my belongings stowed safely loved and cosseted and given the moral support that made my courage possible then my father said rapidly sticks and stones bess shes distraught but it tells you something doesnt it it tells you that someone heard you and that someone is doing whatever can be done i feel such pity for her she must have known bess she must have been afraid from the start that it was her husband and so shed become a detective to find a lie not the truth murder is never kind to the victim to the survivors not even to the murderer himor herself let it go be safe and concentrate on why youre in france he was right i kissed him smiledalbeit most likely a tremulous oneand settled back into my seat and then we were pulling out of the station there was no sign of serena but i lowered my window and leaned out to watch my fathers tall broadshouldered figure out of sight no one had come into my compartment crowded as the train was my fathers parting gift to me forward i could hear male voices singing one of the interminable verses of the mademoiselle from armentieres that bawdy drinking song that the troops seemed to love even when sober i leaned back and closed my eyes seeing only emptiness and darkness ahead chapter twentyfour at dawn the next morning i could hear the guns in the distance as the ambulance that had been waiting for me and a half dozen other nurses rumbled and bounced toward our destination a field hospital behind the line of trenches i watched the sun rise and it was a fair day and i could think of nothing but michael walking out the door into the prison yard and looking up at that bright sky for the last time i had pictured it beforebut only as a dread possibility this morning it was real i turned away from the other nurses and fought back my tears if only marjorie hadnt succumbed to the seductive advances that jack melton had made if only she had listened to his brother there in the station and not seemed so desolate that raymond melton had reported to his brother that there was no hope of keeping her from telling someonemichael or her husbandwhat she had done if only i hadnt been in the station that rainy evening i wouldnt have known any of these people i would have watched this sunrise untouched by the pain of a man who would rather die than live but that was wrong it wasnt marjories fault it wasnt mine the blame must fall where it belonged and i truly believed that it would i had met a number of good people in the course of these last months and some terribly cruel ones because i believed in doing my duty and telling the police what i had seen in that railway station i had got involved and that was nothing to be ashamed of we hit a deep rut just as the sun reached above the horizon and i knew that if nothing had stopped his execution michael hart was dead quickly his neck broken his body already limp and without that force that came with life i said a swift prayer for his soul as the sun moved higher touching all the blackened and ruined countryside with a golden light as if trying to hide what war had done to it i said another for mr and mrs hart and then we were at our destination and i had to put michael and all the rest behind me there were wounded already waiting for us men in dire straits and my duty was to them but my last thought as i was handed down from the ambulance by the middleaged driver comforted me i would have done nothing differently even knowing what lay ahead we had worked for three days almost without stopping i hardly had the time to eat or drink or find a bed to fall into i was already tired but it was forgotten when i took my turn as theater sister and then as the night nurse for the recovering wounded and i counted it a blessing because there was no space in which to think or mourn or remember finally the lines of wounded dwindled to twenty and then to ten and then to five and then to an empty doorway i took off my cap to let the fresh breeze of another dawn cool my face for one brief moment before putting it on again to walk down the rows of wounded and surgical cases making certain before going off duty i had told the sisters coming on what to watch for bleeding here shock there nausea across the way and in the far corner septicemia the dread of blood poisoning i signed out walked some fifty yards to the quarters that had been pointed out as mine and found my things piled in a corner the bed as fresh as it was when it had been made up days ago sorting out my belongings i found a towel and toothbrush and a bar of precious soap and went to find where i could wash my face and hands before i slept an orderly showed me and i was just starting in that direction wondering if my feet could carry me that far and then back again when a man came running toward me calling my name he wore the insignia of the signals corps i turned and waited thinking it was a summons back to the theater and i knew i was in no condition to go im sister crawford i told him as he caught me up what is it he reached into his pocket and pulled out an envelope much creased and more than a little grubby from the touch of many hands this came through in a diplomatic pouch marked very urgent sister someone sent it up by a rider but i didnt receive it until yesterday and they told me you couldnt be disturbed he held it out to me almost reluctantly we had learned that urgent messages often brought bad news i tore it open dreading to see what was written there just a few words and they swam before my eyes until i could focus on them execution delayed indefinitely for new evidence weapon that killed victoria also very likely the weapon used to kill lieutenant fordham further investigation into evanson murder and calder wounding forbes expects no less than full pardon but it will take time thank god there is now time available rejoice and below it was my fathers name and rank and former regiment he signed himself that way only on momentous occasions to mark the importance of them i looked up and saw that the signals corporal was watching my face as i read i had even forgotten he was there crumpling the letter in my hand i flung my arms around him and whirled him in a wide circle laughing and crying at the same time here miss he expostulated face beet red caught completely off balance its good news good news i said letting him go and trying to remember the dignity of a nursing sister im sorry but i had to share it with someone he touched his cap smiling yes miss glad to be of service anytime and then he was trotting off toward wherever he belonged and i reread the letter again they had gotten it to me in record time my father my mother and simon pulling god knew how many strings to make certain it reached me as soon as possible before i had mourned a man who still lived shoving the letter into my pocket i picked up the scattered soap and towel and toothbrush and went on to wash my face i couldnt help but notice when i reached a mirror that it was smiling broadly my face and the fatigue that had been grinding me into the ground only ten minutes ago had vanished sparing a moment of pity for serena and the dark road i knew she was following now i remembered the living and the dead as i scrubbed my face meriwether evanson marjorie evanson even victoria garrison my father was right murder was never kind to the victims depriving them of a natural span of life and happiness and also to the survivors who must live with reminders of what might have been
