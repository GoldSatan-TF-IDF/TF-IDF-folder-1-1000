time he remained in a us hospital in st louis till the fighting ended his long talks with rehoboam a colored confederate soldier also at the hospital after losing a foot have made him thoughtful about parts of life in the confederate states he had always taken for granted before the war sergeant jake featherston former battery commander in the first richmond howitzers has also come home to richmond he too fought from first shot to last in the great war and never rose above sergeant not least because the war department was angry at him for exposing the shortcomings of his former co captain jeb stuart iii furious and bitter at the war department in particular and the world in general featherston wonders what to do now that he has no place in the army any more i when the great war ended jake featherston had thought the silence falling over the battlefield as strange and unnatural as machinegun fire in richmond on a sunday afternoon now sitting at the bar of a saloon in the confederate capital a few weeks later he listened to the distant rattle of a machine gun nodded to himself and took another pull at his beer wonder who theyre shooting at this time the barkeep remarked before turning away to pour a fresh whiskey for another customer hope its the niggers jake set a hand on the grip of the artillerymans pistol he wore on his belt wouldnt mind shooting a few myself by jesus they shoot back these days the bartender said featherston shrugged people had called him a lot of different things during the war but nobody had ever called him yellow the battery of the first richmond howitzers hed commanded had held longer and retreated less than any other guns in the army of northern virginia much good it did me he muttered much good it did anything hed still been fighting the damnyankees from a good position back of fredericksburg virginia when the confederate states finally threw in the sponge he went over to the freelunch counter and slapped ham and cheese and pickles on a slice of nonetoofresh bread the bartender gave him a pained look it wasnt the first time hed raided the counter nor the second either he normally didnt give two whoops in hell what other people thought but this place was right around the corner from the miserable little room hed found he wanted to be able to keep coming here reluctantly he said give me another beer too he pulled a couple of brown dollar banknotes out of his pocket and slid them across the bar beer had only been a dollar a glass when he got into town or a quarter in specie before the war even through most of the war it had only been five cents as long as he was having another glass he snagged a couple of hardboiled eggs from the freelunch spread to go with his sandwich hed eaten a lot of saloon free lunches since coming home to richmond they werent free but they were the cheapest way he knew to keep himself fed a couple of rifle shots rang out closer than the machine gun had been any luck at all thats the war department jake said sipping at the new beer lot of damn fools down there nobodyd miss amen said the fellow down the bar who was drinking whiskey like featherston he wore butternut uniform trousers with a shirt that had seen better days though his unlike jakes did boast a collar plenty of bastards in there who dont deserve anything better than a blindfold and a cigarette letting us lose the war like that waste of cigarettes you ask me but what the hell jake took another pull at his beer it left him feeling generous in tones of great concession he said all right give em a smoke then shoot em plenty of bastards in congress too the bartender put in he was plump and bald and had a white mustache so he probably hadnt been in the trenches or just behind them even so he went on in tones of real regret if they hadnt fired on the marchers in capitol square last week reckon we might have seen some proper housecleaning featherston shook his head wouldnt matter for beans i say what do you mean it wouldnt matter the whiskeydrinking veteran demanded stringing a couple dozen congressmen to lampposts wouldnt matter go a long way toward making things betterthink wouldnt jake said stubbornly could hang em all and it wouldnt matter theyd go and pick new congressmen after you did and who would they be more rich sons of bitches who never worked a day in their lives or got their hands dirty men of good family he loaded that with scorn same kind of jackasses they got in the war department if you want to hear gods truth he was not anyones notion of a classical orator with gracefill carefully balanced sentences and smooth elegant gestures he was skinny and rawboned and awkward with a sharp nose a sharper chin and a harsh voice but when he got rolling he spoke with an intensity that made anyone who heard him pay attention what do you reckon ought to happen then the barkeep asked tear it all down jake said in tones that brooked no argument tear it down and start over cant see what in gods name else to do not when the men of good familyhe sneered harder than everlet the niggers rise up and then let em into the army to run away from the damnyankees and then gave em the vote to say thankyou christ he tossed down the last of the beer and stalked out hed fired canister at retreating negro troopsand as the rot spread through the army of northern virginia at retreating white troops too it hadnt helped nothing had helped we should have licked the damnyankees fast he thought a long war let them pound on us till we broke he glared in the direction of the war department your fault not the soldiers fault yours he tripped on a brick and almost fell cursing he kicked it toward the pile of rubble from which it had come richmond was full of rubble rubble and ruins us bombing aeroplanes had paid repeated nighttime visits over the last year of the war even windows with glass in them were exceptions not the rule negro laborers with shovels cleared bricks and timbers out of the street where one faction or another that had sprung up since the war effort collapsed had built a barricade a soldier with a bayoneted tredegar kept them working theoretically richmond was under martial law in practice it was under very little law of any sort discharged veterans far outnumbered men still under government command and paid them no more heed than they had to three other negroes strode up the street toward jake they were not laborers like him they wore a motley mix of uniforms and civilian clothing also like him they were armed two carried tredegars they hadnt turned in at the armistice the third wore a holstered pistol they did not look like men who had run from the yankees they did not look like men who would run from anything their eyes swept over jake he was not a man who ran from anything either he walked through them instead of going around crazy white man one of them said as they walked on he didnt keep his voice down but he didnt say anything directly to jake either with his own business on his mind jake kept walking he passed by capitol square hed slept under the huge statue of albert sidney johnston the night he got into richmond he couldnt do that now troops in sandbagged machinegun nests protected the confederate capitol from the confederate people neatly printed no loitering signs had sprouted like mushrooms after a rain several bore handwritten addenda this means you bloodstains on the sidewalk underscored the point posters covered every wall the most common showed the stars and bars and the phrase peace order prosperity that one featherston knew came from the governments printing presses president semmes and his flunkies remained convinced that if they said everything was all right it would be all right black severed chains on red was another oftenrepeated theme the negroes red uprisings of late had been crushed but reds remained join us some of the posters shoutedan appeal from black to white not likely jake said and spat at one of those posters no more than a handful of confederate whites had joined the revolutionaries during the uprisings no more than a handful would ever join them of so much featherston was morally certain yet another poster showed george washington and the slogan we need a new revolution jake spotted only a couple of copies of that one which was put out by the freedom party till that moment jake had never heard of the freedom party he wondered if it had existed before the war ended he studied the poster slowly he nodded sure as hell do need a new revolution he said he had no great use for washington though washington had been president of the united states that made him suspect in jakes eyes but in spite of the crude illustration in spite of the cheap printing the message struck home and struck hard the freedom party sounded honest at any rate the ruling whigs were trying to heal an amputation with a sticking plaster the radical liberals as far as he was concerned played the same song in a different key as for the socialistshe spat at another red poster niggers and niggerlovers every one of them the bombthrowing maniacs wanted a revolution too but not the kind the country needed he peered more closely at the freedom party poster it didnt say where the party headquarters were or how to go about joining his lip curled goddamn amateurs he said one thing spending his whole adult life in the army had taught him the virtue of organization with a shrug he headed back toward his mean little room if the freedom party didnt know how to attract any members odds were it wasnt worth joining no matter how good its ideas they didnt matter if nobody could find out about them even the damned socialists knew that much too bad he muttered too stinking bad congressional elections were coming this fall a shame the voters couldnt send the cheaters and thieves in the capitol the right kind of message back in the roomhed had plenty of more comfortable bivouacs on campaignhe wrote for a while in a gray eagle scratchpad hed picked up the habit toward the end of the war over open sights he called the work in progress it let him set down some of his anger on paper once the words were out they didnt fester quite so much in his mind he might have killed somebody if he hadnt had a release like this when day came he went out looking for work colored laborers werent the only ones clearing rubble in richmond not by a long chalk he hauled bricks and dirt and chunks of broken stone from not long after sunrise to just before sunset the strawboss of course paid off in paper money though his own pockets jingled knowing the banknotes would be worth less tomorrow than they were today jake made a beeline for the local saloon and the freelunch counter hed drawn better rations in the army too but he was too hungry to care as before the barkeep gave him a reproachful look for making a pig of himself as before he bought a second beer to keep the fellow happy or not too unhappy he was stuffing a pickled tomato into his mouth when the fellow with whom hed talked politics the day before came in and ordered himself a shot then he made a run at the free lunch too they got to talking again featherston learned his name was hubert slattery after a while jake mentioned the freedom party posters hed seen to his surprise slattery burst out laughing oh them he said my brother took a look at those fellows but he didnt want any part of em by what horace told me theres only four or five ofem and they run the whole party out of a shoebox but theyve got posters and everything jake protested startled to find how disappointed he was not good posters mind you but posters only reason they do is that one of ems a printer the other veteran told him they meet in this little dive on seventh near canal most of the way toward the tredegar steel works you want to waste your time pal go see em for yourself maybe i will featherston said hubert slattery laughed again but that just made him more determined by god maybe i will congresswoman flora hamburger clapped her hands together in delight dr hanrahans smile was broader than a lot of those seen at the pennsylvania hospital and david hamburger intense concentration on his face brought his cane forward and then took another step on his artificial leg how does it feel flora asked her younger brother stumps not too sore he answered panting a little but its harder work than i thought it would be you havent been upright since you lost your leg dr hanrahan reminded him come on give me another step you can do it david did and nearly fell hanrahan steadied him before flora could youve got to swing the prosthesis out so the knee joint locks and takes your weight when you straighten up on it the doctor said you dont learn that the leg wont work thats why everybody with an amputation above the knee walks like a sailor who hasnt touched land in a couple of years but you are walking david flora said she dropped from english into yiddish danken gott dafahr omayn seeing her brother on his feetor on one foot of his and one of wood and metal and leatherdid a little to ease the guilt that had gnawed at her ever since he was wounded nothing would ever do more than a little after her new york city district sent her to congress shed had the chance to slide david from the trenches to a quiet post behind the lines he wouldnt have wanted her to do that but she could have shed put socialist egalitarianism above family ties and this was the result her brother shrugged awkwardly i only need one foot to operate a sewingmachine treadle i wont starve when i go home and i wont have to sponge off your congresswomans salary either he gave her a wry grin as a us representative flora made a year far more than the rest of her family put together she didnt begrudge sharing the money with her parents and brothers and sisters and she knew david knew she didnt he took a brotherly privilege in teasing her he also took a brotherly privilege in picking her brains whats the latest on the peace with the rebs she grimaced for a couple of reasons for one he hadnt called the confederates by that scornful nickname before he went into the army for another president roosevelt is still being very hard and very stubborn i can understand keeping some of the territory we won from the csa but all hes willing to restore is the stretch of tennessee south of the cumberland we took as fighting wound down and he wont give that back he wants to trade it for the little piece of kentucky the confederates still hold bully for him david exclaimed he had been a good socialist before he went off to war now a lot of the time he sounded like a hidebound democrat of the roosevelt stripe that distressed flora too she went on and hes not going to let them keep any battleships or submersibles or military aeroplanes or barrels and hes demanded that they limit their army to a hundred machine guns bully this time her brother and dr hanrahan said it together flora looked from one of them to the other in exasperation and he wont come a dime below two billion dollars in reparations all of it to be paid in specie or in steel or oil at prices thats a crushing burden to lay on the proletariat of the confederate states i hope it crushes them david said savagely knock on wood theyll never be able to lift a finger against us again instead of knocking on the door or on a window sill he used his own artificial leg which drove home the point flora had given up trying to argue with him he had his full share of the hamburger familys stubbornness instead she turned to dr hanrahan and asked how much longer will he have to stay here now that hes started to get back on his feet he should be able to leave in about a month provided he makes good progress and provided the infection in the stump doesnt decide to flare up again hanrahan said flora nodded shed seen he gave her straight answers he finished with a brisk nod well shoot for november first then after giving her brother a careful hug and an enthusiastic kiss flora left the pennsylvania hospital fall was in the air sure enough some of the leaves in the trees on the hospital grounds were beginning to turn she flagged a cab the congressional office building she told the driver yes maam he touched the shiny leather brim of his cap put the oldsmobile in gear and went out to do battle with philadelphia traffic the traffic won as it often did philadelphia had been the de facto capital of the usa since the confederates bombarded washington during the second mexican war more than thirtyfive years before starting even before then a great warren of federal buildings had gone up in the center of town getting to them was not always for the faint of heart i have a message for you said floras secretary a plump middleaged woman named bertha she waved a piece of paper congressman blackford wants you to call him back does he flora said as neutrally as she could all right ill do that thank you she went into her inner office and closed the door after her she didnt turn around to see whether bertha was smiling behind her back she hoped not but she didnt really want to know dakota a solidly socialist state had been returning hosea blackford to the house since flora was a girl he was about twice her age now a senior figure in the party even if on the soft side ideologically as far as she was concerned and he was a widower whose philadelphia apartment lay right across the hall from hers he had left no doubt he was interested in her though hed never done anything to tempt her into defending herself with a hatpin to her own surprise she found herself interested in return even if he was both a moderate and a gentile now she muttered as she picked up the telephone and waited for the operator to come on the line is he calling about party business or something else hello flora blackford said when the call went through i just wanted to know if you had seen the newspaper stories about strikes in ohio and indiana and illinois party business then im afraid i havent flora said i just got back from visiting david how is he blackford asked theyve fitted the artificial leg and he was up on it flora shook her head though blackford couldnt see that even with one leg gone he talks like a democrat she inked a pen and slid a piece of paper in front of her so she could take notes now tell me about these strikes from what ive read factory owners are trying to hold down wages by pitting workers against each other he said with soldiers starting to come home from the war they have more people wanting jobs than there are jobs to give so theyre seeing who will work for the lowest pay that sounds like capitalists flora said with a frown a moment later she brightened it also sounds like a political opportunity for us if the factory owners keep doing things like thatand they probably willtheyll radicalize the workers and theyll do a better job of it than we ever could i happen to know weve urged the strikers to stay as peaceful as they can unless the bosses turn goons loose on them or their state governments or the us government move troops against them blackford said good flora nodded blackford couldnt see that either but she didnt care something hed said touched off another thought has roosevelt made any statement about this yet one of the wire reports quotes him as calling the factory owners a pack of greedy fools the congressman from dakota said but it doesnt say hell do anything to make them stop playing games with peoples lives that sounds like him flora said he talks about a square deal for the workers but he doesnt deliver he delivered a war he delivered a victory hosea blackford corrected the country was starved for one the countrys been starved for one for more than fifty years you may not like that but you cant stick your head in the sand and pretend it isnt so i dont intend to do any such thing flora said sharply the people were starved for a victory ive seen as much even with my own brother but after a while theyll discover they have the victory and theyre still starved and still maimed and still orphaned and theyll remember teddy roosevelt delivered that too blackfords silence was thoughtful after a few seconds he said you may very well be right he did his best to hold down the excitement in his voice but she heard it if you are right that would give us a fighting chance in the elections of and maybe even in a lot of people now are afraid well be so badly swamped the democrats will have everything their own way everywhere a lot of things can happen between now and the congressional elections she said even more things can happen between now and thats true too blackford said but youve seen how many socialists are wearing long faces these days even senator debs is looking gloomy maybe they should cheer up maybe the real troubleflora took a deep breathis that weve never won a presidential election weve never had a majority in either house of congress too many people i think dont really believe we ever can ive had doubts myself blackford admitted being permanently in the minority is hard to stomach sometimes if you know what i mean oh yes flora said quietly im jewish if youll remember on the lower east side in new york city jews were a majority everywhere else in the country everywhere else in the world permanently in the minority was as polite a way to put it as shed ever heard she wondered if reminding blackford she was jewish would make him decide he wasnt interested in her after all she wondered if she wanted him to decide that in many ways her life would be simpler if he did with a large family though shed rarely known a simple life would she want it or know what to do with it if she had it the only thing blackford said was of course i remember it means i have to eat crab cakes and pork chops by myself his voice held nothing but a smile would you care to have dinner with me tonight if you like i wont eat anything that offends you im not offended if you eat things i cant flora said any more than an irishman or an italian would be offended if i ate corned beef on friday id be offended if you tried to get me to eat pork but youd never do anything like that i should hope not blackford exclaimed you still havent said whether youll have dinner with me though id like to flora said can we wait till after six though ive got a shirtwaist manufacturer coming in to see me at five and i aim to give him a piece of my mind sixthirty say would be fine shall i come to your office all right flora smiled im looking forward to it she hung up the telephone and went to work feeling better about the world than she had in some time reginald bartlett was discovering that he did not fit into the richmond of late nearly so well as he had in fighting on the roanoke valley front and in sequoyah getting captured twice and shot once shot twice too actually in the leg and the shoulder from the same machinegun burst by the yankees had left him a different man from the jaunty young fellow whod gaily gone off to war richmond was different too then it had been bursting with july exuberance and confidence now the chilly winds of october sliding into november fit the citys mood only too well defeat and autumn went together going to rain tomorrow i reckon reggie said to bill foster as the two druggists assistants walked along seventh street together he reached up with his right hand to touch his left shoulder says so right here foster nodded which set his jowls wobbling he was short and round and dark where bartlett was above average height on the skinny side and skinnier after his wound and blond he said i heard enough people say that in the trenches and they were right a lot of the time hed spent his war in kentucky and tennessee and come home without a scratch after touching his shoulder again reggie said this isnt so much of a much hed had a different opinion while the wound stayed hot and full of pus but hed been a long way from objective fellow i worked for before the war man name of milo axelrod he stopped a bullet with his face up in maryland he wasnt a bad bossbetter than this mcnally im working for now anyhow from what youve said about mcnally that wouldnt be hard foster might have gone on but a small crowd had gathered at the corner of seventh and cary he pointed i wonder whats going on there shall we find out without waiting for an answer from his friend reggie hurried over toward the crowd shrugging foster followed oh i see bartlett said a moment later its a political rally that figures with the congressional election next tuesday but what the devil is the freedom party ive never heard ofem before ive seen a couple of their posters bill foster said dont rightly know what they stand for though lets get an earful maybe itll be something good reggie scowled as his wounded leg gave a twinge which it hadnt done in a while couldnt be worse than the pap the radical liberals and the whigs are handing out thats about right foster nodded everybody whos in is making noise about how he never much cared for the war and everybody whos out is saying that if hed been in he never wouldve voted one thin dime for it and its all a pack of lies too bartlett said with deep contempt why dont they admit they were all screaming their heads off for the war when it started do they think weve forgotten and when arango ran against semmes for president two years ago he said hed do a better job of fighting the yankees than the whigs were he didnt say anything about getting out of the war not one word the freedom party spokesman didnt have a fancy platform or a fancy suit which proved he belonged to neither of the csas major parties he stood in his shirtsleeves on a box or a barrel of some kind and harangued the couple of dozen people who were listening to him traitors to their country he was shouting as reggie and bill foster came up traitors and fools thats what they are a crackpot bartlett whispered he folded his arms across his chest and got ready to listen lets hang around for a while he may be funny somebody in the crowd already thought he was funny calling by what youre saying there the whole government is nothing but traitors and fools youve got to be a fool yourself to believe that i do not the speaker said he was an overweight balding fellow of about fiftyfive whose fringe of gray hair blew wildly in the fall breeze his name was anthony dresserso said a little sign reggie needed a while to notice i do not i tell you the plain unvarnished truth and nothing else but his eyes enormous behind thick spectacles stared out at his small audience and you my friends you hug the viper to your bosom and think it is your friend congress is full of traitors the war department is full of traitors the administration reggie stopped paying much attention to him about then and the moon is full of green cheese the heckler shouted drawing a roar of laughter from the crowd dresser sputtered and fumed the thread of his speech had it ever had one now thoroughly lost reggie and foster grinned at each other enjoying his discomfiture the speech surely would have been boring this was anything but not as easy to get up on the stump as the old boy thought is it foster said with a chuckle you are all traitors to your country for not listening to the plain and simple truth dresser shouted furiously and youre a maniac and they ought to lock you up in the asylum and lose the key it wasnt the first heckler but another man dresser looked to be on the point of having a fit somebody reached up and tugged at his trousers he leaned over cupping a hand behind his ear then with a fine scornful snort he jumped down from his perch all right he said all right you show them then if you think you know so much i can tell you what you will show themyou will show them you do not have any notion of what to say or how to say it up onto the platform scrambled a lean man somewhere in his thirties in a day laborers collarless cotton shirt and a pair of uniform pants he looked around for a moment then said tonys right a blind man should be able to see it too the government is full of traitors and fools dresser had been argumentative querulous the newcomer spoke with absolute conviction so much so that before he caught himself reginald bartlett looked north toward capitol square as if to spy the traitors in the act yeah you cant prove it either any more than the other jerk could a heckler yelled you want proof ill give you proof by jesus the lean man said he didnt talk as if he had any great education but he didnt seem to feel the lack as did so many selfmade men look what happened when the red niggers rose up back at the end of they damn near overran the whole country now why is that do you reckon its on account of nobody in the whole stinking government had the least notion they were plotting behind our backs if that doesnt make everybody from the president on down a damn fool you tell me what in the hell it does do hes got something by god foster said staring at the new speaker hes got a lot of nerve anyhow reggie said thats why you ought to vote for tony dresser for congress the lean man continued on account of he can see the plain truth and you cant now the next thing youre going to say is well theyre a pack of fools up there all right with their fancy motorcars and their whores but they cant be traitors because they fought as long as they could and the yankees are pretty damn tough well this here is what ive got to say about that the lean man let loose with a rich ripe raspberry i know for a fact that people tried to warn the government the niggers were going to rise on account of i was one of those people did anybody listen hell no contempt dripped from his voice like water from a leaky roof some of those niggers were servants to rich mens sons important mens sons and the rich men in the capitol and the important men in the war department shoveled everything under the rug if that doesnt make em traitors what the devil does he has got something bill foster said in an awed voice hes got a big mouth bartlett said you throw charges like that around youd better be able to name names instead of naming names the newcomer on the stump charged ahead and after thatafter that mind you after the niggers rose upwhat did the government go and do come on you remember youre white men youre smart men what did they go and do the lean mans voice sank to a dramatic whisper they went and put rifles in those same niggers hands thats what they did he whispered no more but shouted furiously if that doesnt make em traitors what the devil does reggie remembered rehoboam the negro prisoner of war whod shared his us hospital ward after losing a foot in arkansasand after being a red rebel in mississippi things werent so straightforward as this new freedom party speaker made them out to be the older reggie got the more complicated the world looked the lean man was older than he but still saw things in harsh shades of black and white and he contrived to make his audience see them the same way you want to put tony dresser into congress to give the real people of the confederate states a voice he shouted the working men the men who get their hands dirty the men who went out and fought the war the fools and the traitors and the niggerlovers got us into oh you can throw your vote away for somebody with a diamond on his pinkywith alarming effectiveness he mimed a capitalistbut whos the fool if you do why the hell aint you runnin for congress instead of that longwinded son of a bitch somebody shouted tonys the chairman of the freedom party the lean man answered easily you promote the commander of the unit not a new recruit he took out his billfold and displayed something bartlett could not make out heres my membership card number seven from back in september where do we sign up two men asked the question at the same time one of them added you aint gonna stay a new recruit long pal not the way you talk who the hell are you anyway my names featherstonjake featherston the lean man answered sergeant confederate states artillery retired he scowled the fools in the war department retired damn near the whole army with what looked like a deliberate effort of will he made himself smile party office is a couple blocks down seventh toward the tredegar works come on by hope you do anyways damned if im not tempted to bill foster said as the little rally began to break up damned if im not that fellow featherston hes got a good way of looking at things hes got a good line thats for certain reggie bartlett said if he were selling can openers door to door there wouldnt be a closed can in richmond this time tomorrow but just because something sounds good doesnt make it so come on bill do you think a stage magician really pulls a stonewall out of your nose wish somebodyd pull one out of somewhere foster answered reggies laugh was rueful fivedollar goldpieces being in notably short supply in his pockets too he said the worlds not as simple as he makes it out to be well what if it isnt his friend returned i wish it was that simple dont reckon im the only one who does either reckon youre not bartlett agreed but most folks are the same as you and me they know the difference between what they wish and whats really out there yeah foster raised an eyebrow how come we just fought this damn war then reggie thought about that for a while but found no good answer guided by a pilot intimately familiar with the local minefields the uss dakota made a slow cautious entrance into new york harbor sailors on tugs and freighters waved their caps at the battleship steam whistles bellowed and hooted fireboats shot streams of water high into the air sam carsten stood by the port rail enjoying the show the latenovember day was bleak and gloomy and cold but that didnt bother the petty officer at all anything more clement than clouds and gloom bothered him he was so blond and pink he sunburned in less time than he needed to blink after brazil entered the war on the side of the usa and germany and their allies the dakota had gone up into the tropical atlantic after convoys bound for britain from argentina he was only now recovering from what the cruel sun had done to him off to the west on bedloe island stood the great statue of remembrance the sword of vengeance gleaming in her hand carsten turned to his bunkmate and said seeing her gives you a whole different feeling now that weve gone and won the war sure as hell does vic crosetti nodded vigorously he was as small and swarthy as carsten was tall and fair every time i seen that statue before it was like she was saying what the hell you gapin at me for get out there and kick the damn rebs in the belly now we gone and done it cant you see the smile on that bronze broads kisser remembrance looked as cold and stern and forbidding as she had since shed gone up not long after the second mexican war even so carsten said yeah he and crosetti grinned at each other victory tasted sweet carsten somebody said behind him he turned and stiffened to attention sir as you were commander grady said and sam eased out of his brace the commander of the dakotas starboard secondary armament was a pretty good fellow sam cranked shells into the forwardmost fiveinch gun under his charge grady said do you recall that matter we were discussing the day the limeys gave up the fight for a moment carsten didnt then he nodded about aeroplanes you mean sir thats right grady nodded too were you serious about what you meant about getting in on the ground floor there yes sir i sure was sir sam answered aeroplanes were the coming thing anyone with an eye in his head could see that anyone with an eye in his head could also see the navy wouldnt stay as big as it had been during the war since sam wanted to make sure he didnt end up on the beach getting involved with aeroplanes looked like a good insurance policy commander grady said all right then i have some orders cut for you if youd said no youd have stayed here there wouldnt have been any trouble about that as things are though we both catch the train for boston tomorrow morning youll see why when we get there his smile made him look years younger youre leaving the dakotal vic crosetti demanded when sam nodded crosetti clapped a hand to his forehead jesus christ whom i gonna rag on now i figure youll find somebody carsten said his voice dry crosetti gave him a dirty look that melted into a chuckle then slapped him on the back sam had a gift for getting in digs without making people angry at him only problem with this is the train ride commander grady said this spanish influenza thats going around is supposed to be pretty nasty we might be better staying aboard the dakota sir if the limeys couldnt sink us and the japs couldnt sink us and whoever was flying that damn bombing aeroplane out from argentina couldnt sink us i dont figure we need to be afraid of any germs sam said grady laughed thats the spirit all right carsten pick up your new orders get your paperwork taken care of and well go ashore tomorrow morningif you can stand an officer for company that is im a tough guy sir carsten answered i expect ill put up with it grady laughed and mimed throwing a punch at him then went on his way whats this about aeroplanes crosetti asked dont even know exactly sam said i joined the navy five years before the war started and here i am buying a pig in a poke maybe i need my head examined but maybe im smart too smart i mean besides getting away from you i hope i am anyway good luck i think youre crazy but good luck crosetti shook sams hand then walked off shaking his own head getting orders was the easy part of getting off the dakota carsten filled out endless separation forms only after the last of them was signed would the paymaster grudgingly give him greenbacks with money in his billfold and a duffel bag on his shoulder he walked down the gangplank from the dakota to the pier with commander grady even at the edge of the harbor new york boiled with life when grady flagged a cab for the ride to the new york central railroad depot three different automobiles almost ran him and sam down in the zeal for a fare the drivers hopped out and screamed abuse at one another in both english and a language that seemed entirely compounded of gutturals grady knew his way through the crowded old depot which was fortunate because sam didnt he had to step smartly to keep from being separated from the officer the only place where hed felt more crowded was the tripledecked bunkroom of the dakota everyone here was moving intent on his own business about every third man woman and child was sneezing or sniffling or coughing some of them were likely to have influenza carsten tried not to inhale that didnt work very well he and grady got a couple of seats in a secondclass car the navy saved money on train fares that way they were the only navy men there though soldiers in greengray occupied a fair number of seats the civilians ranged from drummers in cheap flashy suits to little old ladies who might still have been in russia once grady and carsten pulled into boston the officer paid for another cab ride this one over the charlestown bridge to the navy yard on the north side of the charles river seeing the battleships and cruisers and submersibles and tenders tied up there made sams heart swell with pride a few ships from the western squadron of germanys high seas fleet stood out from their american allies because of their less familiar lines and light gray paint jobs sam followed commander grady each of them with duffel bag bouncing on his back then all at once sam stopped in his tracks and stared and stared grady walked on for a couple of steps before he noticed he didnt have company any more he turned and looked back a grin on his rabbity features whats the matter carsten he asked sounding like a man trying hard not to laugh out loud sir sam said plaintively ive seen every type of ship in the us navy and i reckon damn near every type of ship in the high seas fleet too he pointed ahead in all my born days though ive never seen anything that looked like that and i hope to god i never do again what the hell is it supposed to be now grady did laugh out loud thats the remembrance carsten thats what you signed up for jesus sam said i must have been out of my goddamn mind the remembrance looked as if somebody had decided to build a battleship and then about a third of the way through the job got sick of it and decided to flatten out most of the deck to hurry things along an aeroplane sat on the deck aft of the bridge not a seaplane that would land in the water and be picked up by the ships crane but a wright twodecker fighting scouta us copy of a german albatroswith utterly ordinary landing gear and not a trace of a float anywhere sam shook his head in disbelief laughing still commander grady clapped him on the back cheer up it wont be so bad youll still mess forward and bunk aft and a fiveinch gun is a fiveinch gun he pointed to the sponson under that unbelievably long unbelievably level deck youll do your job and the flyboys will do theirs and everybody will be happy except the poor enemy bastards who bump into us yes sir sam said dubiously what the devil did she start out to be anyway and why didnt she turn out to be whatever that was they started to build her as a fast lightarmored battle cruiser to slide in close to the confederate coast blast hell out of it and then scoot before the rebs could do anything about ita monitor with legs you might say grady answered but that idea never went anywhere some bright boy got to thinking how handy it would be to take aeroplanes along wherever you needed them and theres the remembrancer i thought of that myself after the dakota got bombed off argentina carsten said but i never imaginedthis he wondered if hed get into fights because sailors on ordinary respectable vessels would call the remembrance the ugliest ship in the navy dammit she was the ugliest ship in the navy come on lets go aboard grady said she wont look anywhere near so strange from the inside even that didnt turn out to be true the hangars that held nearly three dozen fighting scouts and the supply and maintenance areas that went with them took up an ungodly amount of space leaving the bunkrooms cramped and feeling like afterthoughts as a petty officer carsten did get a bottom bunk but the middle one in the threetier metal structure was only a few inches above him he could stand it but he didnt love it the only place in which he did feel at home was the sponson the fiveinch gun was the same model hed served on the dakota and the sponson itself might have been transferred bodily from the battleship the chief gunners mate in charge of the crew a burly veteran named willie moore wore a splendid gray kaiser bill mustache he wasnt half brother to his counterpart from the dakota hiram kidde but sam couldnt have proved it by the way he acted he turned out to know kidde which surprised sam not at all if you served with the capn reckon youll do for me he rumbled when carsten mentioned the name of his former gun commander a couple of days after coming aboard thanks chief hope so sam said and punctuated that with a sneeze damn im coming down with a cold he was off his feed at supper that evening which surprised him the remembrance however ugly she was boasted a firstclass galley everything was fresh tooan advantage of sitting in port but sam didnt realize how sick he was till the next morning when he almost fell out of his bunk he stood swaying in front of it you all right asked george moerlein who slept just above him sam didnt answer he had trouble figuring out what the words meant moerlein peered at him touched his forehead and then jerked back his hand as if hed tried picking up a live coal we better get this guy to sick bay he said i think hes got the influenza sam didnt argue either he couldnt he let them lead him away arthur mcgregor took a certain somber satisfaction in listening to the wind howl around his farmhouse that was just as well the wind in manitoba was going to howl through the winter whether he took any satisfaction in it or not one thing he said to his wife in weather like this the yanks stay indoors i wish to heaven theyd stayed in their own country maude answered she was short and redheaded a contrast to his rangy inches and dark hair that was beginning to show frost as he edged into his forties her eyes went to the photograph of their son alexander that hung on the wall of the front room the photograph was all they had of him the us troops who occupied manitoba had executed him for plotting sabotage a year and a half before mcgregors eyes went there too he was still paying the americans back for what theyd done to alexander he would never be done paying them back as long as he lived if they ever found out he made bombs he wouldnt live long he couldnt drive the yanks out of canada singlehanded if they were going to try to rule his country though he could make their lives miserable julia came in from the kitchen she also looked toward alexander these days the family almost made a ritual of it mcgregor looked at his daughter in what was as close to wonderment as his solid stolid nature could produce some time while he wasnt looking julia had turned into a woman shed been eleven when the americans invaded and hardly even coltish she was fourteen now and not coltish any more she looked like her mother but taller and leaner as mcgregor himself was what are you going to do about that school order pa she asked the wind gusted louder mcgregor could have pretended not to hear her his own sigh was gusty too im going to pretend i dont know the first thing about it for as long as i can he answered hed pulled julia and her younger sister mary out of school a couple of years before the americans were using it to teach canadian children their lies about the way the world worked since then mcgregor and maude had taught reading and ciphering at home now though the occupying authorities had sent out an edict requiring all children between the ages of six and sixteen to attend school at least six months out of the year they didnt intend to miss any chances to tell their stories to people they wanted to grow up to be americans not canadians itll be all right pa julia said i really think it will you can send mary and me and we wont end up yanks truly we wont she looked toward alexanders photograph again i know you wont chick he said but i dont know that mary would be able to keep from telling the teacher what she really thinks at nine mary wore her heart on her sleeve even more than alexander had she also hated americans with a pure clear hatred that made even her fathers pale beside it letting the yanks know how she felt struck mcgregor as most unwise julia had washed the supper dishes mary was drying them after the last one clattered into the cupboard she came out to join the rest of the family she was sprouting up too like wheat after planting she would mcgregor judged make a tall woman but she still kept some of the feline grace shed had since she was very small and also some of a cats selfcontainment mcgregor hadnt needed to teach her much about conspiracy she understood it as if by instinct now he said mary if you have to do you suppose you can put up with listening to the yanks lies in school without telling them off why would i have to do that pa she answered maybe they can make me go to school but she caught herself her gray eyes so like those of her father and her dead brother widened oh you mean put up with them so i wouldnt get in troubleso we wouldnt get in trouble thats right arthur mcgregor nodded no no one needed to teach mary about conspiracy she thought it over if i have to i suppose i could she said at last but telling lies is a sin on their heads isnt it so it is mcgregor smiled to hear that but not too much hed passed his own stern presbyterian ethic down to the new generation the yanks have so many other sins on the book against them though that lying doesnt look like so much to them well it should mary said it should all count against them every bit of it and it will god counts everything she spoke with great assurance mcgregor wished he felt so sure himself he believed yes but hed lost that simple certainty if hed had any left alexanders death would have burned it out of him leaving ashes behind he said you will go to school then and be a good little parrot so we can show the americans were obeying their law his younger daughter sighed if i have to she said again good mcgregor said the more we look like were doing what they want us to the more we can do what we want to when they arent looking julia said thats good pa thats very good thats just what well do thats what well have to do maude said thats what everyone will have to do for however long it takes till were free again or till we turn into americans arthur mcgregor said bleakly he held up a workroughened hand no i dont mean us some of our neighbors will turn into americans but not us some of our neighbors have already turned into americans julia said they dont care about what they were so they dont care what they are we know better were canadians well always be canadians always mcgregor wondered if with the strongest will in the world his grandchildren and greatgrandchildren would remember they were canadians and then perhaps wondering the same thing maude spoke as if to reassure herself germany took alsace and lorraine away from france almost fifty years ago but the people there still remember theyre frenchmen canadians had heard a great deal about their allys grievances against the kaiser and his henchmen till the americans overran them after which theyd had to endure lies about germanys grievances against france now france had more reasons to grieve for the germans were biting off more of her land and mcgregor still in his bleak mood said the germans settled a lot of their own people in alsace and lorraine to help hold them down if the americans did that his wife and daughters stared at him in horror mary spoke first i wouldnt live next to americans pa i wouldnt if they came here id i dont know what id do but itd be pretty bad we wont have to worry about that till next spring at the earliest mcgregor said wont be any yanks settling down to farm in the middle of winter not here in manitoba there wont his chuckle was grim and the ones who come in the spring if any do theyre liable to turn up their toes when they find out what winters are like weve seen that the americans dont fancy our weather too bad for them julia said after the children had gone to sleep mcgregor lay awake beside his wife in the bed the two of them shared what am i going to do maude he whispered his voice barely audible through the whistling wind by myself i can hurt the americans but thats all i can do they wont leave on account of me youve made them pay maude said hed never admitted making bombs not in so many words shed never asked not in so many words she knew he knew she knew but they formally kept the secret even from each other not enough he said now nothing could ever be enough except driving them out of canada but no one man can do that no one man can maude said in a musing tone of voice he understood where she was going and shook his head one man can keep a secret maybe two can and maybe three can but only if two of them are dead that came from the pen of benjamin franklin an american but mcgregor had forgotten where hed first run across it i suppose youre right maude said it seems a pity though if alexander hadnt hung around with a pack of damnfool kids who didnt have anything better to do than run their mouths and make foolish plots hed still be alive today mcgregor said harshly maude caught her breath i see what youre saying she answered after a long pause and the strange thing is if he was still alive we wouldnt hate the yanks the way we do mcgregor said they caused themselves more harm shooting him than he ever would have given them if theyd let him go theyre fools maude said that mcgregor agreed with wholeheartedly but the american fools ruled canada today god must have loved them for hed made so very many the notion of god loving americans was so unlikely mcgregor snorted and fell asleep bemused by it when he woke up it was still dark december nights fifty miles south of winnipeg were long he groped for a match scraped it alight and lit the kerosene lamp on the nightstand he didnt want to get out from under the thick wool blankets he could see his own breath inside the bedroom he threw a shirt and overalls over his long johns and was still shivering maude got out of bed too she carried the lamp downstairs as soon as she was dressed he followed her she built up the fire in the stove and started a pot of coffee it wasnt good coffee if the americans had any good coffee they kept it for themselves but it was hot he stood by the stove too soaking in the warmth radiating from the black iron maude melted butter in a frying pan and put in three eggs mcgregor ate them along with bread and butter then he shrugged on a long heavy coat and donned mittens reluctantly he opened the door and went outside it had been cold in the bedroom as he slogged his way to the barn he wondered if he would turn into an icicle before he got there a wry chuckle made a fogbank swirl around his face for a moment till the fierce wind blew it away people said there wasnt so much work on a farm in winter in a way they were right for he didnt have to go out to the fields in spring and summer though he didnt have to work in weather like this the body heat of the livestock kept the barn warmer than the weather outside but warmer wasnt warm he fed the horse and cow and pigs and chickens and cleaned up their filth by the time he was done with that he was warmer too his eye fell on an old wagon wheel the sort of junk any barn accumulated under it hidden in a hole beneath a board beneath dirt lay dynamite and fuses and blasting caps and crimpers and other tools of the bombmakers art mcgregor nodded to them they would come out again rain some of it freezing poured down out of a bleak gray sky a barrel rumbled across the muddy kansas prairie toward colonel irving morrell the cannon projecting from its slightly projecting prow was aimed straight at him two machine guns projected from each side of the riveted steel hull two more covered the rear a pair of white truck engines powered the traveling fortress stinking steaming exhaust belched from the twin pipes the charge would have been more impressive had it been at something brisker than a walking pace it would have been much more impressive had the barrel not bogged down in a mud puddle that aspired to be a pond when it grew up the machines tracks were not very wide and it weighed almost thirtythree tons it could have bogged on ground better than that it was traveling morrell snapped his fingers in annoyance at himself for not having brought out a slate and a grease pencil with which he could have taken notes here in the field he was a lean man nearing thirty with a long face weathered features that bespoke a lot of time out in the sun and wind and closecropped sandy hair at the moment hidden under a wool cap and the hood of a rain slicker his boots made squelching noises as he slogged through the ooze toward the barrel the commander of the machine stuck his head out of the central cupola that gave him and his driver a place to perch and a better view than the machine gunners and artillerymen enjoyed the engineers who tended the two motors had no view being stuck in the bowels of the barrel sorry sir he said couldnt spot that one till too late one of the hazards of the game jenkins morrell answered you cant go forward thats as plain as the nose on my face see if you can back out yes sir lieutenant jenkins ducked down into the cupola clanging the hatch shut after himself the engines changed note as the driver put the barrel into reverse the barrel moved back a few inches then bogged down again jenkins had spunk having shifted position he tried to charge forward once more and escape the grip of the mud all he succeeded in doing was getting deeper into it morrell waved for him to stop and called you keep going that way youll need a periscope to see out just like a submersible he doubted jenkins heard him with the engines hammering away nobody inside a barrel could hear the man next to him screaming in his ear even so the engines fell silent a few seconds later the traveling fortress commander could see for himself that he wasnt going anywhere when the young lieutenant popped out through the hatch again he was grinning well sir you said you wanted to test the machine under extreme conditions id say youve got your wish id say youre right morrell answered id also say these critters need wider tracks to carry their weight better lieutenant jenkins nodded emphatically yes sir they could use stronger engines too to help us get out of this kind of trouble if we do get into it thats a point morrell also nodded we used what we had when we designed them it would have taken forever to make a new engine and work all the teething pains out of it and we had a war to fight with the new model though weve got the chance to do things right not just fast that was his job to figure out what right would be he would have a lot to say about what the next generation of barrels looked like it was a great opportunity it was also a great responsibility more than anything else barrels had broken two years of stalemated struggle in the trenches and made possible the us victory over the csa having the best machines and knowing what to do with them would be vital ifno when he thoughtthe united states and confederate states squared off again for the moment his concerns were more immediate you and your men may as well come out he told jenkins weve got a couple of miles of muck to go before we get back to fort leavenworth leave the barrel here for now sir the young officer asked its not going anywhere by itself thats for sure morrell answered with which jenkins could hardly disagree rebs arent about to steal it either well need a recovery vehicle to pull it loose but we cant bring one out now because it would bog too recovery vehicles mounted no machine guns or cannon but were equipped with stout towing chains and sometimes with bulldozer blades more hatches opened up as the engineers and machine gunners and artillerymen emerged from their steel shell even in a kansas december it was warm in there it had been hotter than hell in summertime tennessee as morrell vividly remembered it had been hot outside there too it wasnt hot here all eighteen men in the barrel crew jenkins included started shivering and complaining they hadnt brought rain gearwhat point in the belly of the machine morrell sympathized but he couldnt do anything about it come on he said you wont melt listen to him one of the machine gunners said to his pal hes got a raincoat so what the devil has he got to worry about here morrell said sharply the machine gunner looked alarmed he hadnt intended to be overheard morrell stripped off the slicker and threw it at him now youve got the raincoat feel better no sir the machine gunner let the coat fall in the mud not fair for me to have it either sir now nobody does that was a better answer than morrell had expected from him lieutenant jenkins said lets get moving so we stay as warm as we can were all asking for the spanish influenza thats true morrell said first thing we do when we get in is soak in hot water to get the mud off and to warm us up inside and if thinking about that isnt enough to start you moving ill give two dollars to any man who gets back to the fort ahead of me that set the crew of the barrel into motion sure enough morrell was the oldest man among them by three or four years they were all veterans they were all convinced they were in top shape every one of them hustled east in the direction of the fort they all thought they would have a little extra money jingling in their pockets before the day was through morrell wondered how much his big mouth was going to cost him as he picked up his own pace his right leg started to ache it lacked the chunk of flesh a confederate bullet had blown from it in the opening weeks of the war morrell had almost lost the leg when the wound festered he still limped a little but never let the limp slow him down and he got to fort leavenworth ahead of any of the barrel men as soon as he reached the perimeter of the fort he realized how worn he was ridden hard and put away wet was the phrase that came to mind hed ridden himself hard all right and he was sure as hell wet but he hadnt been put away yet he wanted to fall into the mud to save himself the trouble soaking in a steaming tub afterwards did help so even more did the admiring looks he got from his competitors as they came onto the grounds of the fort in his wake he savored those command was more than a matter of superior rank if the men saw he deserved that rank they would obey eagerly not just out of duty that evening he pored over german accounts of meetings with british and french barrels the germans had used only a few of the traveling fortresses fewer than their foes theyd won anyhow with england distracted from the continent because of the fighting in canada and with mutinies spreading through the french army after russia collapsed morrell was familiar with british barrels the csa had copied them he knew less about the machines the french had built when he looked at photographs of some of the french barrels their equivalent of the rhomboids england and the csa used he snickered their tracks were very short compared to the length of their chassis which meant they easily got stuck trying to traverse trenches another french machine though made him thoughtful the germans had only one example of that model the text said it was a prototype hastily armed and thrown into the fight in a desperate effort to stem the decay of the french army it was a little barrel hardly more than a keg morrell thought with a grin with only a twoman crew and mounted a single machine gun in a rotating turret like the ones armored cars used not enough firepower there to do you as much good as youd like morrell said into the quiet of his barracks room still the design was interesting it had room for improvement he grabbed a piece of paper and a pencil and started sketching whoever designed the first us barrels had thought of nothing past stuffing as many guns as possible inside a steel box and making sure at least one of them could shoot every which way the price of success was jamming a couple of squads worth of soldiers into that hellish steel box along with the guns if you put the twoinch cannon into that turret instead of a machine gun you got a gun firing every which way all by itself youd still want a machine gun in front if the cannon were in the turret the driver would have to go down into the lower front of the machine could he handle a machine gun and drive too not likely morrell muttered all right that meant another gunner or two down there with him you wouldnt always want to use the turret cannon though sometimes that would be like swatting a fly with an anvil morrell sketched another machine gun alongside the cannon it would rotate too of course and the gunners who tended the large gun could also serve it that cut the crew from eighteen men down to five or six youd likely need an engineer too but the machine had better have only one engine and one strong enough to move at a decent clip morrell shook his head no six or seven he said somebodys got to tell everybody else what to do a boat without a commander would be like a boatno a ship navy men would laugh at himwithout a captain he was forgetting something he stared at the paper then at the plain whitewashed plaster of the wall forcing it wouldnt work he had to try to think around it that was as hard as not thinking about a steak dinner hed had practice though soon it would come to him soon wireless telegraph he exclaimed and added an aerial to his sketch maybe that would require another crewman or maybe the engineer could handle it if it did it did hed wanted one of those gadgets in his barrel during the war just finished controlling the mechanical behemoths was too hard without them he studied the sketch he liked it better than the machines in which hed thundered to victory against the csa he wondered what the war department would think it was different and a lot of senior officers prided themselves on not having had a new thought in years he shrugged hed send it in and find out ii miss colletonthe broker in columbia sounded agitated even over the telephone wirei can do only so much if you ask the impossible of me you must not be surprised when i do not hand it to you on a silver platter anne colleton glared at the telephone she could not exert all her considerable force of personality through it but she could not leave st matthews south carolina to visit the state capital either and so she would have to forgo the impact her blond good looks had on people of the male persuasion shed manage with hardheaded common senseor if she didnt shed find a new broker shed done that before too mr whitson she said are the confederate dollar the british pound and the french franc worth more in terms of gold today january than they were yesterday or are they worth less less of course whitson admitted but even so do you expect that these currencies will be worth more in gold tomorrow or less again anne broke in less again whitson said but even so you are gutting your holdings by she interrupted if i convert my holdings in those currencies to gold and us dollars and german marks while the cs dollar and the pound and the franc are still worth something mr whitson i will have something left when the confederate states get back on their feet if i wait any longer i will have nothing ive waited too long already now sir will you do as i instruct you or would you sooner converse with my attorneys i am trying to save you from yourself miss colleton whitson said peevishly you are my broker not my pastor anne said answer the question i just gave you if you would be so kind whitson sighed very well on your head be it he hung up so did anne angrily her brother tom came into the room you look happy with the world he remarked his words held less in the way of lighthearted humor and more sardonicism than they would have before the war hed gone off as if to a lark a captain and come back a lieutenantcolonel whod been through all the horrors the roanoke front had to offer delighted anne returned she was still sorting out what to make of her brother in a way she was pleased he didnt let her do all his thinking for him as he had before in another way that worried her having him under her control had been convenient she went on my idiot broker is convinced im the maniac everything will be rosy day after tomorrow if you listen to him youre righthes an idiot tom agreed you know what i paid for a pair of shoes yesterday twentythree dollarsin paper of course i keep my gold and silver in my pocket im not an idiot it will get worse anne said if it goes on for another year peoples life savings wont be worth anything thats when we really have to start worrying ill say it is her brother nodded if the red niggers had waited to rise up till that happened half the white folks in the country would have grabbed their squirrel guns and joined in if they hadnt risen up when they did we might not be in this mess now anne said grimly and they did bad enough when they rose tom nodded the marxist negroes had killed jacob his brother and annes who was at the marshlands plantation because yankee poison gas left him an invalid theyd burned the mansion too only in the past few months had their remnants been cleared from the swamps by the congaree river hmm tom said we need an idiot to take marshlands off our hands for us maybe we ought to sell it to your broker as a matter of fact i think we need an imbecile to take marshlands off our hands anne said god only knows when anyone will be able to raise a crop of cotton on that land one fieldhand in three is liable to be a red and how could you tell till too late and the taxesi havent seen anyone talking about taking the war taxes off the books have you not likely tom snorted government needs every dime it can squeeze only good thing about that is the government has to take paper if they dont take the paper they print nobody else will either small favors anne said and her brother nodded again she went on id take just about any kind of offer for marshlands and id take paper id turn it into gold but id take paper if that doesnt prove im desperate i dont know what would a hundred years tom said more than a hundred years gone he snapped his fingers like that gone he snapped them again better than fifty years of good times for the whole country thats gone too we have to put the pieces back together anne said we have to make the country strong again or else the damnyankees will run over us again whenever they decide theyre ready even if they dont decide to run over us they can make us their little brown cousins the way weve done with the empire of mexico im damned if ill be anybodys little brown cousin tom colleton ground out he swore with studied deliberation hed never cursed in front of her before he went off to the trenches he still didnt do it in the absentminded style hed no doubt used there but when he felt the need the words came out i feel the same way anne answered anyone with an ounce of sense feels the same way but the congressional elections prove nobody knows how to take us from where we are to where we ought to be what her brother raised an eyebrow split as near down the middle between whigs and radical liberals as makes no difference and a couple of socialists elected from chihuahua and one from cuba and even one from new orleans for christs sake sounds to me like theyll have everything all straightened out by day after tomorrow or week after next at the latest anne smiled at toms pungent sarcasm but the smile had sharp corners even that mess shouldnt get things too far wrong we have to do enough of what the yankees tell us to keep the usa from attacking us while were flat whatever dribs and drabs we happen to have left after that can go to putting us back on our feet lean times yes but i think we can come through them if were smart outside of a couple of panics we havent had lean times before tom said we do need better politicians than the gang weve got we could use somebody whod really lead us out of the wilderness instead of stumbling through it for forty years of the current crop im not going to hold my breath anne said ithe telephone interrupted she picked it up hello her mouth fell open just a little in surprise commander kimball how good to hear from you i was hoping youd come through the war all right where are you now im in charleston roger kimball answered and what the hell is this commander kimball nonsense you know me better than that baby unlike her brother kimball swore whenever he felt like it and didnt care who was listening he not only had rough edges he gloried in them and he was rightshe did know him intimately enough in every sense of the word to call him by his christian name that she could though didnt mean she had to she enjoyed keeping men off balance in charleston how nice she said i hope you can get up to st matthews before long you do know my brother lieutenantcolonel colleton is staying with me here in town you do know that even if you get up to st matthews you re not going to make love with me right now kimball was brash he wasnt stupid anne couldnt abide stupidity he understood what she meant without her having to spell it out laughing a sour laugh he answered and hell whale the living turpentine out of me if i put my hands where they dont belong will he sweetheart i hate to tell you this but i havent got the jack for pleasure trips without much pleasure im on the beach same as every other submarine skipper in the whole goddamn navy where he could banter about passing on a chance to pay a social call that was only a social call his voice showed raw pain when he told her the navy had cut him loose im very sorry to hear that she said and trusted him to understand she understood what grieved him most what are you going to do now dont know yet kimball said i may try and make a go of it here or i may head down to south america plenty of navies there that could use somebody who really knows what hes doing when he looks through a periscope that was likely to be true the south american republics had chosen sides in the great war as the rest of the world had done losers would be looking for revenge winners would be looking to make sure they didnt get it anne said whatever you decide to do i wish you the very best but not enough for you to send your brother out to hunt possums or something eh kimball laughed again never mind well get another chance one of these days i reckon good luck to the lieutenantcolonel too the son of a bitch before she could answer he hung up so did she and she laughed too she admired the submariner he was she judged almost as thoroughly selfcentered as herself tom raised an eyebrow whos this commanderkimball is it thats right he captained a submarine anne answered i got to know him on the train to new orleans not long after the war started hed seduced her in his pullman berth too but she didnt mention that how well do you know him tom asked were friends she said was in bed with him down in charleston when the red negro uprising broke out she didnt mention that either she didnt have to are you more than friends her brother demanded before the war he wouldnt have dared question her that way ive never asked what you did while you werent fighting she said what i did or didnt do is none of your business tom set his jaw and looked stubborn he wouldnt have done that before the war either no she couldnt control him any more not with certainty he said if youre going to marry the guy it is if hes just after your money ill send him packing what youre doing affects me you know nor would he have had that thought in if he were just after my money dont you think would have sent him packing she asked in return i can take care of myself you know with a rifle or any other way all right tom said people who fall in love are liable to go all soft in the head though i wanted to make sure it hadnt happened to you when it does you can shovel dirt on me because ill be dead anne spoke with great conviction tom came over and kissed her on the cheek they both laughed liking each other very much at that moment in the trenches down in virginia chester martin had heard new englanders talk about a lazy wind a wind that didnt bother blowing around a man but went straight through him the wind coming off lake erie this morning while he picketed the toledo steel mill where he would sooner have been working was just that kind in spite of coat and long underwear in spite of hat and ear muffs he shivered and his teeth chattered as he trudged back and forth in front of the plant his sign was stark in its simplicity it bore but one word that in letters a foot high thieves they want to cut our wages he said to the fellow in front of him a stocky man named albert bauer we went out and got shot athell i got shotand they stayed home and got rich no they got richer they were already rich and they want to cut our wages bauer was a solid socialist he said this is what we get for reelecting that bastard roosevelt hes not so bad martin said a democrat himself he walked the picket line with his more radical coworkers he visited my stretch of the front once hell i jumped on him when the rebs started shelling us later when i got wounded he found out about it and sent me a note bully bauer said can you eat the note can you take it to the bank and turn it into money roosevelt will oblige feudal nobles do but does he care about whether you starve not likely hush chester martin said suddenly he pointed here come the scabs the factory owners always had people willing to work for them no matter how little they paid they also had the police on their side jeers and curses and all manner of abuse rained down on the heads of the workers taking the places of the men whod gone on strike so did a few rocks and bottles in spite of socialist calls for calm and in spite of the strong force of blueuniformed policemen escorting them into the steel mill well now theyve gone and done it albert bauer said in disgusted tones now theyve given the goddamn cops the goddamn excuse they need to go on and suppress us he proved a good prophet as soon as the police had hustled the scabs into the plant they turned around and yanked the nightsticks off their belts a whistle blew as if an officer during the war were ordering his men out of the trenches and over the top shouting fiercely the police charged the strikers chester martin had not been an officer but thanks to casualties in the ranks above him hed briefly commanded a company in virginia not long before the csa asked for an armistice almost all the men on the picket line had seen combat too come on he shouted we can take these fat sons of bitches lets give em some bayonet drill he tore the cardboard sheet off his picket sign the stick he was left holding wasnt as good a weapon as a billy club but it wasnt to be despised either all around him his companions imitated his action here came the cops a solid phalanx of them even so they were outnumbered they relied on discipline and on being able to create fear to get their way after gas and machine guns and artillery and confederate barrels martin found absurd the idea that he should be afraid of conscriptiondodgers with clubs he heard laughter from the men to either side of him too in the instant before the redfaced policemen slammed into the picketers martin saw surprise and doubt on the features of a couple of blueuniformed goons then he was at close quarters with them and had no chance to study their expressions in any detail one of them swung a nightstick at his head as if the cop were a rebel with a clubbed rifle martin ducked things seemed to move very slowly as they had in combat in the trenches as he would have with a bayoneted rifle martin jabbed the end of his stick into the policemans beefy side a bayonet would have deflated the fellow for good as things were the cop grunted in pain and tried to twist away martin kicked him in the belly he folded up like a concertina the nightstick flying out of his hand martin wished he could have grabbed the solid club but it landed on the sidewalk well out of his reach he caught another policeman in the throat with the end of what had been the handle for his picket sign anyone whod been in the trenches would have had no trouble blocking that lunge or knocking it aside the cop let out a gargling shout and went over on his back see martin shouted they arent so goddamn toughthe rebsd eat em for breakfast and we can whip em too rally one of the policemen shouted the cops were taking longer than the strikers to figure out what was going on not until something close to half their number had fallen or had their nightsticks taken away did another cry ring out drop back and regroup yelling in triumph the men from the picket line surged after them down with the scabs they roared down with the copsthey trampled underfoot the policemen who couldnt fall back and regroup maybe one of those police officers was first to yank out his pistol and start shooting at the men who were stomping him but after one or two sharp cracks rang out it suddenly seemed as if every cop in toledo were drawing his revolver and blazing away at the striking steelworkers against gunfire the strikers had no defense some fell screaming in pain some fell silently and would not rise again a few kept trying to advance on the police in spite of everything most though chester martin among them knew how hopeless that was he was not ashamed to run bullets zipped past his head now that the police had opened fire they seemed intent on emptying their revolvers and slaying as many strikers as they could in their shoes martin probably would have done the same after the men from the picket line had come so close to overwhelming the cops altogether they wanted their own back if strikers got to thinking they could defeat the police no man in blue would be safe next time somebody not far away panted next time we bring our own guns to the dance by jesus thats right somebody else said they want a war well give em a fucking war see if we dont all martin wanted was to be able to work and to bring home a halfway decent wage he didnt think that was too much to ask the men who ran the steel millthe trust bosses with their top hats and diamond pinky rings so beloved of editorial cartoonists evidently thought otherwise a bullet slapped into the flesh of a man close by martin had heard that sound too many times on too many fields to mistake it for anything else the steelworker crumpled with a groan martin dashed around a corner after that he didnt need to worry about getting shot the people on the street werent striking they were going about their ordinary business if the cops suddenly started spraying lead through their ranks theyor their survivorscould complain to city hall with some hope of being heard it looked to be open season on picketers though martin realized he was still holding the stick hed used against the police to such good effect as casually as he could he let it fall to the pavement pulling his cap down over his eyes and wondering how it had managed to stay on his head through the melee he trudged down the street toward the nearest trolley stop several policemen pistols drawn ran past him while he stood waiting his eyes widened maybe hed been wrong about how much mayhem the cops were willing to dish out to the general public since he didnt do anything but stand there they left him alone if hed tried to flee he didnt care to think what might have happened then when the trolley came clanging up to the stop he threw a nickel in the fare box and took a seat even though it was heading away from his parents flat where he was staying he rode for more than a mile till hed put the steel mill well behind him when he did get off he was only a block or so away from the county courthouse across the street from the building stood a statue of remembrance a smaller replica of the great one in new york harbor remembrance had finally brought the united states victory over the csa what sort of statue would have to go up before anyone recognized that the working man deserved his due how long would it take before he did those were questions that made martin look at remembrance in a new way his left arm bore a large ugly scar a reminder of what hed suffered for his countrys sake what was his country willing to do for him shoot me again thats what he muttered is that what i fought for teddy roosevelt made noises about caring over what happened to the ordinary working man martins brief meeting with the president in the trenches had made him think roosevelt was sincere he wondered what roosevelt would say about what had happened in toledo that would tell whether he meant what he said martin wondered if writing him a letter would do any good he doubted it he knew what happened when a private wrote a general a letter either nothing or somebody landed on the private like a ton of bricks roosevelt would do what he would do and chester martins view of the matter wouldnt count for beans thats not right he said thats not fair but it was he knew too well the way the world worked after a while he took a streetcar back to his parents apartment building in ottawa hills his younger sister sue was at work shed landed a typists job after he recovered from his wound and went back to the front his father was at work too that graveled him some stephen douglas martin had been a steelworker longer than chester had been alive he labored down the street from the plant his son was striking he had a good job and a good days pay chester wondered if he himself would have to wait till he was gray and wrinkled to say the same he wondered if hed ever be able to say the same his mother louisa who looked like an older version of sue exclaimed in surprise when he came through the door i thought youd be out there all day she said she didnt approve of his striking but he was her son and she stayed polite about it at the moment he knew a certain amount of relief hed made it here ahead of the news of trouble it got a little lively when the scabs came in he said which was technically true but would do for an understatement till a better one came along were the cops busting heads his mother asked he nodded she shook her own head in maternal concern thats why i dont want you out there picketing chester you could get hurt he started to laugh he couldnt help it it wasnt that she was wrong it was much more that she had no idea how right she was if i came through the war im not going to let toledo goons worry me he answered you need to worry you could step in front of a streetcar tomorrow his mother said he nodded she said that a lot if he was going to worry trolley cars wouldnt go high on the list two other questions topped it one was had anyone recognized him while he nerved the strikers to resist the police the second followed hard upon the first would any of those people let the police know who he was jefferson pinkard kept a wary eye on the crucible as it swung into position to pour its molten contents onto the sloss works foundry floor the kid handling the crucible had some notion of what he was doing but only some herb wallace the best crucible man jeff had ever known had gone off to fight the damnyankees conscription nabbed him earlybut he hadnt come home to birmingham his bones lay somewhere up in kentucky this time the pouring went smoothly only a tiny fingerlike rivulet of molten steel broke through the earth and sand walling the mold and pinkard and his partner had no trouble stemming it with more earth leaning on his rake afterwards jeff said wish they were all that easy his partner nodded yes suh mistuh pinkard vespasian agreed the big bulky negroas big and bulky as pinkard himselftook off his cloth cap and wiped sweat from his forehead winter might rule outside but it was always summertime in hell on the foundry floor vespasian pointed toward the crucible operator hope to jesus billy up there figure out his job before he kill somebody aint happened yet but he come too damn close a couple times yeahone of em was me last month pinkard jumped sideways to show how hed escaped the misplaced stream of metal you was right lively thats a fact vespasian said damn well had to be pinkard shored up the edge of the mold at another place where it looked as if it might give way the floor did run smoother before the war and thats a fact too vespasian didnt answer he hadnt been on the foundry floor before the war back then negroes had fed the furnaces and done other jobs that took strong backs and no brains but the better positions had been in white hands jeffs partner then had been his nextdoor neighbor and best friend bedford cunningham but the war had sucked white men into the confederate army the csa had still needed steelmore steel than everto fight the damnyankees negroes started filling nightshift jobs once solely the property of white men then eveningshift and then at last dayshift too back then before he got conscripted himself jeff hadnt wanted to work alongside a black man hed done it though for the sake of his country bedford cunningham had come back to birmingham without an arm a lot of other steel men had come back as invalids a lot more like herb wallace hadnt come back at all and so even now with the war over for half a year negroes remained in some of the places they had taken during the war theyd gained experience pinkard couldnt argue against experience not when hed just been griping about billy and vespasian who was in his forties didnt get uppity the way a lot of younger blacks did as far as the work went he made a good enough partner jeff still felt uncomfortable working beside him he didnt quit hed have felt a lot more uncomfortable unemployed steel was all he knew if he got a job at another foundry he had no guarantee he wouldnt be working with another negro and one harder to get along with than vespasian he didnt care to move out of s loss company housing either though he wished he didnt live next door to bedford any more he endured he never once wondered what vespasian thought of working next to him at shiftchanging time the steam whistle blew a blast that cut through the rest of the din on the floor like a hot knife through pork fat see you in the mornin mistuh pinkard vespasian said yeah jeff answered see you they clocked out separately and left the enormous foundry building separately too it wasnt the way it had been when pinkard and bedford had sometimes gone home to their sidebyside yellow cottages with their arms draped over each others shoulders vespasian didnt have a yellow cottage his cabin was painted primer red which was cheaper some of the white men going home waved to pinkard as did a couple coming onto the evening shift he waved back he was always glad to see familiar faces he didnt see that many shift changes reminded him how little remained the same as it had been in being reminded hurt his breath smoked as he hurried home theyd had snow the week before which wasnt common in birmingham on top of everything else it had been a hard winter the grass was yellowbrown and dead somebody sneezed not far from jeff he hoped it was from a cold or from a tickling mustache hair the spanish influenza was killing men whod lived through all the bullets the damnyankees aimed at themand killing their wives and mothers and children too in spite of the cold fanny cunningham was standing in front of her house gossiping with the woman who lived on the other side of her from the pinkards she waved to jeff as he walked by he waved back calling hows bedford doing right good she answered hes been cheerful the whole day through glad to hear it pinkard said he was especially glad to hear fanny had had her husband under her eye the whole day through she said you dont come over like you used to jeff bedfordd be powerful pleased to see more of you jefferson pinkard didnt answer that he waved again almost but not quiteas if to say hed think about it then headed up the walk to his own cottage he hesitated before opening the door he had to do it though if he intended to go inside when at last he did the savory smell of stewing pork made his mouth water that you darlin emily called from the kitchen its me all right jeff said emily came out a smile on her face she had a barmaids good looks and a barmaids good buxom figure and hair of a bright shade somewhere between red and gold now that she wasnt working in a munitions plant any longer she was letting it grow out now that she was out of the plant too the jaundice working with cordite had given her was gone leaving her rosy and altogether desirable jeff took her in his arms she pulled his face down to hers her lips were greedy against his shed always been greedy for loving when jeff hadnt been there to give it to her that was when hed become a less than happy man what did you do today he asked her after they broke apart usual kinds of things she answered did my cleaning did my cooking went out and bought me some cloth to make a dress with she nodded toward the sewing machine in a corner of the front room then she stuck out a hip tilted her head a little and looked at him sidelong thought about you thought about you a lot jeff did you he said emily nodded batting her eyelashes she played the role of seductress to the hilt that didnt mean jeff failed to respond to it the collarless neck of his shirt suddenly felt like a choker some evenings supper turned out to be later than he expected when he walked through the door did that was the question jeff knew he shouldnt ask did you see bedford cunningham today if he wanted to let the poison seep out of their marriage instead of putting more in he couldnt keep harping on that he changed course in midstream did we have any more beer in the icebox alabama had gone dry not long before the war what that meant pinkard had found was that you had to know somebody before you could buy beer or whiskey and that the quality of the stuff you could buy especially the whiskey had gone down hed evidently managed to ask the question without perceptible pause for emily nodded again sure do she said couple bottles shall we have em with the stew it ought to be just about ready that sounds pretty good jeff said supper for the moment was more on his mind than going back to the bedroom he found another question that wasnt dangerous or wasnt dangerous that way what did you pay for the cloth now emilys blue eyes flashed with fury not any more tender emotion dollar and a half a yard can you believe it she said i wasnt buying fancy silk taffeta jeff i know we aint rich it wasnt anything but printed cotton dress percale like i used to get before the war for eleven cents a yard wasnt as nice as what i could get then neither he sighed hed feared the answer would be something like that they havent bumped my pay in a bit he said dont know when theyll do it again his laugh held fury too here i am making more money than i ever reckoned i would in all my born days and i cant even keep my head above water that aint right em that purely aint right and hellfire the little bit wed stashed away in the bank before the warwhatll it buy us now not what we hoped it would thats certain sure his wife didnt argue instead she went into the kitchen pulled the cork from a bottle of beer and brought it out to him here she said wont make things better but itll make em look better for a spell while jeff took a long pull she got the other bottle for herself things did look a little better after some beer getting some pork stew under his belt made pinkard more charitably inclined toward the world too it even made him more charitably inclined toward emily he hadnt married her for any other reason than getting her drawers down but shed shown him some others in the years since they tied the knot while she washed the supper dishes he read yesterdays newspaper by the light of a kerosene lamp kerosene was heading through the roof too especially since the yankees werent going to let go of sequoyah from which the confederate states had drawn a great part of their oil a story caught his eye look here he said to emily when she came out of the kitchen drying her hands on a towel they had themselves a riot in richmond folks saying were selling ourselves down the river to the usa were sure as hell selling ourselves down the river to somebody dollar and a half a yard for cotton that kind of thing means we need to get ourselves set to rights but im hanged if i know how i dont want you hanged jeff sweetheart but i like the way youre hung emily said she cared nothing for politics sweeping the newspaper aside she sat down on her husbands lap his arms went around her one hand closed on her breast she sighed in his ear her breath warm and moist he knew she wanted him hed never stopped wanting her even when that hand squeezed tight emily whimpered a little but only a little later in the bedroom she whimpered in a different way and gasped and moaned and thrashed and clawed sated sinking toward sleep jeff slowly nodded she wanted him all rightno doubt of that but whom would she want when his back was turned he drifted off wondering wondering nellie semphroch woke with a start to find a man in her bed a grayhaired fellow with a bushy mustache the reason she woke and woke with a start was not hard to find for he was snoring like a sawmill as her racing heart slowed toward its normal rhythm she relaxed and let out a small sigh here shed been married since before the turn of the year and she still wasnt used to sleeping with her husband she wasnt used to thinking of herself by her new name either shed worn the one ednas father had given her for a good many yearsmost of them without him as hed died when his daughter was little and edna wasnt little any more one of the few decent things he ever did nellie muttered then softly she repeated her new name to herself over and over nellie jacobs nellie jacobs nellie jacobs she hadnt had so much trouble the first time she was married that lay a quarter of a century in the past though she was more set in her ways now nellie jacobs hal jacobs grunted and rolled over toward her his eyes opened did he look a little confused too as if wondering where he was hed been a widower for a long time as shed been a widow and had grown used to fending for himself the room in which hed lived above the cobblers shop across the street from her coffeehouse in washington dc was aridly neat then seeing her he smiled good morning my dear nellie he said leaning over to kiss her on the cheek he did that every morning they woke up together good morning hal nellie said her husband though far from young remained very much the enchanted new bridegroom nellie wasnt so young as she wished she were either for her part she remained bemused shed ever agreed to marry him his hand slid along under the covers and came to rest on the curve of her hip you have made me the happiest man in the world he declared he was sweet because he was sweet nellie had never told him how much she disliked having a man reach out and touch her like that he wasnt young he didnt seek his marital rights all that often when he did she had no trouble getting through it shed got through far worse back in her own younger days he wanted to please her she let him think he did once or twice he really had come close which surprised her shed thought that part of her dead forever not that it had ever had much life she threw off the wool blankets she wore a thick flannel nightgown and long underwear beneath it but she was still cold shed been cold for months when will this winter end she asked though that was not a question her husband could answer hal jacobs got out of bed too he also had on long johns under a nightshirt and he also looked cold it has been a hard one he agreed march and no sign of letup and it has to be making the influenza epidemic worse they both dressed rapidly nellie said i hate the influenza it makes people afraid to go out in crowds and thats bad for business with so much snow on the street they have trouble getting about anyhow hal said this will not keep me from enjoying a cup of your wonderful coffee though or i hope not mrs jacobs i think we can probably take care of something like that mr jacobs nellie said shed always liked his oldfashioned almost old world sense of courtesy now that they were married she found herself imitating it they went downstairs together edna whose room was across the hall joined them a few minutes later they all stuck close to the stove which heated the kitchen area as well as water for coffee sipping at his steaming cup hal jacobs let out a grateful sigh he looked from nellie to edna and back again my beautiful wife and her beautiful daughter he said beaming yes i am a lucky man edna glanced over to her mother you better keep him happy ma he sure does talk pretty foosh nellie said she and edna did look alike with long faces brown hair and very fair skin she didnt think she was particularly beautiful edna made a pretty young woman she smiled more than nellie did which made her look more pleasantbut then she was looking for a man nellies opinion was that the joys of having even a good one were overrated but edna paid as little attention to nellies opinions as she could get away with a customer came in and ordered a friedegg sandwich to go with his coffee he was young and moderately handsome with a brown kaiser bill mustache whose upthrust points were waxed to formidable perfection edna took care of him before nellie could that might have been funny were it happening for the first time having seen it throughout the war nellie was sick and tired of it she made eggs for herself and her husband tooafter so many years as a widow she found the idea of having a husband very strange when hal had eaten he said im going to go across the street and get some things done he chuckled cant have folks say my wife does all the work in the family now can i not when it isnt true nellie said go upstairs and get your overcoat though before you set foot outdoors jacobs nodded and headed for the stairs edna laughed there you go ma youre telling him what to do like youve been married twenty years nellie made a face at her and not a happy one jacobs laughed again going upstairs that was luck nothing else he could as easily have grown angry at the idea of being ordered about well bundled he walked across the snowy street and opened the cobblers shop he wouldnt get much business today he had to know it too the shop was part of his routine though as running the coffeehouse was part of nellies she was glad he kept his independence and let her keep hers a barrel with a bulldozer blade welded to the prow rumbled down the street pushing snow asideand up onto the sidewalk making the drifts higher and making it even harder for people to come into the coffeehouse or the cobblers shop the barrel driver cared nothing about that having been occupied by the confederates for more than two and a half years and then devastated in the us reconquest washington remained under martial law with the war months over trucks roared by in the barrels wake it was for them that the bigger heavier machine had cleared a path rubble filled their beds had rubble been gold washington would have spawned a rush to make the stampede to california seem as nothing beside it but it wasnt gold it was only rubble it had to be disposed of not sought out when nellie opened the front door to take a cup of coffee to hal she found she couldnt not without shoveling her way to the street by the time she and edna did the shoveling the coffee was cold she poured it out got a fresh one and took it across the street then she discovered she had to shovel her way into her husbands shop that meant another trip back for coffee that was hot some of the things she said about the us government were less than complimentary her husband was fixing a soldiers boot when she finally came in the only difference between and was that it was a us not a confederate boot coffee how nice how thoughtful he said his eyes twinkled and what do you hear in the coffeehouse that might interest an old shoemaker eh nellie laughed he hadnt just been a shoemaker during the war hed been part of a spy ring keeping tabs on what the confederates did in and around washington hed helped nellie get coffee and food when they were scarce and hard to come by since she had them her place had been popular among confederate officers and homegrown collaborators in turn shed passed on what she overheard to him she had an order of remembrance first class straight from the hands of theodore roosevelt because of that edna had an order of remembrance second class which was richly undeserved shed been on the point of marrying a confederate officer when he died in a us artillery barrage so far as nellie knew hal had no decorations of his own that struck her as dreadfully unfair but hed never once said a word about it where she could hear nor did he now he drank the coffee quickly savoring the warmth shed had to work so hard to get him then he remarked if you look over there youll see they are building the washington monument a little higher now she looked out the window before the war she would have been able to see only the tip of the monument over the buildings between it and the shop rebel bombardment and us counterattacks had truncated the white stone obelisk she could still see more of it now than shed seen before the war because the fighting had also leveled most of the buildings formerly in the way hal said i hear theyre starting to rebuild the white house and the capitol too theyll be pretty nellie said past that i dont know why anybody would bother theyll just get blown up again when the next war comes and i cant see the president and congress coming down from philadelphia can you to spend all their time here the way they used to do hal jacobs shook his head no not when we are still so close to virginia even though the usa will hold the land down to the rappahannock but maybe to come down for ceremonial sessions that yes that i could see i suppose you may be right nellie said after a little thought teddy roosevelt is the sort to enjoy ruffles and flourishes no doubt about that hed love to make the rebs grind their teeth too they were going on about how washington would be theirs forever reckon they didnt know everything there is to know they were wrong her husband agreed they will pay the price for being wrong but we have paid a great price because they were wrong too i hope that will never happen again oh i hope so too nellie said i hope so with all my heart but when i said people wouldnt come back to the white house and the capitol on account of theyd get blown up in the next war i didnt hear you telling me i was wrong we have fought three wars against the confederate states hal said i hope we do not fight a fourth one i pray we do not fight a fourth one a man should plan by what he has seen though not by what he hopes and prays the older i get the more certain i am this is true nellie studied him no he wasnt handsome no he didnt make her heart flutter and yet as she had seen during the war and as she saw even more strongly now he had a core of solid good sense that was altogether admirable she did admire it and him she hadnt been looking for anyone to make her heart flutter that was for people ednas age good sense thoughgood sense lasted the older nellie got herself the plainer that became she smiled at her new husband it was the most wifely smile shed ever given him it was also the smile of someone beginning to realize shed made a good bargain after all john oglethorpe came up to scipio as the negro was clearing dishes off a table a customer had just left the restaurant owner coughed scipio knew what that sort of cough meant oglethorpe was about to say something he only half wanted to say scipio could make a good guess about what it was too his guess wasnt just good it turned out to be right after clearing his throat a couple more times oglethorpe said youve done a right good job for me here xerxes i want you to know i mean that i thanks you very much suh scipio answered xerxes was the name hed used since escaping the collapsing congaree socialist republic and making his way across south carolina to augusta georgia in his proper persona he had a hefty price on his head though georgia worried more about its own black reds on the loose than about those from other states youve been just about as good a waiter as aurelius matter of fact oglethorpe went on the other negro had conveniently put himself out of sight and earshot oglethorpe coughed yet again but him and me we go back years and i aint got enough business to keep two waiters busy any more not with so much of the war work closed down i aint yous lettin me go scipio said the dialect of the congaree was slow and thick as molasses scipio could speak far better formal english than his bossyears of training to be the perfect butler at marshlands had forced him to learnbut that wouldnt help now it was likely to make things worse in fact oglethorpe nodded hate to do it like i say but ive got to keep my own head above water first you on the trail of another job waitin tables you tell whoevers thinking about hiring you to talk to me youre a brick and ill say so that right kind o you mistuh oglethorpe scipio said you been a good boss he was on the whole sincere oglethorpe expected his help to work like mules but he worked like a mule himself scipio had no complaints about that fair was fair digging in his wallet oglethorpe peeled off brown banknotes its wednesday today but im pay in you till the end of the week couple extra days of money never did anybody any harm that was more than fair thank you kindly suh scipio said he counted the money frowned and counted it again he took out a banknote and thrust it at the man who ran the restaurant even if you is payin till the end o the week you done give me twenty dollars too much keep it oglethorpe looked annoyed that hed noticed aint like it was twenty dollars before the war money was worth somethin in those days nowhell look at you you got all that money in your hand there and you aint rich what kind of world is it when you can be standin there with all that cash and you got to worry about he checked himself no you dont have to worry about where your next meal is comin from you get on back here with me scipio got his boss hacked off a couple of slices of egg bread yellow as the sun then put them around a slab of ham that would have choked a boa constrictor he added pickles and mustard gave scipio the monster sandwich and stood there with hands on hips till hed eaten it i gets me a new job i comes back here to eat scipio declared want another one oglethorpe asked reaching for the bread again scipio shook his head and belly bulging managed to make his escape only when he was out on the streets of augusta did he wish hed taken the restaurant owner up on his generosity a sandwich like that kept a mans belly from complaining for most of a day augusta had a shabby rundown look to it these days from things hed heard scipio suspected the whole confederacy had a shabby rundown look to it these days a lot of men white and black were walking along not quite aimlessly looking for anything that might be work as oglethorpe had said the factories that had boomed during the warcotton mills brickworks fertilizer plants cannerieswere booming no more more than a few men remained in their uniforms though the war had been over since the summer before and spring wasnt far away most of the whites who still wore draggled butternut looked to be wearing it because they had nothing better to put on the negroes in uniform though might have been in business suits they were advertising that they had served their country as plainly as if they carried sandwich boards and were hoping that would help them land work what sort of place the confederate states were going to give their black veterans remained to be seen scipio headed east along telfair toward the terry the colored district in augusta somebody was holding a rally in may park a couple of blocks south of telfair he saw waving flags from the corner of telfair and elbert he didnt really need to go back to his room he was at the moment a gentleman of leisure he wandered down toward the park to find out what was going on the flags were confederate flags they flew at the edge of the street to draw people toward the rallyas theyd succeeded in drawing scipioand fluttered in a mild breeze on and beside the platform on which the speaker stood behind the fellow was a sign that did not look to have been painted by a professional it read freedom party what was the freedom party whatever it was scipio had never heard of it before no one at anne colletons elegant dinner parties had ever mentioned it so far as he recalled of course he hadnt paid that much attention to politics at least till hed been dragooned into the leadership of the congaree socialist republic why should he have he couldnt vote the confederate states didnt recognize him as a citizen maybe this new outfit would help make things better and maybe it wouldnt too the skinny fellow up there on the platform was long on complaints arent our generals pretty in their fancy uniforms wouldnt you have liked it better if theyd had any notion how to fight the goddamn war wouldnt you have liked em better if they werent in the damnyankees pockets scipio blinked at that generals had occasionally visited marshlands he knew good and well theyd done everything they knew how to do to beat the united states they hadnt known enough but theyd tried most of the men in the crowd looked to be either white veterans or men whod had wartime factory jobs and had no jobs now theyd never seen any generals except perhaps whizzing by in fancy motorcars when this loudmouthed madman ranted about traitors in high places in richmond they ate it up and shouted for more and he gave them more saying and if the goddamn generals werent traitors and fools how come they sat there with their thumbs up their asses while the niggers plotted up the biggest goddamn rebellion in the history of the world were they blind or did they shut their eyes on purpose either which way throw em on the rubbish heap every stinking one ofem thats right voices in the crowd said tell it as far as they were concerned the speaker might have been one of the colored preachers who went around the plantations testifying to the power of the lord these battered white men responded the way colored fieldhands as oppressed a group as was ever born did when the preacher started going strong and wed have whipped the damnyankeeswhipped em i tell youif the niggers hadnt risen up the man from the freedom party shouted he believed every word he was saying scipio could hear conviction jangling in his voice they stabbed usthey stabbed our countryin the back get rid of the traitor niggers and the traitor generals and ill tell you wed have been past philadelphia and heading for new york city he pumped his fist in the air his audience pumped their fists in the air too scipio stood only on the outermost fringes of the audience by the glares coming his way he suddenly realized even that was much too close to the platform he made himself scarce before anybody decided pounding him into the ground would be a good way to settle lunch behind him the crowd erupted in more cheers he didnt turn around to find out why he suspected hed be happier not knowing once he got back inside the terrylocal colored dialect for territoryhe felt better being surrounded by black faces eased the alarm hed felt at the freedom party rally not all white men were like that shouting wouldbe politician scipio patted his hip pocket where the money john oglethorpe had given him rested oglethorpe was as good as they came black or white even anne colleton didnt scare scipio the way hed been scared in may park miss anne wanted to go on running things and she wanted revenge on the people whod killed her brother and gutted marshlands and almost killed her that made sense to scipio even if it had put him in hot water the fellow on the platform aint gwine think about he no more scipio muttered that was easy to say it wasnt so easy to do he stuck his head into every little holeinthewall cafe and cookshop he passed to see if anybody was looking for help even if a waiter didnt get paid a whole lot he didnt go hungry not if his boss had so much as a particle of heart waiting tables was easier than factory work too not that any factory work was out there these days he didnt find any restaurant jobs in the terry either he would have been surprised if he had half of these joints didnt have any waiters at all the fellow at the stove did everything else too at a lot of the other places the waiter looked to be the cooks son or brother or cousin still you never could tell if you didnt bet how were you going to win the terry had even more places to get a drink than it did places to get food scipio was tempted to stick his head into one of them too not to look for work but to find somewhere he could kill an afternoon over a mug of beer or two in the end he stayed out unless a man had silver to spend beer cost three or four dollars a mug even in the dingiest dive without a job at the moment scipio didnt care to throw his banknotes around like that he ended up back at his roominghouse the landlady gave him a fishy stare a working man who unexpectedly showed up long before quitting time couldnt figure on anything else the landlady didnt say anything she didnt need to if scipio was late with his rent hed end up on the sidewalk and everything he ownednot that that amounted to muchout there with him he was paid up till the end of the week and he had plenty for the next weeks rent he hoped he wouldnt have to worry past then hed never before had trouble finding a job that cheered him till he remembered he hadnt looked for one since the war ended everybody was scrambling for work now he went upstairs the furniture in his room was no better than could be expected in a terry roominghouse but he kept the place spotlessly clean the books on the battered bookshelf were his he pulled out a beatup abridgement of gibbons decline and fall and read with a smile on his face of the moorish conquest of the blond visigoths of spain general george armstrong custer was not a happy man god damn it to hell and gone lieutenant colonel he shouted i dont want to go back to philadelphia im perfectly content to stay here in nashville im sorry sir lieutenant colonel abner dowling said custers adjutant was in fact a good deal less than devastated but knew better than to show it the telegram just now came in im afraid it leaves you little room for discretion i dont want to go back to philadelphia custer repeated he had scant discretion once set on a course he kept on it and derailing him commonly took the rhetorical equivalent of dynamite hed been stubborn and hardcharging for more than seventyeight years no wire from the war department would make him change his ways abner dowling was convinced nothing would make him change his ways sir dowling said i suspect they want to honor you you are after all the senior soldier in the united states army dont pour the soft soap on me even if youre shaped like a barrel of it custer growled his description of dowlings physique was unfortunately accurate although he was hardly the dashing young cavalryman himself these days he tapped at the four stars on the shoulder of his fancyas fancy as regulations permitted and then someuniform took me long enough to make full general by god when i think of the fools and whippersnappers promoted ahead of me i could weep lieutenant colonel i could just weep custers slow promotion had also meant dowlings slow promotion custer never thought of such things nor that calling a fat man fat to his face might wound his feelings custer thought of custer first last and always dowling scratched at his mustache in lieu of reaching out and punching the distinguished general commanding the us first army right in the nose he took a deep breath and said sir they may have taken a while to recognize your heroism but theyve gone and done it in an odd sort of way he was even telling the truth as with the rest of his life custer knew only one style of fighting straightahead slugging first army had paid a gruesome toll for that aggressiveness as it slogged its way south through western kentucky and northern tennessee when custer saw his first barrel hed wanted to mass the traveling forts and beat his confederate opponents over the head with them too war department doctrine dictated otherwise custer had ignored war department doctrine lying about it along the way and making dowling lie too assembled his barrels exactly as he wanted to hurled them at the rebsand broken through other us armies using the same tactics had broken through too if that didnt make him a hero what did if hed failed if hed failed he would have been retired and dowling dowling would probably be a first lieutenant in charge of all the battleship refueling depots in montana and wyoming he knew what a narrow escape theyd had custer didnt even suspect it he could be very naive he could also be very canny i know why theyre calling me to philadelphia he said leaning toward his adjutant so he could speak in a conspiratorial whisper theyre going to put me out to pasture thats what theyre going to do oh i hope not sir dowling lied loyally hed fought the good fight for a lot of years keeping custer as close to military reality as he could if he didnt have to do that any more the war department would give him something else to do anything this side of latrine duty looked more pleasant i wont let them custer said ill go to the newspapers thats what ill do dowling was sure he would too publicity was meat and drink to him he might even win his fight hed won many of them in his time all that was for the moment beside the point though sir you are ordered to report in philadelphia no later than sunday twentyfirst april thats day after tomorrow sir theyve laid on a special pullman car for you and mrs custer with a berth in the next car for me you dont have to take that particular train but it would be a comfortable way to get there dowling was and needed to be skilled at the art of cajolery custer sputtered and fumed through his peroxided mustache he did know how to take ordersmost of the time libbie would like going that way he said as if to give himself an excuse for yielding dowling nodded partly from policy partly from agreement custers wife would like going that way and would also approve of his acquiescence but then elizabeth bacon custer in dowlings view had more brains in her fingernail than her illustrious husband did in his head the train proved splendid dowling wondered if the pullmans and dining car had been borrowed from a wealthy capitalist to transport custer in splendorand he himself got only a reflection of the splendor custer had to be enjoying to the fullest as he ate another bite of beefsteak in portwine sauce he reflected that life could have been worse a brass band waited on the platform as the locomotive pulled into the broad street stationand not just any brass band but one led by john philip sousa next to the band stood theodore roosevelt dowling watched custers face when he saw the president the two men had been rivals since theyd combined to drive the british out of montana territory at the end of the second mexican war each thought the other had got more credit than he deservedtheyd quarreled about it in nashville as the great war was ending now though roosevelt bared his large and seemingly very numerous teeth in a grin of greeting welcome to philadelphia general he boomed and advanced to take custers hand as the band blared out the stars and stripes forever and photographic flashes went off like artillery rounds i trust you will do me the honor of riding with me at the head of the remembrance day parade tomorrow dowling could not remember the last time he had seen george custer speechless but custer was speechless now speechless for half a minute then at last he took roosevelts hand in his and huskily whispered thank you mr president beside him libbie who thought even less of roosevelt than he did dropped the president a curtsy and abner dowling felt something that might almost have been a tear in his eye roosevelt had done custer honor not the other way round president blaine had instituted remembrance day at the close of the second mexican war as a memorial to the humiliation of the united states by their foes it had always been a day of mourning and lamentation and looking ahead to fights unwon and now the fight was over and it had been won instead of lying prostrate in defeat the united states stood triumphant with remembrance day come round again the country could see that all the sacrifices its citizens had made for so many years were not in vain flags wouldnt fly upside down in distress any more custer asked mr president where will you seat my wife that i have come to this moment is in no small measure due to her thank you autie libbie said dowling thought custer dead right in his assessment he hadnt thought custer perceptive enough to realize the truth in what he said every once in a while the old boy could be surprising trouble was so many of the surprises proved alarming i had in mind placing her in the motorcar directly behind ours roosevelt answered and putting your adjutant with her if that be satisfactory to you all lieutenant colonel dowling has given his country no small service dowling came to stiff attention and saluted thank you very much sir his heart felt about to burst with pride the people will want to look at the general and the president so i am perfectly content to ride behind libbie said in public she always put custer and his career ahead of his own desires in private as dowling had seen she kept a wary eye on custer because his own eye even at his advanced age had a tendency to wander good thats settled roosevelt liked having things settled especially his way well put you folks up for the night and then tomorrow morning tomorrow morning general custer presumed to interrupt his commanderinchief tomorrow morning mr president we celebrate our revenge on the world it was a typically grandiose custerian phrase the one difference being that custer this time was inarguably right theodore roosevelt laughed and nodded and clapped his hands with glee the victory the united states had won looked to be big enough to help heal even this longtime estrangement up until the war the hindenburg hotel had been called the lafayette whatever you called it it was luxury beyond any dowling had ever known surpassing the train on which hed come to philadelphia to the same degree the train surpassed a typical wartime billet he feasted on lobster drank champagne bathed in a tub with golden faucets plucked a fine habana from a humidor on the dresser and slept on smooth linen and soft down there were he reflected as he drifted toward that splendid sleep people who lived this life all the time it was enough to make a man wish he were one of the electeither that or to make him a socialist the next morning he was whisked along with the custers on a whirlwind inspection of the units that would take part in the parade he endured rather than enjoying most of the inspection hed seen his share of soldiers but some of the barrels and their crews were from the first army brigade colonel morrell had assembled and commanded they greeted custer and dowling with lusty cheers dowling thought those cheers lusty at any rate till the parade began and he heard the philadelphians their roar was like nothing he had ever imagined it was as if they were exorcising more than half a century of shame and disgrace and defeatlee had occupied philadelphia at the end of the war of secession in this grandest of all grand moments some women in the crowd looked fierce as they waved their flagsthirtyfive stars now that kentucky was back in the usa and the new state of houston would make it thirtysix on the fourth of july god only knew what would happen with sequoyah and with the land conquered from canada abner dowling didnt and didnt worry about it other women he saw seemed on the point of ecstasy at what their country had finally achieved tears streamed down the faces of old men who remembered all the defeats and embarrassments of boys who hadnt been old enough to go and fight and of men of fighting age who had given of themselves to make this parade what it was even a young man wearing a hook in place of his left hand wept unashamed at this remembrance day to be remembered forever in the motorcar ahead custer and roosevelt took turns rising to accept the plaudits of the crowd and the crowd did cheer each time one of them rose but the crowd would have cheered anyhow more than anything else it was cheering itself libbie custer leaned close to dowling and said lieutenant colonel i thank god that he spared me to see this day and rejoice at what we have done yes maam he said and then half to himself and what do we do next iii having been beached roger kimball like so many of his comrades was making the painful discovery that very little hed learned at the confederate naval academy in mobile suited him to making a living in the civilian world he was a firstrate submarine skipper but there were no civilian submarines the cs navy was no longer allowed to keep submersibles either otherwise he would have stayed in command of the bonefish he had a fine understanding of the workings of large diesel engines that also did him very little good outside the navy there were next to no large diesel engines nor small ones either he understood gasoline and steam engines too but so did plenty of other people none of them seemed willing to sacrifice his own position for kimballs sake miserable bastards every last one ofem he muttered as he trudged through the streets of charleston south carolina then he laughed at himself had he had a steady job he wouldnt have let go of it either maybe he should have headed down to south america as hed told anne colleton he might a lot of former navy men were trudging the streets of charleston these days most of them overqualified for the jobs that turned upwhen any jobs turned up which wasnt often kimball kept money in his pocket partly because he wasnt too proud for any kind of work that came alonghaving grown up on a hardscrabble farm in arkansas he was no pampered confederate aristocratand partly because he was a damn fine poker player he walked into a saloon called the ironclad let me have a beer he told the barkeep and laid a tendollar banknote on the bar he got back a beer and three dollars sighing he laid some briny sardellen on a slice of cornbread from the freelunch counter and gobbled them down pickled in brine the little minnows were so salty they couldnt help raising a thirst he sipped the beer and had to fight the urge to gulp it down and immediately order another provoking just that response was the free lunchs raison detre a couple of men farther down the bar were talking one of them also nursing a beer the other with a whiskey in front of him kimball paid them only scant attention for a bit but then began to listen more closely he emptied his schooner and walked over to the fellow who was drinking whiskey you wouldnt by any chance be from the united states would you he asked his harsh arkansas drawl made it very plain he was not he was looking for a yes and a fight as the man on the bar stool turned to size him up he realized the fight might not be so easy he was a little heavier and a little younger than the other man but the fellow owned a pair of the steeliest gray eyes hed ever seen if he got in a brawl those eyes warned he wouldnt quit till hed either won or got knocked cold and then his friend laughed and said jesus clarence swear to god im gonna have to stop taking you out in public if you dont quit talking that way its the way i talk the man with the hard eyesclarence said he turned back to kimball no whoever the hell you are i am not a damnyankee i sound the way i sound because i went to college up at yale clarence potter exmajor army of northern virginia at your serviceand if you dont like it ill spit in your eye kimball felt foolish hed felt foolish before he expected hed feel foolish again he gave his own name adding excommander cs navy submersibles and stuck out his hand potter took it that explains why you wanted to wipe the floor with a yankee anyhow sorry i cant oblige you he threw a lazy punch in the direction of his friend and this creature here is jack delamotte you have to forgive him hes retarded only an exfirst lieutenant army of northern virginia i wont hold it against him kimball said pleased to meet the both of you id be happy to buy you fresh drinks he wouldnt be happy to do it but it would make amends for mistaking potter for someone from north of the masondixon line im pleased to meet damn near anybody wholl buy me a drink delamotte said he was a big fairhaired fellow who sounded as if he was from alabama or mississippi he kicked the bar stool next to him why dont you set yourself down again and maybe well get around to buying you one too being closer to clarence potter kimball sat beside him the bartender served up two more beers and another whiskey kimball raised his schooner on high to hell with the united goddamn states of america potter and delamotte both drank no confederate officer cut loose from his countrys service in the aftermath of defeat could refuse that toast the exmajor who talked like a yankee and looked like a tough professor offered a toast of his own to getting the confederate goddamn states of america back on their feet that too was unexceptionable after drinking to it kimball found himself with an empty schooner he wasnt drunk not on two beers but he was intensely and urgently thoughtful he didnt much care for the tenor of his thoughts either how the hell are we supposed to do that he demanded the united states are going to be sitting on our neck for the next hundred years no they wont potter shook his head we will get the chance he sounded positive roger kimball was positive too positive his new acquaintance was out of his mind they made you butternut boys say uncle he said which might have come close to starting another fight confederate navy men whod battled their us counterparts to something close to a draw resented the army for having to yield but now not intending pugnacity he went on why do you reckon theyll be fools enough to ever let us do anything again same question ive been asking him delamotte said and ill give commander kimball the same answer ive given you potter seemed to think like a professor too he lined up all his ducks in a row in rhetorical tones he asked toward what have the united states been aiming ever since the war of secession and especially since the second mexican war kicking us right square in the nuts kimball answered and now theyve finally gone and done it the bastards hed done some nutkicking of his own even after the ceasefire that last though was a secret he intended to take to the grave with him just so clarence potter agreed emphasizing the point with a forefinger now theyve finally gone and done what theyve been pointing toward since up till now they had a goal and they worked toward it christ were they serious about working toward it you have no notion how serious they were if youve never seen a remembrance day parade scared me to death when i was up in connecticut believe you me it did but now they dont have a goal any more theyve achieved their goal do you see the difference commander before kimball could answer jack delamotte said what i see is im thirsty and i bet im not the only one either he ordered another round of drinks then ate some sardellen and lit a cigar almost as pungent as the fish after a pull or two at his beer kimball said major i dont follow you suppose their next goal is wiping us out altogether how in blazes are we supposed to stop em goals dont work like that not usually they dont potter said once you got to where you always thought you were going you like to ease back and relax and smoke a cigara good cigar mind you not a stinking weed like the one jacks stuffed into his faceand maybe marry a chorus girl if thats what you reckoned you would do after you made it big so thats what you figure is going to happen eh kimball chuckled you figure the united states scrimped and saved for so long and now theyll buy a fancy motorcar and put a beautiful dame in it well i hope youre right but ill tell you this much it wont happen as long as that goddamn roosevelt is president of the usa he hates us too much to care about chorus girls i never said it would happen tomorrow potter replied i said it would happen countries live longer than people do he knocked back his whiskey with a sharp flick of the wrist and ordered another round while the bored man behind the bar was drawing the beers jack delamotte leaned toward kimball and said now youre going to hear clarence go on about how we need to find a goal of our own and stick to it like the damnyankees did its the truth potter looked stubbornand slightly pieeyed if we dont well be secondraters forever wont see it with the regular politicians kimball said with conviction they got us into the swamp but im damned if i reckon theyve got even a clue about how to get us out neither potter nor delamotte argued with him he would have been astonished if they had he went on i heard this skinny fellow on the stump a week or two ago the freedom party that was the name of his outfit he wasnt too badsounded like he knew what he wanted and how to get there his name was feathers or something like that to his surprise clarence potter whod struck him as a sourpuss threw back his head and guffawed featherston the exmajor said jake featherston hes about as likely a politician as a catfish is on roller skates you sound like you know him kimball said he commanded a battery in the first richmond howitzers through most of the war potter answered good fighting man should have been an officer but that battery had belonged to jeb stuart iii and jeb jr blamed featherston when his son got killed since jeb jrs a general featherston wouldnt have got past sergeant if hed stayed in the army till he died of old age slowly kimball nodded no wonder he was ranting and raving about the fools in the war department then no wonder at all potter agreed not that hes wrong about there being fools in the war department there are plenty i was in intelligence i worked with some and reported to others but you need to take what featherston says with a grain of salt about the size of texas hes got some good ideas about the niggers though kimball said if they hadnt risen up wed still be fighting by god he didnt want a grain of salt not one the size of texas nor a tiny one either he wanted to believe he wanted his country strong again the sooner the better he didnt care how clarence potter shook his head i doubt it he said a good big man will lick a good little mannot all the time but thats the way to bet once we didnt knock the usa out of the fight in a hurryonce it turned into a grapplewe were going to be in trouble as i said i was in intelligence i know how much they outweighed us even with a good deal of whiskey in him he was dispassionately analytical like a scholar kimball cared for dispassionate analysis only when calculating a torpedos track even then it was a means to an end not an end in itself the end was actionblowing up a ship featherston wanted action too you know how i can find out more about this freedom party he asked theyve started up an office here in town i think potter answered distaste on his face jake featherston calls richmond home though and i think the party does too thanks kimball said do me a little poking around i think he signaled to the bartender set em up again pal cincinnatus driverthe negro was getting more and more used to the surname hed taken the year beforehad hoped the wars end would bring peace to kentucky and especially to covington where he lived now here it was the middle of spring and covington still knew no peace every day when he left his house to start up the ramshackle truck hed bought his wife would say be careful watch yourself i will elizabeth he would promise not in any perfunctory way but with a deep and abiding sense that he was saying something important he would crank the truck to noisy shuddering life climb into the cabin put the machine in gear and drive off to hustle as much in the way of hauling business as he could he wished he were inside one of the big snarling white trucks the army used to carry its supplies hed driven a white during the war hauling goods that got shipped across the ohio from cincinnati through covington and down to the fighting front the whites were powerful they were sturdy they were in fact everything his antiquated duryea was not that included expensive which was why he drove the duryea and wished for a white as he turned right onto scott from out of the negro district and drove up toward the wharves this morning he kept a wary eye open a good many us soldiers in greengray uniforms were on the streets they also looked wary and carried bayoneted springfields as if ready to start shooting or stabbing at any moment they needed to be wary too after more than fifty years in the confederacy kentucky was one of the united states again it was however like none of the other united states in that a large part of the population remained unreconciled to the switch from stars and bars to stars and stripes the city hall had us machinegun nests around it somebody odds were a confederate diehardhad taken a shot at the mayor a couple of weeks before cincinnatus wouldnt have been brokenhearted had the malcontent hit him the mayor cooperated with us authorities and tried to placate the locals with rabblerousing speeches against blacks blue st andrews crosses some of them new marked buildings and suggested the confederate battle flag two horizontal red stripes with a white one between similarly suggested the confederate national flag some of those were new too the diehards hadnt given up not by a long chalk i aint no yankee someone had written beside one of those notquiteflags new posters marred walls too some of them slapped over the proconfederate graffiti the posters were solid red with broken chains in black stretched across them the red uprising had not got so far among the negroes of kentucky as among their brethren still in confederateowned territory at its outbreak but it had not been brutally suppressed here either being a red wasnt illegal in the usa even if it was hazardous to a black mans health red posters and blue crosses were both thick around the waterfront cincinnatus wondered if the diehards and the reds had bumped into each other on their clandestine rounds of pasting and painting down in the csa they would have been deadly foes here in kentucky they sometimes reckoned the us government a common enemy cincinnatus whistled softly they sometimes didnt too both soldiers and police patrolled the wharves confederate policemen had commonly worn gray like soldiers from the war of secession now that kentucky belonged to the usa policemensometimes the same policemenwore dark blue as their grandfathers might have done had they fought for the stars and stripes and some policemen wore no uniforms at all some of the idlers some of the roustabouts who strode up and down the piers and along the waterfront were sure to belong to luther bliss kentucky state police an outfit that made kentucky the only us state with its own secret police force cincinnatus knew luther bliss better than he wanted to knowing bliss at all was knowing him better than cincinnatus wanted to the chief of the state police made a formidable foe roustabouts were hauling crates and barrels off a barge cincinnatus braked to a halt cautiously as the duryea didnt like to stop any more than it liked to start he hopped out of the cab and hurried over to a discontentedlooking fellow holding a clipboard mornin mr simmons he said what you got wheres it got to get to and how fast does it got to be there hello cincinnatus the steamboat clerk answered pointing to some of the barrels got oatmeal here five for twitchelps general store and another five for dalyrimples and three for conroys you fit all of them in there he pointed to cincinnatus truck damn tight squeeze if you do mr simmons theyll go in there if i got to make one of em drive cincinnatus said at which the white man laughed cincinnatus went on haifa dollar a barrel for haulage like usual simmons looked more discontented than ever at last he said wouldnt pay it to any other nigger driving a raggedy old truck thats for damn sure but yeah fifty cents a barrel bring me your receipts and ill pay you off got yourself a deal suh cincinnatus beamed that was good money and he might have the chance to pick up another load or maybe even two before the day ended then he hesitated really hearing the third name simmons had given him that joe conroy he asked fat man used to have hisself a store before it burned down let me check simmons flipped papers joseph conroy thats what it says i dont know about the other part how come didnt know he was back in business is all cincinnatus replied it wasnt all not even close but he kept that to himself wheres his new store at simmons checked his papers again corner of emma and bakewell it says here you know where that is this aint my town you know i know where its at yeah cincinnatus said over on the west side gettin out towards the park twitchells over here on third and dalyrimples on washington so i reckon ill deliver theirs first and then head over to conroys he held out his hand give me the papers i got to get signed here you go the steamboat clerk handed them to him thats the other reason i pay you like i would a white man or almost you read and write good so things get done proper thank you cincinnatus said pretending not to hear that or almost he couldnt do anything about it stowing the papers in his shirt pocket he started crowding barrels of oatmeal into the back of the truck he did end up with one of them on the seat beside him simmons was a keen judge of how much space merchandise took up the truck rode heavy the weight in back smoothing out its motion and making it laugh at bumps that would have jolted cincinnatus had it been empty he appreciated that the ponderous cornering and the greater likelihood of a blowout were something else again he drove carefully avoiding the potholes that pocked the street a puncture would cost him precious time his first two stops went smoothly as hed thought they would hed delivered to both hank twitchell and calvin dalyrimple before twitchell a big brawny fellow even helped him lug barrels of oatmeal into his general store calvin dalyrimple didnt a strong breeze would have blown him away they both signed their receipts and sent cincinnatus on his way in jig time he drove out to the west side of town with much more trepidation that didnt shrink when he discovered conroys new general store sat between a saloon and a pawnshop none of the looks he got from passersby as he stopped the truck in front of the store was friendly or anything close most of them translated to what the hell you doing here nigger he hoped the truck would still be there when he got done with his business with conroy he also hoped the storekeeper wouldnt recognize him when he brought the first barrel into the store all he said was heres your oatmeal suh straight off the docks got two more barrels in the truck fetch em right in for you all you got to do is sign the receipt shows you got em and i be on my way joe conroy grunted he was a round middleaged white man with narrow suspicious eyes he was also a confederate diehard and a friend of cincinnatus former boss tom kennedy kennedy had involved cincinnatus with the diehards too having him plant firebombs on cargoes heading down to us forces eventually cincinnatus had planted one in conroys old store but the white man had never figured that out cincinnatus had never decided how smart conroy was smarter than he let on was the negros guess he proved smart enough to recognize cincinnatus whom he hadnt seen in a year and who would have been glad never to see him again well well he said slowly the unlit cigar in his mouth jerking up and down look what the cat drug in mornin mistuh conroy cincinnatus hurried out to the truck to haul in the second barrel of oatmeal as long as he was working he didnt have to talk he wished a customer would come into the cramped dark general store conroy couldnt afford to talk not where anyone could hear him but nobody came in except cincinnatus conroy gave him an appraising stare hear tell it was that damnyankee you was workin for who shot tom kennedy he said yes suh thats a fact hear him say so my ownself cincinnatus agreed he got in a dig of his own wasnt the reds like you told me in the park last year no it wasnt the reds the storekeeper said but it was a friend of yours just the same we dont forget things like that no indeed we dont i saved tom kennedys bacon from the yankees back when the war was new cincinnatus said angrily i hadnt done that i never wouldve met youand believe you me that wouldve suited me fine we know where youre at conroy put menace in his voice and i know where youre at too cincinnatus said i get into trouble from you and your pals luther blissll know where youre at and what youve been doin dont want no trouble conroy he used the white mans unadorned surname with relish to shock but i get trouble i give it right back damn uppity nigger conroy growled yes sir cincinnatus went outside and manhandled the last barrel of oatmeal into the store he thrust the receipt at joe conroy you want to sign right here so i can go on about my business why do i give a damn about that conroy said on account of if you dont sign i take this here oatmeal back to the docks and you dont get no more shipments cincinnatus wondered how much conroy cared if the store was nothing but a front for the diehards he might not care at all that would make cincinnatus life more difficult but conroy grabbed a pencil scrawled his signature and all but hurled the paper back at cincinnatus here god damn you much obliged mistuh conroy cincinnatus headed for the door got me a lot of work left to do come on sylvia enos said to her children get moving ive got to take you over to mrs dooleys so i can go to work i like it better when youre not working ma mary jane said she would be five soon which sylvia found hard to believe i like it when you stay home with us when she stays home with us though its because shes out of work again silly george jr spoke with the worldweary wisdom of his seven yearsand wasnt shy about scoring points off his sister either we have to have money he had a hard streak of pragmatism in him his father had been the same way george jr looked very much like his father though he was missing the brown kaiser bill mustache sylvias husband had worn seeing her son sylvia again cursed the fate that had put a submersible in the way of the uss ericsson the night after the confederate states yielded to the usa with the csa out of the war she thought it had to be a british boat george hadnt worried about the royal navy a confederate submarine had almost sunk his destroyer earlier in the war hed fought rebel boats all the way up to the end to have his ship sunk by the limeys after that even now it was hard to take george hadnt deserved that much bad luck come on sylvia said again i cant be late on account of you i cant be late at all that was nothing less than the gospel truth with men home from the war in droves jobs for women were harder and harder to come by she didnt know how long the work at the galoshes factory would last and she couldnt afford to anger the people over her in any way she was the sole support for her family as much as any man was for his but nobody looked at things that way men came first women had been fine during the war now now she couldnt even vote for anyone who might better her plight massachusetts had no womens suffrage had she been able to cast a ballot she would have voted socialist in a heartbeat the democrats had been fine when it came to winning the war what were they good for in peacetime only counting their profits as far as she could see she hurried the children out of the apartment and down to the clamorous streets of boston with a sigh of regret she walked past a newsboy hawking the globe she couldnt justify laying out a couple of cents on it not when she didnt know if shed have work next week england signs treaty the newsboys shouted trying to persuade others to part with pennies limeys give up all claim to sandwich islands and canada england signs treaty recognizes ireland and quebec it was she supposed good news the best news though as far as she was concerned would have been for the ocean to swallow england and all her works and while the ocean was at it it could swallow the csa too mrs dooley was an aging widow with wavy hair defiantly hennaed and with bright spots of rouge on her cheeks to sylvia it looked more like clown makeup than anything alluring but she would never have said so the woman took good care of her children and did not charge too much after kissing george jr and mary jane goodbye sylvia went back to the trolley stop tossed another nickel in the fare box and soon she would have to start paying mary janes fare too one more expense and headed to the galoshes factory to her relief she got there on time the place stank of rubber from which the rubber overshoes were made sylvias post came just after the galoshes emerged from the mold she painted a red ring around the top of each one had the firm been able to train a dog to do the job it would have that failing it grudgingly paid her when shed worked in a mackerelcanning plant shed been able to operate the machine that glued gaudy labels to cans almost without thinking about it sometimes when she was lucky she would hardly notice the time going by between getting to the factory and dinner or between dinner and going home she hadnt had that luxury at the shoe factory where shed been working when george was killed if she didnt pay attention to what she was doing there the powerful needle on the electric sewing machine would tear up her hand shed seen it happen to operators whod been at the place longer than shed been alive a moments lapse was all it took all that could happen with a moments lapse here was her ending up with red paint on her hand not red blood still she couldnt let her mind wander as shed been able to do in the canning plant what she did here wasnt simple repetitive motion the way that had been she had to pay attention to painting the rings precisely if she didnt the foreman started barking at her frank best wasnt a hardened old tartar like gustav krafft the foreman at the shoe factory where shed worked who gave a walking demonstration of why the limeys and frogs thought of germans as huns bests style was more the sly dig thought you were going to slip that one by me did you was a favorite remark the other difference between the two men was that krafft had been too old to serve in the army frank best wore a soldiers circle pin with the year on it that being his conscription class he was only a handful of years older than sylvia he was also single and convinced he was the greatest gift to women god had ever set on the planet a lot of women who worked in the galoshes factory were widows some still wearing mourning others not most of them like sylvia heartily despised the foreman like to put a certain part of him in the moldthe sizetwo mold sarah wyckoff one of those widows said at dinner on a day when best was being particularly obnoxious wouldnt need nothin bigger that produced a good set of giggles sylvia said no for goodness sake you dont want him vulcanized there hed never keep quiet about it then more giggles rose if so many of us hate him said may cavendish another widow why does he think hes so bully hes a man sarah wyckoff said as if she expected that to cover everything by the way the other women nodded it probably did may cavendish tossed her head her blond curls bounced on her shoulders what frosts me is that some of the girls do like him i cant imagine that anybody would really like him sylvia said with a shudder her companions nodded she went on but if he says be nice to me or go look for another job some of the girls are going to be nice to him times are hard believe me i know we all know sweetheart sarah said if he said anything like that to me though id break him in half she was built like a longshoreman sylvia didnt think she meant it any way but literally there ought to be a law sylvia said shed had that thought before when she lost her job at the canning plant because shed had to stay home and tend to her children after they came down with the chicken pox there ought to be a lot of things that there aint sarah wyckoff said with authority if i was teddy roosevelt youd look silly with a mustache sarah and you havent got enough teeth to be tr may cavendish said she pulled a pack of cigarettes from her handbag scraped a match on the sole of her shoe got the cigarette lighted and blew out a creditable smoke ring then she coughed sorry im still getting the hang of this doesnt it make people think youre fast sylvia asked may shook her head not the way it would have before the war she said and drew on the cigarette again the coal glowed red she let the smoke go without showing off this time its not like its a big smelly cigar or anything its not like it was hooch either you dont get drunk or anythingyou feel better about things for a little while thats all she extended the pack toward sylvia want to try one sure why not sylvia said its not like they can hurt you or anything she took a cigarette may cavendish struck another match sylvia didnt drag deeply on the cigarette the way may had done she drew in a cautious mouthful of smokeor so she thought when she tried to suck it down into her lungs she hacked and wheezed and started to choke very same thing happened to me the first time i tried may assured her it gets easier believe me it does you get used to it sylvias mouth tasted as if someone had just doused a campfire in there she stared at the cigarette in dismay why would you want to get used to it she asked and coughed again but she felt tingly all the way out to her fingers and toes tingly and lightheaded in a strange and pleasant sort of way ever so cautiously she took another puff it still tasted bad it made her chest burn but the tingles and that good feeling in the middle of her brain got stronger dont do too much the first time may cavendish advised her you can get sick if you do think about whether you like it or not its not like cigarettes are expensive or anything like that thats true sylvia said theyve come down since the war ended too ive noticed that even if i dont usually buy them may nodded and the tobaccos better now its the one good thing you can say about the rebsthey grow better tobacco than we do some of the stuff they were selling while the war was still on honey i swear to jesus they were sweeping the horseballs off the street and wrapping paper around em people kept smoking though sarah wyckoff said why not sylvia said its not a bad thing and mays rightit does make you feel nice for a little bit despite saying that she had no great urge to smoke the rest of the cigarette may cavendish had given her she let it fall to the ground and crushed it with her foot maybe shed acquire the habit and maybe she wouldnt if she did shed do it slowly if she tried to do it in a hurry she had the feeling she would get sick instead time to get back to work sarah said or frankll start sweettalking us again she rolled her eyes to show how much she looked forward to that when sylvia went back into the plant it didnt stink so badly of rubber or so it seemed after a while she realized the cigarette had numbed her sense of smell that seemed a good reason to start smoking all by itself the line began to move sylvia painted red rings on a pair of galoshes the machinery sent them down the line to the next worker who would trim off extra rubber sylvia dipped her brush in the paint can and painted more rings lucien galtier was the sort to enjoy summer while it lasted up here close to the st lawrence a few miles outside the town of riviereduloup it did not last long the farmer did not hold that against summer it was what it was he accepted along with enjoying he accepted weeds too but he did not enjoy them at the moment he was hoeing the potato patch when he saw a bit of green of the wrong shade and in the wrong place the hoe lashed out without his conscious direction the decapitated weed toppled strike them all dead cherpapa luciens son georges said from a couple of rows over seeing the hoe come down at eighteen georges overtopped his father by several inches and was wider through the shoulders tooluciens strength was of the wiry enduring sort georges humor was also wider than his fathers he enjoyed playing the buffoon while lucien met the world with irony strike them all dead eh lucien said as he got rid of another weed one fine day my son you will make your country a fine general if the republic of quebec needs me as a general it will be in a great deal of trouble georges said with conviction he looked down at the ground come on you weedsget out of the potato trenches and charge the machine guns die and save me the trouble of grubbing you out beaming at lucien he went on perhaps you have reason i can talk like a general n estcepas his father snorted as always you are a nonpareil he bent his back to the weeding not wanting georges to see any surprise on his face hed forgotten as he sometimes could in the daily routine of farm life that this was and had been for the past year and more the republic of quebec dancing attendance on the united states and not the province of quebec a frenchspeaking appendage to the british empire he laughedat himself as he often did hed forgotten the americanfostered republic of queb ec and that with an american soninlaw there was absentmindedness worthy of a professor or a priest when he straightened again he glanced over in the direction of the hospital the americans had built on his land to care for their wounded from the fighting north of the st lawrence the hospital remained but no longer flew the stars and stripes instead the republics flag which had also been the provincial flag floated above it a field of blue quartered by a white cross and in each quadrant a white fleurdelys these days the hospital drew its patients from the people of quebec as the sun went down he and georges shouldered their hoes like rifles and trudged back toward the farmhouse a ford was parked by the house not one in a coat of greengray us official paint nor the republics equivalent bluegray but somber civilian black georges grinned when he saw it ah good he said my sister is here for me to harass yes and her husband is here to give you what you deserve for harassing her too lucien replied to which his son responded with a magnificent gallic shrug charles georges older brother came out of the barn just as lucien and georges headed toward it to hang the hoes on the rack luciens grandfather had built long years before charles looked like lucien but was more sobersidedhe had to take after his mother there marie greeted her husband and sons on the front porch as much to make sure they wiped their feet as for any other reason she was a small dark sensible woman ideally suited to be a farm wife her younger daughters susanne denise and jeanne who ranged in age from sixteen down to eleven also came out susanne sixteen galtier shook his head she had been a child when the war started seeing her ripening figure forcibly reminded him she was a child no longer lucien waded through his younger daughters to give nicole a hug she looked very much the way marie had as a young wife she also looked happy which made her father happy in turn when she turned lucien loose he shook his soninlaws hand and how does it march with you the distinguished dr odoull he asked dr leonard odoull looked back over his shoulder as if to see whether galtier were speaking to someone behind him with a chuckle he answered it marches well enough with me mon beaupere and with you oh with me galtier said lightly as he got out a jug of the applejack one of his neighborsmost unofficiallycooked up it is good of you to ask it is good of you to deign to visit my home here instead of returning to the palace in which you dwell in riviereduloup father nicole said indignantly be calm my sweet leonard odoull said laughter in his green eyes he was trying to make you squeak and he did it hed spoken frenchparisian frenchbefore he came up to quebec he still spoke parisian french but now with a heavy quebecois overlay in another few years he would probably sound like someone whod grown up here nicole sniffed i expected such behavior from my brother not from my own dear papa she laid the treacle on with a trowel her eyes glowed why georges asked innocently what did you expect charles to do that set nicole to spluttering charles to glaring and the young ladies of the family to chaffing both their brothers impartially in the midst of that racket lucien spoke more seriously to dr odoull it is always good to see you he handed his soninlaw a glass of the apple brandy to your health and to yours odoull said they drank galtier gasped a little as the applejack clawed its way down to his belly this was a rougher batch than most his neighbor made if it fazed leonard odoull he didnt let on irishmen were supposed to have welltempered gullets and he lived up to that after another sip he went on nicole and i finished our work at about the same time and we thought we would pay you a visit you should have such thoughts more often galtier said but then qualified that by adding are you certain it has been good for nicole to continue to work instead of keeping house full time she has become a good nurse odoull answered and the hospital would be the poorer if it lost her and she desires to work and i believe me i am perfectly happy with the way she keeps house so long as a man is happy everything will march well lucien said gravely and his soninlaw nodded the farmer raised an eyebrow is it for this reasonto boast of your happiness that you do us the honor of this visit by no means odoull could match georges absurdity for absurdity and lucien dry for dry it is because a little bird whispered in my ear that nicoles mother was fixing a great stew of lapins auxpruneaux ah is that the reason lucien slowly nodded very well very well indeed in fact the rabbits think i set the cabbages there for them to enjoy i on the other hand think god put the rabbits there for me to enjoy after you taste of the stew whose hot meaty odor filled the farmhouseyou will decide any rabbit who presumes to taste of your cabbages surely deserves to end up auxpruneaux his soninlaw agreed with a face so perfectly straight that galtier well pleased elbowed him in the ribs as if he were a son of his own flesh and poured him another glass of the homemade calvados the meal was a great success afterwards nicole helped her mother and sisters with the disheswith so many hands the work could not help being light odoull handed fragrant habanas to lucien and his sons and lit one for himself galtier savored the aroma before drawing the first sweet smoke from his own panatela he whistled tabernac he said reverently by the tobacco they grow there habana must be very close to paradise closest part of the confederate states anyhow not that thats saying much dr odoull replied charles said nothing which was not surprising georges said nothing which was an astonishment both young men puffed happy clouds so did lucien he could not recall the last time hed been more content at least outside the marriage bed and then another astonishment took place nicole came out of the kitchen followed by marie and susanne and denise and jeanne galtier did not find that an astonishment of the pleasant sort custom was that the women let their menfolk linger over liquor and tobacco he reckoned that a good custom one in no need of breaking whats this he asked a parade no cher papa only something i have to tell you something i have to tell everyone nicole said everyone except leonard that is for he knows even by the ruddy light of kerosene lamps lucien could see her blush he knew then what was coming knew it before she spoke cherpapa cher maman you will be grandparents next year a grandfather lucien exclaimed even knowing what was coming he found himself surprised but i am too young to be a grandfather he wanted to cry foolishness of course if he had a married daughter he was not too young to be a grandfather still he felt as if he were he looked down at his hands gnarled and scarred and callused by years of farm work tanned by the sun when there was sun roughened by the wind and the snow they were not the hands of a man too young to be a grandfather from them he looked to marie she without any possible doubt was too young to be a grandmother but her beaming face said she didnt think so it also said she looked forward to the role what of me georges said with fine mock anger i will be an uncle next year but do you say one word about that no you leave it to me to figure out for myself is that fair is that just nicole said what you will be next year is what you are this year and what you have always been a nuisance thank you georges nodded as at a great compliment well be aunts susanne and denise and jeanne chorused jeanne who was the youngest of them added i cant wait youll have to nicole said i am not ready to have the baby just yet lucien got up from his chair and embraced his daughter congratulations he said may all be well may all be well with you always he let her go and shook his soninlaws hand who would have thought i would have a grandchild named odoull the young doctors eyes twinkled see what you get for letting your daughter go to work in the american hospital at the time galtier said gravely i did not think that a good idea perhaps i was right leonard odoull just grinned at him he had to wait for nicole to let out an irate squawk before he could go on perhaps too i was wrong but only perhaps mind you someonehe did not see whohad filled his glass with applejack again if it was full it needed emptying before the war hed never imagined a halfamerican grandchild now though he discovered he liked the idea jonathan moss sat in a coffeehouse not far outside the northwestern university campus a breeze from lake michigan ruffled his light brown hair an internal breeze ruffled his thoughts whats the matter johnny my boy asked his companion at the table a curlyhaired fellow named fred sandburg you look like youve got bullets whizzing past your head again sandburg had served on the roanoke front in virginia helping to take the riverside town of big lick and the nearby iron mines away from the confederate states that had been some of the worst fighting of the whole war he knew all about bullets flying past his head he had a purple heart with an oakleaf cluster to show how much he knew he knew more about it than did jonathan moss and moss would have been the first to admit as much hed been a flier up in ontario through the fighting and never had been shot when the war was new hed thought of himself as a cavalier meeting other cavaliers in single combat three years of flying had convinced him he was as much a gear in a killing machine as an infantryman in the mud only the pay and the view and the hours were better moss sipped at his coffee conversation buzzed in the background it was the sort of coffeehouse where vast issues were hashed out and settled every day the nature of the universe the effect of the war on the history of the world whether the waitress would go home with the college kid whod propositioned her vast issues whirled through moss head too im trying to sort out whether i really give a damn about studying the law he said ah said sandburg who was also in law school you finished your first year before the war started same as i did right you know i did moss answered then it seemed important now i have a tough time caring now i guess the war made me look at the scale of things differently if you know what i mean i mean in the big picture what difference does it make whether or not i hang out my shingle and start drafting wills for wheat traders with more money than sense maybe it doesnt make any difference in the big picture his friend said it sure as hell does make a difference in the way your life goes dont you care about that me i want to be in a spot where nobody can make me pick up a springfield for the rest of my days something to that no doubt about it moss admitted he finished his coffee and waved to the waitress for another cup had she said she would go home with the student or she wouldnt try as he would moss couldnt tell but i have trouble giving a damn i have trouble giving a damn about almost everything aha fred sandburg stabbed out a forefinger he would make a formidable attorney he listened almost everything eh all right johnny my boy what do you give a damn about suddenly moss wished the coffee the waitress brought were whiskey in the officers clubs during the war hed had plenty of highproof lubrication against the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune hed needed it too he needed it now needed it and didnt have it at last slowly he said up in ontario in canada there was this girl this woman he ran out of steam oho sandburg laid that forefinger by the side of his nose was she pretty was she built his hands described an hourglass in the air yeah i guess so moss answered a puzzled tone in his voice he wasnt really quite sure she was interesting he nodded that was the right word he repeated it interesting hell with whether she was interesting said sandburg a relentlessly practical man was she interested in me moss laughed only to spit in my eye her names laura secord shes somehow related to the original who had the same name a hundred years ago and played paul revere against the usa in the war of she hates americans she told me where to head in i dont know how many times besides he added morosely shes got a husband oh bully fred sandburg made silent sardonic clapping motions you sure know how to pick em dont you sure do moss said last time i saw her was just after the canucks surrendered i drove over from orangeville where our last aerodrome was back to this little town called arthur where it had been she was keeping a farm going there she didnt know whether her husband was alive or dead she hadnt heard from him in a long timehe was in the canadian army but everything would be ready for him if he came down the road so if she was keeping the home fires burning for him what did she say to you sandburg asked moss face heated at the memory she told me she never wanted to set eyes on me again she told me she wished the canucks had shot me down she told me she wished her husband had fired the bullet that shot me down she told me she hoped the train i took back to the usa went off the rails and smashed to bits after that she got angry fred sandburg stared then started to guffaw and you call this broad interesting jesus christ johnny my boy you can go down to new mexico and marry a rattlesnake and do it cheaper youll live happier too maybe moss said probably even his grin lifted up only one corner of his mouth making it more grimace than smile but i cant get her out of my mind sandburg was just warming to his theme or you could take to drinking absinthe to forget or smoking cigarettes doped with opium or hashish then if she ever saw you again shed take pity on you because you were so pale and wasted and decadentlooking and clutch you to her bosom he leaned forward and made as if to clutch moss to his bosom funny moss said evading him funny like a crutch with so many veterans on one crutch or two these days the cliche had taken on fresh life all right all right sandburg said but what are you going to do moon about this woman the rest of your life when you have grandchildren you can talk about her the way fishermen go on the one that got away youre probably better off you know youre almost sure to be better off yeah i know moss said ive been telling myself the same thing ever since i got back to the states trouble is i cant make myself believe it what are you going to do then head back up to wherever it was in canada you said she lived sandburg shook his head that sounds like an awful lot of trouble to go through to have some girl tell you to go to hell twice he glanced over toward the waitress a pert brunette shell probably tell you to go to hell right here and if she doesnt what does this canuck gal have that shes missing theyre all the same when the lamp goes out i never thought so moss said hed never thought of going back to arthur ontario again either not seriously in musing tones he went on maybe i should id get her out of my system anyhow thats the spirit sandburg raised his coffee mug in salute the hell with courses the hell with examinations if you can only see this woman who hates your guts one more time youll die happy i expect theyll make a moving picture about it and every organ player in the country can milk the minor chords for all theyre worth oh shut up moss said but the more his friend ridiculed the idea the more it appealed to him if he felt like going up to ontario he could do that provided the occupation authorities didnt give him any trouble had he not come from a family with money he wouldnt have been studying law at northwestern in the first place leaving for a semester wouldnt be hard he wondered what his parents would say variations on the theme of you re out of your mind occurred to him maybe hed be wiser just to tell them he was going up to visit someone hed met during the war without going into too many details they might think he meant an army buddy hed have a lot less to explain afterwards if he came home unsuccessful he was not a fool im not a fool except about this he thought no matter how foolish he was when he thought about laura secord he understood the odds werent in his favor the odds werent always in his favor when he played poker either of course he generally lost money when he played poker which meant he didnt play it very often come on sandburg said after a look at his pocket watch weve got brickers lecture on courtroom defense and crossexamination tactics to go to and hes worth listening to besides he hasnt lost a case in years and if that doesnt prove he knows what hes talking about i dont know what would moss laid a quarter on the table to cover his two cups of coffee the waitress brought back fifteen cents change he left her a nickel tip as he was heading out the door he said im glad were not down at clemson or one of those other confederate universities if we were wed be paying five bucks for coffee not five cents yeah but wed be somewhere close to millionairesin confederate dollars anyhow fred sandburg said he shook his head before the war their dollar was at par with ours god only knows when it will be again theyre giving us their specie and letting the printing presses run for themselves moss said you let that go on for a while and pretty soon you take five pounds of bills to the grocery store and trade em for five pounds of beans either that or the bills start getting crowded on account of all the extra zeros they have to put on each one sandburg agreed he checked his watch again come on shake a leg were going to be late by shaking a leg they got to swift hall on time moss liked the campus with its buildings scattered among emeraldgreen lawns and the deeper tone of trees lake michigan beyond could almost have been the sea as fred sandburg had said professor bricker was an impressive lecturer not only was he a strikingly handsome man with broad shoulders and a thick head of black hair he also had a deep and musical voice and a presence an actor might have envied moss could see how juries would believe anything he said no wonder hed been a burr under the saddle of local district attorneys for years and yet however fine a lecturer bricker was jonathan moss had trouble paying attention to him today his thoughts kept wandering up to canada wondering what laura secord was doing wondering what she would say when she saw him again he would find out no doubt that was stupid he recognized as much but he was surealmost surehed do it anyway anne colletons broker looked like the very unhappy man he was it was good of you to come up to columbia when i asked he said i do appreciate it believe me i wanted to tell you in person that as of august first i shall no longer be able to represent you im sorry to hear that mr whitson anne said not altogether truthfully are you retiring altogether from your profession whitson was not a young man but not so old as that either yes and not voluntarily he answered his voice bitter as of that date i shall be declaring bankruptcy to protect myself from my creditors i doubt very much whether you or anyone else would have any use for a bankrupt broker im sorry to hear of your misfortune but anne could not resist getting in a shot of her own you might have done better if youd invested along the lines i chosethe lines about which you had some unkind things to say when i presented them to you go aheadrub it in whitson muttered anne did not dislike him enough to do any more gloating so she pretended not to hear he went on i must admit your ideas proved sounder than mine i am as i say bankrupt with holdings in worthless stocks your financial position is not as it was before the war whose is in the confederate states anne asked harshly not many folks ill tell you that the broker said but you are merely poorer than you were in the csa and especially here in south carolina thats an impressive accomplishment most plantation owners have long since gone belly up youre still in the fight who else is anne asked interested in the competition importers whitson answered steel men petroleum men in texas and louisianatheyre thriving because sequoyahs gone some of the sonoran copper kings the ones whose mines the yankees didnt reach but anybody who grew anything with negro laborcotton tobacco rice sugarcane indigohas troubles the way a stray dog has fleas cant trust em not any more anne said thats never going to be the same again thats why ive still got marshlands like a millstone around my neck who would want the place now what would anyone do with it if he bought it i havent the faintest idea whitson said but i dont know what that proves either his mouth tightened to a thin pale line the ideas i have had havent been good ones the whole country is having a rough time anne said with more sympathy than shed thought she would show its hard for anyone to prosper we need to put some heart back into ourselves but i dont know how this inflation is eating us out of house and home the broker said before long everybody will be a millionaire and everybody will be broke told you so trembled on the edge of being spoken but anne held her tongue she had told whitson so and he hadnt listened and now he was paying the price because shed converted her holdings into currencies that still meant something in terms of gold shed come through pretty well when the upturn finally arrived she would be rich againif she could wait long enough whitson said if you like miss colleton i can recommend a new broker for you i know several very able men who anne got to her feet no thank you i hope you will forgive me for saying so but your recommendation does not strike me as the ideal warrant for a mans quality whitson bit his lip i deserve that maybe youll have better luck in times to come i hope you do anne said telling more of the truth than notshe had nothing personal against the luckless broker i see you have all my papers here please give them to me now very well whitson sighed as he handed them to her i should have been listening to your investment advice not the other way round the world has turned upside down since the end of the war since the beginning of the war anne said but youre right the confederate states were on top and now were on the bottom some people are going to be content to stay on the bottom too some are going to try to see how to get back on top again what will you do mr whitson she didnt wait for an answer but swept the papers into her valise and left the brokers office as she turned around to close the door she saw him staring after her she let out a tiny sigh whitson was going to be one of the ones who stayed on the bottom for a long time his office stood only a few blocks away from the capitol anne thought about going over to see the governor but sighed again she didnt have the influence shed enjoyed before the war either not only had her fortunes suffered shed called in too many favors fighting the black reds who lurked in the swamps by the congaree long after their revolt was stamped out elsewhere shed almost had to seduce the governor to pry a machine gun loose for the militia god damn you cassius she muttered the former chief hunter at marshlands had proved a far more stubborn and resourceful foe than shed imagined any negro could shed underestimated the blacks at marshlands time and again underestimated them and let them fool her it wont happen again she muttered as she hurled the valise into the back seat of her beatup ford before the negro uprising shed driven a powerful vauxhall when the revolt broke out shed driven it up from charleston toward marshlands south of the frontthe negroes of what they called the congaree socialist republic had been able to hold a regular front for a whilea militia officer had confiscated the vauxhall for use against the black rebels shed never seen it again she wondered how many bullet holes scarred the fine coachwork these days after cranking the fords engine to rough noisy life she climbed in and drove south down the robert e lee highway from which she would eventually turn left to get to st matthews she was about thirty miles away from home a little more than an hour if she didnt have a puncture or a breakdown if she did the time might double or it might go up by some much larger factor what struck her as she rattled along in the decrepit motorcar was how still and empty the countryside felt cotton and tobacco should have been ripening in the fields and negro laborers should have been tending both crops here and there they were but so many fields were a rank tangle of weeds and vines and shrubs with no one even trying to bring in a crop on them it wasnt the way it had been it would never again be the way it had been tears stung her eyes so that she had to slow down till they clearednot that the ford could go very fast anyhow the cotton fields at marshlands looked like this these days colletons had thrived on the plantation since the end of the eighteenth century even so she was ever more tempted to cut her losses on it quit paying the exorbitant taxes and let the state of south carolina take it off her hands as far as she was concerned the state of south carolina was welcome to it the lee highway crossed the congaree on a steel suspension bridge the red rebels had damaged the bridge but hadnt managed to destroy it well before she came to the river and the swamps to either side of it anne took a revolver from the valise and laid it on the seat where she could grab it in a hurry as a force for rebellion against the government of south carolina and that of the csa the congaree socialist republic was dead not quite all the negroes had been hunted out of the swamps yet though some still made a living of sorts as bandits if bandits were lurking there they gave no sign she spotted a couple of pickaninnies fishing and passed an old black man leading a skinny swaybacked mule laboring along under some enormous burden tied to its back she thought about stopping and making the old man show her what the mule carried how many rifles and pistols had traveled through the csa in bundles like that before the uprising of too many surely in the end she drove on she felt bad about it afterwards but one person could do only so much if the old man was moving guns or explosives what was she supposed to do with him arrest him driving with one hand on the wheel and one on the pistol didnt appeal to her shoot him on the spot that did appeal to her powerfully but it wasnt so simple as it would have been before the war either she would certainly have to go to court about it which wouldnt have been certain at all before the number of negro veterans enrolled on the south carolina voting lists remained tiny the uprising during the war though showed how dangerous ignoring negro opinion could be when she got into st matthews she smiled several women on the street were wearing trousers shed started that fashion herself getting aaron rosenblum the tailor to make her several pairs so she could go into the swamps to fight the reds in clothing more convenient than an anklelength skirt these women didnt wear pants because they intended to hunt reds they wore them because one of the most prominent women in calhoun county did tom colleton chuckled when she remarked on that i had noticed it myself as a matter of fact he said gives a whole new kick to watching a pretty girl does it anne wasnt sure whether to be angry or amused she ended up a little of both thats not why i got them you know i never said it was her brother answered that doesnt make what i did say any less true though while anne digested that and finally nodded tom went on have we got any money left all things considered were doing wellas well as we can be anyhow with a certain amount of malicious pleasure she added were doing a lot better than clever mr whitson and explained how hed gone bankrupt so the brokers broke is he tom said anne made a face at him then she started to laugh thats the sort of thing you would have said back before the war youre usually more serious these days i can laugh when somebody else falls on his face in the mud tom told her laughing when im down there myself is harder laughing when the whole countrys down there is hardest of all i still dont know how were going to get back on our feet sis neither do i not with the damnyankees standing over us with a club anne said sooner or later though theyll ease up they have troubles of their own what with all their strikes and trying to hold the canadians down and socialists yelling their heads off when they get too busy at home thats when well find somebody who can help us get moving again she sighed i wish it would happen faster though iv even months after getting over the spanish influenza sam carsten knew he wasnt quite the man he had been the disease had done its best to steamroller him into the grave something like a dozen sailors aboard the uss remembrance had died many more like him remained weaker and slower than they were before they got sick he could still do his job though and do the hundreds of jobs any sailor had to do when he wasnt at his battle station and as the remembrance worked with the aeroplanes she carried learning what they could and couldnt do he occasionally found time to marvel this was one of those times he stood by the superstructure as the remembrance steamed in the north atlantic watching while a wright twodecker approached the stern a sailor with semaphore paddles directed the aeroplane toward the deck the pilot had to pay more attention to the director than to his own instincts and urges if he didnt hed end up in the drink come on sam muttered hed been watching landings for a while now just the same they made him sweat if he couldnt take them for granted what were they like for the fliers pilots were the most nonchalant men on the face of the earth but anyone who was nonchalant through one of these landings would end up dead come on on came the aeroplane smoke spurted as its wheels slammed the deck of the remembrance the hook on the bottom of the wright machines fuselage missed the first steel cable stretched across the deck to arrest its progress but caught on the second one the twodecker jerked to a halt jesus carsten turned to george moerlein whod watched the landing a few feet away from him every time they do that i think the aeroplane is going to miss the deckeither that or itll tear in half when the hook grabs it his bunkmate nodded i know what you mean it looks impossible even though weve been watching em for months as the wrights prop slowed from a blur to a stop the pilot climbed out of the aeroplane sailors with mops and buckets dashed over and started swabbing down the deck with oil and gasoline spilling all the time swabbing was a more serious business than on most ships sam said the thing i really fear is one of em coming in low and smashing right into the stern hasnt happened yet thank god yeah that wouldnt do anybody any good moerlein agreed could happen too especially if somebodys coming in with his aeroplane shot to hell and goneor if he just makes a mistake what i hope is we never come into range of a battleships big guns carsten said taking a hit is bad enough any which wayive done thatbut taking a hit here with all the gasoline were carrying wed go straight to the moon or maybe five miles past it itd be over in a hurry anyhow his bunkmate answered before sam could say he didnt find that reassuring george moerlein went on but thats one of the reasons were carrying all these aeroplanes to keep battlewagons from getting into gunnery range in the first place carsten stamped the flight deck which was timber lain over steel we cant be the only navy working on aeroplane carriers ive heard tell the japs are moerlein said dont know it for a fact but ive heard it it wouldnt surprise me wouldnt surprise me either not even a little bit sam said i was in the battle of the three navies out west of the sandwich islands those little yellow bastards are tougher than anybody ever gave em credit for moerlein looked sour and they just walked away from the war free and clear too the rebs are paying england and france are paying russias gone to hell in a handbasket but japan said well all right if nobody else on our sides left standing were done too and we couldnt do anything but say all right charliesee you again some day we will too carsten said i was just a kid when they took the philippines away from spain right after the turn of the century and now weve taken the sandwich islands away from englandi was there for that aboard the dakota so theyre looking our way and were looking their way and nobodys sitting between us any more thatd be a fight all right all that ocean aeroplanes whizzing around us bombing them and trying to keep them from bombing us moerlein got a faraway look in his eye so did sam hell if both sides have aeroplane carriers you could fight a battle without ever seeing the other fellows ships that would be pretty strange moerlein said but i guess it could happen sure it could sam said and youd want to sink the other bastards aeroplane carriers just as fast as you could because if he didnt have any aeroplanes left he couldnt stop your battleships from doing whatever they wanted to do he stamped on the flight deck again and if the aeroplane carrier is the ship you have to sink first that makes the remembrance the most important ship in the whole navy right now for a moment he felt almost like a prophet in the middle of a vision of the future he also felt pleased with himself for having had the sense to figure out that aeroplanes were the coming thing and grateful to commander grady for having brought him to the remembrance no matter how ugly she was then something else occurred to him he hurried away wheres the fire at george moerlein called after him he didnt answer but hurried down a hatch to go below he guessed grady would be checking one sponson or another and sure enough found him in the third one into which he poked his head the officer was testing the elevation screw on the gun there and talking about it in a low voice with the gunners mate who commanded the crew for that sponson sam stood at attention and waited to be noticed eventually commander grady said youll want to make sure of the threads there reynolds good thing were not likely to be sailing into combat any time soon he turned to sam what can i do for you carsten ive been thinking sir sam began a smile spread across gradys rabbity features far be it from me to discourage such a habit and what have you been thinking weve taken the confederates battleships away from them sir and weve taken away their submersibles carsten said what do the agreements weve made with them say about aeroplane carriers so far as i know they dont say anything commander grady said shouldnt they sir sam asked in some alarm what if the rebs built a whole raft of these ships and grady held up a hand i understand what youre saying if the remembrance turns out to be as important as we think she is then youll be right if she doesnt though he shrugged there are a lot of people in philadelphia who think were pouring money down a rathole theyre crazy sam blurted i think so too but how do you go about proving it grady asked we need to have something to do to prove what were worth in any case i believe the answer to your question is no as i said if the confederate states want to build aeroplane carriers they are not forbidden to do so when the agreements were framed no one took this class of ship seriously thats too bad carsten said i think so too grady repeated nothing i can do about it though nothing you can do about it either carsten looked southwest in the direction of the confederacy wonder how long itll be before the rebels have one of these babies then he looked east wonder how long itll be before england and france do too itll take the rebs a while and the frogs too i expect commander grady said were sitting on the csa and kaiser bill is sitting on france england i dont know about england they didnt have the war brought home to them not the way the confederates and the french did yeah they got hungry and the royal navy finally ended up fighting out of its weight but they werent whippedyou know what i mean yes sir sam said grady went on as if he hadnt spoken and from australia through india and africa theyre still cocks o the walk if they decide they want to get even and they find some friends his laugh was anything but mirthful sounds like the way we won this last war doesnt it carsten we decided we were going to get even and we cozied up to the german empire i hope to god it doesnt work for them ten years down the line or twenty or thirty yes sir sam said again i guess we just have to do our best to keep ahead of them thats all he sighed i wonder where all this ends or if it ever ends only way i can see it ending is if we ever figure out how to blow a whole country clean off the map grady said he slapped sam on the back i dont figure thatll happen any time soon if it ever does well have work to do for as long as we want it the two of us thatd be good sir carsten said equably thats the big reason i wanted to transfer to the remembrance as soon as they bombed us off argentina i knew aeroplanes were going to stay important for a long long time youre a sharp bird carsten grady said i was glad to see you get that promotion at the end of youre too sharp to have stayed an able seaman for as long as you did if you were as pushy as youre sharp youd be an officer by now an officer me carsten started to laugh but commander grady wasnt the first person whod told him he thought like one he shrugged i like things the way they are pretty well ive got enough trouble telling myself what to do let alone giving other people orders grady chuckled theres more to being an officer than giving orders though i dont suppose it looks that way to the ratings on the receiving end i think youve got what it takes if you want to apply yourself really sir sam asked and commander grady nodded sam had never aspired to anything more than chief petty officer not even in his wildest dreams now he did hed known a few mustangs officers whod come up through the ranks doing that wasnt impossible but it wasnt easy either how much did he want it did he want it at all have to think about that jake featherston rubbed brilliantine into his hair then combed a part that might have been scribed with a ruler he looked at himself in the tiny mirror above the sink in his room he wasnt handsome but he didnt figure he would ever be handsome hed do he put on a clean shirt and a pair of pants that had been pressed in the not too impossibly distant past again he didnt look as if he were about to speak before the confederate congress but he didnt want to speak before the confederate congress except to tell all the fat cats in there where to go he grinned he was going to tell some fat cats where to go today too but they werent so fat as they wanted to be nor so fat as they thought they were he donned a cloth workingmans cap put his pistol on his belt and left the room fewer people bothered wearing weapons on the streets in richmond than had been true in the first desperate weeks after the great war ended but he was a long way from the only man sporting a pistol or carrying a tredegar nobody could be sure what would happen next and a good many people didnt care to find out the hard way featherston hurried down seventh toward the james river the back room in the saloon where the freedom party had met wasnt big enough these days but a rented hall a couple of doors down still sufficed for their needs after meetings the party veterans would repair to the saloon and drink and talk about the good old days when everyone had always stood shoulder to shoulder with everyone else sometimes jake was part of those gatherings sometimes he wasnt after tonight either he would be or he wouldnt have anything to do with the party any more he saw no middle way but then hed never been a man who looked for the middle way in anything he did a small crowd had gathered on the sidewalk in front of the meeting hall men in caps and straw hats crowding around the doorway jostling to get in they parted like the red sea to let jake by tell the truth tonight featherston somebody called tell everybody the whole truth dont you worry about that jake answered i dont know how to do anything else you wait and see several people clapped their hands but somebody said you dont want to be party chairman you want to be king is what you want whirling to turn on the man jake snapped thats a goddamn lie bill turley and you know it goddamn well what i want is for the freedom party to go somewhere if it wants to go my way fine if it doesnt itll go however it goes and ill go somewhere else no hard feelings no matter what hed said a moment before that was a thumping lie hard feelings were what made jake featherston what he was if the freedom party rejected him tonight he would never forget and never forgive he never forgot and never forgave any slight and this rejection if it came would be far worse than a mere slight inside people buzzed and pointed as he walked up the aisle toward the long table on the raised stage at the front of the hall anthony dresser already sat up there along with several other party officials ernie london the treasurer who was almost wide enough to need two chairs ferdinand koenig the secretary a headbreaker despite his fancy first name and bert mcwilliams the vice chairman a man who could be inconspicuous in almost any company dresser london and mc williams all wore business suits of varying ages and degrees of shininess koenig like jake was in his shirtsleeves as jake sat down at the table he looked out over the audience it was a shirtsleeves crowd he saw only a handful of jackets and cravats and vests he smiled but only to himself dresser and his chums no doubt thought they looked impressive the crowd out there though would think they were stuffed shirts and they are jake muttered to himself god damn me to hell and gone but they are anthony dresser rapped a gavel on the tabletop this meeting of the freedom party will now come to order he said and turned to ferdinand koenig the secretary will read the minutes of last weeks meeting and bring us up to date on correspondence thank you mr chairman koenig said in a rumbling baritone jake featherston listened with half an ear as he droned through the minutes which were approved without amendments as for correspondence weve had a good many letters from north and south carolina and from georgia concerning joining the party and forming local chapters this as a result of mr featherstons speaking tour weve also had inquiries from mississippi and alabama and even one from texas these based on newspaper stories about the speaking tour he displayed a fat sheaf of envelopes dresser gave him a sour look kindly keep yourself to the facts mr koenig save the editorials for the papers he nodded to ernie london before we proceed to new business the treasurer will report on the finances of the party thank you mr chairman londons voice was surprisingly high and thin to be emerging from such a massive man as far as money goes we are not in the worst situation our present balance is which is an increase of over last week i would like that better if it were in dollars from before then we would have ourselves a very nice little piece of change but even now it is better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick question jake featherston said sharply where did all that new money come from dresser brought the gavel down sharply that doesnt matter now only thing that matters is how much money weve got he banged the gavel again and now if nobody else has got anything to say well get on with the new business we mr chairman i reckon jakes got himself a point ferdinand koenig said especially on account of the new business youve got in mind bang no sir dresser said angry now i said it doesnt matter and my ruling stands by jesus mr chairman i appeal that ruling to a vote from the floor jake said he hated parliamentary procedure but hed started learning it anyhow even if he did think it was only a way to cheat by the numbers second koenig said never mind dresser said in a low furious voice he wasnt ready for a floor vote then jake wasnt nearly sure he was ready for a floor vote either when one came he wanted it to be for all the marbles dresser said go ahead ernie tell em what they want to know so we can get on with things reluctantly london said some came from dues some came from contributions from people who heard featherstons speaking tour how much came from each jake demanded fat as he was ernie london looked as if he wished he were invisible i dont have the figures showing the split right here with me he said at last hell of a treasurer you are featherston jeered all right let me ask you an easy one did i bring in more or less than half the weeks take you tell me you dont recollect ill call you a liar to your face everybody knows bookkeepers like playing with numbers they dont forget em most unwillingly london said it was more than half thank you ernie jake beamed at him then nodded to anthony dresser go on ahead tony its your show for now he put a small but unmistakable stress on the last two words all right then dresser looked around the room no doubt gauging his support featherston was doing the same he didnt know how this would come out he knew how it would come out if there were any justice in the world but that had been in short supply for a while now if there were any justice in the world wouldnt the csa have won the war maybe the same sorts of thoughts were going through anthony dressers mind as he banged the gavel down once more and announced new business mr chairman bert mcwilliams voice was more memorable than his face but not much when dresser recognized him he went on mr chairman i move that we remove jake featherston from his position as head of propaganda for the freedom party second ernie london said at once jake had expected london to bring the motion and mcwilliams to second it otherwise he was unsurprised it has been moved and seconded to remove jake featherston as head of propaganda anthony dresser said ill lead off the discussion he rapped loudly with the gavel several times and we will have order and quiet from the members unless they have been recognized to speak order bang bang when something not too far from order had been restored dresser resumed i dont deny jake has done some good things for the partydont get me wrong but hes done us a good deal of harm too and its not the kind of harm thats easily fixed hes taken all the great things we stand for and boiled them down to hang the generals and hang the niggers not that they dont need hanging mind you but there are so many other things to get the country going again that need doing too and he never talks about a one of them people get the wrong idea about us you see london and mcwilliams followed with similar speeches out in the hard uncomfortable seats that filled the hall the freedom party members were silent listening judging confidence surged through featherston even here when they should be doing everything to crush him his opponents beat around the bush and tried to see all sides of the question he would never make that mistake mr chairman he said can i speak for myself or are you just going to railroad me altogether warily dresser said go ahead jake have your say then we vote right featherston said tightly he looked out at the crowd now is the time to fish or cut bait he said the reason im head of propaganda is that im the only man up here people can listen to without falling asleep that got him a laugh anthony dresser sputtering angrily tried to gavel it down and failed im the one who brings in the moneyernie said so himself and ill tell you whyi keep it simple thats what propaganda is all about i make people want to support us i dont say one thing monday and another thing tuesday and something else on wednesday like i say i keep it simple he took a deep breath i shake things up i make the people in high places sweat thats the other thing propaganda is for folksto show people your way is better so here it is you can go on with me and see how much we can shake loose together or you can throw me out and spend your time pounding each other on the back on account of itll be a cold day in hell before you see any more new members he rounded on anthony dresser in tones of contemptuous certainty he said mr chairman i call the question dresser stared the scales suddenly fallen from his eyes you dont want to be head of propaganda he stammered you you want to head the party jake grinned hiding his own unease where dresser let his show i call the question he repeated licking his lips dresser said in favor of removing jake featherston somewhere between a quarter and a third of the men in the hall raised their hands in a voice like ashes dresser said opposed the rest of the hands flew high so did a great shout of triumph the motion is not carried dresser choked out mr chairman ferdinand koenig said and dresser was rash enough to recognize the party secretary koenig went on mr chairman i move that you step down and we make jake featherston chairman of the freedom party another great shout rose in it were two dozen cries of secondmaybe more featherston and koenig grinned at each other as anthony dresser presided over voting himself out of office in that glorious moment jake felt the world turned only because his hands worked its axis he had his chance now he didnt know what he would make of it not yet but it was there stephen douglas martin looked at his son i wish you wouldnt do this he said worry in his voice i know chester martin answered youve got to understand thoughyou have a place the way the bosses are acting these days ill never have one not unless i take it for myself his father pointed to the bulge of the pistol behind his belt you wont get it with that i wont get it any other way martin said stubbornly i dont aim to shoot firstim not that stupidbut im not stupid enough to stand around and watch my friends on the picket lines get shot down like dogs either if theres no trouble fine but if those goons start banging away at me im not going to run like a rabbit not any more his father shook his head a troubled gesture youve been listening to the socialists again if i never see another red flag itll be too soon you dont get it pa chester said impatient with the ignorance of the older generation if it werent for the socialists nobodyd make any kind of decent moneythe bosses would have it all unending labor strife since hed come home from the war had eroded his lifelong faith in the democratic party youre going to end up on a blacklist his father said gloomily then you wont have any work at all no matter how the strikes turn out i wont have any steel work maybe chester said with a shrug one way or another though ill get along theres plenty of things i can do if i have to one of em or another is bound to work out im a white man i pull my weight aahhh stephen douglas martin made a disgusted noise youre in it for the glory i remember the red flags flying back in the s too and the battles and the blood in the streets it was all foolishness if you ask me glory chester martin laughed bitterly he unbuttoned his left cuff and rolled the sleeve high to show the scar a confederate bullet had left on his upper arm theres no such thing as glory near as i can tell if the machine guns didnt kill it the artillery did teddy roosevelt promised us a square deal but i dont see him delivering if i have to go out into the streets to get it ill do thatand to hell with glory aahhh his father repeated well go on then since thats what youre bound and determined to do i only hope you come back in one piece thats all youre playing for keeps out there chester nodded the thought did not bother him or not unduly hed been playing for keeps since his first comrade got hung up on confederate barbed wire and shot just inside the virginia line back in august he said what was the war about if it wasnt about having a better life after it was over i dont see that not for me i dont not without this fight im still here in the old room i had before i went into the army for heavens sake i buried one son chester when the scarlet fever took your brother hank his father said heavily it tore my heart in two and what it did to your mother if i had to do it twice i dont know how id get by afterwards chester martin slapped his father on the back itll be all right i know what im doing and i know why im doing it that wasnt the bravado he might have shown in the days before conscription pulled him into the army instead it was a mans sober assessment of risk and need his father said nothing more his father plainly saw there was nothing more to say with a last nod chester left the flat went down to the corner and waited for the trolley that would take him into the heart of toledo and into the heart of the struggle against the steelmill owners the strikers by now had their own headquarters a rented hall a couple of blocks away from the long row of steelworks whose stacks belched clouds of black sulfurous smoke into the sky the hall had its own forward guards and then a stronger force of defenders in red armbands closer to it most of the strikes leaders had served in the great war they understood the need to defend a position in depth an unusual number of trash cans and kegs and benches lined the street by the hall if the toledo police tried to raid the place the strikers could throw up barricades in a hurry theyd already done that more than once when their struggle with the owners heated up for now though motorcars whizzed past the hall for now too blueuniformed police made their way past the strikers guards the men in blue strolled along as if they were in full control of the neighborhood only a few of them strolled along at any one time though a tacit understanding between the leaders of the strike and city hall let the police keep that illusion of control provided they did not try to turn it into reality the agreement was not only tacit but also fragile when things heated up on the picket lines the cops drew near at their peril what do you say chester albert bauer called when martin walked into the hall the stocky steelworker made a fist heres to the revolutionthe one you said we didnt need ahh shut up al martin answered with a sour grin or if you dont want to shut up tell me you were never wrong in your whole life cant do it bauer admitted but ill tell you this i dont think i was ever wrong on anything this important teach me to be like you then martin said jeering a little youre learning bauer was imperturbable you started out mystified by the capitalists same as so many do but youre learning before too long youll see them like they really are nothing but exploiters who need to be swept onto the ash heap of history so the proletariat can advance i dont know anything about the ash heap of history martin said i hope some of them get swept away in the elections theyre only a couple of months off that would send the country the right kind of message so it would bauer said so it would that means we have to send the country the right kind of message between now and election day you mean you dont want me to go out and start taking potshots at the ugly blue bastards whove been taking potshots at us martin said something like that yeah bauers eyes went to the pistol concealedbut not well enoughin the waistband of martins trousers we arent out to start any trouble now if the police start it well give them as much as they want but the papers have to be able to say they went after us first all right that made sense to martin he headed over to the neat rows of picket signs choosing one that read a square deal means a square meal he shouldered it as if it were a springfield and headed out toward the line the striking steelworkers had thrown up around the nearest plant by then the scabs who kept the plant running had already gone in martin was sure theyd gone in under a hail of curses perhaps they hadnt gone in under a hail of rocks and bottles today that was the sort of thing that touched off battles with the police and everything seemed quiet for the time being as it had on the roanoke front when both sides were gearing up to have a go at each other martin marched along the sidewalk toledo police and company guards kept a close eye on the strikers the police looked hot and bored martin was hot and bored too sweat ran off him in rivers the day was muggy without a hint of a breeze he kept a wary eye on the company guards they looked hot too but they also looked like great danes quivering on the end of leashes ever so eager to bite anything that came near scablovers the strikers taunted them whores goons stinking sons of bitches your mothers were whores the guards shouted back your fathers were niggers just like the ones who rose up in the csa shut up the cops shouted over and over shut the hell up all of you they didnt want to have to do anything but stand there brawling on a day like this was more trouble than it was worth chester martin knew a little sympathy for them but only a little he cursed the company guards along with everybody else on the picket line socialist party workers brought the picketers cheese sandwiches to eat while they marched in the middle of the afternoon a picketer and a cop keeled over from the heat within a few minutes of each other no company guards keeled over they had all the food and cold water they wanted shiftchanging time neared chester martin tensed the picketers shouts which had grown perfunctory turned loud and fierce and angry once more as the scabs escorted by guards and police both left the steelworks back away a policeman yelled at the strikers martin had heard that shout so often he was sick to death of it the cop shouted again anyhow back away you men or youll be sorry sometimes the striking steelworkers would back away sometimes they would surge forward and attack the scabs regardless of the cops and goons protecting them martin had been in several pitched battlesthat was what the newspapers called them anyway to a man whod known real combat they didnt rate the name either the reporters had managed to sit out the war on the sidelines or they cared more about selling papers than telling the truth maybe both those things were true at once it wouldnt have surprised martin a bit today nothing untoward happened the strikers jeered and cursed the scabs and called join us more than a few former scabs had quit their jobs and started on the picket lines no one threw a stone or a horse turd this afternoon though no one started shooting either although martin was sure he was a long way from the only striker carrying a pistol having been through more gunfire than hed ever wanted to imagine he was anything but sorry not to land in it again he trudged back to the strikers hall turned in his sign and dug a nickel out of his pocket for trolley fare his father and mother would be glad to see him home in one piece he wondered about his sister from some of the stories sue told her boss exploited her too as he stood on the streetcorner he shook his head in slow wonder the bosses are too stupid to know it he murmured but theyre turning a whole bunch of good democrats into revolutionaries scipio had hoped he would never hear of the freedom party again after that one rally in may park he hadnt thought such a hope too unreasonable hed never heard of it till that rally with any luck the socalled party would turn out to be one angry white man going from town to town on the train the times were ripe for such cranks but as summer slowly gave way to fall the freedom party opened an office in augusta the office was nowhere near the terry even had more than a handful of negroes been eligible to vote the freedom party would not have gone looking for their support scipio found out about the office in a oneparagraph story on an inside page of the augusta constitutionalist he showed the story to his boss a grizzled negro named erasmus who ran a fish market that doubled as a friedfish cafe erasmus hed seen was a shrewd businessman but read only slowly and haltingly mumbling the words under his breath when at last he finished he looked over the tops of his halfglasses at scipio aint such a bad thing xerxes i dont reckon he said the buckra in this here party hates we scipio protested after close to a year in augusta hed grown as used to his alias as he was to his right name they gets anywheres aint gwine do we no good erasmus peered at him over those silly little spectacles again most o the white folks hates us he answered matteroffactly these ones here at least theys honest about it reckon id sooner know who cant stand me than have folks tell me lies that made a certain amount of sensebut only scipio thought a certain amount the buckra wants to be on top sure enough he said but these here freedom party buckra they wants to be on top on account o they wants we in de grave six feets under de ground his boss shook his head white folks aint that stupid we dead an buried who gwine do their for work them you answer me dat an then ill worry bout this here freedom party huh scipio said he thought for a little while then laughed a bit sheepishly mebbe yous right caint you jus see de po buckra out in de cotton fields wid de overseer yellin an cursin at they to move they lazy white backsides lawd have mercy i wish to jesus i could see me that erasmus said i pay money to see that but it aint gwine happen white folks aint about to get their soft hands all blistered an dirty an wes safe enough because o that a negro in overalls came in and sat down at one of the half dozen rickety little tables in front of the counter where fish lay on ice erasmus pointed never mind this stupid stuff we cant do nothin about anyways get yourself over there an see what pythagoras wants to eat fried catfish an cornbread the customer said as scipio came up to him lemonade on the side i gets it for you scipio answered he turned to see whether erasmus had heard the order or hed have to relay it his boss had already plucked a catfish from the ice an empty spot showed where it had been a moment later hot lard sizzled as the fish after a quick dip into egg batter went into the frying pan scipio poured lemonade and cut a chunk from the pan of moist yellow cornbread erasmus had baked that morning he took the lemonade over to pythagoras by the time he got back erasmus had slapped the fried catfish onto the plate with the cornbread he also dipped up a ladleful of greens from a castiron pot on the back of the stove and plopped them down alongside the fish he dont ask for no greens scipio said quietly once he sees em he decide he wants em erasmus said he been comin in here bettern ten years you reckon i dont know what he wants without another word scipio took the plate over to pythagoras he had spent years learning to anticipate anne colletons needs and to minister to them even before she knew she had them if erasmus had done the same with his regular customers how could scipio argue with him and sure enough pythagoras waved to erasmus and ate the greens with every sign of enjoyment he ordered a slab of peach pie for dessert only after hed polished that off did he turn a wary eye on scipio and ask whats all that come to thirtyfi dollars scipio answered and waited for the sky to fall pythagoras only shrugged sighed and pulled a fat wad of banknotes from a hip pocket he peeled off two twenties and set them on the table don fret yourself none about no change he said as he stood up foe the war i dont reckon i never had thirtyfive dollars not all at the same time money come easy now but lord it sure do go easy too he lifted his cloth cap in salute to erasmus then went back out onto the street do jesus scipio said he sure enough right about dat erasmus was paying him a week after his latest raise and feeding him dinner every day besides despite what would have looked like spectacular wealth in scipio remained just one more poor negro in the terry erasmus said it aint all bad couple weeks ago i done took me a thousand dollars down to the bank so i could pay off the note on my house should have seen them white bankers fuss an flopjus like a catfish on a hook they was his reminiscent grin showed a couple of missing front teeth wasnt nothin they could do about it though moneys money aint that right he laughed so did scipio moneys money he agreed and laughed again these days the confederate dollar would scarcely buy what a penny had bought before the war for anyone in debt cheap money was a godsend for those who werent it was a disaster or at best a challenge to make last weeks salary pay for this weeks groceries the eatery got more sitdown trade as afternoon darkened into evening more women though threw down brown banknotes for fish they carried away wrapped in newspaper to fry for their husbands and brothers and children scipio watched erasmus throw the story about the freedom party around a fat catfish that a fat woman with a bandanna on her head took off under her arm like a loaf of bread he wasnt sorry to see the story go he wished somebody god perhapswould use the freedom party itself to wrap fish whatever else you said about the skinny man who spoke for the party hed been terribly earnest hed believed every word of what he was saying if that didnt make him all the more frightening scipio didnt know what would at last erasmus said might as well go on home xerxes dont reckon wes gwine get much more trade tonight i see you inthemornin all right scipio left the little market and cafe and headed back to his roominghouse he kept an eye open as he hurried along the street lights in the terry were few and far between the white men who ran augusta didnt waste a lot of money on the colored part of town if anybody was thinking of equalizing the wealth in an altogether unmarxist way scipio wanted to see him before being seen no one troubled him on the way to the roominghouse no one troubled him when he got there either evenin xerxes the landlady said when he walked up the stairs and into the front hall not so hot like it has been is it no maam scipio said hed been paying the rent regularly for some time now he was working steady hours too which made him a good bet to be able to go on paying the rent under those circumstances no wonder the landlady sounded friendly he went on up to his neat little thirdfloor room got out of his white shirt and black pants and threw on a cheap flimsy cotton robe over his drawers then barefoot he padded down to the bathroom at the end of the hall being butler at marshlands had left him as fastidious about his person as he was about his surroundings which meant he bathed more often than most of the people who shared the roominghouse with him but when he tried the bathroom door it was locked a startled splash came from within and a womans voice whos there scipios ears heated had he been white he would have blushed its xerxes miss bathsheba from up the hall he said fs right sorry to sturb you dont fret yourself none she said im just about done more splashes he judged she was getting out of the cramped tin tub he smiled a little letting his imagination peek through the closed door in a couple of minutes that door opened out came bathsheba a pleasantlooking woman in her early thirties scipio thought she had a little white blood in her though not enough to be called a mulatto she wore a robe with a gaudy print of the same cheap cotton cloth as his she didnt hold it closed as well as she might have at marshlands scipio had mastered the art of looking without seeming to he got himself a discreet eyeful now see you later xerxes bathsheba said and headed up the hall past him he turned his head to watch her go she looked back at him over her shoulder her eyes sparkled well well scipio murmured he hurried into the bathroom ran the tub half full and bathed as fast as he could he would have bathed in a hurry anyhow sitting down in a tub of cold water was a long way from a sensual delight now though he had an extra incentive or hoped he did he went back to his room almost at a trot and put on a fresh shirt and a pair of trousers have to take the laundry out soon he thought he started out the door again then checked himself when he did leave he was carrying a flat pint bottle of whiskey he didnt do a lot of drinking but there were times he knocked on the door to bathshebas room that you xerxes she asked when he admitted it she opened the door then shut it after him she was still wearing that robe and still not bothering to hold it closed very well she pointed at the whiskey bottle what you got there her voice was arch she knew perfectly well what he hadand why too wonder if you wants to take a nip with me scipio said by way of reply bathsheba got a couple of mismatched glasses and sat down at one end of a ratty sofa when scipio sat down too close beside her he contrivedor maybe she didto brush his leg against hers she didnt pull away he poured a healthy shot of whiskey into each glass they drank and talked neither one of them in a hurry after a while scipio slipped his arm around her she leaned her head on his shoulder he set down his glass turned toward her and tilted her face up for a kiss then his free hand slid inside her robe he rapidly discovered she was naked under it bathsheba laughed at what must have been his startled expression i was hopin you might stop by she said sweet thing i aint stopped scipio said i aint hardly even started he lowered his mouth to a darknippled breast she pressed her hand to the back of his head urging him on his breath caught in his throat he needed no urging these days the lower east side in new york city felt strange to flora hamburger that it felt strange was strange itself shed lived her whole life there till shed gone off to philadelphia to take her seat in congress at the start of now as october yielded to november she was home again campaigning for a second term but though shed visited the lower east side several times since this long campaign swing forcibly brought home to her how much shed been away everything seemed shabby and cramped and packed tighter with people than a tin of sardines was stuffed with little fish things surely hadnt changed much in less than two years but shed taken them for granted before she didnt any more her postersred and black with vote socialist vote hamburger in both english and yiddishwere almost everywhere in the fourteenth ward and especially in the centre market across the street from the socialist party headquarters her district was solidly socialist the democratic candidate an amiable nonentity named marcus krauskopf had for all practical purposes thrown in the sponge the democrats hadnt been able to win two years before even with an appointed incumbent now that flora held the advantage of incumbency they looked to be saving their efforts for places where they had a chance to do better flora was not the sort who took anything for granted she stood on a keg of nails and addressed the people who crowded into the centre market even if many of them were after pickled tomatoes or needles or smoked whitefish not speeches what have we got from our great victory dead men maimed men men who cant get work because the capitalists care more for their profits than for letting people earn a proper living that was the war the democrats gave you this is the peace the democrats are giving you is it what you want some people in the market shouted no about as many though went on about their business most of themmost who were citizens at any ratewould vote when the time came theyd known too much oppression to throw away the chance to have a say in government the united states offered them if you want to help the capitalists youll vote for the democrats flora went on if you want to help yourselves youll vote for me i hope you vote for me her breath smoked as she talked the day was raw with ragged gray clouds scudding across the sky people sneezed and coughed as they went from one market stall to the next the spanish influenza wasnt nearly so bad as it had been the winter before but it hadnt gone away either when flora stepped down from the keg of nails herman bruck reached out a hand to help steady her bruck was dapper in an overcoat of the very latest cut not because he was rich but because he came from a family of master tailors fine speech he said very fine speech he didnt want to let go of her hand her being away hadnt made him any less interested in her it had made her much less interested in him not that shed ever been very interested next to hosea blackford he was a barely housebroken puppy freeing herself flora said lets go back to the offices i want to make sure well have all the pollwatchers well need out on the fifth she was confident the socialists would but it gave her an excuse to move and to keep bruck moving the party offices were above a butchers shop max fleischmann the butcher came out of his doorway and spoke in yiddish ill vote for you miss hamburger thank you mr fleischmann flora answered genuinely touchedthe butcher was or had been a staunch democrat his vote meant a lot to her in a slightly different way it also meant a lot to herman bruck as he went upstairs with flora he said if people like fleischmann are voting for you youll win in a walk well know tuesday night flora said inside the office people greeted her like the old friend she was a term in congress slipped away and for a little while she was just the agitator she had been before congressman myron zuckermans tragic accidental death made her run to fill his shoes and bring the seat back to the socialist party everyone cheered when bruck reported what max fleischmann had said maria tresca remarked if we keep on like this in the democrats wont bother to run anybody at all in this district any more than the republicans do now the secretary was a lone italian in an office full of jews but probably the most ardent socialist thereand by now not the least fluent in yiddish either maybe in alevai in the white house herman bruck said softly silence fell while people thought about that when teddy roosevelt rode the crest of the wave after winning the great war such dreams from a socialist would have been only dreams and pipe dreams at that now with the cost of the war clearer with the strife that followedmaybe the dream could turn real flora did check the roster of pollwatchers and suggested some changes and additions if you want something done right do it yourself she thought after everything satisfied her she headed back to the flat where shed lived most of her life the years on the floor of congress had sharpened her debating she had no trouble discouraging bruck from walking along with her coming in through the door reminded her anew of how much her life had changed the apartment where she lived alone in philadelphia was far bigger than this one which housed her parents two brothers two sisters and a toddler nephew and which had housed her as well it hadnt seemed particularly crowded before she went away everyone she knew lived the same way and sometimes took in boarders to help make ends meet now she knew there were other possibilities her sisters sophie and esther helped her mother in the kitchen the smell of beefandbarley soup rising from the pot on the stove mingled with the scent of her fathers pipe tobacco to make the odor of home her brothers david and isaac bent over a chess board at one corner of the diningroom table all was as it had been there too save for the crutch on the floor by davids chair david moved a knight and looked smug isaac grunted as if in pain looking up from the board he consciously noticed flora for the first time though she hadnt been particularly quiet hello he said got my conscription notice today he was eighteen two years younger than his brother you knew it was coming flora said and isaac nodded everyone put in his two years flora quietly thanked the god in whom her marxist exterior did not believe that isaac would serve in peacetime by the way davids face twisted for a moment that thought was going through his mind too how does the leg feel she asked him he slapped it the sound it made was nothing like that of flesh closer to furniture not too bad he said i manage i only need one leg for a sewingmachine treadle and it doesnt much matter which at that guilt rose up and smote flora seeing it her brother said i didnt mean to give you a hard time its just the way things are thats all a fresh puff of smoke rose from behind the daily forward their father was reading abraham hamburger said its usually not a good idea to say anything that makes you explain yourself afterwards i wish more congressmen would pay attention to that advice father flora said which caused fresh smoke signals to rise from behind the yiddish newspaper little yossel reisen grabbed flora by the leg and gravely said wowa the closest he could come to her name then he walked on unsteady feet to sophie and said mama that he had down solid sophie reisen stirred the soup then picked him up yossels father after whom he was named had never seen him hed been killed in virginia long before the baby was born had he not got sophie in a family way they probably wouldnt have been married before he met a bullet when supper reached the table the tastes of home were as familiar as the smell afterwards flora helped her mother with the dishes you will win again sarah hamburger said with calm assurance she would have thought the same had flora reckoned herself out of the running as things were flora nodded yes i think i will she answered and her mother beamed sarah hamburger had known it all along going to sleep that night was a fresh trial for flora shed got used to dozing off in quiet surroundings queer as the notion would have struck her before she went to congress the racket in the apartment the sort of noise that had once lulled her now set her teeth on edge because she wasnt accustomed to it any more even having to answer esthers good night struck her as an imposition she stumped hard through the last few days of the campaign on tuesday the fifth she voted at public school the socialist pollwatcher tipped his cap to her his democratic opposite number did not raise his expensive black homburg then it was back to socialist party headquarters to wait for the polls to close in the district and across the country as the night lengthened telephone lines and telephone clickers began bringing in reports by the third set of numbers from her district she knew she was going to beat marcus krauskopf her lead was close to two to one well before midnight krauskopf read the writing on the wall and telephoned to concede mazeltov he said graciously now that youve won go right on being the conscience of the house they need one there believe me thank you very much she said you ran a good race that wasnt quite true but matched his graciousness i did what i could she could almost hear him shrug over the wire but youve made a name for yourself its a socialist district anyhow and i dont think this is a democratic year as if to underscore that maria tresca exclaimed we just elected a socialist in the twentyeighth district in pennsylvania where is that anyhow people looked at maps after a minute or so herman bruck said its way up in the northwestern part of the state weve never elected a socialist congressman from around there before too many farmers not enough miners maybe the people really have had enough of the democratic party even if they are finally fed up its taken them much too long to get that way maria said as far as she was concerned the proletarian revolution was welcome to start tomorrow or even tonight the later it got the more returns came in from the west the first numbers from dakota showed hosea blackford handily ahead in his district a sound man herman bruck said sound half the time he sounds like a democrat maria tresca said darkly but even her ideological purity melted in the face of the gains the socialists were making a couple of districts in and just outside toledo that had never been anything but democratic were going socialist tonight the same thing happened in illinois and michigan and eventually in distant california too is it a majority flora asked a question she hadnt thought she would need tonight shed been optimistic going into the election but there was a difference between optimism and cockeyed optimism except tonight maybe there wasnt i dont know herman bruck sounded like a man doing his best to restrain astonished awe a lot of these races are still close but it could be he looked toward a map where hed been coloring socialist districts red it really could be every time cincinnatus driver got downwind of the kentucky smoke house spit gushed into his mouth he couldnt help it apicius wood ran the best barbecue joint in kentucky very possibly the best in the usa negroes from the neighborhood came to the kentucky smoke house so did covingtons whites and so did the men whod come down from the other side of the ohio since the stars and stripes replaced the stars and bars atop the city hall nobody turned up his nose at food like that luculluslucullus wood now that his father apicius like cincinnatus had taken a surnamewas turning a pigs carcass above a pit filled with hickory wood and basting the meat with a sauce an angel had surely brought down from heaven he nodded to cincinnatus aint seen you here for a while he remarked what you want cincinnatus stretched out his hands in the direction of the pit for a moment he wanted nothing more than to revel in the warmth that came from it the weather outside held a promise of winter i want to talk to your pa he answered as he began to warm up himself lucullus made a sour face why aint i surprised on account of you know me cincinnatus said ill be damned if i know how you can look like you done bit into a green persimmon when youre takin a bath in the best smell in the world only thing i smell when you come around here is trouble lucullus said he never missed a beat in turning the carcass or basting it with a bitter laugh cincinnatus answered thatd be funny except it aint i get into trouble around here its trouble your pa put me in nowhe let his voice roughencan i see him or not lucullus wood was harder to lean on than he had been he was twenty now or maybe a year past and had confidence in himself as a man even so a show of determination could still make him back down he bit his lip then said that room in back i reckon you know about yeah i know about that room cincinnatus nodded he in there with anybody or is he by his lonesome by his lonesome far as i know lucullus said go on go on you barged in before barge on in again had his hands been free he probably would have made washing motions with them to show that whatever happened next was not his fault as things were his expression got the message across ignoring that expression cincinnatus went down the hall at the back of the kentucky smoke house till he got to the door he knew he didnt barge in he knocked instead come in a voice from within said cincinnatus worked the latch apicius wood looked at him with something less than pleasure oh its you reckoned it might be somebody i was glad to see its me cincinnatus shut the door behind him with a grunt apicius pointed to a battered chair the proprietor of the kentucky smoke house looked as if hed eaten a great deal of his own barbecue if that was how hed got so fat cincinnatus didnt think he could have picked a better way well apicius rumbled what we gonna fight about today dont want no fight cincinnatus said apicius wood laughed in his face aint many niggers in this town as stubborn as i am but youre sure as hell one of em we dont see eye to eye you know it an i know it too when we get together we fight cincinnatus let out a long sigh i aint enough of a red to suit you i aint enough of a diehard to suit joe conroy and im too goddamn black to suit luther bliss where does that leave me out on a limb apicius answered accurately well say your say so i know what we gonna fight about this time what you think of the elections cincinnatus asked what the hell difference it make what i think or even if i think apicius returned aint like i got to vote aint like you got to vote neither have to wait till after the revolution for that to happen i reckon maybe not cincinnatus said put em together the socialists and the republicans got more seats in the house than the democrats do first time the democrats lose the house in moren thirty years they lost seats in the senate too didnt lose a one here in kentucky apicius said fore they let somebody here vote they make damn sure they know who he vote for cincinnatus refused to let the fat cook sidetrack him how much you work with the white socialists before the elections he asked not much apicius said aint much to work with dont hardly have no homegrown white socialists and every one that come over the ohio bliss and the kentucky state police got their eye on him dont want them bastards puttin their eye on me any worse than they done already how hard did you try cincinnatus persisted did you but apicius wasnt easy to override either raising a palepalmed hand he went on sides them white socialists aint hardly reds theyre nothin but pinks you know what i mean they jaw about the class struggle but they aint pickin up guns and doin anything much what you talkin about cincinnatus said all these strikes apicius broke in again so what aint much shootin goin on not to speak of when the niggers in the confederate states rose up that was a fight worth talkin about wed have done the same thing here certain sure if the yankees hadnt taken us out of the csa by then did do some of it anyways that was true and cincinnatus knew it he also knew something else yeah they rose up sure enough but they got whipped reds rise up in the usa they get whipped too got to be more to the class struggle than shootin guns all the blame time or the folks with most guns always gonna win not if their soldiers and their police work out whose side they really ought to be on apicius said this time he spoke quickly to make sure cincinnatus couldnt interrupt him yeah i know i know it aint likely not the way things is now i aint sayin no different all right then cincinnatus said if it aint all struggle with guns weyouought to be workin with the white folks aint that right you aint been enough of a red your ownself to tell me what i ought to be doin cincinnatus apicius said heavily you dont fancy it you dont got to listen cincinnatus returned other thing you ought to be doin is you ought to start workin to get black folks the vote aint impossible not in the usa aint possible not in kentucky apicius said some of the sons of bitches in the legislature remember when they used to own us you was born after manumission you dont know how things was when i was a boy i was a slave i dont know how to tell you how bad bein a slave is my pa was a slave cincinnatus said my ma too theres some states in the usa that let niggers vote if we cant vote we might as well still be slaves on account of we aint got no say in what happens to us yeah and you know what states they are apicius said with a toss of the head theyre states that aint got more than about a dozen niggers maybe two dozen tops so havin em vote dont matter one way or the other kentucky aint like that we got to vote here wed have us some say what that means is we aint never gettin the vote here white folks wont let it happen that held an unpleasant ring of truth cincinnatus said if we cant win a fight and we cant win the vote what good are we damned if i know what good you are cept to drive me crazy apicius said what im good for is i make some pretty good barbecue cincinnatus exhaled in exasperation if you dont try how the devil you find out what you can do i go up on the roof at city hall i dont need to jump off to know i land in the street apicius said what you want i should do hand luther bliss a petition to ask him to tell the govnor to give us the vote not likely that not likely didnt refer to the orders the chief of the kentucky secret police might give the governor but apicius could never sign such a petition being unable to read or write this here is one of the united states now cincinnatus said stubbornly you and me were citizens of the united states we werent never citizens of the confederate states we can try now maybe we dont win but maybe by the time my achilles grows up he be able to vote dont hold your breath apicius advised or you end up the bluest damn nigger anybody ever seen that also sounded altogether too likely to suit cincinnatus but he was not a man to give in to trouble if he could get around it and as a us citizen he had more ways to try to get around it than hed had as a confederate resident i end up bangin my head against a stone wall here i can move to one of them states where they do let black folks vote he didnt know exactly which states allowed negro suffrage but a trip to the library would tell him hed succeeded in startling apicius youd move up to one of them yankee states the barbecue cook seemed to listen to himself for he laughed hellfire this heres a yankee state these days aint it yeah except most of the white folks here aint figured that out cincinnatus answered so why the hell shouldnt i move couldnt be worsen what ive got now not in the usa it couldntthe confederate states were a different story altogether and both men knew itso whats keepin me here ought to throw my family in the truck and get on the road i seen that truck apicius said if it aint one thing keepin you here damned if i know what is you be lucky to get over the river into ohio let alone anywheres else maybe cincinnatus said it is a shame and a disgrace aint it but even though he chuckled at the barb the idea of packing up and leaving stayed in his mind the more he thought about it the better it seemed he wouldnt have to worry about luther bliss or apicius and the reds or the diehards hed seen that white people from the rest of the usa didnt love negroesfar from itbut white people in kentucky didnt love negroes either he wondered what elizabeth would say if he proposed pulling up stakes he wondered what his mother and father would say too all of a sudden finding out didnt seem like the worst idea in the world hed never cast a vote in his life being able to do that would be worth a lot you got that look in your eye apicius said maybe i do cincinnatus answered god damn maybe i do v there are times when im stupid jonathan moss said and then there are times when im really an idiot he looked around the more he looked the more this seemed like one of the times when he was really an idiot chicago winters were bad hed known about them winters up in ontario were worse hed known about them too hed shivered his way through three of them during the great war hardly anything was more useless than the pilot of a flying scout in the middle of an ontario winter i can think of one thing though he said and his breath blew out in a great icy cloud and thats a man who comes up here in december after a woman who cant stand hima married woman who cant stand him mind you if he hadnt done it though he would have wondered for the rest of his life now one way or the other he would know he had his doubts about whether knowing would make him happy it would make him sure though and that counted too so hed told himself at any rate when he left law school coming into the battered little town of arthur now he wondered no town in ontario through which the front had passed was anything but battered the canucks and the british had fought with dreadful intensity for every square foot of ground theyd held in the end that had done them no good at all but the end came much slower and much much harder than any american had dreamt it would before the war began people in heavy coats and fur hats stared at moss sturdy bucephalus as he halted the motorcar in front of the general store if hed been driving a lightweight ford say he didnt think hed have been able to make his way north from guelph the road such as it was would have defeated him here he was though and arthur ontario and laura secord would have to make the best of it as he got out of the automobile he wished for the furs and leathers in which hed flown hed lived in them in wintertime under canvas without even a proper roof over his head they were the only things that had kept him from freezing to death a cloth coat even a cloth coat with a for collar wasnt the same inside the general store a potbellied stove glowed a cheery red the storekeeper was shoveling more coal into it as moss came inside he went from being too cold to too warm in the twinkling of an eye setting down the coal shovel the storekeeper said the same thing any smalltown storekeeper in the usa might have said help you stranger then his eyes narrowed no wait you aint a stranger or not quite you were one o them yank fliers at the aerodrome outside of town werent you yes moss hadnt expected to be recognized he didnt know whether that would make things easier or harder the storekeeper would have been able to tell he was an american before long anyhow now the fellow knew which american or which kind of american he was how are you today mr peterson ive been better but ive been worse too the canuck allowed he fixed moss with a flinty stare other thing is im mindin my business in the town where ive lived all my days you can boil me for tripe before i figure out why the hell a yankd want to come back here you all of a sudden recollect you left a collar stud over at the aerodrome or what all at once jonathan moss felt very much alone no american occupation forces were within miles the troops had more important places to occupy than a little town in the middle of nowhere like arthur if he had an unfortunate accident here nobody would ever find out anything about it except what the locals revealed and if it turned out not to be quite so accidental as it looked he would be in no position to explain even so he decided to grasp the nettle hed come here to ask this question hed planned on doing it a little later but hed seen no plan survived contact with the enemy straight ahead then did laura secords husband come home safe from the war peterson the storekeeper gave him another long look youre that crazy yank he said at last she told me there was one whod come sniffing around her that was peskier than all the rest dont reckon she ever thought youd be pesky enough to come back here though you didnt answer my question mr peterson moss said peterson went right on not answering it too with a sigh moss dug in his pocket he pulled out a twentydollar goldpiece after examining the double eagle for a moment he let it fall on the counter it rang sweetly you didnt answer my question mr peterson he repeated the storekeeper studied the coin as if hed never seen any like it before likely he hadnt not much us gold would have got up here the eagle in front of crossed swords on the reverse was close to the emblem with which us aeroplanes flew the legend below held one word remembrance peterson scooped up the double eagle and stuck it in his pocket she never said you were a rich fool of a yank thanks so much moss replied now will you please answer what i asked you nope peterson said for a moment moss thought that meant he wouldnt answer the american wondered if he could get back his goldpiece without killing the storekeeper as he was making up his mind to try peterson slowly went on no isaac aint come back that should make her fall right straight into your arms dont you reckon nope moss said imitating him what laura secord had said the last time hed seen her still scorched his memory what was he doing here anyway without another word he spun on his heel and went back out to his automobile winter slapped him in the face as soon as he opened the door to the general store the sweat the redhot stove had brought out on his forehead promptly started to freeze he got into the bucephalus and stabbed the starter button silently thanking god he didnt have to stand in the snowy street cranking the engine to life he drove out to the aerodrome it was from there that he knew how to get to the farm laura secord had been running he had some trouble finding the base from which he and his comrades had flown against the canadians and british theyd lived under canvas and the canvas had moved along with the front but hed served in these parts through a winter and so the ground began to look familiar after a while one field plainly rutted despite the snow on it sent chills through him that had nothing to do with the weather hed jounced along there any number of times taking off on missions and coming back afterwards nowhow strangeit was only a field again it was the field he needed though instead of casting about he drove confidently once hed found it five minutes later he pulled off a road even more rutted than the field and up a narrow lane that led to a farmhouse and barn and a couple of smaller outbuildings the bucephalus brakes reluctantly brought him to a halt not far from a stump with a hatchet driven into it by that and by the stains on the wood he guessed it did duty for a chopping block he got out of the motorcar before he could head for the farmhouse door as he intended a figure muffled to the eyes walked out of the barn whos coming to see me in a fancy automobile the demand was sharp and curious at the same time hearing laura secords voice for the first time in a year and a half sent a shiver through him as if hed taken hold of a live electrical wire the first time he tried to answer all that came out was a hoarse cough he felt sixteen years old again calling on a girl for the first time his hands and feet couldnt suddenly have grown large and clumsy but they felt as if they had he took a deep breath and spoke again its jonathan moss miss secord hed forgotten her married namedone his best to blot it from his mind he wondered if shed forgotten him altogether he hadnt seen her that many times and hed been far from the only american flier whod seen her but her sharp gasp said she remembered the mad yank she exclaimed i dont think so he said his breath steaming with every word well you most certainly are she said not mad for being a yanki dont suppose you can help thatbut mad for coming up here again why on earth did you no matter how daft you are you cant have wanted to see this part of the world againor can you no i didnt come here for that moss took another deep breath he wished he could take a drink too i came up here to see you oh dear god laura secord said quietly she gathered herself didnt you listen to a word i told you the last time you came here if thats not madness i dont know what is you should have stayed wherever you were and gone on doing whatever you were doing i did that jonathan moss said for more than a year i did that when i couldnt do it any more i came he hesitated then went on i heard in arthur that your husband didnt come home im very sorry for whatever that may be worth to you you decided to come up here without even knowing that she said in open astonishment and he nodded maybe he was mad after all she remarked he would have shot you you know he was very good with a rifle even before he went into the army moss didnt say anything he could think of nothing to say had she told him to go then he would have got back into his motorcar and driven away without another word instead she continued come inside and have a cup of tea i wouldnt turn out a mongrel dog in this weather before he had a cup of tea that did not strike him as the warmest commendation of his personal charms if any but it was kinder than anything shed said to him the last time he was here he followed her up the stairs and into the farmhouse the stove was going in the kitchen but not like the one in petersons general store laura secord shoveled in more coal filled the teapot from a bucket and set it on the stove as she busied herself in readying cups and tea she kept shaking her head doing his best to make light of things moss said i really am a harmless fellow if you really were a harmless fellow you would have been shot down she retorted then she pointed to a chair by the table sit if you care to i can get you bread and butter he sat and nodded she served him then tended to the tea when the pot started whistling no matter what he might have expected the tea wasnt particularly good it was hot he gulped it savoring the warmth it brought it helped unfreeze his tongue too he said i came to tell you that if theres ever anything you needanything at all let me know and ill take care of it a knight in shining armor her eyebrows rose moss shook his head i thought of myself like that at the start of the war a knight of the air i mean it didnt last of course wars a filthy business no matter how you fight it but ill do that for you so help me god i will yourespecial to me i dont know how else to put it he was more afraid of saying love than he had been of facing machinegun bullets from a sopwith pup youd better go now laura secord said she wasnt reviling him as she had the last time hed come to her but there was no give in her voice either you mean to be kind im sure you mean to be kind but i dont see how i can take you up on any part of that generous offer when i see you i see your country too and your country has destroyed mine find yourself an american girl one who can forgive you for that she laughed melodramatic isnt it but life is sometimes he got to his feet hed known from the beginning the odds were against himto put it mildly here he pulled a scrap of paper and pencil from his pocket and scrawled down three lines this is my address what i said still goes if you ever need me let me know he turned and left as fast as he could so he wouldnt have to watch her crumple up the paper and throw it away soon he was driving back toward arthur and then back past arthur toward the life hed done his best to toss out the window he kept telling himself he was lucky he had a devil of a time making himself believe it this feels good reggie bartlett said to bill foster as the two of them strolled through richmond we havent done it as much lately as we used to time has a way of getting on foster said and reggie nodded his friend went on and wed stop in a saloon for a beer afterwards too when a beer costs twentyfive dollars instead of five cents stopping in a saloon doesnt seem like such a bully idea any more my pays gone up sure but it hasnt gone up as fast as prices have it never does bartlett said with mournful certainty this time bill foster nodded reggie added and youve got to watch your money nowadays after all youre going to be a married man this time next month and sallys the sort of girl who deserves the best i only hope ill be able to give it to her fosters voice held worry how am i supposed to watch my money all i can do is watch it go away a dollar i put in the bank at the start of the year isnt worth a quarter now even with interest watching money these days means spending it as soon as you get it reggie replied if you do anything else you watch it shrink like you said foster sighed didnt used to be this way how are we supposed to get on with our lives if we cant even save money the freedom partys right if you ask meweve got to put a stop to things before the whole country goes down the water closet yeah weve got to put a stop to things reggie said that doesnt mean the freedom party is right we heard those fellows going on and on when they were new as wet paint remember i thought they were crazy then and i still think theyre crazy theyd come a long way into the northwestern part of town to the public square at the corner of moore and confederate street it had been federal before the war of secession in spite of the chilly weather somebody was holding a rally in the square confederate flags whipped in the breeze and a gesticulating speaker stood on a platform of fresh yellow pine is that the freedom party again bartlett asked then he spotted the signs behind the platform no i seeits the radical liberals want to listen bill sure why not foster said they have some interesting ideas if they dont go off the deep end the way they did when they nominated arango in may vote for em for president in me too reggie nodded that fellow up there whoever he is he doesnt look like hes ever gone off the deep end of anything in his whole life as he got closer he noticed a placard identifying the speaker as congressman baird from chihuahua waistcoated and homburged baird looked more like a banker than a congressman we have to face the facts he was saying as reggie and foster got close enough to hear we are not the top dogs any more our friends are not the top dogs any more we can stick our heads in the sand and pretend things still are the way they were in but that wont do us any good the war has been over for almost a year and a half and most of the people in this country dont really understand that things have changed bill foster looked disgusted take back what i said a minute ago he wants us to go sucking up to the united states and ill see him and everybody else in hell before i lick teddy roosevelts boots weve got to do something reggie answered if we dont its beer next month or maybe beer they licked us you going to tell me they didnt as if to remind him his shoulder twinged while they were talking so was congressman baird reggie started listening to him again in midsentence whole continent north and south and west alike might be better off if we dropped our tariff barriers and the usa did the same i dont say we ought to do that all at once but i do say it is something toward which we can work and something liable to lead to greater prosperity throughout america we share a heritage with the united states in their own way the yankees are americans too we fought a revolution against england but england became the confederacys friend even though we have fought wars against the united states they too may yet become our friends you want to hear any more of this reggie foster asked if the sign didnt say this fellow was from chihuahua id reckon he snuck in from california or connecticut or one of those damnyankee places damnyankees arent as bad as all that they dont have horns and tails reggie said his friend gave him what was plainly meant for a withering look he didnt wither continuing they doctored me as well as anybody could when it would have been easier for them to give up and let me die all you did was fight em they had me in their hands foster was plainly unconvinced but congressman baird got a bigger round of applause than reggie bartlett had really expected foster looked surprised at that too grudgingly he said some people here think the way you do i still dont see it but ill listen a while longer buoyed by the cheers baird went on i dont say for a moment that we should not try to regain as much of our strength as we can we must be able to defend ourselves but we must also bear in mind the colossus to our north and west and that as i said our friends have fallen by the wayside we are on our own in a world that loves us not we would be wise to remember as much that made good sense to reggie the whigs who had dominated confederate politics even more thoroughly than the democrats had dominated those of the usa still seemed stuck in the past without any notion of how to face the future the freedom party and others of its ilk wanted to throw out the baby with the bathwater although they quarreled over which was which baird at least had some idea of the direction in which he wanted the csatogo his supporters in the crowd raised a chant radical liberals radical liberals whigs would never have done anything so undignified but the whigs didnt have to do anything undignified they often seemed to think they didnt have to do anything at all that reggie thought was what holding power for half a century did to a party and then from behind another chant rose or rather a furious howl traitors filthy stinking goddamn traitors reggie spun around charging across the yellowed grass were a couple dozen men armed with clubs and bottles and a variety of other improvised weapons they all wore white shirts and butternut trousers traitors they howled again as they smashed into the rear of congressman bairds crowd they howled something else too a word that made bartletts hair try to stand on end freedom the congressmans voice rose in wellmodulated indignation what is the meaning of this uncouth interruption no one answered him not in so many words but the meaning was obvious even sothe newcomers were breaking up his rally and breaking the heads of the people whod been listening to him fight reggie shouted fight these bastards a club whizzed past his ear swung by a thicknecked thickshouldered chap screaming freedom at the top of his lungs reggie kicked him in the side of the knee as he ran past then as the man started to crumple he kicked him in the belly hed learned to fight fair once upon a time and had to unlearn it in a hurry when he got to the trenches he grabbed the muscular goons club after the fellow lost interest in holding it then started swinging it at everybody in a white shirt he could reach some of the others at the rally were fighting back too most confederate white men had done a tour in the army theyd seen worse fights than this but the attack force from the freedom party had size ferocity youth and surprise on their side they also had a joyful zest for the brawl unlike anything reggie had encountered in the trenches he knocked two or three of them flat even so but then somebody hit him from behind he staggered and fell a couple of peopleone of them was bill foster who was trying with no luck at all to play peacemakerstepped on him someone else kicked him in the ribs and he decided to stay down lest something worse happen to him the ruffians had just about completed routing the rally when police at last appeared haifa dozen men in oldfashioned gray took billy clubs off their belts their leader blew a whistle and shouted that will be quite enough of that freedom the goons bawled all of them still on their feet rushed straight at the cops they had one other thing reggie bartlett noticed only while prone more than a little discipline they fought like soldiers after a common goal not like individual hellraisers the startled policemen went down like wheat under the blades of a reaper had one of them drawn a pistol had one of the radical liberals drawn a pistol but no one had the ruffians or most of them got away slowly and painfully reggie dragged himself to his feet he looked around for bill foster and spotted him holding a handkerchief to a bloody nose a couple of the fallen freedom party fighters were also rising reggie stooped to grab the club though quick movement hurt but showing he was ready to fight meant he didnt have to the goons lifted a comrade who couldnt get up on his own and with his arms draped over their shoulders left the public square from up on the platform congressman baird kept saying this is an outrage an outrage i tell you over and over again nobody paid much attention to him he wasnt wrong that didnt make what he had to say useful they break your nose bill reggie asked dont think so foster felt of it no they didnt i just got hit not clubbed or stomped bastards reggie said that didnt seem nearly strong enough he tried again goddamn fucking sons of bitches that didnt seem strong enough either but it came closer he looked around for his hat and discovered it had got squashed during the brawl picking it up he asked still like what the freedom party stands for foster suggested the freedom party do something illegal immoral and anatomically unlikely his hat when he found it was in worse shape than reggies sadly he dropped it back onto the grass then he said the thing is though plenty of people will like it damn hard to stomach anybody saying anything good about the united states a couple of times i wouldnt have minded walloping baird myself thinking about its one thing bartlett said doing it though he shook his head people wont be able to stomach that no way in hell will people be able to stomach that bill foster thought it over then nodded people just arent so stupid reggie said and his friend nodded again lieutenant colonel abner dowling sat at his deskbecause of his protruding belly sat some distance behind his deskclacking away at a typewriter he would have starved to death in short order had he had to try to make his living as a secretary but he was a good typist for an army officer he wished he were out in the field instead of banging out a report no one would ever read here in a war department office in philadelphia hed wished he were in the field instead of back of the lines at first army headquarters all through the great war he could have commanded a battalion maybe a regiment maybe even a brigade considering how fast frontline officers went down of course he might have gone down himself but that was the chance you took dowling at the howl from behind him he made a typographical error save that it held the sounds of his name the howl might have burst from the throat of a trapped wolf coming sir he pushed the chair back far enough to let himself rise then hurried into the larger more spacious office behind his own sleet beat on the window that gave a blurry view of downtown philadelphia even though it was freezing out there a steam radiator kept the office warm as toast saluting dowling asked what can i do for you this morning general custer custer stared at him through him dowling had seen that stare before it meant custer had been into the bottle he didnt know dowling knew he had in a desk drawer no after a moment dowling realized the stare held more than that custers pale redtracked eyes roamed the office again he might have been a wild beast in a cage what can i do for you sir his adjutant repeated do for me custer said slowly he might have forgotten hed summoned dowling in the first place you cant do anything for me no one can do anything for me no one at all dowling had heard custer in a great many moods before but never despairing whats wrong sir he asked is there anything i can do to help no you cant help me majoruh lieutenant colonel custers wits werent particularly swift but he hadnt started turning forgetful as the general continued dowling realized that was part of the problem i entered west point in july july lieutenant colonel sixtytwo years ago come this summer i have served in the united states army longer than most men have been alive and served with distinction sir dowling said which in its own strange way was true thats why you have four stars on each shoulder strap sir thats why youre here now still serving your country at an age when most menare dead but he wouldnt say thatare sitting in a rocking chair with pipe and slippers what do you think im doing now dowling general custer demanded ive been in the army almost sixtytwo years as i say and in an active command during nearly the whole of that time he waved a plump agespotted hand where is my active command now pray tell he was feeling trapped dowling realized custers adjutant picked his words with care sir there arent a lot of active commands with the country at peace and our foes beaten and your assignment here is only sound and fury signifying nothing custer broke in i have no duties no duties that matter at any rate evaluate the transmission of orders from corps headquarters to divisions and regiments they told me jesus christ dowling its a job for a beadyeyed captain not for me he had a point a good point to try to cheer him up his adjutant had to ignore it no doubt they want the benefit of your long experience oh poppycock custer snapped nonsense drivel theyve put me out to pasture lieutenant colonel thats what theyve done they dont give two whoops in hell whether i ever write this goddamn evaluation even if i do no one will ever read it it will sit on a shelf and gather dust thats what im doing now sitting on a shelf and gathering dust they got all they could out of me and now theyve put me on the shelf everyone is grateful for what you did general dowling said would you have headed last years remembrance day parade if that werent so so teddy roosevelt was generous enough to toss an old dog one last bone custer said a distinct sneer in his voice ha if he lives long enough hell go into the dustbin of the outmoded too and if the election returns from last november are any guide he may get there faster than i have dowling didnt know what to say to that he judged custer was likely to be right the general formerly commanding first army did have a makework assignment here in philadelphia but what else could he expect he was going to be eighty at the end of the year he couldnt very well hope to be entrusted with anything of real importance he could he did barrels he said thats where i want to be working sure as hell lieutenant colonel the rebs are plotting ways to make theirs better even as we speak i know theyre not going to be allowed to have any but theyre plotting just the same well fight another round with them see if we dont i may not live till then but you will i expect wouldnt surprise me if you were right sir dowling said no one in the us army trusted the confederate states no matter how peaceful they tried to make themselves seem they need me on barrels custer said those chowderheads didnt know what to do with what they had till i showed them they wont know how to make barrels better either you mark my words sir there i dont really know if youre right or not dowling said by which he meant custer was talking through his hat colonel morrell is doing good work out in kansas ive seen a couple of the analyses hes sent in theyre firstrate i was very impressed he meant that the more he had to do with morrell the more he was convinced the former commander of the barrel brigade would wear four stars long before his late seventies oh morrells a sound lad no doubt about that custer said by which he meant morrell had given him the victories hed craved but hes only a colonel and hes only a lad will they read his analyses or will they just shelve them alongside of mine they arent soldiers here dowling theyre nothing but a pack of clerks in greengray that held enough truth to be provocative not enough to be useful dowling said colonel morrell will make himself noticed one way or another custers thoughts were running down their own track as they often did he hardly noticed his adjutants words nothing but a pack of clerks in greengray he repeated and now theyre making me a clerk too how am i supposed to turn into a clerk dowling when ive spent the past sixty years as a fighting man sir i know this isnt your first tour at the war department dowling said how did you manage before god only knows custer answered gloomily i sat behind a desk the same as im sitting behind a desk now then though i had an army to help reform i had wars to look forward to i had a purpose that helped me forget i wasstuck here what have i got now only the desk lieutenant colonel only the desk his sigh ruffled his bushy mustache exasperation fury scorn occasional astonished admiration horror those were the emotions custer usually roused in abner dowling that he should pity the ancient warrior had never crossed his mind till now setting custer to makework was like harnessing an old wornout exchampion thoroughbred to a brewery wagon he still wanted to run even if he couldnt any more quietly dowling asked can i get you anything sir anything at all that might make you more comfortable even if custer told him he wanted an eighteenyearold blondeand custers asking for something along those lines would not have unduly surprised his adjutant for he still fancied himself a ladies man especially when libbie wasnt arounddowling resolved to do his best to get him one but the general asked for nothing of the sort instead he said can you get me the presidents ear we still have soldiers in action enforcing our rule on the canadian backwaters we didnt overrun during the great war even a command like that would be better than sitting around here waiting to die and by god i still owe the canucks more than a little the british bastards who killed my brother tom rode down out of canada almost forty years ago even so late as this revenge would be sweet dowling wished hed kept his mouth shut he had no great desire to go traipsing up into the great american siberia no matter what custer wanted but seeing the desperate hope on the old mans face he said i dont know whether i can get president roosevelts ear or not sir even if he hears me i dont know whether hell listen to me if you know what i mean oh yes custer nodded and looked shrewd it might be interesting to find out whether teddy would enjoy keeping me here under his eye and useless better than he would knowing hes sent me to the ends of the earth yes i do wonder how hed decide there reluctantly dowling nodded teddy roosevelt would be making exactly that calculation even more reluctantly custers adjutant telephoned powel house the presidents philadelphia residence he was not immediately put through to theodore roosevelt he hadnt expected to be he left his nameand custers name tooand how to reach him if the president decided to call back he would if he decided not to well in that case dowling had made the effort two days later the telephone rang when dowling answered a familiar gravelly voice on the other end of the line said this is theodore roosevelt lieutenant colonel what can i do for you and what presumably can i do for general custer yes mr president thats why i called dowling said and explained a long silence followed he wants me to send him up there roosevelt sounded as if he couldnt believe his ears yes sir dowling answered he feels useless here at the war department hed rather be doing something than vegetating and he wants to rule the canadians with a rod of iron you might say because of what happened to his brother during the second mexican war loyally dowling refrained from offering his own opinion of a transfer to canada if tom custer hadnt got killed we probably would have lost the battle by the teton river because our gatling guns would have been wrongly placed roosevelt said but thats neither here nor there now i admit the president paused dowling could almost hear the wheels going round inside his head at last he said well by jingo if thats what general custer wants thats what he shall have let no one ever say i put my personal differences with him in the way of fulfilling the reasonable desires of the most distinguished soldier the united states have known since george washington thank you your excellency on general custers behalf dowling said you have no idea how pleased hell be at going back under the saddle again our old warhorse roosevelt chuckled a sound dowling wasnt sure he liked tell him to pack his long johnsand you pack yours too lieutenant colonel yes sir dowling did his best to sound cheerful his best he feared was far from good enough lies julia mcgregor furiously tossed her head the flames in the fireplace caught the red highlights of her hair and made it seem about to catch fire too the lies the americans make the teachers tell what is it now her father asked arthur mcgregor smiled grimly the harder the americans tried to indoctrinate his daughters the more they shot themselves in the foot they call the tories traitors they stayed loyal to their own king when everyone around them was rebelling and for that the americans call them traitors julia was furious all right id sooner be around people who stay loyal even if it costs them than a pack of fools who blow like weather vanes whichever way the wind happens to catch them maude looked up from her knitting shes your daughter she remarked to her husband that she is mcgregor said with no small pride my daughter my countrys daughternot any americans daughter i should say not julia exclaimed indignantly mary shoved aside a piece of scratch paper on which she was practicing multiplication and division pa do the yanks lie about nine times eight being seventytwo too she asked her voice hopeful it would work a lot better if it were seventyone im afraid theyre telling the truth there chick he answered numbers dont change no matter which side of the border theyre on too bad his younger daughter said i thought the americans would lie about everything under the sun they lie about everything that happened under the sun julia said but numbers arent exactly things that happen under the sun theyre real and true all by themselves no matter how you look at them how does that make them different than anything else mary asked before julia could answer one of the kerosene lamps that helped the fireplace light the front room burned dry the stink of lamp oil spread through the room mcgregor heaved himself up out of his chair and started over to get some kerosene to refill the lamp dont waste your time arthur maude said were as near out as makes no difference thats too bad he said he did his best not to curse in front of his womenfolk have to ride into town tomorrow and buy some more at gibbons general store cant go around wandering in the dark why not pa mary said with a wicked smile the yanks do it all the time hush you mcgregor said snorting tend to your ciphering not your wisecracks mary dutifully bent her head to the paper five minutes later or ten or fifteen shed come out with something else outrageous he was as sure of it as of the sun coming up tomorrow morning when he drove out in the wagon the next morning he was only half convinced the sun had come up a thick layer of dirty gray clouds lay between it and him in that murky light the snow covering the ground also looked gray and dirty though most of it was freshly fallen under the wagons iron tires the frozen ground was as hardthough by no means as smoothas if it were macadamized as usual us soldiers meticulously checked the wagon before letting mcgregor go on into rosenfeld he had nothing to hide not here all his bombmaking paraphernalia remained hidden in his barn after hed taken his revenge on major hannebrink whod ordered his son executed the urge to make his deadly toys had eased the yanks hadnt rebuilt the sheriffs station after he bombed it all theyd done was clear away the wreckage he smiled as he jounced slowly past the bare snowcovered stretch of ground it was not enough nothing could ever be enough to make up for losing alexander but it was something it was more than most canadians had a lot more rosenfeld was a far cry from the big city it didnt hold even a thousand people if two railroad lines hadnt met there it might not have existed at all throughout the war though americans had packed it to the bursting point as it became a staging area and recuperation center for the long hard campaign against winnipeg now with just a small occupation garrison it seemed much more nearly its old self than it had during the war years people on the street nodded to mcgregor why not no need to bother avoiding his eyes alexander was two and a half years dead now old news to everyone but his family no one knew mcgregor had had his revenge had anyone known the yanks would have found out they would have stood him against a wall as theyd stood his son and shot him down too he hitched the horse on the main street in front of the post office he couldnt have done that during the war the yanks had reserved the street for themselves digging in his pockets for some change he went into the post office hello arthur said wilfred rokeby the postmaster he was a small fussily precise man who wore his hair parted in the middle and plastered down to either side with some spicysmelling oil didnt expect to see you coming into town quite so soon ran out of kerosene sooner than i thought i would mcgregor set a couple of dimes on the counter long as im here let me have some stamps too wilf i can do that rokeby said he peeled ten red twocent stamps from a sheet and handed them to mcgregor they were ordinary us stamps adorned with benjamin franklins fleshy portrait but had the word manitoba overprinted on them in black at least we dont have to pay double any more to help the singers and dancing girls come up here and perform for the yankee soldiers mcgregor said pocketing the stamps that was nothing but highway robbery things are settling down a mite the postmaster said i hear some fellows going to come up from minnesota and start us a new weekly paper when the weather gets better been a long time since that bomb in front of malachi stubings place shut down the old register t that bomb had not been one of mcgregors he hadnt been in the bombing business back then he had been in henry gibbons general store when the bomb went off the americans had almost taken him hostage after the blast frowning he said one more way for the yanks to peddle their lies thats so rokeby admitted but itll be good to have the town news too and all the advertising weve missed it you cant say we havent arthur well maybe mcgregor said but then as if to rebut himself he added minnesota shaking his head he turned and walked out of the post office the general store was half a block up the street and on the other side henry gibbon was wiping his hands on his apron when mcgregor came inside carrying a large sheetiron can a hot stove gave relief from the chill outside didnt expect to see you for another week or ten days arthur the storekeeper said he raised an eyebrow almost to what would have been his hairline had his hair not long since retreated to higher ground ran out of kerosene mcgregor set the can on the counter with a clank want to fill me up again sure will gibbon said and did so with a large tin dipper when he was through he put the top securely back in place and held out his right hand palm up five gallons makes sixtyfive cents would only have been half a dollar before the war mcgregor said the fiftycent piece and dime he gave gibbon were us coins the fivecent piece canadian more and more of the money in circulation came from the usa these days during the war youd have been out of luck if you didnt have your ration book gibbon said with a massive shrug its not as good as it was but its not as bad as it was either he hadnt had a son killed he could afford to say things like that mcgregor had and couldnt he started to head out the door then checked himself gibbon might not know good and bad from the man in the moon but he heard all the gossip there was to hear in rosenfeld has wilf rokeby got it straight is some fellow coming up from the united states to put out a paper here thats what ive heard anyway gibbon answered be right good to let folks know every week that im still alive and still in business but a yank mcgregor said the storekeeper shrugged again the notion didnt bother him as long as he got his advertisements in the newspaper he couldnt have cared less what else went in with a grunt mcgregor picked up the can of kerosene and went back out into the cold he started across the street a motorcars horn blared at him he froze like a deerhe hadnt paid the least attention to traffic if the automobile hadnt been able to stop in time it would have run him down it halted with its front bumper inches from him it was a big open touring car with a us soldier who looked very cold driving and two men in buffalo robes and fur hats in the back seat one of them looked older than god with a beaky nose projecting from a wrinkled face jesus christ i wanted to see what one of these little towns looked like he said his voice americanaccented i didnt aim to kill anybody while i was doing it sorry general custer sir the driver said his greatcoat didnt offer him nearly the protection from the bitter winter chill that a buffalo robe would have done think your wife had the right idea sir the younger man in back said he was a porky fellow porky enough that his blubber probably helped keep him warm you might have done better to stay on the train till we got up to winnipeg im supposed to be in charge of things the old man said querulously how can i be in charge of things if i dont see for myself what the hell im in charge of he shook a mittened fist at mcgregor what are you standing there for you damn fool get out of the way mcgregor unfroze and took a few steps forward the motorcar shot past him with a clash of gears its tires spat snow up into his face he stared after it hed learned about general custer in school during the second mexican war hed beaten general gordons british and canadian army down in montana beaten it after the usa had agreed to a ceasefire mcgregor had assumed he was long dead till his name started cropping up in war news and now he was coming to canada to be in charge of things and not just to canada but to winnipeg only a couple of days to the north even by wagon mcgregor hurried back to the wagon purpose had indeed leaked out of his life after hed avenged himself on major hannebrink now suddenly it was back this time he wouldnt just be avenging himself hed be avenging his whole country nellie jacobs yawned right in the middle of business hours edna laughed at her this is a coffeehouse ma nellies daughter said if youre sleepy pour yourself a cup ive been drinking it all day long nellie punctuated her reply with another yawn i dont want another cup right now she hesitated and lowered her voice so the couple of customers in the place wouldnt hear it hasnt tasted quite right anyway did we get a bad batch of beans i dont think so edna semphroch answered also quietly tastes fine to me nobodys said anything about it either unless somebody went and complained to you no nellie admitted she yawned again goodness i cant hold my eyes open if this keeps up im going to have to go upstairs and lie down for a while edna said sure go ahead ma leave me with all the work maybe she was joking on the other hand maybe she wasnt in the end nellie didnt go upstairs a few more customers had come in and sticking edna with all of them didnt seem fair she got through the day though by the end of it she felt as if she had a couple of sacks of cement strapped to her shoulders oh lord im beat she said over the ham steaks and string beans and fried potatoes that made up supper you look it hal jacobs said sympathetically what have you been doing to make yourself so tired her husband looked worried do you think it is something you ought to see the doctor about i havent been doing anything special nellie answered but todayno the past few daysive felt like i was moving under water maybe you should go to a doctor ma edna said that aint like you and you know it aint youve always been a gogetter doctors nellie tossed her head theyre all quacks half the time they cant tell whats wrong with you the other half they know whats wrong but they cant do anything about it neither her daughter nor her husband argued with her if you had a broken arm a doctor could set it if you had a boil a doctor could lance it if you needed a smallpox vaccination a doctor could give you one but if you had the spanish influenza a doctor could tell you to stay in bed and take aspirin and if you had consumption he could tell you to pack up and move to new mexico that might cure you or it might not doctors couldnt and the honest ones admitted as much nellie found herself yawning yet again she covered her mouth with her hand gracious she said i swear to heaven i havent felt this wrung out since i was carrying you edna the words seemed to hang in the air hal jacobs eyes widened ednas mouth fell open ma she said slowly you dont suppose you dont suppose youre in a family way again do you what a ridiculous notion nellie exclaimed but when she thought about it maybe it wasnt so ridiculous as all that her time of the month should have been her jaw dropped too her time of the month should have come a couple of weeks before shed never thought of asking hal to wear a french letter on the infrequent occasions when she yielded him her body she hadnt even worried about it she was far enough past forty that shed figured having a baby was about as likely as getting struck by lightning she glanced cautiously up toward the ceiling that was foolish and she knew it if a lightning bolt came crashing through shed never know what hit her are you going to have a child nellie hal jacobs asked in tones of wonder i think try as she would nellie had trouble forcing out the words at last she managed i think maybe i am edna burst out laughing no matter how tired nellie felt she wasnt too tired to glare a moment later her daughter looked contrite im sorry ma edna said i was just thinking that if you had a baby now itd be almost like i had a baby now and she dissolved in more giggles hal looked delighted and awed at the same time softly he said with my first wife i had two children two little girls neither one of them lived to be three years old now god has given me another chance when i never thought he would he bent his head in thanks nellie wasnt nearly so sure she felt thanks she hadnt figured on taking care of a child againnot unless edna had misfortune strike her in the shape of a man and nellie could think of no more likely shape for misfortune to assume and then nellie started to laugh in the same way edna had it is funny she said its funny now anyways wont be so funny when the baby finally comes i remember that oh yes hal said i remember too it is much work but you nellie we must take the very finest care of you to make sure everything goes on in exactly the way it should what he meant was she was getting long in the tooth to have a baby she couldnt get annoyed about that for one thing hed put it very nicely for another shed thought she was too long in the tooth herself over a gap of half a lifetime she remembered what bringing forth edna had been like maybe this time shed go to a hospital and have them stick an ether cone over her face that was one other thing doctors were good for mas a tough bird edna said with no small pride she beamed at nellie nellie could hardly recall her beaming before arent you ma before nellie could answer hal said a woman in a delicate condition is in a delicate condition which means she is delicate is what it means hed talked himself twice round a circle hadnt said a single solitary thing and didnt realize it ill be all right nellie said this is something god meant women to do and if that doesn tprove god is a man i dont know what does she didnt feel like a tough bird but she didnt feel delicate either what she mostly felt was tired edna said if you really are in a family way ma why dont you go on upstairs ill do the dishes why thank you sweetheart nellie cherished every friendly gesture she got from edna not least because she didnt get that many of them that shed been watching edna like a hawk for years never once entered her mind when she went upstairs and took off her corset she sighed with relief before too long she wouldnt be able to wear a corset any more her belly would stick out there for all the world to see but she had a ring on the proper fingershe held up her hand to look at the thin gold circletso that was all right she sighed again when she lay down on the bed she felt as if her bones were turning to rubber she raised an arm and then let it flop limply to the mattress she wasnt quite ready to fall asleepthough she knew she would be very soonbut she wasnt going anywhere either her eyes had just started to slide closed when hal came into the bedroom i know we didnt think this would happen nellie he said but it will be a blessing in our old age i suppose so nellie said not yet convinced but willing to be she laughed once more i never thought id be a mother again at the age i am now and i never expected to be a father her husband answered you made me the happiest man in the world when you said you would be my bride and you have made me the happiest man in the world since too every hair in his mustache seemed to quiver with joy nellie was a long way from the happiest woman in the world a million dollars a fancy house full of servants and a rich handsome husband for edna would probably have turned the trick but hal was doing his best to make her happy and shed never had anyone do that before youre sweet she told him everything will be fine was she talking to herself as well as to her husband if she was who could blame her hal said i shall have to get more business from the shop across the street how do you aim do to that nellie asked with genuine curiosity the shoerepair shop brought in a steady reliable trickle of money building that trickle to anything more struck her as unlikely i know what we need her husband said another war and another invasion he sighed only the confederates whose boots i made and mended would probably pay me in scrip the way they did last time but even with scrip i made more from them during the war than from my regular customers before or after id sooner be poor nellie said considering how she felt about money that was no small assertion so would i hal jacobs said the united states have spent my entire life working to get even with the rebels now that we have finally done it i dont ever want them to have another chance to invade our beloved country and of course he added now that our flag flies down to the rappahannock the confederates would have a harder time reaching and shelling washington than they did in the last two wars i was just a little girl when they shelled the city during the second mexican war nellie said i thought the end of the world had come her expression grew taut and then i went through and i was sure the end of the world had come and then i went through the shellings and bombings during the last few months of the war and by the time they were through i was wishing the end of the world would come it was a very hard time hal agreed but you came through safe and your lovely edna and so did i he kissed her and now this i never imagined it but i am ever so glad it has happened nellie wondered how glad he would be when she was bent over a bucket heaving her guts out she remembered doing that for weeks and weeks when she was carrying edna she wondered how glad he would be when she was big as an elephant and couldnt find a comfortable position in which to sleep and had to get up to use the pot every hour on the hour she wondered how happy he would be with the baby screaming its head off all night long three or four nights in a row she would find out she glanced over at hal jacobs who was gazing fondly at her hed made a better husband than she thought he would odds were hed make a good father too nellie smiled if we have a little girl youre going to spoil her rotten i hope so hal exclaimed and if we have a little boy i expect to spoil him rotten too a son he blinked was he blinking back tears i never thought i might have a son never not for many many years well we dont know if youve got him yet nellie said weve still got a good many months to go before we find out she yawned once more enormously this time but ive only got a couple of minutes to go before im asleep she closed her eyes and discovered she didnt have even that long jefferson pinkard wished he could walk into a saloon and have himself a cold beer he didnt feel like getting drunk or so he told himself he just wanted one schooner of beer to take the edge off a bad mood but alabama had gone dry before the great war all the saloons were either padlocked and ankledeep in dust or long since converted to some other way of separating a customer from his cash that didnt mean a thirsty man had to dry up and blow away some beer was sitting back in the icebox in jeffs cottage he didnt feel like going back there though hed eyed emily like a fox eyeing a henhouse ever since he came home from the war that was more than a year and a half now heading on toward two years you couldnt keep watch every livelong minute of every livelong day spring hadnt come to birmingham yet but it was on the way the breezes werent roaring down out of the freezing usa any more they might not be very warm yet but they blew off the gulf of mexico wafting up a hint of mobile a hint of the subtropical even though tree branches remained bare of leaves as skeletons were of flesh and all the grass on the lawns and in the parks was yellow and dead somewhere under the bark somewhere under the ground new life lurked and would soon be bursting forth maybe new life lurked somewhere under the ground for the confederate states too if it did jefferson pinkard couldnt sense it as he could the coming spring he wanted renewal the country needed renewal he had no idea where to find it nobody else in the csa seemed to know either birmingham had been a fine bustling city before the war now it just idled along like a steam engine running on about a quarter of the pressure it needed the steel mills remained busy but most of what they made went north as reparations for the damnyankees no profit there for the foundry owners and when they made no profit the whole town suffered some of the general stores and haberdasheries and furniture stores were recognizable only by the lettering on their windows being empty locked shells of their former selves almost as parched and dead as the deceased saloons with which they shared business blocks others still survived on a saturday afternoon though they shouldnt have been surviving they should have been thriving full of steelworkers with money in their pockets to spend on a halfholiday jefferson pinkard had money in his pocketsmore than two hundred dollars hell of a lot of good that does me he muttered under his breath the way things were these days you couldnt even get good and drunk on two hundred dollars maybe it was just as well the saloons were all deceased a man in a pair of denim pants and a shirt with one sleeve pinned up came out of a secondhand clothing store pinkard stopped short plenty of men in birmingham these days had an arm gone above the elbow but sure enough it was bedford cunningham jeffs best friend once upon a time how are you today jeff cunningham asked he was as tall as pinkard and had been as burly when they were both down on the floor at the sloss works since being wounded hed lost a lot of flesh all right pinkard answered shortly he still remembered he could never forgetwhat bedford cunningham and emily had been doing when hed walked into his cottage on leave but if bedford was here he couldnt be back there doing anything with emily now that made jeff somewhat better inclined toward him enough so to ask what you doin now i was heading over toward avondale park cunningham answered this new freedom party is holding a rally i want to see what they have to say christ bedford theyre just politicians jeff said now certain he had the excuse he needed not to go along youve heard one of em youve heard em all youve heard one of em youve heard too many too these boys are supposed to be different bedford said theyre the ones whove been banging heads up in richmond if youve been reading the papers he essayed a small joke theyve been banging heads up in richmond even if you havent been reading the papers as it happened jeff had been reading the papers though not with so much attention as he might have forgot the name of that outfit he admitted i didnt know they got down here to birmingham either he rubbed his chin bristles rasped he needed a shave what the hell ill come along with you curiosity about the new party outweighed dislike and distrust for his old friend peoplemostly workingclass white men like pinkard or his shabbier outofwork counterpartsstraggled into the park and toward a wooden platform bedecked with confederate flags in front of the platform stood a row of hardfaced men in what might almost have been uniform white shirts and butternut trousers dont reckon you want to pick a quarrel with those boys bedford cunningham said you wouldnt want to do it more than once jeff agreed theyve all been through the trenches ill laytheyve got that look to em cunningham nodded on top of the platform prowled a thin man with lank brown hair he kept looking out at the crowd as if he wanted to launch into his speech but was making himself wait so more people could hear him hes seen the elephant too bedford said thats what my grandpappy would call it anyway yeah pinkard said sure has even this long after the war he usually had little trouble telling a combat veteran from a man who wasnt at last unable to contain himself any more the skinny man strode to the front edge of the platform arent you folks proud to be puttin money in the damnyankees pockets he called in a harsh but compelling voice arent you glad to be workin your fingers to the bone so they can put their mistresses in the fancy motorcars they build out of the steel you make arent you glad the fools and the traitors in richmond blow kisses to the damnyankees when they send em our steel and our oil and our money they didnt make those things so why the devil should they care hes got something bedford cunningham said pinkard nodded hardly noticing he was doing it yeah he does he waved a hand now hush up bedford i want to hear what he has to say for himself do they remember up there in richmond up there in the capitol up there in that whited sepulcher do they remember we fought a war with the united states not so long ago the skinny man demanded do they doesnt look like it to me friends how does it look to you hell no jeff heard himself shout his was far from the only voice raised from the crowd beside him cunningham yelled louder than he did he grinned at his old friend the first time hed done that since hed caught him with emily up there in richmond do they care if were weak the skinny man asked and answered his own question no they dont care why should they care all they care about is getting elected nothing else matters to em so what if the united states kick mud in our face we were a great country once before the traitors in congress and the fools in the war department stabbed us in the back we can be great again if we want to bad enough do they care up there in richmond no they dont care do you care you people in birmingham he could give the same speech in chattanooga and just drop in the different placename and a couple of details jeff knew that somehow it didnt matter it didnt matter at all he felt the skinny man was speaking to him alone showing him what was wrong leading the way toward making it better yes he yelled at the top of his lungs his voice one among hundreds all crying the same word i dont blame the united states for doing what theyre doing to us the skinny man said if i was in teddy roosevelts shoes id try and do the same thing but i blame those people up in richmond for letting him get away with itno by god for helping him get away with it we ought to throw every one of those bastards on the trash heap for that by itself before we stand tall again we have to throw em on the trash heap but weve got more reasons than just that they sat there sleeping while the niggers plotted and then rose up and what did they do after that they said fine from here on out niggers are just as good as white men tell me friends you reckon niggers are just as good as white men no roared the crowd jefferson pinkard loud among them vespasian wasnt a bad fellow and he did his job pretty well but working alongside a white man didnt make him as good as a white man well now you see youre smarter than they are up in richmond the freedom party speaker said niggers arent as good as white men never were never will be never can be and the liars up in richmond cant make em that way even if they did give em the vote the vote his voice rose to a furious contemptuous howl ive got a donkey back in richmond i can whip him from now till doomsday and he wont ever win a horse race you can say a niggers as good as a white man but that doesnt make it so never has never will cant weve got to give those fools up in richmond the heaveho and elect some people who can stand up to the united states and stand up for the white man here thats what the freedom party is all about weve got congressional elections coming up this fall i hope youll remember us im jake featherston ill be by again if the money holds out youll have somebody on the ballot here who thinks the way i do get on over to your polling place and vote for him he waved to show he was done while the applause still thundered a hat came through the crowd as if to underscore that if the money holds out jeff pulled a hundreddollar banknote out of his pocket and stuck it in the hat he imagined doing such a thing back in or tried he couldnt imagine having a hundreddollar banknote in his pocket back then theres a man who knows what we need bedford cunningham said as the rally began to break up sure as hell is sure as hell does pinkard said his voice was awed almost as if hed gone to church and been born again he felt born again listening to featherston made him believe the confederate states could pull themselves together again id follow him a long way me too cunningham said if whoever the freedom party runs is even a quarter as good on the stump as this feathersmith featherston jeff corrected hed listened with great attention to every word the skinny man said jake featherston featherston cunningham said if i like who theyre running here ill vote for him ive been a whig a long time but id change so would i jefferson pinkard said this featherston he knows what hes talking about you can hear it in every word he says vi for perhaps the first time in his professional life colonel irving morrell wished he were back in philadelphia fighting arguments about barrels by way of letters and telegrams from leavenworth kansas was not getting the job done in the way he would have hoped letters and wires were all too easy to ignore what can we do colonel lieutenant jenkins asked when the latest unsatisfactory reply came back from the war department we should have a design ready to build now and were not even close damned if i know lije morrell answered he tapped the papers with the tip of his index finger i think we would have a design by now if the budget were what people thought it was going to be when they set up the barrel works miserable socialists jenkins said angrily theyre trying to take away everything we won on the battlefield theyre not making anything easy for us thats for sure morrell said i want to make hay while the sun shines if you know what i mean you have to figure the rebs wont stay down forever the farther ahead of them we are when they do start getting back on their feet the better ill like it yes sir jenkins said wed be a lot better off sir if theyd listen to you more if they dont want to listen to you why did they send you out here in the first place to get me out of their hair for one thing morrell answered to drive me out of my mind for another these days theyre so worried about spending money that theyre trying to build barrels on the cheap i dont know how many times ive explained and explained and explained that the engines in our machines arent strong enough to do the job but what sort of answer do i get what it boils down to is they did the job in the last war so of course theyll do the job in the next one too he looked disgusted so did lije jenkins with that kind of thinking wed have gone into the great war with singleshot blackpowder springfields morrell nodded you understand that and i understand that the war department understands it can get white truck engines even the ones built in mirror image to pair with the regular model in carload lots cheap as it wants coming up with something better wont be anywhere near as cheap and cheap counts right now cheap counts a lot are they going to leave our countrys safety hanging on nickels and dimes lieutenant jenkins demanded indignantly he was still very young young enough to believe in the tooth fairy the common sense of congress and a great many other unlikelihoods probably morrell said at which the lieutenant looked as if hed just watched his puppy run over in the street trying not to smile morrell went on they spent twenty years after the war of secession tossing the army nickels and dimes and not much more remember they paid for it too but that doesnt mean they cant do it again theyd have to be crazy jenkins exclaimed no just shortsighted morrell said shaking his head i think it was president mahan who noted that the biggest trouble republics have is that over time the voters are apt to get tired of paying for what their country needs to defend itself theyd sooner spend the money on bread and circuses or else not spend it and keep it in their own pockets after everything weve gone through sir that would be a crime jenkins said you think so and i think so and the war department thinks so too morrell replied this time with a shrug the voters dont think so theyve sent a lot of socialists to congress this year we do what we can with what we have thats all if we havent got much we do what we can with that pharaoh made the israelites make bricks without straw a crime lieutenant jenkins repeated he wasnt old enough to recall the cheeseparing the army had had to put up with during the dark years after the war of secession neither was morrell but hed listened to older soldiers grouse about it ever since hed put on a greengray uniform general custer under whom hed served in tennessee had been through it all and now hed heard custer was up in canada in charge of the soldiers bringing us authority to a land larger than the united states he didnt know how the old warhorse would shape in that assignment it didnt seem to call for the slambang drive that characterized custers fighting style on the other hand morrell would have preferred it to sitting behind a desk in philadelphia no doubt custer did too morrell dismissed his former commander from his mind he glanced over at lije jenkins who still looked unhappy with the world the only thing we can do is our best morrell said a cuckoo came out of the clock on the wall and announced six oclock morrell grinned the other thing we can do now is head over to the mess hall and get supper and after that didnt i hear something about a dance in town tonight yes sir jenkins eyes sparkled im going over there you feel like cutting a rug too sir he eyed morrell with a certain bemused curiosity morrell had all he could do to keep from laughing out loud im not a greatgrandfather ready for the boneyard yet lieutenant he said theres still some juice left in here he set a hand over his chest and grinned wickedly after supper shall we race over to the dance hall uh no sir jenkins said you ran me into the mud out on the practice range i figure you can probably do the same thing on sidewalks his grin had a wicked touch too but sir therell be girls there you know i should hope so morrell said you dont think id want to waltz or foxtrot with an ugly customer like you do you as a matter of fact lieutenant jenkins was a handsome young man that still didnt mean morrell wanted to dance with him morrell was heading toward thirty now and had never come close to acquiring a wife his eye had always been on the war ahead as the eyes of the united states had been but now the war was over and won and singleminded devotion to duty was looking harder and less desirable not only to the country but also to irving morrell he did not head for the dance with lieutenant jenkins seriously expecting to find a wife the minute he stepped out onto the floor that would have been unreasonable in the extreme and he knew it but if he did find a young lady a lady he found attractive he was ready and more than ready to pursue the matter and see where it led he nodded as he left fort leavenworth hed never had that kind of determination before not about anything except the battlefield leavenworth kansas was a town of about twenty thousand people not all of them served the fort by any means many mined the large coal deposits in the area while others worked in flour and lumber mills but regardless of whether the locals worked for the army or not soldiers got solid respect in leavenworth it had been an antislavery settlement back in the days before the war of secession when the south tried to make kansas a slave state only the oldest of the oldtimers recalled those days now but the tradition of hatred for the confederacy ran strong here as it did in much of kansas morrell and jenkins strode past a large bronze statue of john brown the citizens of leavenworth had erected after the second mexican war brown was and always had been a hero to many kansans hed become a national hero during the s when people in the united states began to see that hed known what he was doing when hed attacked the southerners not only here but also in their own lair down in virginia the dance was at a social hall next to a whitepainted baptist church with a tall steeple a spare building that might have been transported bodily from new england to the prairie sounds of piano and fiddle music drifted out into the night thats not the best playing ive ever heard morrell said which was if anything a generous assessment but they do go right after a tune yes sir jenkins answered now we just have to hope its not one of the dances where theyve got maybe half a dozen girls and five hundred guys waiting to dance with them a little bit of that kind goes a long way it was chilly outside a coal stove and the dancers exertions heated the social hall so that a blast of warm air greeted morrell when he opened the door after looking around he nodded approval men did not hopelessly outnumber women not all the men were soldiersclose to half wore civilian clothes morrell had never feared competition of any sort a punch bowl sat on a table at the far end of the hall he went over to it got himself a glass and leaned against the wall watching couples spin and dip more or less in time to the music scouting the terrain before advancing was a good idea in other things besides warfare lije jenkins on the other hand plunged straight into the fray cutting in on a civilian in a sharp suit the fellow gave him a sour look as he retired toward the sidelines leavenworth might have liked soldiers pretty well but cutting in like that was liable to start a brawl anywhere with a final raucous flourish the little threepiece band stopped its racket people clapped their hands not so much to applaud the musicians as to show they were having a good time men and women headed over to the punch bowl morrell quickly drained his own glass and with the empty glass as an excuse contrived to get to the bowl at the same time as a woman in a ruffled shirtwaist and maroon wool skirt he filled the ladle then after catching her eye to make sure the liberty would not be unwelcome poured punch into her glass before dealing with his own thank you she said she was within a couple of years of thirty herself with hair black as coal brown eyes and warm brown skin with a hint of blush beneath it when she took a longer look at morrell one eyebrow rose thank you very much colonel he was he suddenly realized a catch glancing around he saw a couple of captains but no soldiers of higher rank men were not the only ones playing this game well on with it my pleasure he said if you like you can pay me back by giving me the next dance ill do that she said at once my name is hill agnes hill very pleased to meet you morrell gave his own name the musicians struck up what was no doubt intended to be a waltz he guided her out onto the dance floor he danced with academic precision his partner didnt but it mattered little the floor was so crowded couples kept bumping into one another everyone laughed when it happened it was expected they talked under and through the semimusical racket my husband was killed in the first few weeks of the war agnes hill said he was up on the niagara front and the canadians had lots of machine guns and she shrugged in morrelps arms im sorry he answered she shrugged again morrell said i got shot myself about that time in sonora only reason im here is luck his dancing partner nodded ive thought about luck a lot the past few years colonel thats all you can do isnt itthink i mean she whirled on with him for another few steps then said im glad you were lucky im glad you are here as the music ended morrell was glad he was there too lucien galtier did not converse with his horse while driving up to riviereduloup as he usually did the horse a heartless beast seemed to feel no lack and galtier had conversation aplenty for instead of going up to the town by the st lawrence alone he had along marie his two sons and the three daughters still living at home with them i cant wait to see the baby denise said shed been saying that since word came from leonard odoull that nicole had had a baby boy the evening before i want to see nicole marie said not for nothing do they call childbirth labor she glared at lucien as if to say it was his fault nicole had endured what shed endured or maybe she was just thinking it was the fault of men that women endured what they endured soothingly galtier said all is well with nicole and all is well with the baby too for which i give thanks to the holy mother of god he crossed himself and i also give thanks that nicole gave birth with a doctor attending her who was so intimately concerned with her wellbeing intimately marie sniffed and slapped him on the leg then she sniffed again on a slightly different note a midwife was plenty good for me a midwife is good lucien agreed not wanting to quarrel with his wife but he did not abandon his own opinion either a doctor i believe is better marie didnt argue with him for which he was duly grateful she kept looking around as if she didnt want to miss anything her sharp eyes might pick up she didnt get off the farm so often as he did and wanted to make the most of the excursion in every way after a bit she said traveling on a paved road all the way to town is very nice it is so smooth the wagon hardly seems to be moving traveling on a paved road all the way to town is even better when it rains galtier said the road had not been paved for his benefit paving had been extended as far out from riviereduloup as his farm only because the americans then occupying quebec south of the st lawrence had built their hospital on land theyd taken from his patrimony not least because he hadnt cared to collaborate with them and now his daughter had collaborated on a halfamerican child he shook his head he had not expected that he had not expected it but he welcomed it now that it was here clouds drifted across the sky hiding the sun more often than they let it show through snow still lay on the ground to either side of the road more might fall at any time in the next month the calendar said it was april and therefore spring but the calendar did not understand how far winter could stretch in this part of the world lucien and his wife and children were as well muffled as they would have been going out in january and needed to be here and there bomb craters showed up as dimples under the snow british and canadian aeroplanes had done what they could to harm the americans after their soldiers were driven north across the river but now the wounds in the land were healing the antiaircraft guns that had stood outside of riviereduloup guns manned at the end of the war by soldiers in the bluegray of the new republic of quebecwere gone now stored away heaven only knew where lucien hoped they would never come out of storage riviereduloup itself perched on a spur of rock jutting out into the st lawrence inside its bounds a waterfall plunged ninety feet from the small river that gave the town its name into the greater one in the late seventeenth century when riviereduloup was founded it would have been a formidable defensive position in these days of aeroplanes and giant cannons galtier wondered if there were any such thing as a formidable defensive position his daughter and soninlaw lived only a couple of blocks from bishop pascals church not far from the market square galtier reckoned that a mixed blessing the bishopwho had been simply father pascal when the war beganhad jumped into bed with the americans so quickly he had surely endangered his vows of celibacy there were still times when lucien had mixed feelings about the way the war had gone he suspected he would have those times as long as he lived the houses on either side pressed close to that of dr leonard odoull how cramped things are here in the city marie said and clucked in distress lucien was inclined to agree with her coming into town on market day was all very well but he would not have cared to live here as he was tying the horse to an apple tree in front of the house dr odoull opened the door and waved come in all of you he called in his evermore quebecois french nicole cant wait to see you and of course you will want to see little lucien galtier froze in his tracks slowly he said when you sent word you said nothing of naming the baby after me when i sent word we had not yet decided what we would name the baby his soninlaw returned but lucien odoull he shall be he reached into his pocket and held out cigars come on smoke with me its the custom in the united states when a man has a son if the cigars were anything like the ones odoull usually had galtier would have been glad to smoke one regardless of whether he had a grandson or not shaken out of his startled paralysis he hurried toward the house a coal fire in the fireplace held the chill at bay nicole sat in a rocking chair in front of the fire she was nursing the baby and did not get up when her family came in she looked as if shed been through a long spell of trench warfare pale and battered and worn had galtier not seen marie look the same way after her children were born he would have been alarmed his other children who did not remember such things so well were alarmed even georges had no snide comments ready marie spoke in tones of command when he is finished there hand him to me yes mother it shouldnt be long nicole sounded battered and worn too lucien galtier stared at lucien odoull as he nursed the baby looked very red and wrinkled its head somewhat misshapen from its passage out into the world his children exclaimed about that too he said every one of you looked the same way when you were born georges said surely i was much more handsome what a pity it hasnt lasted then denise said she and her sisters laughed so did charles georges looked something less than amused presently nicole lifted the baby from her breast to her shoulder she patted him on the back lucien would have patted harder but hed had more practice than his daughter he realized babies didnt break after a while his grandson gave forth with a belch a grown man would not have been ashamed to own good marie said very good now he is settled now you will give him to me nicole held the baby out with great care marie took him with an automatic competence she would never lose supporting his head in her right hand as she shifted him into the crook of her left arm he is so small she murmured as little lucien flailed his arms at random when you have not had one in the house for a while you forget how small a newborn baby is hes a goodsized fellow leonard odoull said almost eight pounds he felt like an elephant when i was having him nicole added marie ignored them both so small she crooned so small here give him to me lucien said his wife gave him a dirty look but passed him the baby after another minute or so he discovered he still knew how to hold an infant too his tiny namesake stared up at him from deep blue eyes he knew they would get darker over time but how much darker might prove an interesting question leonard odoull had green eyes galtier murmured what are you thinking little one what can he be thinking but who is this strange man georges said he could be thinking why is this man about to clout his son in the side of the head galtier returned he and georges were both laughing had lucien tried clouting his son in the side of the head he suspected georges could and would have made him regret it odoull said he probably is thinking who is this strange man before galtier could do more than raise an eyebrow his soninlaw went on he is also thinking what is this strange world everything must seem very peculiar to a baby lights and sounds and smells and touch and all the rest he never knew any of that before not where he was galtier found it indelicate to mention where the baby had been before he was born by their expressions so did both his sons he reminded himself odoull was a doctor and thought differently of such things let me hold the baby now father denise said as lucien handed his grandson to her someone knocked on the front door whos that odoull said in some annoyance then he laughed at himself only one way to find out n estce pas he opened the door there stood bishop pascal plump and pink and looking as impressive as a plump pink man could in miter and cope and cassock he almost always had a broad smile on his face and today was no exception did i hear correctly that this house had a blessed event last night he asked and then seeing little lucien in denises arms he pointed oh very good very good indeed i see that i did hear correctly his eyes twinkled i am glad to know that my sources of information remain good what he meant was lam glad my spies are on the job lucien understood that perfectly well if odoull didnt it wasnt because galtier hadnt told him but bishop pascal was not an overt foe to galtier these days and had never been a foe to any american on the contrary dr odoull said come in your grace come in yes nicole had a little boy last night he handed the bishop a cigar how wonderful bishop pascal exclaimed he held out his arms denise glanced at galtier who nodded ever so slightly she passed the bishop the baby he proved to know how to hold him beaming he asked and how is he called lucien leonard odoull answered ah excellent no bishop pascal never stopped smiling he aimed that large mouthful of teeth at galtier your name goes on lucien nodded bishop pascal turned back to odoull you should make sure that as this little fellow grows up he learns your language as well as the tongue of the republic of quebec he surely meant it as good advice it probably was good advice it made galtier bristle all the same leonard odoull answered in a mild voice these days and i expect the rest of my days the language of the republic of quebec is my language i meant no offense bishop pascal said quickly with the world as it is today though knowing english will help a young man throughout his life that had been true before the war it was as the bishop had said likely to be even more true now with quebec so closely involved with the usa that didnt mean lucien had to like it worth a damn though and he didnt sylvia enos lit a cigarette she sucked smoke down into her lungs held it there and blew it out again then she took another drag she didnt feel nearly the exhilaration she had when shed started the habit but she did enjoy it when she couldnt smoke as on the line at the galoshes factory she got tense even jittery like so many of the other women working there shed taken to sneaking smokes in the restroom the place always smelledlike a saloon then she had to return to the line into the can of paint went her brush she painted a red ring around the top of one of the black rubber overshoes sitting there in front of her then around the other working fast so the endless belts of the factory line would not carry them away before she could finish another pair of galoshes still warm from the mold appeared before her she put rings on them too down the line they went the next girl armed with knives and shears trimmed excess rubber from the galoshes she threw the scraps into a bin under her foot when the bin filled the scraps would go back into the hopper along with fresh rubber to be made into new overshoes the factory wasted nothing and did everything as cheaply as possible that was why sylvia still had a job had a man taken it they would have had to lay out a little more money every week after a while the stink of rubber started to give her a headache that happened every morning by ten oclock it also gave her another reason to wish for a cigarette or maybe a whole pack what shed discovered the first day she lit up got truer the more she smoked tobacco did blunt her sense of smell frank best headed her way she groaned silently the foreman was carrying an overshoe where shed missed part of the red line around the top she knew what hed say before he said it that didnt stop him thought you were going to slip this one by didnt you im sorry mr best sylvia said she didnt want him to have any kind of hold on her here give it to me ill fix it he held on to it you know sylvia it really is too bad i have to take one out of a pair like this it holds up the line and delays everybody i hope i wont have to do it very often from now on he was holding up the line too by lecturing her she didnt say so she knew a lost cause when she saw one ill do my best not to let it happen again she said please let me fix it at last best did as if she were leonardo working on the mona lisa sylvia completed the red ring she handed the rubber overshoe back to best please she thought take it back to wherever you spotted it and leave me alone lectures were one thing and bad enough the rest of his routine was worse that didnt keep him from trotting it out you really should pay more attention to what youre doing he said i would be disappointed and i know you would be too if you made mistakes like this very often work is sometimes hard to find these days mr best i dont make mistakes like this very often sylvia answered youve said so yourself he went on as if she hadnt spoken if the people above you are happy with you though things are liable to go a lot better for you she knew how he wanted to be above her on a bed in some cheap hotel room she found the idea more appalling than appealing now that george was gone she did have times when she missed a man sometimes very much frank best though was emphatically not the man she missed not understanding him seemed the safest course here ill be extra careful from now on mr best i promise i will he gave her a sour look she wondered if he would make himself plainer if he said sleep with me or lose your job what would she do shed get up and quit that was what maybe her expression said as much for he turned and walked away muttering under his breath sylvia got back to work she took extra care with the rings all morning long if best wanted an excuse to bother her hed have to invent one she didnt want to give him any she felt his eye on her more than once but pretended not to notice at last the lunch whistle blew was frank singing his little beniceorelse song at you sarah wyckoff asked gnawing on a chicken leg probably left over from supper the night before he sure was sylvia took a fierce bite of her own sandwich which was made from dayold bread and sausage that tasted as if it were about half sawdust for all sylvia knew it was it cost half as much as a better brand that mattered he has no shame may cavendish said none hes a foreman sarah said of course he has no shame a foreman at the canning plant where i used to work got one of the girls there in a family way sylvia said her friends made sad clucking noises and nodded knowingly i never found out if he married her afterwards or noti got fired because i had to take care of my kids when they caught the chicken pox she thought isabella antonelli would have come and let her know if everything had turned out all right she hadnt seen the other woman from the canning plant in a long time that might have meant isabella was deliriously happy and didnt need her any more it was more likely to mean the foreman from the canning plant had left her in the lurch sylvia wondered if shed ever find out what had happened life didnt tie up every loose end with a neat bow the way novels did thats just like a man sarah wyckoff studied her own brawny forearm nobodys going to trifle with me not and keep his teeth he wont may sighed men make it so you dont want to live with them and they make it so you cant hardly make a living by yourself you dont make as much as a man would doing the same job and they dont let you do half the jobs anyhow you tell me whats fair about that if they didnt pay us less than they would a man we wouldnt have these jobs weve got here sylvia said the other two women nodded and they wont let us vote here in massachusetts either may said bitterly theyve got to pass a law that says we can and whos got to pass it men thats who you think more than half the men over at the new state house are going to vote for women hasnt happened yet and im not going to hold my breath either there are a lot of states where it did happen sylvias voice was wistful the world didnt end either youd figure it did the way some men carry on sarah said mays right they arent worth the paper theyre printed on may ate an apple down to a very skinny core then took out a pack of cigarettes she lit one then blew an elegant smoke ring i like a smoke after i eat she said sort of settles whats in there if you know what i mean i sure do sylvia got out her own cigarettes the front of the pack showed soldiers in greengray marching to victory nobody ever showed the mangled corpses of soldiers in greengray and sailors in navy blue who didnt live to see victory sylvia never would have thought that way if she hadnt lost george now deliberately she turned the pack over so she wouldnt have to see those pinkcheeked soldiers thanks for giving me a cigarette that time may i like em now good may cavendish had been about to put her cigarettes back into her handbag she stopped and aimed the pack at sarah want to tryem no thanks sarah shook her head ive smoked a couple of times never liked it enough to keep up with it dont expect i would now either have it your own way may said with a shrug she did put away the pack sylvia smoked her cigarette with determination she coughed only once her chest was getting used to tobacco smoke too and may was right even without the buzz shed got when first starting the habit a smoke after dinner or supper was more enjoyable than just about any other time george had liked to smoke after they made love sylvias ears heated as she remembered that she wondered what taking a deep drag while lazy in the afterglow would be like probably pretty nice she thought would she ever have the chance to find out there have to be some decent men out there somewhere she said suddenly a lot of them are dead sarah said my martin is she sighed and looked down at the grimy wood of the floor i still cant think about him without wanting to puddle up i dont even know if id ever want to be with anybody else i would if i could find somebody may said but a lot of the men who are decent are settled down with their wives on account of thats what decent men do and a lot of men whether theyre decent or not dont want anything to do with you if youve got children oh theres one thing they want to do with you sylvia said both her friends laughed at the obvious truth in that sylvia went on but those arent the decent ones maybe i ought to go to church more often but sundays the only chance i have to rest even a little not that i can get much with two kids in the house plenty of men who go to church every livelong sunday arent what youd call decent either may said sounding as if she was speaking with the voice of experience they dont go there to pray or to listen to the sermonthey go on account of theyre on the prowl thats disgraceful sylvia said sweetheart theres a whole lot of disgraceful things that go on in this world sarah wyckoff said with authority you dont have to look no further than frank best if you want to see some well heaven knows thats true sylvia said with a sigh now that ive told him no i only hope he leaves me alone and doesnt take it out on me like he said he was liable to all depends said may whod been at the galoshes factory longer than sylvia if he finds somebody who goes along with him before too long hell forget about you if he doesnt you may not have such a good time for a while sylvia wondered how she ought to feel about hoping some other young woman succumbed to what best thought of as his fatal charm it would make her own life easier no doubt about that but would she wish the foreman on anyone else she couldnt imagine disliking anyone enough to hope she suffered such a fate when the whistle announcing the end of the lunch hour blew she headed without enthusiasm back to her position just behind the galoshes molds she reminded herself to do the best job she could painting rings on the rubber overshoes to give frank best no reason to bother her but would he need an excuse here he came that wasnt blood in his eye sylvia recognized the expression george had often worn it when hed been away at sea for a long time frank best hadnt been though she would cheerfully have dropped him off a pier he wore the expression anyhow sylvia sighed the end of the day seemed years away sometimes roger kimball still wished hed gone to south america every so often the charleston papers gave tantalizing bits of news about the fighting that continued down there even though the great war was over everywhere else the local enmities had started long before the war and werent about to disappear because it did everybody but paraguay and bolivia needed submarine skippers and they would have if only theyd had coastlines but hed stayed in charleston almost two years now and hed probably stay a while longer for one thing he saw anne colleton every so often not so often as he would have liked not quite so seldom as to make him give up in dismay he understood how carefully she rationed their liaisons it would have infuriated him more if he hadnt admired her too and for another hed found or thought hed found a way to help put the confederate states back on their feet clarence potter whod become a friend instead of a barroom acquaintance thought he was crazy i cant believe youve gotten yourself sucked into the freedom party potter said one evening in kimballs small furnished apartment those people couldnt start a fire if you spotted them a lit torch and kindling im one of those people clarence kimball said with only a slight edge to his voice and thank you to keep a civil tongue in your head no youre not potter said your deplorable taste in politics aside youre an intelligent man believe me that makes you stand out from the common herd in the freedom party it makes you stand out from jake featherston too he held up a hand dont get me wrongfeatherstons not stupid but he has no more education than youd expect and the only thing hes good at is getting up on the stump and making everyone else as angry as he is jack delamotte took a pull at his whiskey ive heard him talk myself now he even makes me angry and im usually too damn lazy to get mad about anything we need to get angry dammit kimball said too much wrong with this country not to get angry about it the moneys still not worth anything the damnyankees wont let us have a proper army and navy and half the niggers in the country act like they own it you cant tell me different you know damn well its true featherston has about as good a chance of solving those problems as the man in the moon potter said maybe less clarence is right jack delamotte said hes like one of those nigger preachers he gets folks all hot and bothered sure as hell but you look at what he says and you see he doesnt really say anything at all thats all right kimball said placidly potter and delamotte both looked startled kimball pointed at the former intelligence officer clarence the first time we met you were talking about finding a goal for the csa and getting people to stick to it you remember that of course i do potter said it was true then and its still true now its truer than ever now because weve drifted longer without a rudder kimball chuckled trying to talk like a navy man are you well all right go ahead but you know this featherston character right he waited for potter to nod then went on like jack said hes awful damn good at riling people up if he doesnt have any kind of education so what so much the better matter of fact what do you say we get hold of him and give him the kind of ideas the confederate states need to get back on their feet you and me and clarence saving the country delamotte didnt just seem dubious he seemed on the point of laughing out loud somebodys got to roger kimball answered he wasnt laughing not now nobody in richmond knows how thats for damn sure what do you say clarence will featherston listen to you potter rubbed his chin his gray eyes held uncertainty something kimball had rarely seen in them at last he said i dont know for certain he hated officers in general but he didnt hate me in particular because i did him some good turns but does that mean wed be able to steer him the way we want him to go im not sure im not sure hes in the habit of listening to anybody either hes as stubborn as they come jack delamotte looked down into his glass which was empty easy enough to get on a tigers back he observed how do you get off again oh wed manage that potter said confidently any of the three of useven you jack no matter how lackadaisical you let yourself getis a match for featherston and then some thats settled then kimball said though it wasnt not anywhere close well get hold of featherston fill him full of what we figure he ought to say and get people to pay attention to what really needs doing he picked up the whiskey bottle from the table yanked out the cork and poured fresh drinks for himself and his friends they solemnly clinked glasses as was his way kimball wasted no time trying to make what he planned come true hed become a familiar fixture at the freedom party offices over on king street next to the headquarters of the washington light infantry a unit that as its name suggested had fought in the wars of the csa and the usa since the revolution no commander a fellow there said from behind a typewriter i dont know when sergeant featherston will be coming into south carolina again it shouldnt be too long though with congressional elections this fall hell be doing a deal of traveling i reckon we aim to send richmond a message from all across the country thats fine kimball said thats mighty fine thing is id like to send a message to sergeant featherston having failed to become an officer the leader of the freedom party took an upsidedown pride in his noncommissioned rank kimball kept his face carefully straight while referring to it i just found out a friend of mine served in the army of northern virginia and got to know him pretty well up there hed like to have the chance to say hello a lot of people served in the army of northern virginia the freedom party man said i did myself as a matter of fact and youd be surprised how many of them say now that they knew sergeant featherston then my friends name is potter clarence potter kimball said patiently he told me the name i should mention is pompey that sergeant featherston would know what it meant quite casually he set a gold dollar a tiny little coin on the desk by the typewriter the freedom party man licked his lips a gold dollar could buy a couple of thousand dollars worth of banknotes these days he made the coin disappear not hard when it was so small i reckon i can arrange a wire up to richmond youre righti know hed be glad to hear from an old friend and especially through party channels kimball could have sent the telegram himself but how many telegrams did jake featherston get every day piles without a doubt hed made himself widely known through the csa how many of those telegrams got tossed unread hed pay more attention to the ones that came from inside his own outfit thanks friend kimball said and headed off to a poker game well pleased with himself he won too which left him even more pleased when he strolled back into the freedom party headquarters a couple of days later the fellow whod pocketed the gold dollar held out a pale yellow telegram kimball took it with a confidence that evaporated as he read the message major potter if you cared about seeing me you could have done it a long time ago featherston sgt st richmond howitzers he knows your friend i reckon the freedom party man said but it doesnt sound like hes real hot to pay him a visit no it doesnt kimball agreed morosely thanks for trying anyhow now that he knew the man took bribes he might want to pay him off again which meant not growling at him now but what he really wanted to do was get hold of jake featherston if potters name wasnt the key that fit the lock he needed one that would as he left the freedom party office he snapped his fingers maybe he knew where to find it since he had no telephone in his flat he went over to the telephone exchange building and placed a call up to st matthews it took a little while to go through by now anne colletons brother was used to kimball calling even if he didnt quite accept him but anne answered the telephone herself hello roger she said when she found out who was on the other end of the line what can i do for you today kimball had learned to read her tone of voice it said if you re calling because you want to sleep with me forget about it under other circumstances that would have angered him it still did a little but he buried that what do you think of the freedom party he asked he took her by surprise there were several seconds of silence up in st matthews before she answered i havent really thought much about it one way or the other it certainly has been making a lot of noise lately though hasnt it now she might have been a detective whipping out a magnifying glass why do you want to know he explained what he had in mind for the freedom party finishing people are starting to listen to this featherston if he says the right things he might be the one who can haul the country out of the swamp well anne said after another thoughtful pause i dont know what i expected you to say when you called but that wasnt it she hesitated again why do you think featherston would listen to me kimball hadnt wanted featherston listening to her hed wanted the freedom party leader listening to what he had to say maybe anne would say the same things he would have but he had no guarantee about that still she was waiting for an answer and he gave her a blunt one youve got money you ever hear of a politicianany sort of politicianwho didnt need money she laughed youre right about that heaven knowsand so do i the hard way i dont know that i want to spend any of my money on the freedom party but i dont know that i dont either let me do some checking around and see if it would be money well spent if i decide it is i expect i can find a way to let featherston know i want to have a talk with him she spoke about the freedom party as if it were a firm in which she was considering an investment in a way that was probably just what it was to her as far as roger kimball was concerned politics and investments were two separate worlds maybe that meant anne colleton was the right person to approach featherston after all kimball said all right thats fair enough thanks when he didnt say anything more anne teased him no sweet talk roger have you gone and found somebody else after you anyone elsed be boring he answered this time pleasure filled her laugh he went on i just didnt reckon itd work today thats all youre a smart man she said getting such praise from her pleased kimball much more than getting it from clarence potter had done tom colleton looked quizzically at anne he asked are you really sure you want to do this what meet with jake featherston she asked her brother nodded she exhaled in some exasperation seeing as hes going to be on the train that gets to st matthews in half an hour dont you think its a little late to worry about that if i show him up now ive made an enemy im liable to have made a dangerous enemy i dont care to do that thank you very much i suppose youre rightyou usually are tom still looked unhappy i cant say i much fancy what ive heard about him though hush anne said absently as she walked over to the closet i want to pick out the hat that goes best with this dress the dress was of orchid cotton voile with a newstyle square collar and with ruffles at the sleeves waist hips and a few inches above the anklelength hemline it managed to be stylish and to suit the formidable south carolina climate at the same time the flowered hat she chose had a downturned brim that was also of the latest mode she didnt know how much attention featherston paid to fashion shed tried to find out what he thought of women all shed been able to learn was that he was a bachelor not being able to find out more left her obscurely irked are you sure you want to come along tom she asked one thing we do know is that he doesnt love officers next enlisted man i meet who does love officers will be the first her brother pulled out his pocket watch wed better get going if you aim to meet him at the station do you expect the train to run on time anne asked but she went with him as it happened the train did run late but only by twenty minutes or so hardly enough time in which to start fuming it pulled into the battered stationnot all the damage from the black uprising had been repairedwith wheels squealing and sparking as the brakes brought it to a halt and with black smoke and cinders belching from the locomotives stack anne brushed soot from her sleeve with a muttered curse that made tom chuckle and that no one else heard only two people got off the train in st matthews since one of them was a fat colored woman figuring out who the other one was did not require brilliance the lanky white man dressed in butternut trousers a clean white shirt and a straw hat looked around for people to greet him as any traveler might have done mr featherston anne called and the newcomer alertly swung toward her his features were pinched and not particularly handsome but when his eyes met hers she had to brace herself for an instant roger kimball had been right whatever else he was jake featherston was not a man to take lightly she stepped toward him im anne colleton mr featherston pleased to meet you and thank you for coming down this is my brother tom right pleased to meet you both featherston said his virginia accent not bespeaking any great education when he shook hands with anne his grip was so businesslike it revealed nothing he turned to her brother you were an officer on the roanoke front isnt that right yes thats so tom said wasnt the only one doing some checking anne thought no featherston was not a man to be taken lightly not even a little bit he said ill try not to hold it against you from the lips of most former noncoms it would have been a joke anne and tom both started to smile neither let the smile get very big anne wasnt at all sure featherston was kidding he asked you have a motorcar here to take us wherever were going anne shook her head i didnt bother were only a couple of blocks from my apartment this isnt a big townyou can see that its an easy walk ill take your carpetbag there if you like tom added reaching out for it dont bother featherston said and did not hand it over ive been taking care of myself a long time now i can go right on doing it he nodded to anne lead the way miss colleton sooner were there sooner we can get down to business he was mostly silent as they walked along not a man with a large store of small talk as he walked he studied st matthews with military alertness he studied anne the same way his eyes kept coming back to her but not in the way of a man who looks on a woman with desire anne had seen that often enough to be most familiar with it no he was trying to size her up that was interesting usually till they realized she had a brain men were more interested in trying to feel her up back at the apartment featherston accepted coffee and a slice of peach pie he ate like a man stoking a boiler emptying his plate very fast then he said what can i do for you miss colleton i dont quite know anne answered what i do know is that i dont like the way the confederate states have been drifting since the end of the war id like the country to start moving forward again if the freedom party can help us do that maybe id like to help the freedom party i can tell you what i want for the csa featherston said i want revenge i want revenge on the damnyankees for licking us i want revenge on the damnfool politicians who got us into the war i want revenge on the damnfool generals in the war department who botched it i want revenge on the niggers who rose up and stabbed us in the back and i aim to get it revenge was a word that struck a chord with anne shed spent most of two years getting even with the blacks of the congaree socialist republic after theyd torched marshlands killed her brother jacob and almost killed her she dearly wanted to get even with the united states though she didnt see how the confederate states would be able to manage it any time soon still how do you propose to do all that she asked you said it yourself everything in the country seems dead right now featherston replied the freedom party is alive and growing people see that theyre starting to come over to us well elect congressmen this yearyou just wait and see if we dont before too long well elect a president he had all the confidence in the world that was certain tom remarked youre not running for congress yourself are you featherston shook his head thats rightim not dont want to sit there for one thing on account of i cant stand too many whore already in and for another i want to be able to go where i want to go when i want to go there if i had to stay in richmond too much of the time i wouldnt be able to do that so no im not going to the dance youre going to stay on the sidelines and call the tune anne said you might put it that way jake featherston agreed he had a pretty good poker face but it wasnt perfect anne saw his attention focus on her it still wasnt the look a man gave an attractive woman more like the look a sniper gave a target now hes realized im no fool she thought wonder if i should have let him know so soon i wonder if i should have let him know at all she also realized featherston was no fool not running for congress let him pick and choose his issues and what he did about them it also protected him from the risk of running and losing she had no feel yet for how smart he was but he was plenty shrewd what tune are you going to call she asked i already told you he answered i dont hide anything i aim to do i just come right out and say it an alarm whistle went off in annes head any man who said something like that was almost bound to be lying she kept her face quite still featherston continued platforms pretty simple like i said pay back the usa as soon as we can clean out the house and senate clean out the war department put the niggers back in their place best place for em you ask me is six feet under but ill settle for less for now still and all this is a white mans country and i aim to keep it that way what do you propose to do about the black men who got the vote by fighting in the army tom colleton asked most of em dont deserve it featherston said at once most ofem ran instead of fighting i was there i saw em do it i fired into em too to make em more afraid of me than they were of the damnyankees some did run tom agreed i saw that myself toward the end of the war i saw white troops break and run too he waited slowly featherston nodded looking unhappy about having to do it tom went on i saw some niggers fight pretty well theyre the ones im talking about how do you take their vote away wouldnt be hard once we got around to it featherston replied with breathtaking and anne thought accurate cynicism most decent white folks cant stand em anyway besides chances are the ones who fought hard against the usa learned how by fighting against the confederate states pin that on em call it treason and hang the lousy bastards what do we do if the united states try to stop us from getting strong again anne asked thats my biggest worry we walk small as long as we have to featherston said i hate it but i dont know what else to tell you we build up our strength every chance we get though and before too long we get to tell the damnyankees to leave us alone unless they want a sock in the nose that made sense to anne she couldnt see what else the csa could do in fact except become a supine us puppet she said so you want to get the negroes out of the towns and factories and back to the fields do you would keeping marshlands be worthwhile no she judged featherston had more on the ball than shed expected but the freedom party remained very new and raw it sought power it wasnt about to lay claim to much yet featherston answered thats about right miss colleton he eyed her again did he guess the calculation she was making she wouldnt have been surprised her gaze flicked over to tom that did surprise her she rarely relied on anyone to help her decide her brother shrugged ever so slightly he was leaving it up to her he did that more often than not she wished he wouldnt have not here featherston waited he had more patience than she would have thought he had more of quite a few things than shed thought she wasnt easy to impress but hed impressed her she said i think were traveling in the same direction mr featherston i suspect you could use some help along the road too we sure could he said we sure could when i joined the freedom party it operated out of a cigar box were better off than that now but not a whole lot contempt washed over him as if poured from a bucket most rich folks dont dare change what made em rich theyll go on sucking up to the whigs and the radical liberals while the country goes down the drain always good to find somebody who zigs when most folks zag he couldnt have paid her a compliment she appreciated more if hed tried for a week i think i may be able to help some she said how much depends on any number of things featherston got to his feet as if getting up on the stump put those niggers back in the fields where they belong his voice filled the apartment with a raspy thunder that didnt enter it when he was speaking in ordinary tones that took anne by surprise again and for a moment almost took her breath away she nodded recognizing the good bargain shed made she held out her hand jake featherston shook it you give the speeches she thought yes you call the tuneafter i whistle it to you lieutenant colonel abner dowling stared out across the prairie from general custers thirdstory offices in winnipeg hed been there with the general since winter and the view on a clear day never ceased to astonish him today he managed to put that astonishment into words my god sir its flatter than kansas it is isnt it custer agreed you can see forever or if you cant it certainly seems as though you can makes you think god pressed an iron to the countryside hereabouts doesnt it yes sir dowling nodded although from what ive read it wasnt an iron at all it was a great whacking sheet of ice that pressed the land down flat and didnt pull back or melt or whatever it did till not so very long ago i can believe that custer shivered melodramatically by the way the weather felt when we got to this place id say the glacier had been gone about a day and a halftwo days tops dowling laughed custer rarely joked here he might well have been kidding on the square during several days that winter the temperature never had managed to creep above zero nor even get very close to it there was a word for a place more than three hundred miles north of minneapolis siberia but people lived here before the war something like of them had lived here in abner dowlings considered opinion theyd been out of their minds oh from may to september the weather was good enough but that left a lot of time out of the bargain nowhere near so many people were left in winnipeg now a lot had fled during the two and a half years in which canadian and british forces had held the us army away from the critical rail junctions here a lot more had fled when they realized the canucks and limeys could hold the americans no more and a lot had died when the city finally fell one of the reasons dowling could see so far was that the building housing custers headquarters was one of the few in town to come through the war intact had it ever had any taller neighbors they were rubble now nothing got in the way of the view a lot of the new houses that were starting to go up in winnipeg these days were made from the wreckage of older structures one construction outfit even advertised itself as best rebuilders in town the company had plenty of material with which to work custer said i feel as though i can see all the way to the rockies i wish we could see all the way to the rockies from here sir dowling said it would make our jobs a lot easierand thats where a lot of our problems lie anyhow the broom didnt sweep clean custer said thats what the problem is thats why they sent me up here to set things to rights for as long as dowling had known him custer had had a remarkable gift for revising events so they fit neatly into a scheme of things sometimes existing only in his own mind the first part of his statement though was objectively true the us broom had not swept clean nor even come close the usa had conquered ontario and quebec severed eastern canada from the vast west byfinallyseizing winnipeg and struck north into the rockies to break the rail links with the pacific that had been enough to win the war but it had also left a couple of million square miles unvisited by us troops a lot of those square miles especially in the far north didnt have enough people on them to make anyone worry but the cities of the canadian prairieregina and saskatoon calgary and edmontonresented having been handed over to the united states when no soldier in greengray had got anywhere near them during the war they seethed with rebellion so did the farms for which they gave markets so did the logging and mining towns of british columbia so did the fishermen of newfoundland so for that matter did a great many people in the areas the united states had taken by force confound it lieutenant colonel how am i supposed to control half a continent without the soldiers i should have lost during one mediumsized battle in the great war custer demanded every time theres a new little uprising somewhere i have to rob peter of troops to pay paul so paul can put it down and then twenty minutes later peter needs the men back again we have kept the railroads hopping havent we sir dowling shook his head at the understatement the way the budgets going in congress we ought to count ourselves lucky that we still have as many soldiers up here as we do it wont get any better next year either socialists as custer usually did he turned it into a swearword i tell you dowling the machine guns most proper use is for shooting down the socialist blockheads who want to cut our country off at the knees blow enough of them to kingdom come and the rest might come to their sensesif they have any sense to come to which i am inclined to doubt yes sir dowling said resignedly he was a rocksolid democrat himself but not he thought with a certain amount of pride a political fossil like his superior custer said if things get any worse well have to start borrowing soldiers from the republic of quebec damn me to hell if i lie dowling started to laugh for custer to make two jokes in one day was wellnigh unprecedented then he realized custer wasnt joking for a moment he was inclined to scorn then all at once he didnt feel scornful any more every so often custer came up with an interesting notion sometimes without even realizing hed done it do you know sir id bet the frenchies over there would lend them to us dowling said and do you know what else id bet the soldiers from quebecd have a high old time clamping down on the englishmen who sat on them for so long that really might be worth looking into take care of it then custer said indifferently no he hadnt known that was a good idea hed just been talking to hear himself talk something he was fond of doing dowling scribbled a note to himself have to make quebec pay for the troops they send too he said that will make congress happy it might not make quebec happy but i wont lose any sleep over that if we cant twist quebecs arm whose can we twist if it werent for the united states that wouldnt even be a country today as far as he was concerned it wasnt much of a country but nobody in quebec had gone out looking for his opinion who cares whether quebec likes it or not custer said which meant hed thought along with dowling and which almost set dowling wondering if he hadnt miscalculated if custer agreed with him he had a good chance of being wrong he said i think we have managed to put down the latest flareup outside of edmonton thats something anyhow putting down flareups doesnt get the job done lieutenant colonel custer said i want to put them down so they dont start again one of these days i expect well have to raze one of these prairie towns to the ground itd serve the bastards right and after we do that the other canucks will get the idea that we mean business maybe sir dowling said his tone plainly making that maybe a no sometimes you couldnt be too plain for custer so he went on if we do that without good reason the rest of the world will raise a big stink to hell with the rest of the world custer said grandly the philosophy of a lifetime boiled down to eight words through the whole of his long span custer had done very much as he pleased hed had a good many breaks along the way but no one could deny hed made the most of them will there be anything more general dowling asked as a matter of fact there is one other thing custer hesitated which was most unlike him at last he resumed im afraid libbie and i have had to let our housekeeper go could you arrange for the hiring of another one wouldnt your wife sooner take care of that for you sir dowling asked warily when elizabeth custer joined her husband at a posting she ran their household with a whim of iron custer coughed a couple of times this once lieutenant colonel id like you to take care of it libbie is a marvelous womangod never made a finerbut she does have a habit of hiring sour driedup sticks with whom i have a certain amount of trouble getting on well i was hoping you might find a capable woman of cheerier disposition i see and dowling did libbie custer hired housekeepers in whom her husband could have no possible interest that was only common sense on her part for custer did have an eye for a pretty woman whether anything more than an eye still functioned at his age dowling did not know he didnt want to find out either now that custer had a real command again he didnt need some pretty young popsy distracting him and dowling didnt want to anger custers wife libbie made a far more vindictive far more implacable foe than her husband ever dreamt of being if dowling hired custer a popsy she would not be pleased with him he had his own coughing fit sir he said i really do think thats something best left to mrs custers judgment fiddlesticks custer said you handled such arrangements for me plenty of times during the war once more wont hurt you a bit whenever your wife was with you though sir she did prefer to keep such matters in her own hands dowling said i wouldnt care for her to think i was encroaching on her privileges youre not helping lieutenant colonel custer said irritably dowling stood mute if custer ordered him to choose a housekeeper he resolved to find the general the homeliest old crone he could lets see you ask me to do something like that again he thought but custer gave no such order instead he let out a long wheezy sigh here i am in command of all of canada he said and i find im not even in command of my own household dowling wondered how many other famous generals had been defeated by their wives a good many was his guess and he did not think that guess likely to be far wrong vii scipio was in love and wondered why in gods name hed never been in love before the best answer he could come up with and he knew it was nowhere near good enoughwas that hed always been too busy first hed had an education forcibly crammed down his throat then hed been butler at marshlands which under anne colleton was a job to keep any four men hopping and after that hed been swept up into the affairs of the congaree socialist republic now now as far as anybody in augusta georgia knew he was xerxes the waiter an ordinary fellow who did his job and didnt give anybody any trouble and bathsheba he was sure was the most marvelous creature god had seen fit to set on the face of the earth hed never had any trouble finding a woman to bed when he wanted one but hed never understood the difference between making love and being in love not till now he stroked bathshebas cheek as they lay side by side on the narrow bed in his furnished room i is the most luckiest man in the whole wide world he saidno originality but great sincerity she leaned over and kissed him and you are the kindliest man she said no one had ever called scipio anything like that before he hadnt had many chances to be kindly either now that he did he was doing his best to make the most of them bathsheba got out of bed and started to dress for the trip back across the hall to her room dont want you to go scipio said i got to she answered got to go clean for the white folks tomorrow mornin the work dont never go away he knew that among the reasons he loved bathsheba was the solid core of sense hed found in her it wasnt that he wanted to make love with her again that made him want her to stay since hed reached his forties second rounds didnt seem so urgent as they once had but he enjoyed talking with her more than with anyone else hed ever met he wished he could recite some of the love poetry hed learned the only way he knew it though was in the educated white mans accent hed been made to acquire using that accent mightno wouldmake her ask questions he couldnt afford to answer that was the one fly in the ointment of his happiness everything he said about his past had to be either vague or a lie even the name by which she knew him was false he counted himself lucky that he quickly got used to the aliases under which he protected his real identity back in south carolina reward posters with his true name on them still hung in post offices and police and sheriffs stations some might even have come into georgia though hed never seen one in augusta as if to flick him on that wound of secrecy bathsheba said one of these days im gonna know all about youeverything there is to know and do you know what else im gonna like every bit of it too i already likes everything there is to know bout you scipio said and her eyes glowed as for him he was glad of the butlers training that let him think one thing and say another without giving any hint of what was going on behind the expressions he donned like convenient masks bathsheba leaned down over the bed and gave him another kiss see you tomorrow night she said her voice rich with promise then she was gone gently closing the door behind her scipio rose and put on a light cotton nightshirt in augusta in early summer no one wanted anything more he picked up a fan of woven straw he wished the roominghouse had electricity he would have bought an electric fan and aimed it at the bed as he slept it got every bit as hot and oppressive here as it did over by the congaree hed heard it got even worse down in savannah he found that hard to believe but you never could tell his cheap alarm clock jangled him awake the next morning he yawned got out of bed and started getting dressed he had his white shirt halfway buttoned before his eyes really came open bathshebas door was closed when he left his room and everything quiet within her place she got up earlier than he did to cram the most work she could into a day the fry joint where he worked didnt serve breakfast he got eggs and grits and coffee at a place that did and paid for them with a banknote need another hundred on top o that the black man behind the counter said with a grimace scipio peeled off another banknote and gave it to him be a thousand tomorrow i reckons he said after considering the counterman shook his head not till next week i dont think he answered seriously despite those serious tones it was funny in a macabre way every day confederate paper dollars bought less and less scipio had just put down six hundred of them on a cheap breakfast if it was a thousand tomorrow or a thousand next week at the latest so what the printing presses would run off more banknotes with more zeros on them and another cycle would begin the good sweet smell of baking cornbread filled scipios nostrils when he went into erasmus fish store and restaurant the grizzled negro who ran the place nodded to him and said mornin mornin scipio answered he grabbed a broom and dustpan and started sweeping the floor he kept his furnished room as neat as he could and he did the same here even though erasmus had given him no such duty erasmus watched him now as he plied the broom the cook rarely said anything about it maybe he didnt know what to make of it maybe he was afraid that if he said anything scipio would quit doing it a couple of minutes later erasmus took the pan of cornbread out of the oven and set it on the counter to cool then he said make sure nobody steal the store xerxes im gonna git us fish fo today the ice man come before i git back put it in the trays there like you know how to do i takes care of it scipio promised erasmus by now had good reason to know his promises were reliable he headed out the door a fat bankroll made a bulge in his hip pocket the roll would be considerably thinner after he came back from the riverside fish market hed get good value for the money he spent though even in these times of runaway prices he always did off he went left behind to his own devices scipio went right on cleaning the ice man did come in scipio stuck some of the slabs of ice in the display trays and put the rest in the damp sawdust underneath those trays so it wouldnt melt before it was needed then he got a hammer and an ice pick and began to break up the ice in the trays from slabs to glistening chunks by the time hed finished dealing with the ice scipio wasnt hot any more his teeth chattered and he could barely feel his fingers he wondered if that was what living through a winter up in the usa felt like he doubted hed ever find out he didnt stay cold for long nothing could stay cold very long not in that weather he took a little chunk of cracked ice and dropped it down the back of his shirt it made him squirm and felt good at the same time erasmus came back with a burlap bag slung over his shoulder he grunted when he saw the ice in the trays come on he said to scipio got to clean us these here fish he did most of the cleaning himself hed long since seen that scipio knew how but he was an artist with the knife had he had a fancy education he might have made a surgeon instead of a fry cook scipio carried fish and set them on ice he also carried pink bloody fish guts out to the alley in back of the shop and flung them into a battered iron trash can he always hosed the can out right after the refuse collectors emptied it it still stank of stale fish flies buzzed around it flies buzzed everywhere in augusta when the weather was warm people knew when erasmus would be getting back with his fish within fifteen minutes of his return housewives started coming in to buy for their husbands and families when scipio first started working there theyd viewed him with suspicion as people had a way of viewing anyone or anything new with suspicion by now they took him for granted one woman carrying away a couple of catfish wrapped in old newspapers turned back and said to erasmus that xerxes he jew me down bettern you ever could old man it aint so hard these days not with money so crazy aint nobody knows what nothin supposed to cost erasmus answered the woman took her fish and departed scipio glanced over to his boss wondering if her comments had annoyed him erasmus gave no sign of that catching scipios eye he grinned at him as if to say the housewife had paid him a compliment business picked up as noon approached men started coming in and having their fish fried in the shop for dinner erasmus fried potatoes to go with them too and a big pot of greens never seemed to go off the stove a man could leave the table hungry but it wasnt easy and how the money flowed in hundreddollar banknotes five hundreds thousands even a tenthousand now and then scipio felt like a bank cashier as he made change he would have felt even more like a bank cashier and less like a poor negro if he hadnt been making a week himself next week erasmus would probably give him fifty or sixty or seventy however much it was it would keep food in his belly and a roof over his head and it wouldnt go a great deal further than that one more reason to marry bathsheba as soon as he could was that then theyd need only one roof over their two heads and save the cost of the secondnot that anyone could save anything much with prices as mad as they were trouble started about half past twelve the first hint of it scipio got was an angry shout from not far away freedom a moment later it came again from a lot of throats freedom theys buckra scipio exclaimed why fo buckra come into de terry carryin on like dat dont know erasmus tucked a knife into his belt dont much fancy the notion neither they aint got no business in this part otown whether they had business or not here they came straight up the street past the cafe a dozen or so white men all of them in white shirts and butternut trousers freedom they shouted again and again as they shouted they knocked down any negro in their path man woman or child what we do bout dat scipio said what can we do bout dat i know theys white folks but they got no call to do nothin like that you reckon yellin fo the police do any good erasmus erasmus shook his gray head not likely twothree of them fellas they was the police scipio thought about that for a little while he thought hed escaped terror for good when hed got free from the last wreck of the congaree socialist republic now he discovered hed been wrong i never thought id live to see the day sam carsten said as the uss remembrance steamed through st georges channel if he looked to starboard he could see englandno wales ireland lay to port george moerlein nodded i know what you mean he said pretty damn crazy us paying a courtesy call in dublin harbor only way a us warship wouldve been able to get into dublin harbor before the war or during it wouldve been to kick its way in sam agreed of course ireland belonged to the limeys then and we werent exactly welcome visitors well we are now moerlein said and if england doesnt like it let her try and start something shell get the idea pretty damn quick after we give her a good boot in the ass despite that bravado he looked east more than a little nervously the royal navy had been beaten in the great war but it hadnt been crushed england hadnt been crushed not the way the confederate states and france had been he had no doubt the usa and the german empire could crush her if they had to he also had no doubt theyd know theyd been in a scrap by the time they were through a destroyer flying a greenwhiteorange flag with a harp in the middle of the white led the way for the remembrance the destroyer had started life as a us fourstacker dozens much like her had gone into the water during the great war her crew consisted of irishmen whod begun their careers in the royal navy men like that thousands of them formed the basis for the irish navy i hope theyve got a good pilot up there carsten said a moment later he added i hope hes got good charts too a moment later still he made another addendum i hope none of the mines from the fields are drifting loose through the irish sea he thought that covered everything but his buddy showed him he was wrong as long as youre doing all that hoping hope the limeys havent snuck out and planted a few of those little bastards right in our path george moerlein said that wouldnt be very nice of them would it sam grimaced and they could always say something like oh were very sorrywe didnt have any notion that one was there how would anybody prove anything different you couldnt moerlein said you wouldnt have a prayer of doing it of course the good thing is that teddy roosevelt wouldnt need any proof if we come to grief here hell make england pay the limeys have to know it too i dont think theyll get gay with us heres hoping youre right carsten glanced up at the sky which was full of thick gray clouds beautiful day isnt it moerlein thought he was being sarcastic yeah if youre moss on a tree he answered i was hoping wed get sent down to south america myself to give brazil a hand against argentina thats my kind of weather no thanks carsten said with a shudder i burn like a rib roast in the galley after the cooks forgot about it when the remembrance came into dublin harbor she got a welcome about the size of the one the dakota had enjoyed coming into new york city after the end of the great war new york city boasted more people than the whole country of ireland but the ones who lined both sides of the river liffey cheered loud enough to make up for their lack of numbers as the remembrance drew near its assigned wharf sam was bemused by the sight of tens of thousands of people almost all of them as fairskinned as he was if you towed this place down to brazil youd give everybody here heatstroke in about a day and a half he said no one else paid him any attention if the other sailors on deck contemplated irishwomens skins as they doubtless did they had different things on their minds so for that matter did sam a couple of light gray german cruisers were berthed only a few piers over from the remembrance sailors aboard them waved toward the aeroplane carrier sam and his comrades waved back here in dublin americans and germans were both about the business of giving england a black eye all the same sam sent those cruisers an appraising glance wondering what going into battle against the squareheads would be like and officers aboard the german ships were bound to be photographing the remembrance so their bosses in berlin could figure out how to fight her and whether to build ships like her after shed been made fast the lord mayor of dublin and a redheaded fellow in a fancy naval uniform came aboard to welcome her to their country the lord mayor who wore a greenwhiteandorange sash made a speech the admiral studied the remembrance as if wishing he had a dozen of her class under the irish flag and so the lord mayor said at last in an accent that struck carstens ear as more nearly british than irish we are proud indeed to welcome this magnificent warship to our port a symbol of the affection between the united states and ireland that caused you to aid us in at last regaining our freedom after so many centuries of oppression at the hands of the british crown along with the rest of the assembled american sailors sam dutifully applauded during the war the usa would have done anything to help give england a rough time that more than affection had prompted us help for the irish rebellion the mayor didnt look stupid he had to know as much politicians looked to be the same on both sides of the atlantic had the world been a perfect place an irishman would have commanded the remembrance captain oliver roland though was a swarthy man of french descent he said the united states are delighted to welcome ireland into the family of nations along with those of poland and quebec her independence shows how the powers of the quadruple alliance respect the national aspirations of peoples whom our late foes for too long kept from the freedom they deserved the lord mayor bowed in delight the irish admiral clapped his hands beside sam willie moore let out a rude but quiet snort the guncrew chief proceeded to put words to it the poles get to do what the germans tell em and the froggies in quebec get to do what we tell em and the micks have never been any goddamn good at doing what anybody tells em that was cynical it was also very likely to be true a chief gunners mate could say it to a man in his crew had captain roland said it to the lord mayor of dublin it wouldnt have gone over so well the skipper had to be or at least had to act like a politician here we going to get liberty chief sam whispered to moore i hear we are moore whispered back other thing i hear is anybody picks up a dose of the clap theyre going to cut his balls off so he never ever gets a chance to do it again you understand what im saying i sure do sam answered in a whispered falsetto willie moores eyes opened wide for a moment then in lieu of laughing he started to cough damn you carsten you sly son of a bitch he wheezed he coughed again and gave sam a dirty look sam did his best to assume a mantle of angelic innocence by moores expression his best was none too good he did get liberty but not till three days later this close to england captain roland wanted to keep as near a full crew aboard the remembrance as possible maybe officers toured dublins cathedrals and other sights sam still thought about trying to become an officer himself he wasnt interested in cathedrals though he went into the first barpubs they called them herehe spotted only a couple of blocks away from the quay on the river liffey by which the remembrance lay guinness is good for you proclaimed a sign in the window it showed a healthylooking fellow pouring down a pint of stout sam had heard of guinness but hed never drunk any he couldnt imagine a better place to ease his thirst and improve his education at the same time in he went when he asked for the famous stout the publican beamed at him indeed and im happy to serve a yank he declared sounding much more like an irishman than had the lord mayor if you havent changed your money a quarter of a dollarll do it ill bet it will sam said not very happily back in the states he could buy five glasses of beer for a quarter but he wasnt back in the states and guinness was supposed to be something special he dug in his pocket and set a silver coin on the bar the irishman did give him full measure filling the pint pot to the brim and then using the last drips from the tap to draw a shamrock in the creamy head seeing sams eye on him he smiled shyly just showing off he murmured thanks sam said and lifted the glass in salute cheers he sipped at the guinness after a moments thought he nodded it might not have been worth a quarter but it came close a lot more was going on in that taste than in the pale watery beers he bought at home it put him in mind of drinking pumpernickel bread it packed a wallop too he could see where after three or four pints he wouldnt be hungry any more and he wouldnt be able to walk either he wasnt ready to get blind he had something else on his mind first you happen to know where i could find me a friendly girl he asked i do that the tapman answered you go round the corner herehe pointedthen knock at the house with the blue door tell em sean sent you and theyll take a wee bit off the price theyd give him his cut for sending trade their way was what he meant sam had got that same answer from a good many bartenders in his time it didnt bother him they werent in business for their health they wanted to make a buckno a pound herelike anybody else he drank another pint of guinness and then feeling a pleasant buzz found the house with the blue door seans name got him inside another one the madam said seeing his uniform christ you yanks are horny devils weve been at sea a long time maam sam answered before long he was happily settled upstairs with a plump blonde who said he could call her louise his first round ended almost before it started as often happened after a long time without he laid out some more cash and began again things were progressing most enjoyably when some sort of commotion broke out down below he concentrated on the business at hand till a raucous americanaccented voice bellowed any sailors off the remembrance who aint back aboard in an hour youre damn well gonna get stranded were sailing then that blue door slammed shut jesus sam said and applied himself he came in a few strokes that spoiled things for louise who he thought had been warming up nicely beneath him but he didnt have time to worry about her not any more she gave him an unhappy look as he scrambled into his clothes he didnt have time to worry about that either he was right behind one american leaving the whorehouse and right in front of another one panting he hurried up the gangplank to the remembrance what the hells going on he asked as he came aboard uprising in the north a sailor answered they dont want to cut englands apron strings up there the irish have asked us to give em a hand with our aeroplanes and guns and were going to do it oh all right sam thought for a moment then chuckled damn good thing they didnt rise up an hour earlier thats all ive got to say emily pinkard said i swear to jesus jeff if i didnt know where you was goin nights id reckon you had yourself another girl on the side well i dont jefferson pinkard gave his wife a severe look she was the one whod been unfaithful and now she had the nerve to think he might be emily dropped her eyes she knew what shed done jeff went on the freedom partys important dammit i dont think theres anything more important in the whole country right now what was she doing on nights when he wasnt home pinkard worried about that especially since bedford cunningham however much hed thought of jake featherstons speech hadnt followed up by joining the freedom party jeff had and kept going to party meetings before hed signed up everything had seemed pointless useless now his life had a focus hed found a cause its bigger than i am he said trying to make emily understand its more important than i am but im part of it thingsll get better and theyll get better partly thanks to me to me he jabbed a thumb at his own chest emily sighed people carry on too much about politics i swear they do you come right down to it none of that stuff means anything anyways werent for politics we wouldnt have fought the war jeff gave her a perfunctory kiss then headed out the door i aint got time to argue tonight i dont want to be late hed heard that the freedom party had started out meeting in a richmond saloon since alabama was a dry state the birmingham party headquarters couldnt imitate those of the founding chapter jeff regretted that he would have enjoyed sitting around with the new friends hed made and hashing things out over a couple of schooners of beer or shots of whiskey he enjoyed sitting around with his new friends anyway but doing it in a livery stable wasnt the same still the stable owner was a party member and the money he got for renting the place out once a week as a meeting hall helped keep him afloat with so many people going from carriages to motorcars these days he needed all the help he could get the chairman of the birmingham chapter was a beefy redfaced fellow named barney stevens hed been a sergeant during the war pinkard would have bet hed been a mean one at eight oclock on the dot he said come on boyslets get this show on the road together they sang dixie the singing wasnt of the best nor anywhere close that didnt matter roaring out the words to the confederacys national hymn reminded jeffand everyone elsewhy theyd banded together the good times the song talked about could come again the freedom party would make them come again after the last notes died stevens said boys the force that will conquer in the end is the fire of our young confederate manhood today new people who claim power are arising in the confederacy men whove shed their blood for the confederate states and know their blood flowed in vain through the fault of the men who ran the government jeff clapped till his hardpalmed hands were sore he looked around the stable a handful of the men there were of solid middle years most though were like him men in their twenties and early thirties whod been through the crucible of war and were ready to be poured into some new shape there are too damned many of us for the government to put down by force barney stevens declared and his audience applauded again we have to wreck what needs wrecking and by god theres plenty of it we have to be hard and tough the abscess on the body of the country needs cutting out and squeezing till the clear red blood flows and the blood needs to flow for a good long time before the body is pure again freedom jeff and the others shouted the stable the heavy air inside smelling of hay and horses echoed to the cry come this fall stevens went on youll need a new chairman here on account of the ninth district is going to send me to congress more cheers through them he said and when i get to richmond im going to have me a few things to say about freedom pinkard shouted again along with his comrades he had a hardon it made him laugh emily had been unfaithful to him with a man he was being unfaithful to her with the party stevens said between now and election day were going to make people notice us this saturday afternoon i hear tell the niggers our damnfool government gave the vote to are gonna hold a rallylike they was really citizens like they deserve to be citizens scorn dripped from his words he wasnt quite so good as the national chairman but he wasnt bad either he grinned out at the crowd how many of you boys want to put on white shirts and butternut pants and pay em a call almost every hand shot into the air one of the men stevens picked was jefferson pinkard the chairman of the birmingham chapter said meet me at the corner of cotton and forestdale two oclock saturday afternoon well have ourselves a good old time damned if we wont what about the cops somebody called from the back of the stable what about em barney stevens said contemptuously they aint gonna do nothin to hold us off a bunch of uppity niggers he grinned again and besides a lot of them is us most of the men at the meeting whom pinkard knew were steelworkers at the sloss foundries but there were plenty he didnt know well enough to have learned what they did he wouldnt have been surprised had some been policemen cops needed freedom like everybody else on the way out of the meeting he threw a banknote into the tin hat one of barney stevens friends was holding weekly dues would probably go to before long money didnt seem real any more it was dying along with so much of what he held dear ill make it better he thought i will emily was still up when he got home hed thought she would have gone to bed its late jeff she said youre gonna be walkin around like you was drunk tomorrow youll be so tired dont start in on me he growled somebody needs to start in on you his wife answered dangerous enough out on the foundry floor when youre awake her voice rose shrill and angry and worried too you go out there half asleep and dont start in on me i said he slapped her she stared at him her eyes enormous with shock hed never raised a hand to her not even when hed walked in on her and bedford cunningham why the hell not he wondered and found no answer he shoved her down the hall toward the bedroom then picked her up threw her down and took her by force theyd played lots of rough games over the years this was no game and they both knew it emily fought back as hard as she could pinkard was bigger and stronger and tonight meaner after he spent himself and pulled out she rolled away from him and cried her face toward the wall he fell asleep sated and happy with her sobs in his ears she didnt speak to him the next morning except to answer things he said to her but she made him his breakfast and handed him his dinner pail and generally took care not to get him angry he pecked her on the cheek and walked off to work whistling mornin mistuh pinkard vespasian said when he came onto the manmade hell that was the foundry floor just got here my ownself good morning vespasian jeff said cheerfully vespasian was the best kind of nigger sure enough one who knew his place pinkard could hardly wait for saturday afternoon he and his buddies would take care of some niggers who didnt know theirs theyd learn by god he glanced toward vespasian in a really proper world even the best kind of nigger wouldnt be doing any sort of white mans work hed be shoveling coal into the furnaces or out in the cotton fields where blacks belonged jeff wondered what the freedom party would do about that when it got the chance something worth doing he was sure of that after he finished his saturday halfday he hurried home and changed into a white shirt and trousers the color of the confederate uniform when he started toward the door emily asked ever so cautiously where are you going out he answered and did he got to the meeting place in good time barney stevens shook his hand good man stevens said and gave him a twofoot length of thick dowelingas formidable a club as any policeman carried well teach the niggers they cant get away with putting on airs like they was as good as white folks some of the freedom party men brought their own lead pipes or bottles or other chosen instruments of mayhem with seventy or eighty of them all together all dressed pretty much alike they made a formidable force jeffs spirit soared at being part of something so magnificent it soared again when a grayclad policeman on horseback waved and tipped his cap to the freedom party force lets go barney stevens said as if they were about to head out of their trenches and over the top and so in a way they were remember this is war hurt the enemy help your pals stay together obey my orders if i go down and out bill mclanahans next in line nowform column of fours the veterans obeyed without fuss theyd done it before countless times forardhaarch stevens barked magnolia park where the negroes were holding their rally was only a few blocks away their speaker stood on a platform on which confederate flags fluttered that made jeffs blood boil even more than birmingham summer did a dozen or so cops sufficed to keep a couple of dozen white hecklers away from the rally those white men werent organized the company from the freedom party was cries of alarm rose from black throats when the freedom party men came into sight double line of battle to the left and right barney stevens shouted and the men performed the evolution with practiced ease stevens pointed with his club as if it were a british field marshals baton charge freedom jeff yelled along with his friends a couple of policemen made halfhearted efforts to get between the freedom party men and the negroes the tough young veterans in white and butternut rolled over them jeff swung his club it smacked into black flesh a howl of pain rose his lips skinned back from his teeth in a savage grin he swung again and again and again a few of the black veterans fought back far more fled though some few of them might have gained the vote but a negro who fought a white man in the csa fought not just his foe but also the entire weight of confederate society and history inside five minutes the rally was broken up destroyed some of the white hecklers had joined the freedom party men none of the cops had made more than a token effort to hold them back a lot of negroes were down with broken heads jeff felt as if hed just stormed a yankee position in west texas he stood tall the sweat of righteous labor streaming down his face just for the moment he and his comrades were masters of all they surveyed the speaker of the house pointed toward flora hamburger the chair recognizes the honorable representative from new york he intoned thank you mr speaker flora said that was more than a mere courtesy seymour stedman of ohio was himself a socialist the first nondemocrat to be speaker since the first congress of president blaines disastrous term at the start of the s mr chairman i move that the house pass a resolution whose text i have conveyed to the clerk deploring and condemning the assaults against lawabiding negroes now taking place within the confederate states mr speaker several congressmen tried to gain stedmans attention as had been arranged he recognized hosea blackford second blackford said in a loud clear voice he and flora grinned at each other it has been moved and seconded that we adopt the resolution miss hamburger has conveyed to the clerk congressman stedman said the clerk will now read the resolution for debate read the clerk did in a deadly drone as soon as he finished stating the resolution flora had summarized hands shot up all around the house chamber speaker stedman said the chair recognizes his honorable colleague from ohio thank you mr speaker william howard taft rose ponderously to his feet then turned toward flora i should like to inquire of the distinguished representative from new york why she does not include in her resolution the disorders currently taking place in china russia south america france and spanish morocco all of those being no less beyond the boundaries of the united states and the purview of the house of representatives than the events condemned in the confederate states flora glared at taft and there was a lot of him at which to glare with the socialists and republicans holding a slim majority in the house he no longer chaired the transportation committee and could not use his power there to make her life miserable he seemed to have trouble realizing that a lot of democrats did they took power for granted even when it wasnt there i would answer the gentleman from ohio in two ways she said first what happens in the confederate states is vitally important to the united states because the confederate states are so close and so closely related to us and second the attacks on the negroes there are fierce unjustified and altogether unprovoked theyre only niggers for christs sake somebody called out without waiting to be recognized who the devil cares what the rebs do to them order speaker stedman slammed down the gavel the chair recognizes the honorable representative from dakota thank you mr speaker hosea blackford said that unmannerly fellow gives me the chance to quote donne and i shall not waste it no man is an island entire of itself every man is a piece of the continent a part of the main if a clod be washed away by the sea europe is the less as well as if a promontory were as well as if a manor of thy friends or of thine own were any mans death diminishes me because i am involved in mankind and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls it tolls for thee if the confederates now permit the terrorizing of their negroes as appears to be true from the reports reaching us who can guess what they may permit a year from now or five years or ten i have two questions for the gentleman from dakota said the democrat who rose to reply to blackford the first is why do you think the confederate states will pay any attention to a resolution from this house the second is if you socialists want us to do something the confederate states will pay attention to why have you taken a meat axe to the war department budget the second question in particular made flora wince shed urged and voted for cutting the military budget too and the reasons for which shed done sochief among them that the country could no longer afford to keep spending as it hadstill seemed good to her but she had to admit that a warning delivered under credible threat of war would have done far more to deter the thugs who called themselves the freedom party than any resolution from the house of representatives as debate went on she also began to see that even the resolution was going to have a hard time passing a lot of democrats proclaimed that they did not care to be seen meddling in the internal political affairs of a neighboring sovereign state speaker stedman countered that one with a sardonic gibe as we wont meddle in the affairs of the republic of quebec had we not meddled in those affairs there would be no republic of quebec but the congressman whod said theyre only niggers had spoken for a great many of his colleagues whether they would come out and admit it or not flora had expected little better from the democrats but the republicans mostly farmbelt congressmen from the midwest also proved to have little sympathy for the colored mans plight and even one socialist stood up and said this is not an issue that concerns the people of my district the people of your district dont care about pogroms flora shouted angrily which made speaker stedman bang the gavel against her when stedman called the question floras resolution fell eighteen votes short of passage as the hour now nears six i move that we adjourn for the day the speaker said his motion carried by voice vote without a single dissenter heard the house floor emptied rapidly still furious flora made no effort to hide it what will they do when the bell tolls for them she demanded of hosea blackford who can guess till the time comes he answered with a wry smile you dont win all the time flora for a lot of years we hardly won at all we are on the record even if the resolution failed if things go on we can bring it up again later in the session you take the long view of things she said slowly id better after all the worthwhile resolutions and bills ive seen die blackford flashed that wry grin again for now what sort of view do you take toward supper im in favor of it flora admitted with luck someplace where they know how to serve up crow oh i think we can do a little better than that he said and took her to a chophouse theyd visited a couple of times before after mutton chops and red wine the world did seem a less gloomy place brandy afterwards didnt hurt either blackford took out a cigar case he waited for floras nod before choosing and lighting a panatela between puffs he asked shall we go out dancing or to a vaudeville show flora thought about it then shook her head she wasnt that happy no thanks not tonight why dont you just take me back to my flat all right if thats what you want blackford rose and escorted her out to his motorcar the ride back to the apartment building where they both lived passed mostly in silence they walked upstairs together the hallway across which their doors faced each other was quiet and dim dimmer than usual because one of the small electric light bulbs had burned out as usual blackford walked flora to her doorway as usual he bent to kiss her goodnight the kiss that followed was anything but usual maybe flora was trying to make up for the days disappointment maybe it was just the brandy talking through her she didnt know or care neither evidently did hosea blackford whew he said when at last they broke apart i think you melted all the wax in my mustache floras laugh was shaky her cheeks felt hot as if in embarrassment but she was not embarrassed her heart pounded she turned wondering if the routine business of unlocking and opening her door would still the tumult in her it didnt she reached for the light switch by the door then looked back to blackford would you like to come inside she asked good he began responding to the good night shed always given him before then he heard what shed really said he asked a question of his own are you sure she leaned forward and stood on tiptoe to kiss him on the end of the nose hed never pushed her to go further than she wanted to go pushing her would have done no good as a lot of people in congress and out could have told him but he hadnt needed telling he wasnt pushing now she liked him very much for that and for the feel of his lips pressed against her his body pressed against her yes she said firmly could never have done this back in new york she thought as they sat side by side on the sofanot with everyone who lives in our apartment but even that wasnt true when yossel reisen was about to go off to war her sister sophie had found a way to give him a womans ultimate giftand hed given her a gift in return a gift that now bore his name a gift hed never lived to see if you wanted to badly enough you could always find a way shed never dreamt she might want to so badly when in an experimental way blackford slipped an arm around her she pinned him against the back of the sofa this kiss went on much longer than the one in the hallway had and left her feeling as if she might explode at any moment blackford kissed her eyes her cheeks his mouth slid to the side of her neck then up to her ear every time his lips touched her skin she discovered something new and astonishing and wonderful he nibbled at her earlobe murmuring you dont know how long ive wanted to do this darling she didnt answer not with words but left no doubt about what she wanted but going into her bedroom with him a few minutes later was another long step into the unknown she didnt turn on any of the lights in there no matter how much urgency filled her the idea of undressing in front of a man left her shaking even so she sighed with relief as she slid off her corset on a hot muggy latesummer night bare skin felt good her bare skin soon felt quite a lot better than good she was amazed at the sensations hosea blackfords hands and lips and tongue evoked from her breasts and then amazed again when one hand strayed lower shed stroked herself now and again but this was different every touch every movement a startlement the small altogether involuntary moan of pleasure she let out took her by surprise but that surprise also recalled her partly to herself she remembered sophies horror and panic out on the balcony of the family flat when her sister told her she was pregnant i cant have a baby she exclaimed blackford hesitated studying her in the halflight had she made him angry if he got up and left now she would die of humiliationand frustration but to her vast relief he nodded one of the reasons i care for you so much is for your good sense he said well make sure everything is all right he bent so that his mouth went where his hand had gone before flora had literally never imagined such a thing she hadnt imagined how good it felt either when pleasure burst over her it made everything shed done by herself seem beside the point was the best way she found to think of it if hed done that for her she ought to return the favor though she didnt quite know how awkwardly she took him in her hand as she drew near she saw he looked strange from inadvertencies around the family apartment she knew how a man was made hosea blackford was made a little differently hes not circumcised she realized shed forgotten that consequence of his being a gentile she kissed him and licked him he needed only a moment to understand she didnt know what she was doing put it in your mouth he said quietly she did though she hadnt imagined that only minutes before any more than the other the sound he made was a masculine version of her moan encouraged she kept on she didnt need to keep on very long he grunted and jerked and spurted it caught her by surprise and didnt taste very good she coughed and sputtered and gulped before she could help herself when she could speak again she asked was that right he put her hand over his heart which pounded like a drum if it were any more right he assured her id be dead she laughed and lay beside him still marveling that such pleasure was possibleand ever so relieved that unlike sophie she would not have to worry about consequences nine months later atlanta the conductor called stepping into the car in which jake featherston rode all out for atlanta he strode down the aisle making sure no one could doubt the upcoming stop featherston grabbed his carpetbag and sprang to his feet his seat had been in the middle of the car but he was one of the first people off it he was one of the first people to a taxicab too the kendall hotel he told the driver sure thing the fellow answered the hotel proved to be only a few blocks east of terminal station brakes squealed as the driver stopped in front of the massive brick building with moorishlooking turrets and ornaments thatll be twelve here you go jake handed him a banknote and a i dont need any change with the taximans tip he would have got back only a hundred dollars two hundred if he wanted to be a cheapskate he didnt anyhow with currency the way it was these days you had to be crazy to worry about anything as small as a hundred bucks a uniformed negro porter came up to carry his bag he gave the black man a hundred dollars that was what such nearly worthless banknotes were good for it was also he thought what nearly worthless black men were good for when jake gave his name at the front desk the clerk handed him his key and then said i have a message here for you mr featherston he plucked an envelope from a pigeonhole and presented it with a flourish thanks featherston pulled out the envelope and unfolded the sheet of paper inside it read knight got in this morning if you see this in time have supper with us at seven tonight in the hotel restaurant amos mizell he stuck the note in his pocket how do i find the restaurant he asked the desk clerk down that corridorsecond doorway on your leftfirst is the bar the young man answered shyly he went on its an honor to have you in the kendall mr featherston freedom freedom yeah jake was still getting used to people recognizing his name it was he found very easy to get used to another colored porter carried the bag up to his room and earned another hundred dollars jake snorted imagining a hundreddollar tip before the war he unpacked his clothes then pulled a watch from his pocket and checked the time it was half past five he didnt feel like sitting in the room for an hour and a half like a cabbage so he went down to the bar and peeled off a banknote for a beer he nursed the one glass till it was time for supper the last thing he wanted was to go to this meeting drunk or even tipsy when he left the bar and headed over to the restaurant a professionally obsequious waiter led him to a table in a quiet corner not the best seating in the place for anyone who wanted to show off but a fine place to sit and eat and talk two other men were already sitting and talking featherston would have pegged them both for veterans even had he not known they were they got to their feet as he approached featherston the taller one asked jake nodded in a twanging texas accent the fellow went on im willy knight of the redemption league and this here is amos mizell who heads up the tin hats pleased to meet you gents jake said shaking hands with both of them he wasnt sure how pleased he was to meet knight the freedom party was growing only slowly west of the mississippi not least because the redemption league spouted similar ideas there supper with amos mizell was a feather in his cap though the tin hats were far and away the largest exsoldiers organization in the csa mizell sipped from a whiskey glass in front of him he was about forty and missing the little finger on his left hand he said i think all three of us are going in the same direction i think all three of us want to see the country going in the same direction too what we want to do is make sure nobody sidetracks anybody else thats right knight nodded he was blond and handsome and wore an expensive suit all of which made jake jealous thats just right he went on if we bang heads the only ones who win are the damnyankees fair enough jake smiled as he might have smiled over a bad poker hand knight reminded him of an officer which in his book was another black mark against the redemption league man we might have been smarter not to talk till after the congressional elections though then wed have a better notion of whos strong and who isnt almost imperceptibly willy knight winced featherston grinned at him the fierce grin of defiance he threw at everyone who got in his way the freedom party was stronger than the redemption league at least for now it had its base in the more populous eastern part of the confederate states and was reaching west where only a relative handful of people on this side of the mississippi belonged to the redemption league again mizell played peacemaker one thing certain is were stronger together than we are apart the tin hats werent a political party so he wasnt a direct rival to either of the men at the table with him but if he tipped to one or the other of them his influence would not be small they paused when the waiter came up knight ordered a beefsteak mizell fried chicken and jake a ham steak im shooting for ten congressmen next session he said though he expected perhaps half that many would win seats how about you knight well win dallasim pretty sure of that the leader of the redemption league said they can see the yankees up in sequoyah and over in that damned new state of houston from there we may take a couple of other seats too ill tell you what we will do though by god well scare the radical liberals clean out of their shoes no arguments there amos mizell said he raised the drink to his lips again i wish more of the new leaders who think along our lines would have joined us here tonight the tennessee volunteers the knights of the gray and the redfighters all have ideas we might find worthwhile and they arent the only ones theres plenty of people angry with the way things are going now jake allowed a couple of years ago the freedom party wasnt anything more than a few people sitting around in a saloon grousing he drew himself up straight with pride weve come a long ways since then that you have mizell said knight nodded once more now he looked jealous the freedom party had come further and faster than the redemption league mizell continued i know for a fact that a lot of tin hats are freedom party men too i never thought we could get away with breaking up the soft parties rallies will knight said and looked jealous again but youve gone and done it and youve gone and gotten away with it too you bet we have jake said if you reckon the cops love the whigs and the radical liberals and the niggers you can damn well think again andhe lowered his voice a littleif you reckon the soldiers love the traitors in the war department you can damn well think again about that too some of the things youve said about the war department have been of concern to me amos mizell said i dont care to bring disrepute down on men who served so bravely against the foe traitor is a hard word featherston fixed him with that savage grin jeb stuart iii was my commanding officer he said pompey his nigger servant was assdeep in the rebellion he shielded that nigger from army of northern virginia intelligence his old man jeb jr shielded him when it turned out hed been wrong all the time if that doesnt make him a traitor to his country what the hell does it do before either mizell or knight could answer the waiter returned with their suppers they ate in silence for a while knight was the first to break it suppose what you say is true if you say it too loud and too often dont you figure the army is going to land on your back i reckon the generalsd love to jake answered with his mouth full but i dont reckon theyd have an easy time of it even now on account of the soldiers who got the orders wouldnt be happy about following em and the longer they wait the harder itll be you may be right about the second part of that mizell said ive got my doubts about the first i have to tell you you might be smarter to take a step back every now and then so you can take two forward later on the freedom party doesnt back up featherston eyed mizell but was really speaking more to knight you talk about people who want to straighten out the mess were in and you talk about us first everybody else comes behind us you go on like that whyd you bother coming down here at all knight asked what have we got to talk about that was a good question jake did not want to negotiate with the redemption league negotiating implied he reckoned knight his equal which he did not care to do but he did not dare risk antagonizing the tin hats if amos mizell started saying harsh things about him and about the freedom party it would hurt but he was not about to admit that either picking his words with more care than usual he replied were on the way up you want to come with us knight you want to help us climb thats fine you want to fight youll slow us down i dont say anything different but you wont stop us and ill break you in the end that wasnt party against party it was man against man the only thing featherston knew how to do when threatened was push back harder than ever knight was a man of similar sort he glared across the table at jake were here to stop these brawls before they hurt all of us amos mizell said if we work things out now we dont have to air our dirty linen in public and waste force we could aim at our enemies thats how i see it thats how i see it too jake said if the redemption league was bigger than the freedom party id ease back since its the other way round youre the one who gets to talk that way willy knight said jake only smiled he knew he was lyinghe would have done anything to get ahead of a rivalbut nobody could prove it it appears to me things being as they are that our best course is to use the freedom party as the spearhead of our movement and the redemption league and other organizations as the shaft that helps give the head its striking power mizell said how does it appear to you mr knight featherston felt like kissing amos mizell he couldnt have put the leader of the redemption league on the spot like that himself knight looked like a man whod found a wormno half a wormin his apple very slowly he replied i think we can work with the freedom party depending on whos stronger in any particular place thats a bargain jake answered at once well pull a couple of our candidates in arkansas where you look to have a better chance and well throw our weight behind you there are some districts in alabama and mississippi and one in tennessee i can think of where i want you to do the same even more slowly knight nodded again if the freedom party outperformed the redemption league in this election support would swing featherstons way leaving knight in the lurch he could see that he couldnt do anything about it though hed want a high post if the redemption league got folded into the freedom party jake could already tell as much hed give knight a good slot too that way he could keep an eye on him the csa he thought had been stabbed in the back he didnt intend to let that happen to him jonathan moss slid out of his bucephalus and stumbled toward his evanston apartment building he was glad hed managed to get home without running over anybody after his last course he and fred sandburg and several other peoplehe couldnt recall how many right nowhad found a friendly saloon and done their best to drink it dry why not he thought it was a friday night he wouldnt need his brains again till monday morning his breath smoked the wind off lake michigan blew the smoke away it was chilly despite the antifreeze hed poured into his pipes not as chilly as it would be up in ontario moss said as if someone had asserted the opposite he stepped up onto the stairs not half as chilly as laura secords heart fred never had stopped ribbing him about laura secord even now after shed rejected him again he couldnt get her out of his mind hed come home hed done well at northwestern he hadnt found a girl he cared about though he wondered if he ever would he wondered if he ever could he opened the door at the top of the stairs then quickly shut it behind him getting out of the wind felt good he fumbled for the key to his mailbox it wasnt easy to find not when every key on the ring looked like one of twins he almost gave it up as a bad job and headed for bed but figuring hed probably have trouble finding his apartment key too he chose to regard the mailbox key as a test he made a determined drunk there you are you sneaky little bastard he said capturing the errant key making it fit the lock was another struggle but he won that one too a couple of advertising circulars fell onto the floor bending to pick them up made his head spin he also had a letter from a cousin out in denver and another envelope with his address written in a hand he didnt recognize hed taken two steps toward the stairs before he remembered to go back and shut and lock the mailbox he did have a devil of a time finding the key that opened the apartment door but by luck he got it into the lock on the first try he flipped on the electric light and tossed the mail down on the table in front of the sofa he tossed himself down on the sofa and fell asleep next thing he knew the sun was streaming in the window a determined musician pounded on kettle drums inside his head his mouth tasted the way a slit trench smelled his bladder was about to explode he staggered off to the bathroom pissed forever brushed his teeth and dryswallowed two aspirin tablets black coffee would have helped too but making it seemed too much like work after splashing cold water on his face he slowly went back out into the front room he discovered he hadnt thrown out the circulars so he did that then he read his cousins letter it had already started snowing in denver and david looked likely to get a promotion at the bank where he worked bully moss muttered his voice sounded harsh and unnaturally loud in his ears he let the letter lie where hed left it cousin david was not the most interesting man god ever made that left the other envelope the one with the unfamiliar handwriting it bore no return address something about the stamp looked funny when he peered closely he saw that ben franklins portrait had the word ontario printed over it no he said hoarsely he shook his fist at the window in the general direction of the northwestern campus god damn you to hell for the practicaljoking son of a bitch you are fred he found it much easier to believe that his friend had got hold of some occupation stamps than that anyone in ontario should write to him he knew only one person in the conquered canadian province and she wished she didnt know him but the envelope carried a postmark from arthur could fred have arranged to have someone up there put it in the mail moss knew fred could have his friend would go to great lengths to jerk his chain only one way to find out he mumbled and opened the envelope with fingers not all of whose shaking sprang from his hangover the paper inside was coarse and cheap he unfolded it the lettera note reallywas in the hand that had addressed the envelope dear mr moss it read now you have the chance to pay me back i daresay it will be sweet for you i would sooner do anything than rely on the word of a man to whom i offered nothing but insult but i find i have no choice the harvest this year was very bad and i have no way to raise the need to keep from being taxed off my farm so far as i can tell all my kin are dead my friends are as poor as i am even if you do find it in your heart to send the money i can make no promise to feel toward you the way you would want me to feel i would not deceive you by saying anything else laura secord her address followed moss stared the letter couldnt be anything but genuine hed told fred sandburg some of what hed said and done up in ontario but hed never mentioned the promise hed given laura secord hed known too well how fred would laugh what do i do now he asked the ceiling the ceiling didnt answer it was up to him if he threw the letter away he would have his revenge the trouble was he didnt much want revenge he hadnt been angry at laura secord when she turned him down hed been disappointed hed been wounded almost as if by machinegun fire but what hed felt for her hadnt turned to hate though for the life of him he couldnt have said why if he sent her the two hundred dollars hed be throwing his money away he knew that had he not known it shed made it very plain but that frozen day up in arthur hed told her that if she ever needed him for anything all she had to do was ask now shed asked was he going to break his promise if he did what would that make her think of americans what would it make her think of him hed never been a man in whom altruism burned with a fine hot flame he was welltodo but not so welltodo that spending two hundred dollars wouldnt hurtit wasnt as if he were playing with confederate money what do i do he said again the ceiling still wasnt talking he went back into the bathroom and stared at himself in the mirror over the sink he looked like hell bloodshot eyes stubble hair all awry because he hadnt bothered combing it yet if he threw laura secords letter into the wastebasket what would he see the next time he looked in a mirror a lying bastard that wasnt the ceiling talking that was him did he want to go through life thinking of himself as a liar every time he lathered up with his shaving brush some people wouldnt care some people would figure rejection made their promise null and void but hed given that promise after laura secord had rejected him in spite of her rejecting him his headache had only a little to do with the hangover he sighed fogging the mirror that proved he was still alive he knew what he would do hed never tell fred sandburg fred wouldnt let him live it down if he found out hed do it anyway it was saturday morning the banks would be closed the post office was open though he could send a money orderif he had two hundred dollars in cash by turning the apartment upside down he came up with he cursed under his breath for a minute then telephoned fred sandburg hullo when sandburg answered the phone he sounded as if hed just been raised from the dead and wished he hadnt been hello fred moss said cheerfullythe aspirins were working listen if i write you a check for a hundred and thirty bucks can you cash it yeah i think so his friend answered good see you in a few minutes moss said sandburg started to ask him why he wanted the money right away but he hung up without answering throwing on some clothes he drove the few blocks to sandburgs flat what the hell is this all about sandburg asked he looked like a poor job of embalming hed had more to drink than moss had you eloping with some broad and you need to buy a ladder got it the first time moss told him he wrote a check and thrust it at his friend in return sandburg gave him two fifties a twenty and a gold eagle thanks pal youre a lifesaver moss said he headed out leaving sandburg scratching his head behind him at the post office moss discovered he couldnt buy a money order for two hundred dollars hundreddollar maximum sir the clerk said but i can sell you two moss nodded the clerk went on that will be thirtycent fee on each order moss gave him the money when he got the money orders back he put them in an envelope hed already addressed for another two cents the clerk sold him a stamp after that he drove home now that the deed was done he wondered how foolish hed been two hundred dollars foolish he thoughtand sixty cents when he asked his parents for money as hed eventually need to do theyd want to know where it had gone they were liable to suspect hed spent it on a loose woman he laughed mirthlessly if only laura secord were loose or even a little looser he returned to the study of the law on monday every day when he went home he checked the mail in hope of finding another envelope with an overprinted stamp ten days later he got one the note inside read simply see there are decent yanks after all god bless you he read it a dozen times convinced beyond contradiction that that was the best two hundred dollars hed ever spent viii nellie jacobs opened her eyes she was lying on a hard unyielding bed staring up into a bright electric light bulb when she blinked the bulb seemed to waver and float it also seemed much farther away than a selfrespecting ceiling lamp had any business being hovering between her and the lamp were her daughter and her husband hal jacobs asked are you all right darling im fine even to herself nellie sounded anything but fine what she sounded was drunk she felt drunk too at least to the point of not caring what she said dont worry about me i was born to hang she coughed that hurt so did talking her throat was raw and sore and dry as she slowly took stock of herself that was far from the only pain she discovered someone had been using her belly for a punching bag do you know where youre at ma edna semphroch asked her of course i do she answered indignantly that bought her a few seconds in which to cast about through the misty corridors of her memory and try to find the answer somewhat to her own surprise she did im in the emergency hospital at the corner of fifteenth and d miss smartybritches recalling where she was made her recall why she was there holy suffering jesus did i have a boy or a girl we have a daughter nellie hal said if he was disappointed at not having a son he didnt show it clara lucille jacobs six pounds fourteen ounces nineteen and a half inchesand beautiful just like you how you do go on nellie said a little girl that was nice little girls thank god didnt grow up to be men someone new floated into her field of view a man clad all in white even to a white cloth cap on his head a doctor she realized and giggled at being able to realize anything at all businesslike as a stockbroker he asked how are you feeling mrs jacobs not too bad she said i had ether didnt i she remembered the cone coming down over her face the funny choking smell and then nothing the doctor was nodding nellie nodded too though it made her dizzy or rather dizzier i had ether and after that i had the baby the doctor nodded again nellie giggled again a lot easier doing it like that than the regular way she declared one hell of a lot easier believe me most women say the same thing mrs jacobs the doctor answered her cursing didnt bother him hed surely heard a lot of patients coming out from under ether he hadnt even noticed edna had and was smirking nellie went on taking stock shed felt a lot of labor pains before hal and edna brought her to the hospital and a lot more before the doctors put her under but shed missed the ones at the end of the affair and those were far and away the worst and shed missed the process of as one of her fallen sisters had put it many years before trying to shit a watermelon sure as sure this was better would you like to see your daughter mrs jacobs the doctor asked would i ever nellie said smiling the doctor turned and beckoned a nurse brought the baby wrapped in a pink blanket up to nellie clara was tiny and bald and pinkish red and wrinkled edna had looked the same way just after she was born shes beautiful isnt she hal said of course she is nellie answered edna looked as if she had a different opinion but she was smart enough to keep it to herself if you want to give her your breast now you may the doctor said what right here in front of you nellie almost blurted that was foolish and she figured it out before the words passed her lips hed had his hands on her private parts while delivering clara after that how could she be modest about letting him see her bare breast but she was he must have read it in her faceand of course he would have seen the same thing in other women too he said mr jacobs why dont you step out into the hall with me i think your wife might have an easier time of it with just the ladies in here with her oh yes of course hal said he followed the doctor out of the room looking back over his shoulder at nellie as he went slide down your gown dearie and you can give your wee one something good the nurse said she was a powerfully built middleaged woman with the map of ireland on her face after nellie exposed her breast she set the baby on it clara knew how to root babies were born knowing that she didnt need long to find the nipple and start to suck ow nellie said and made a hissing noise between her teeth shed forgotten how tender her breasts were and would be till nursing toughened them up shes getting something sure enough the nurse said nellie heard the gulping noises the baby was making too the nurse went on youll be better off if you go right on nursing her too breastfed babies dont get the bowel complaints that carry off so many little ones not nearly as often as them that suck a bottle cheaper and easier to nurse a baby too nellie said nothing to buy nothing to measure nothing to boil ill do it as much as i can edna watched in fascination they know just what to do dont they they do that the nurse said if they didnt not a one of emd live to grow up and then where would we be you were the same way nellie told edna i reckon i was the same way too and my ma and her ma and all the way back to the start of time she didnt mention little claras father nor ednas father nor her own father nor any other man that wasnt because she assumed they were the same way too it was because as far as she was concerned men werent worth mentioning after about ten minutes the baby stopped nursing nellie handed her to the nurse who efficiently burped her clara cried for a little while the high thin wail of a newborn that always put nellie in mind of a cat on a back fence then abruptly as if someone had turned a switch on her back she fell asleep nellie found herself yawning too not only were the remnants of the ether coursing through her but shed also been through labor and delivery hard work even if she hadnt felt most of it rest now if you want to the nurse said well want to keep you here for a week maybe ten days make sure you dont come down with childbed fever or anything else she cast a speculative eye toward nellie that or anything else no doubt meant or anything else thats liable to happen to an old coot like you had nellie had more energy she might have resented that as she was now without enough getupandgo to lick a postage stamp she simply shrugged a week or ten days with nothing to do but nurse the baby and eat and sleep looked like heaven to her edna took a different perspective a week ten days she exclaimed in mock anger youre going to leave me running things by myself so long ma thats a lot to hand me ive already done a lot nellie said besides the place has to bring in enough to pay for my little holiday here it didnt not really she and hal had saved up enough to meet the hospital bill hal knew how to sock away money it wasnt the worst thing in the world nellie wished she were better at that shed learned some from paying attention to the way her husband handled things maybe she could learn more edna stopped complaining even in fun nellie thought she recognized the gleam in her daughters eye hal wouldnt be able to watch edna the way nellie had ever since shed become a woman edna wouldnt have a lot of time to get into mischief but a girl didnt need a lot of time to get into mischief fifteen minutes would do the job nicely and maybe nine months from now edna would have an ether cone clapped over her face and wake up with a baby hardly younger than its aunt if she did nellie hoped the baby would have a last name she yawned again she was too tired even to worry about that very much whatever edna did in the next week or soif she did anythingshe would damn well do and she and nellie and hal would deal with the consequencesif there were consequenceslater the only thing nellie wanted to deal with now was sleep the light overhead and the hard hospital mattress fazed her not at all before she could sleep though her husband came back into the room he bent over her and kissed her on the cheek everything will be fine he said the doctor tells me you could not have done better you will be well and little clara will be well and every one of us will be well bully nellie said and then a new word shed started hearing in the coffeehouse swell hal youre sweet as anything but will you please get the hell out of here and let me rest of course of course he almost stumbled over his own feet he went out the door so fast he paused in the doorway to blow her a kiss and then he was gone a moment later nellie was gone too they woke her in the middle of the night to nurse the baby again by then all the anesthetic had worn off not to put too fine a point on it she felt like hell the night nurse brought her some aspirin that was sending a boy to do a mans job she wondered if shed be able to go back to sleep once they took clara away again she did which testified less to the tablets effectiveness than to her own overwhelming exhaustion when she woke in the morning she was ravenous she would have yelled at edna for serving a customer such greasy scrambled eggs overcooked bacon and cold toast the coffee they gave her with it might have been brewed from mud she didnt notice till the whole breakfast was gone while she was eating she noticed only that it filled the vast echoing void in her midsection after clara had had breakfast too a nurse escorted nellie down the hall so she could take a bath it was the first time shed had a good look at her body since the baby was born she didnt care for what she saw not even a little bit the skin of her belly hung loose and flabby having been stretched to accommodate the baby who wasnt in there any more it would tighten up again she remembered that from the days following ednas birth shed been a lot younger in those days though how much would it tighten now if hal wanted her less after she came home that wouldnt break her heart it would if anything be a relief she resolved to lay in a supply of safes now that she knew she could catch she didnt intend to do it again if hal didnt care to wear them she grimaced there were other things they could do things that carried no risk she hated those things having had to do them for men who laid coins on the nightstands of cheap hotel rooms but she hated the notion of getting pregnant again even more as it had been on the way to the bathtub her walk on the way back was not only slow but distinctly bowlegged she remembered that too shed had a baby come through there all right clara was waiting for her when she returned to her bed nellie startled herself with a smile another baby no this one not so bad she said and took her daughter in her arms on the night of november roger kimball headed over to freedom party headquarters on king street to get the congressional election returns as fast as the telegraph brought them into charleston hed tried to get clarence potter and jake delamotte to come along with him theyd both begged off if your madman friends do win some seats ill want to go out and get drunk and i dont mean by way of celebration potter had said that being so i may as well go straight to a saloon now the companys apt to be better anyhow i aim to get drunk no matter what happens jack delamotte had echoed hed gone along with potter summer soldiers kimball thought theyd been willing enough to think about using jake featherston but hadnt settled down for the long haul of using featherstons party a submersible skipper learned patience those who didnt learn ended up on the bottom of the ocean smoke filled the freedom party offices when kimball walked in as soon as the door closed behind him he held up a gallon jug of whiskey a raucous cheer went up and everybody in the place welcomed him like a longlost brother his was far from the only restorative there several men already seemed distinctly elevated he laughed potter and delamotte could have got drunk here and saved themselves thousands of dollarsnot that thousands of dollars meant much any more were leading in the fourth district up in virginia somebody at one of the bank of telegraph clickers announced and more cheers rang out people had yelled louder for kimball and his whiskey though he poured himself a glass and raised it high going to congress he shouted and another burst of happy noise filled the rooms it must have spilled out into the street too for a grayuniformed cop poked his head inside to see what the commotion was about somebody stuck a cigar in his mouth as if the freedom party had had a baby somebody else asked want a snort ed before the policeman could nod or shake his head he found a glass in his hand he emptied it in short order first votes in from alabamawere winning in the ninth thats birmingham a redfaced freedom party man said applause rang out and a couple of rebel yells with it people raised glasses and bottles on high and poured down the whiskey as if theyd never see it again congress is going to be ours somebody howled that set off more applause it made kimball want to laugh or cry or bang his head against the wall a couple of seats made people think theyd win a majority which wouldnt couldnt come within nine miles of happening maybe clarence potter was right maybe the freedom party did attract idiots from everything kimball had heard even jake featherston wasnt predicting more than about ten seats ending up with freedom party representatives in them that didnt make up a tenth part of the membership of the house and if the leader of a party wasnt a professional optimist before an election who was kimball had figured the night would be a success if the freedom party elected anybody by that undemanding standard things already looked to be going well here we gofirst district south carolina thats us quiet down yall somebody at the bank of telegraph tickers called people did quiet downa little the fellow waited for the numbers to come in then said damn that whig bastard is still a couple thousand votes up on pinky were way out in front of the radical liberals though kimball looked around to see if pinky hollister the freedom party candidate was in the office he didnt spot him that didnt surprise him too much hollister actually lived not in charleston but in mount holly fifteen miles outside of town he was probably getting the results there well we scared the sons of bitches anyways a bald man said loudly that signaled yet another round of cheers and clapping to hell with scaring the sons of bitches kimball said even more loudly we scared the sons of bitches up in the usa but in the end they licked us what i want us to do god damn it to hell is i want us to win another near silence followed that after a moment people started to clap and yell and stomp on the floor freedom somebody shouted the cry filled the room freedom freedom freedom dizziness that had nothing to do with the whiskey hed drunk or with the tobacco smoke clogging and thickening the air filled kimball hed known something of the same feeling when a torpedo hed launched slammed into the side of a us warship then though the pride had been in something he was doing himself now he rejoiced in being part of an entity larger than himself but one whose success hed had a hand in shaping freedom freedom freedom the shout went on and on it was intoxicating mesmerizing kimball howled out the word along with everybody else while he was yelling he didnt have to think all he had to do was feel the rhythmic cry filled him full the door out onto the street opened kimball wondered if another cop was going to come in and try to make people quiet down he hadnt seen the first policeman leave there he was as a matter of fact drinking like a fish a good many people must have had the same thought for the chant of freedom came to a ragged halt but it wasnt a cop standing there it was anne colleton not everybody in the office recognized her not everybody who recognized her knew shed helped the freedom party most of the people who followed jake featherston were poor or at best middleclass one of the reasons they followed him was the vitriol he poured down on the heads of the confederacys elite and here was an obvious member of that eliteanne could never be anything elsecoolly inspecting them as if they were in the monkey house at the charleston zoo kimball started to explain who she was and what shed done for the party before he could get out more than a couple of words she took matters into her own hands as was her habit freedom she said crisply at that the chant resumed louder than ever men surged toward anne as men had a way of doing whenever she went out in public if shed accepted all the drinks they tried to press on her she would have gone facedown on the floor in short order after she took one though she was vaccinated against taking any more instead of acting like a chunk of iron in the grip of a magnet kimball hung back anne took her own attractiveness so much for granted a man who showed he wasnt completely in her grasp often succeeded in piquing her interest by sheer contrariness hello roger she said when she did finally notice him in the crowd i wondered if id find you here wouldnt miss it he answered best show in the world this side of the circus anyhow she laughed at that he said i didnt expect to see you here though if you got out of st matthews i reckoned youd go on up to columbia i didnt come down just for the election anne said ive taken a room at the charleston hotel on meeting street the shops in columbia dont compare to the ones they have here if you say so kimball replied i do say so she answered seriously i know what i want and i aim to get just that nothing less she glanced at him out of the corner of her eye some ways were very much alike you and i thats a fact he said with a scowl he went on if youre going to tease me pick another time ive got a little too much whiskey in me to take kindly to it tonight thats frank enough she appraised him as frankly but id already made up my mind that i wasnt gong to tease you if i found you tonight i was going to invite you up to my room i just told you i know what i want and i aim to get it he thought about turning her down to prove she couldnt take him for granted it might make her respect him more it might also make her furious and he didnt want to turn her down he wanted to throw her down on a big soft bed and take her while she clawed his back to ribbons if she had something like that in mind he was ready willing and ablehe hadnt drunk so much as to leave him in any doubts on that score were ahead in the seventh in tennessee a man at the telegraph tickers announced which produced a new roar of applause through it the fellow went on thats around nashville they had the damnyankees occupying themthey got themselves some debts to pay another freedom party man was keeping an eye on a different telegraphic instrument the redemption league looks like theyre gonna win themselves a seat in texas he said aint as good as if we did it but its the next best thing how long do you want to stay here anne asked up to you kimball answered weve already done about as much as i reckoned we could and theres a lot of votes out there waiting to be counted maybe we really will get ten seats the way featherston said we would that would be remarkable anne said she echoed his own thought most brags before an election turn to wind the second the votings done she slipped her arm into his shall we go celebrate then my motorcars a couple of doors down she was still driving the spavined ford shed got after the cs army commandeered her vauxhall that told kimball she hadnt come all the way back from the financial reverses shed taken during the war but then who in the confederate states had he wondered what would have become of him had he not had more than usual skill with a deck of cards the charleston hotel was a large building of white stucco with a colonnaded entranceway an attendant took charge of the ford as if it had been a vauxhall the house detective didnt blink an eye as kimball got into the elevator with anne their joining was fierce as usual as much a struggle for dominance as what a lot of people thought of as lovemaking when it was good as it was tonight they both won afterwards they lay side by side lazily caressing each other and talking politics you were right roger anne said the sort of admission she seldom made the freedom party is on the way up and jake featherston is someone to reckon with i want to meet him myself kimball said he tweaked her nipple gently enough to be another caress sharply enough to be a demand and a warning you owe me that seeing as i was right she knocked his hand away and answered with more than a hint of malice what makes you think hed want to meetou you were an officer after all and hes not what youd call keen on officers hes not keen on rich officers kimball retorted you ever saw the farm i grew up on youd know im not one of those hell know it too he saw hed surprised her by answering seriously he also saw his answer wasnt something shed thought of herself all right she said ill see what i can do she rolled toward him on the broad bed and now he took her in his arms now ill see what i can do cincinnatus driver wished he didnt keep getting shipments for joe conroys general store he wished he could stay away from conroy for the rest of his life like so many wishes that one wasnt granted he couldnt turn down deliveries to conroys if he started turning down deliveries to one storekeeper hed stop getting deliveries to any storekeepers he also wished his rattletrap truck had windshield wipers since it didnthe counted himself lucky it had a motor let alone any fripperieshe drove from the ohio to the corner of emma and blackwell as slowly and carefully as he could doing his best to peer between the raindrops spattering his windshield his best was good enough to keep him from hitting anybody but he clucked to himself at how long he was taking to drive across covington and when i finally get there i get to deal with joe conroy he said he talked to himself a lot while driving for lack of anyone else with whom to talk wont that just make my day sour old but when he hauled the first keg of molasses into the general store he found conroy in a mood not merely good but jubilant he stared suspiciously at the fat storekeeper conroy wasnt supposed to act like that conroy didnt usually sign the shipping receipt till cincinnatus had fetched in everything but he did today aint it a beautiful mornin he said cincinnatus looked outside in case the sun had come out and a rainbow appeared in the sky while his back was turned no everything remained as gray and dark as it had been a moment before nasty cold drizzle was building toward nasty cold rain he didnt relish the upcoming drive back to the wharves tell you straight out mistuh conroy ive seen me a whole hell of a lot of days i liked the looks of better he answered and went back out into the wet to fetch some more of what conroy had ordered the sooner he got it all into the store the sooner he could get away when he came inside again joe conroy said didnt say it was pretty out i said it was a beautiful mornin and it damn well is i aint got the time to play silly games cincinnatus spoke more rudely to conroy than to any other white man he knew and enjoyed every minute of it tell me what youre talkin about or let it go conroy was in the habit of making noises about what an uppity nigger cincinnatus was he didnt even bother with those today ill tell you by jesus he answered i sure as hell will tell you its a beautiful mornin on account of the freedom party won eleven seats in the congress down in richmond and the redemption league took four more that didnt make it a beautiful morning for cincinnatusbut then cincinnatus though hed had to work with the confederate diehards in kentucky wasnt one himself his considered opinion was that a black man would have to be crazy to want the stars and bars flying here again the stars and stripes werent an enormous improvement but any improvement no matter how modest seemed the next thing to a miracle to him then he thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand he might not be crazy but maybe he was stupid thats how come ive seen freedom painted on about every other wall this past couple weeks he said sure as hell is conroy said those folks is gonna do great things for the countryfor my country his narrow little eyes probed at cincinnatus cincinnatus stared back impassively he didnt want conroy to know what he was thinking the storekeeper grunted and went on reckon therell be a freedom party startin up in kentucky any day now how do you figure the usas gonna let you get away with that cincinnatus asked in surprise they aint gonna let there be no party that dont really belong to the united states at all joe conroy looked sly he might not have been all that smart but he was one crafty devil that much cincinnatus could not help but recognize they let reds operate in the usa dont they he said its a free country aint it says it is anyways says it out loud bangin on a big drum if the freedom party say wants to try and get the votes to take kentucky back into the csa how can they stop us from doin that he looked smug as if certain cincinnatus could have no answer but cincinnatus did have an answer and gave it in two words luther bliss huh conroy said well handle him too when the time comes cincinnatus didnt argue not any more arguing with a fool had always struck him as a waste of time and conroy sure as hell wasnt all that smart if he thought he could handle luther bliss cincinnatus had his doubts about whether apicius wood could handle bliss if he had to apicius he judged had the sense not to try but then apicius really was pretty smart let me get the rest of your stuff cincinnatus said if he wasnt facetoface with conroy he couldnt possibly argue with him the storekeeper wanted to keep on jawing but cincinnatus didnt have to play not today he didnt with conroys receipt in his pocket all he had to do was finish the delivery and get out he did exactly that as he drove back up toward the river he really noticed how many walls and fences had freedom painted on them the word had replaced the blue crosses and redwhitered horizontal stripes as the diehards chosen scribble he didnt like what hed heard about the freedom party that put it mildly the local papers said little about the outfit these days they did their best to ignore what went on in the confederate states but word drifted up out of the csa even so word spread on the black grapevine that ran alongside and occasionally overlapped the one the diehards used none of that word was good and now the freedom party had done better in the elections than anyone expected that was not good news either when he got home that evening he told elizabeth what hed heard from conroy she nodded white lady i clean house for she was talkin bout the same thing on the telephone she sound happy as a pig in a strawberry patch i believe it cincinnatus said kentucky had been taken out of the usa by main force at the end of the war of secession it had been dragged back into the united states the same way during the course of the great war a lot of kentuckiansa lot of white kentuckianswished the return had never happened cincinnatus went on the government ever lets people here vote for the freedom party they aint gonna like the votes they see elizabeth sighed part of the sigh was weariness after a long day part of it was weariness after living among and having to work for people who despised her the second they set eyes on her she said reckon youre right wish it wasnt so but it is pas right achilles said cheerfully pas right he didnt know what cincinnatus was right about he didnt care either he had confidence that his father was and always would be right cincinnatus wished he had that same confidence he knew all too well how many mistakes hed made over the years how lucky he was to have come through some of them and how one more could ruin not only his life but those of his wife and little son slowly he said maybe we ought to talk some more about pullin up stakes elizabeth we can do it dont need no passbook not any more we got us a lifetime of roots in this place elizabeth said shed said the same thing when cincinnatus brought up the idea of leaving covington earlier in the year he hadnt pressed her very hard then now he said sometimes the only thing roots is good for is gettin pulled out of the ground sometimes if you dont pull em out they hold you there till somethin cuts you down instead of answering directly elizabeth retreated to the kitchen over her shoulder she said go set yourself down smells like the ham is just about ready sit himself down cincinnatus did but he didnt abandon the subject as his wife plainly hoped he would i been thinkin about this he said been thinkin about it a lot even if i aint said much if we leave i know where id like us to go i been lookin things up best i can and wheres that elizabeth asked resignation and fear mingling in her voice des moines iowa he answered its on a riverthe des moines runs into the mississippiso therell be haulin business off the docks iowa lets black folks vote they let women vote for president too i reckon they got women there elizabeth allowed they got any black folks there at all a few i reckon he answered theres a few black folks in just about every goodsized town in the usa aint any more than a few very many places though he held up a hand before his wife could say anything maybe thats even for the best when there aint very many of us cant be enough for the white folks to hate us who says there cant elizabeth spoke with the accumulated bitter wisdom of her race and jesus how far away is this des moines place itd be like fallin off the edge of the world about six hundred miles cincinnatus said as casually as he could elizabeths eyes filled with horror he went on reckon the truckll make it they got a lot o paved roads in the usa he pursed his lips have to pick the time to leave make sure everythings all good and dry you aim on bringin your ma an pa along elizabeth asked her own parents were both dead they want to come well fit em in some kind of way cincinnatus answered they dont he shrugged theyre all grown up cant make em do nothin they dont take a shine to i dont take no shine to this myself elizabeth stuck out her chin and looked stubborn you take a shine to livin here in kentucky if that freedom party starts winnin elections cincinnatus asked somethin like that happen youll be glad we got somewheres else to go that hit home maybe elizabeth said in a small voice something else occurred to cincinnatus if the freedom party started winning elections in the confederate states what would the negroes there do they couldnt run away to iowa theyd already tried rising up tried and failed what did that leave for the life of him cincinnatus couldnt see anything stephen douglas martins eyes went from his daughter to his son and back again in something that looked like pleased bemusement you dont have to do this on account of me you know he said if you want to go out and paint the town red go right on out and do it chester martin grinned at his father you already say im too much of a red i dont even want to go out and paint the town green we just want to spend new years eve with you and mother thats all sue martin said nodding vigorously chesters kid sister looked a lot like him with sharp nose green eyes and sandy hair she thought a lot like him too on labor matters and on a lot of other things as well besides pa he added where the devil could i go in toledo to paint the town red even if i wanted to this isnt exactly philadelphia or new york city toledo also didnt boast the multitude of saloons and brothels that sprang up behind an armys lines to cater to the needsor at least the desiresof soldiers briefly free from the trenches well youve got me there his father answered yes sir youve got me there once upon a time i used to know where all the hot joints were but that was a while ago now dont look so much to go out and get rowdy like i used to before i hooked up with your mother and settled down from the kitchen louisa martin called what are you blaming me for now stephen dishes rattled as she put them back into the cabinet im almost finished in here whatever youre trying to pin on me in a minute ill be out there and you wont be able to do it she was as good as her word her husband said what i was trying to pin on you dear was settling me down if you dont think youve done it ill go out and get drunk and leave you home with the kids his eyes twinkled ill probably beat you when i get back too the way i always do i dont know why you havent quit yet louisa martin said with a pretty good martyred sigh im all over bruises and the police keep dragging you down to the station every other day they both started laughing sue looked from one of them to the other as if astonished her parents could act so absurd and about something that would have been very serious had they been serious themselves chester said well ma thats better work for the cops than most of what they do believe me hold on there his father held out his hand like a cop halting traffic if were going to have a happy new years eve lets see if we can manage not to talk politics otherwise well just start arguing ill try chester said knowing his father was likely to be right he let out a wry chuckle before going on doesnt leave me much to talk about but my football team though i wish you wouldnt talk about that either his mother said its just as dangerous as going out there on the picket line not even close chester shook his head the fellows on the teams we play hardly ever carry guns the way the cops and the company goons do what did i say a minute ago stephen douglas martin asked rhetorically if you want to turn out editorials son go work for a newspaper all right chester said his father looked at him in some surprise evidently not having expected such an easy victory the older male martin arose with a grunt from the chair in which hed been ensconced since suppertime he went into the kitchen and came out with a bottle of whiskey and two glasses well i like that sue said with annoyance only partly affected are you going to leave mother and me thirsty i only have two hands her father set the whiskey and the glasses on the side table by his chair then held up the members in question count emtwo he returned to the kitchen and brought out two more tumblers chester wondered if his father had intended to include sue and his mother in the drinking if he hadnt nobody could prove it now whiskey gurgled into four glasses chester raised his to he said to his sister and his parents echoed they all drank chester sighed as the whiskey ran down his throat it wasnt the smoothest hed ever drunk but it wasnt bad either some of the rotgut hed had in back of the linesand every once in a while in a canteen or jug smuggled up to the forward trencheshad been like drinking liquid barbed wire his father stood to propose a toast to the smay they be a better ten years than the ten weve just gone through everyone drank to that too stephen douglas martin said now we ought to all pitch our glasses into the fireplace only trouble with that is you go through a lot of glasses sue looked at the clock on the mantel over the fireplace three hours till midnight less a couple of minutes will starting a new calendar really make a difference itd be nice to think it would we always hope it will her mother said wistfully she sighed and we usually end up looking back and saying well thats another year down this wasnt too bad a year chester said ive had work through most of it anyway and thats more than i can say for the rest of the time since i got out of the army he left it at that had he said more he and his father would have got to arguing politics he was convinced the factory owners had settled with the steelworkers because of the election returns whatever else you might say about them big capitalists werent stupid when handwriting went up on the wall they could read it if they didnt come to terms with the people who worked for them congress would start passing laws they didnt fancy his mother sat down at the tired old upright piano and began to play her choice of tunes made him smile after a little while he said im not in the army any more you dont have to give me one sousa march after another he stomped up and down the room as if on parade i like playing them chester louisa martin said they make me want to go marchingexcept i cant not while im playing she swung into a spirited if not technically perfect rendition of remembrance and defiance shell do as she pleases son stephen douglas martin said if you havent learned that about her by now how long is it going to take you if shes playing them for herself thats fine chester said if shes doing them for me though shes wasting her time i never was so glad as the last time i took that uniform off you went through a lot sue said i remember the hard time you gave that military policeman in the park when you were home on convalescent leave it was like youd seen a lot of things he never had so you didnt think he had any business bothering you thats just what i was thinking sis he answered he behaved like he thought god had sent him down in a puff of smoke the people who really went through the mill dont act that way ive seen that with the younger fellows i work with his father said one of em won the medal of honor but youd never hear it from him thats the way it ought to be martin said we didnt go out there to blow our own horns or to have a good timenot that there were any good times to have in the trenches we went out there to win the war and we did that he tossed down the rest of his whiskey and you know what i wonder if what we bought is worth what we paid for it we licked the rebs his father said along with kaiser bill we licked everybody weve paid people back for everything they ever did to us thats so chester said but there arewhat a million something like thatsay a million men who wont ever see it and lord only knows how many there are on crutches and in wheelchairs and wearing a hook instead of a hand he touched his own left arm im one of the lucky ones all i got was a purple heart and some leave timea hometowner we called a wound like that but it was just luck it wasnt anything else a few inches to one side and i wouldnt be here now i wouldnt be anyplace i was a good soldier but thats not why i came out in one piece nothing but luck the sousa march louisa martin was playing came to a ragged halt youve upset your mother stephen douglas martin said and then to his wife its all right dear he is here hes fine if he werent here and fine he wouldnt be spouting such nonsense would he no chesters mother said in a small voice but i dont like to think about about things that might have been chester poured his glass full of whiskey again he didnt like to think about things that might have been either most of them were worse than the way things had really turned out some of them still made him wake up sweating in the night even though the war had been over for two and a half years he drank if he got numb he wouldnt have to think about them his mother got herself another drink too he raised an eyebrow at that she didnt usually take a second glass maybe she had things she didnt want to think about too maybe hed given her some of those things all at once he felt ashamed im sorry he mumbled his father got up and clapped him on the shoulder youll make a man yet he said i think thats the first time i ever heard you say you were sorry and sound like you meant it kids say it too but they dont say it the same way im sorry stephen douglas martin did a good imitation of a nineyearold apologizing lest something worse happen to him sue said heres hoping we dont need to say were sorry at allwell not muchnext year ill drink to that chester said and he did every time he looked at the clock on the mantel it got a bit later he found that pretty funny which was a sign hed taken a little too much whiskey on board hed have a headache in the morning he was glad he wouldnt have to go in to the steel mill that would have made his head want to fall off a few minutes before midnight firecrackers started going off they alarmed chester they made him think of gunfire they alarmed all the dogs in the neighborhood too along with bangs and pops toledo ushered in with a chorus of canine howls and frantic barks and yips happy new year chester said when both hands on the clock stood straight up happy new year he wondered if it would be then he wondered something else something perhaps not altogether unrelated who would be running for president arthur mcgregor stood in front of the stove in the kitchen soaking in warmth as a flower soaked in sunlight he had no idea why he thought of flowers they werent likely to appear in a manitoba january he turned so hed cook on all sides maude said when you came inside you had frost on your eyebrows i believe it he answered if i wore a mustache id have icicles hanging down from it too its that kind of day but if i dont get out there and take care of the stock whos going to do it eh his wifes mouth tightened alexander should have been there to help but alexander was gone except in the picture on the wall mcgregor moved away from the stove for a moment to go over and slip an arm around maude her mouth fell open in surprise neither of them was greatly given to open displays of affection im not doing as much as i should he said discontentedly you hush maude told him youve done plenty you dont need to worry about not doing more if you want it to be enough it can be enough but i dont he said i have to do this dont you see i have toand i cant of themselves his hands folded into fists of frustration maude set a consoling hand on his shoulder you went up to winnipeg arthur you looked around and then you came home and said the thing couldnt be done that was as close as she would come to talking out loud about his bombs if it cant be done it cant thats all damn the yanks he said fiercely they keep too many soldiers around custers headquarters and around the house hes stolen too looking back on it blowing up major hannebrink had been fairly easy the yanks euphoria at winning the war had helped everyone in rosenfeld that night had been celebrating as if joy would turn illegal the second the sun came up again and hannebrink was only a major and not nearly so valuable to the americans as their commander for all of canada they knew general custer would make a target for canadians as archduke franz ferdinand had made a target for the serbs a serb bomber had killed franz ferdinand and touched off the great war the americans didnt intend to let custer go the same way they kept swarms of soldiers around him mcgregor had had no chance whatever to plant a bomb anyplace where it might do any good he might have flung one into custers motorcar as the serbs had flung one into franz ferdinands carriage the serbian nationalist who flung his bomb had been shot dead a moment later mcgregor wanted to live even killing custer was not revenge enough to satisfy him he wanted more later if he ever got the chance maybe hell come down here to rosenfeld again maude said she sounded consoling the way she did when one of the girls was sad after breaking a toy mcgregor was sadand furious toobecause he couldnt break his toy if you looked at that the right way it was grimly funny not likely he said it isnt much of a town when you get right down to it he scowled theres just no chance for a man working by himself maude asked the question that had stymied him over and over again who can you trust nobody that was the answer he always reached too many people up here have their hands in the yanks pockets too many people spy on their neighbors too many people would just as soon turn into yanksand you cant always tell who they are not till you find out the hard way you cant his wife nodded i dont know what you can do then except get on with things here i dont either mcgregor felt like a lone wolf looking to pull down the biggest bull moose in an enormous herd that was when you thought about it a crazy thing to want to do part of him knew as much no all of him knew as much it was just that most of him didnt care slowly he said the trouble is there are too many hours in the day in the middle of wintertoo much time to sit around and think farm work was harder and made a man keep longer hours than any town job there were times especially around the harvest when he wished he could stay awake for a couple of weeks at a stretch so as not to waste any precious time when snow lay deep on the ground though what a man could do diminished after he tended the stock and made repairs around the house and barn what was left but coming inside and sitting around and brooding maude had an answer you might help me with some of my chores they dont go away when the weather gets cold just the opposite as a matter of fact he stared at her did she think he was going to put on an apron and do womens work if she did she had another think coming he intended to let her know as much too in great detail then he saw her eyes sparkle hed drawn in his breath for an angry shout he let it out in a gust of laughter instead youre a devil he said you really are you had me going there i hope so his wife answered its good to see you smile arthur i havent seen it often enough not since she stopped no one in the family had smiled much since alexander got shot gamely she went on we cant stay gloomy all the time life is too short for that in spite of everything life is too short for that i suppose not he said nowhere near sure he supposed anything of the sort to keep from having to decide whether he did or not he pointed toward the ceiling what are the girls doing as much schoolwork as they can i hope maude said if it doesnt snow again they ought to be able to start going again tomorrow or the day after they want to go back a smile twisted only one corner of her mouth i hope they can i wont be sorry to have them out of the house for a while theyve been snapping at each other a lot the past few days ive noticed mcgregor ruefully shook his head i can still heat up marys backside but that doesnt work with julia any more his older daughter was a woman which still bemused him have to talk sense to her and sometimes she doesnt want to listen to sense and where do you figure she gets that his wife murmured he pretended not to hear knowing when not to hear struck him as not the least important part of a happy marriage what he did say was fix me up a cup of tea will you i think ive warmed up enough so that it wont turn into a lump of ice in my belly now he was sipping it when julia came downstairs dramatically rolling her eyes and demanded who will do something about my nuisance of a little sister mcgregor laughed againtwice in one morning you remind me of henry ii saying who will rid me of this turbulent priestand that was the end of thomas a becket he said julia looked so angry he thought for a moment she wanted someone to rid her of mary but she was angry about something else they dont teach the history of england in school any more except how the mother country was so wicked the americans had to have a revolution to get away im not surprised mcgregor said im not happy mind you but im not surprised the yanks are doing everything they can to make us the same as they are and they try to pretend they invented everything they borrowed from the mother country the less youngsters know about england the easier it is for the americans to get away with their lies thats right julia seemed about to burst into tears and theres nothing we can do about it either is there hearing that mcgregor knew he would have to try again to bomb general custer maybe custers death would spark an uprising throughout canada even if it didnt it would remind his countrymen that they had a country of their own that they werent yanks who happened to live in a cold climate and speak with a slightly strange accent and with her fury against the united states julia had forgotten to be furious at her little sister or so mcgregor thought till julia said and mary keeps humming in my ear until it drives me to distraction shes being annoying on purpose if youd been born a boy youd know how to take care of that mcgregor said youd tell her to stop if she didnt youd wallop her if you want to go back upstairs and pretend youre a boy for a bit thats all right with me julia went the light of battle in her eyes a few minutes later mcgregor heard a thump he waited for mary to come down and complain about what a beast julia was being nothing of the sort happened there were several more thumps interspersed with shouts and a couple of thuds as of one body or perhaps two suddenly landing on the floor he chuckled that sounds cheery doesnt it i hope they dont hurt each other maude said worriedly julias bigger but i dont think mary knows how to quit if she goes up against somebody whos bigger and who means business shell learn how to quit after a little while mcgregor said his wife looked at himcaught and held his eyewithout saying anything for a moment he wondered why then he realized that what hed said about his younger daughter could apply to canadas struggle against the united states his own face showed that realization but maude kept staring at him again he wondered why and started to get angry but then he saw that what hed said about his younger daughter could also apply to his own struggle against the united states the united states were enormously bigger than he was and they meant business about holding on to his country he didnt care whether they meant business or not he intended to go on fighting them they havent licked me yet maude he said ive hit them a few licks but they havent licked me all right was the only thing his wife said she wanted him to be careful in what he was doing but she didnt want him to stop or if she did want him to stop she didnt let him know it which amounted to the same thing somebody was coming downstairs mary by the sound of the footsteps mcgregor waited to console her but when his younger daughter came into the kitchen triumph glowed on her face julia got mean mary said i guess she wont try that again in a hurry maude gaped in astonishment so did mcgregor this time he caught and held his wifes eye if mary could triumph against long odds why couldnt he that bomb still lay in the barn hidden below the old wagon wheel in spite of everything he might find the chance to place it he didnt need to do that right this minute he had time colonel irving morrell stood in the fort leavenworth kansas train station waiting for the special from pontiac michigan to come in his greengray overcoat held the worst of the cold at bay though he wished hed put on a fur hat instead of an ordinary service cap sootstreaked snow covered the ground by the look of the mass of dirtygray clouds building in the northwest more would be coming before too long beside him lieutenant lije jenkins stirred restlessly everythings gone slower than it should have sir i know he said but were finally going to get the prototype for the new model no not the prototype morrell shook his head just a test model to see how some of the ideas we sent the war department work out most of the parts come from the barrels we used in the great war so the test model will run maybe half as fast as it ought to he sighed blowing out a small cloud of vapor getting the real mccoy built will run half as fast as it ought to too when i think what we could have had jenkins angrily shook his head when i think what we should have had by nowthe war will have been over three years this summer and the new model still isnt anywhere near ready to go into production were living on borrowed time morrell said ask any soldier and hell tell you the same thing you can live on borrowed time for a while but then you have to pay it backwith interest jenkins stared north and east across the missouri he pointed dont i see exhaust there sir times right for that to be the special so it is morrell agreed well know pretty soon i expect he glanced around then nodded in satisfaction ah good the station boys are on the ball theyve got the heavy ramp ready to unload the barrel from its flatcar theyve helped take barrels off trains before so theyll know the drill coal smoke billowing from the stack the special crossed the missouri rolled through leavenworth and came north again to the fort leavenworth station it was about the shortest train morrell had ever seen consisting of a locomotive a tender and one flatcar on which perched a large shape covered by greengray tarpaulins to shield it from the weather and from prying eyes when the train stopped an officer jumped out of the locomotive and came up to morrell colonel irving morrell he asked morrell admitted he was himself the officer nodded briskly then saluted very pleased to meet you sir im major wilkinson ive ridden down with this beast from pontiac as soon as i get your john hancock on about sixtyeleven different forms here i can put it into your hands and let you start finding out what it can do morrell signed and signed and signed by the time he was through the signatures on the forms hardly looked like his any more after he gave the last sheet of paper back to major wilkinson he said why dont you take the wrapping off so i can see whats in the package ill be glad to sir if you and lieutenantjenkins was it will come along with me you can see just whats in there nimble as a monkey he swung himself up onto the flatcar and untied the ropes that held the tarps in place morrell and jenkins ascended more sedately they helped him pull away the heavy cloth covering the new barrel bully lije jenkins said softly when he got his first look if thats not a machine for the s ill be darned if i know what is compared to what we had in the great war thats a machine from out of the s by god yeah its pretty on the outside morrell said but what it reminds me of is a homely girl with a lot of paint and powder on he started to rap the barrels hull with his knuckles but checked himself it was cold enough that hed lose skin on the metal he contented himself with pointing thats just mild steel not armor plate and its thin mild steel to boot that makes the barrel lighter so the one white engine they threw in there can give it even a halfway decent turn of speed but you couldnt take it into combat its not even proof against rifle fire let alone anything else but even as he spoke his eyes caressed the test barrels lines as they did agnes hills whenever he saw her here in metal was the shape hed sketched not long after coming to the barrel works the turret cannon and machine gun stared at him so did the machine gun mounted in the front of the hull it doesnt look as as busy as one of our regular barrels lieutenant jenkins said no i suppose not morrell said but i hope itll keep the enemy busier than one of the regular sort and we wont need to put a whole regiment of soldiers inside here when we go into action either he strode to the rear of the flatcar hurry up with that ramp if you please gentlemen were just about ready colonel one of the soldiers replied a couple of minutes later he said all right sir everythings in place do you want to back it off the car major morrell asked i will if you want me to sir wilkinson answered but go right ahead if youd rather do the honors morrell needed no more urging he opened the hatch in the top of the hull that led down into the drivers compartment then wriggled inside the controls were identical to those of the older barrels hed learned the drivers art since coming to the barrel works but had applied himself to it as he applied himself to everything that caught his interest his finger stabbed the electricstarter button behind him the white engine grunted coughed and came to life it was loud it was not however deafening as the engines in oldstyle barrels were that wasnt because the test model had only one where normal machines needed two it was because instead of sitting right there in the middle of the barrels interior the engine had a compartment of its own separated from the crew by a steel bulkhead he wished he didnt have to back the barrel down the ramp to get it off the flatcar even with his head out of the hatch even with the rearview mirror the manufacturer had thoughtfully provided a little bonus that might possibly last thirty seconds in combat he couldnt see behind himself for beans that was something he hadnt thought about when he decided on a turretmounted cannon well that was what the test model was for to discover all the things he hadnt thought of and nobody else had either with luck hed be able to get rid of them before the new model went into production he knew perfectly well that he wouldnt find them all he was human and therefore fallible but hed do the best job he could hed do the best job he could of getting this beast off the flatcar too all he had to do was back straight if he looked ahead he ought to be able to judge how well he was doing that and he couldnt keep sitting up here forever his left foot came down on the clutch he threw the shift lever into reverse and gave the barrel a little gas it was peppier than the ones in which hed fought the great war not peppy like a fancy motorcar not peppy enough to suit him but peppier it went down the ramp faster than hed expected almost before he knew it he was on the ground from the flatcar major wilkinson waved and lieutenant jenkins gave him a thumbsup come on he shouted to jenkins over the rumble of the enginewhich seemed a lot louder with his head out the hatch the lieutenant jumped down from the train clambered up the side of the barrel and scrambled into the turret through a hatch on the roof theres no ammunition in here he said indignantly morrell snortedas if anyone would be crazy enough to put ammunition in a barrel that would be traveling by train accidents didnt happen very often but who would take the chance on sending an expensive test model up in smoke then jenkins went on i wanted to shoot up the landscape as we drove along and morrell snorted again this time on a different note his subordinate was just acting like a kid again morrell put the barrel into the lowest of its four forward speeds it rattled over the railroad tracks and off toward the muddy prairie northwest of fort leavenworth he built up to full speed as fast as he could if the speedometer wasnt lying he was doing better than ten miles an hour more than twice as fast as a great war barrel could manage on similar ground the powertoweight ratio of the test model was supposed to be the same as that of the eventual production machine if so these barrels would do tricks their ancestors had never imagined they still werent fast enough to suit him hell of a ride jenkins shouted sounding as exhilarated as a skilled horseman on a halfbroken stallion hell of a ride now weve got the cavalry back again by jesus thats part of the idea morrell said men on horseback had been poised throughout the great war ready to exploit whatever breakthroughs the infantry could force but infantry alone hadnt been able to force breakthroughs and cavalry melted under machinegun fire like snow in death valley summer the old barrels had broken through confederate lines but hadnt always been swift enough to exploit to the fullest the breaches they made maybe these machines would even in their present state in his minds eye morrell saw barrels clawing at the flank of a foe in retreat shooting up his soldiers wrecking his supply lines keeping reinforcements from reaching the field pushing the front forward by leaps and bounds not plodding steps it was a heady vision so heady it almost made morrell see with his minds eye to the exclusion of the pair at the front of his head had he not paid attention to the gauges in front of him he would have missed noting how little fuel the test model carried in its tank stranding himself out on the prairie was not what he had in mind when it came to getting acquainted with the new machine reluctantly he steered for the muddy field where half a dozen survivors of the great war sat he turned off the engine climbed out of the hatch and got down off the test model lije jenkins came down beside him the youngster looked from the new barrel to the old ones its like stacking the first duryea up against an oldsmobile isnt it sir he said something like that anyway morrell said of course there is one other difference there really are oldsmobiles but this babyagain he remembered in the nick of time not to rap his knuckles on the hullis just pretend for now i hope we dont take twenty years to get the real ones sir jenkins said so do i lieutenant with all my heart we may need them sooner than that morrell said he started off toward the barracks jenkins tagged along after him as morrell walked he wondered what he could tell agnes hill about his new toy she knew in a general way what his duties were being a soldiers widow she also knew not to ask too many questions about what exactly he did but the next time he saw her he was going to be excited he wanted to share that excitement he also needed not to talk too much he was awfully glad hed gone to that dance with jenkins he wanted to go right on being glad the only place where taking chances was a good idea was on the battlefield ix a fat man with a nasty cough came up to the counter of the drugstore where reggie bartlett worked help you reggie asked hope to god you can the man answered hacking again if i dont shake this damn thing its going to drive me right up a tree he pulled out a pack of cigarettes and tapped one in the palm of his hand here you go reggie handed him a box of matches with harmons drugs printed on the topgood advertising he waited till the man lit up then went on i can give you a camphorated salve to rub on your chest and under your nose and weve got a new cough elixir in its got a kind of denatured morphine in itnot nearly as strong and not habitforming but it does the job give me some of the salve and a bottle of that stuff too the sufferer said he coughed some more and shook his head this is killing me i cant even enjoy my smokes any more another thing you can do is you can set a pot of water on the stove to boil put in some of the salve and breathe in the steam bartlett said thatll help clear out your lungs too good idea the fat man answered his face took on a kind of apprehension that had nothing to do with his ailment now what do i owe you two thousand for the salve reggie said the customer nodded in some relief reggie continued the elixir though its new stuff like i said and its expensive could be worse the fat man said he took three banknotes from his wallet and shoved them across the counter at bartlett reggie gave him three banknotes in change as the fat man tucked them away he shook his head in wonder its like play money aint it reckon im a millionaire and a whole hell of a lot of good its doing me he coughed again then picked up the squat blue bottle of salve and the taller one of the elixir much obliged to you young fellow and i hope these here give me some relief as he headed for the door he called a last word over his shoulder freedom bartlett started violently he had all he could do to hold his tongue and indeed to keep from running after the fat man and screaming curses at him christ he said his hands were trembling jeremiah harmon looked up from the tablets he was compounding something troubling you reggie he was in his late forties with a brown mustache beginning to go gray and so quiet bartlett was always straining to hear him that wasnt bad not so far as reggie was concerned hed walked out on mcnally his previous employer because the man wouldnt stop riding him yes sir he answered that fellow who just left used the freedom party salute when he went out the door i dont fancy those people not even a little i dont cant say i do either harmon said but i doubt theyre worth getting very excited about as far as he was concerned nothing was worth getting very excited about lord i hope youre right but i just dont know bartlett said i watched their goons bust up a rally they almost busted me up too thats not the only brawl theyve gotten intonot even close and now richmonds got a freedom party congressman makes me sick to my stomach bicarbonate of soda will do the trick there harmon remarked he was a druggist down to the tips of his toes after a moment though he realized reggie had used a figure of speech with a shrug he went on my guess is theyre a flash in the pan having a few of them in congress is probably a good thing once they show theyre nothing but a pack of noisy windbags people will wise up to them pretty fast bartlett grunted i hadnt thought about it like that maybe youve got something there he didnt take the freedom party seriously even now when more people had a chance to see it in action how could they take it seriously either sometimes the best thing you can do is let a fool prove he is one thats right jeremiah harmon said a customer came into the store harmon bent to his work again why dont you see to mrs dinwiddie there all right hello mrs dinwiddie reggie said what can i get for you today he thought he knew but he might have been wrong he was right mrs dinwiddie answered i need a bottle of castor oil my bowels have been in a terrible state lately just a terrible state and if i dont get something to loosen them up well i swear to jesus i dont know what ill do explode i reckon she went on in that vein for some time she bought castor oil every other week the purchases were regular as clockwork even if her bowels werent every time she bought it she gave the same speech bartlett was sick of listening to it so no doubt was jeremiah harmon since harmon was the boss he had the privilege of avoiding mrs dinwiddie reggie didnt by the time she ran down he was on much more intimate terms with her lower bowel than hed ever wanted to be well i wont keep you any more she said having already kept him too long she opened her handbag what do i owe you thats maam reggie answered it was only ten the last time i came in she said sharply he shrugged if she didnt like the way prices jumped she could take that up with harmon he figured out how much to charge but after grumbling under her breath mrs dinwiddie gave bartlett a pair of banknotes he returned her change and the bottle of castor oil so the day went it was something less than exciting but it put money in his pockets it put tens of thousands of dollars in his pockets those tens of thousands of dollars left him somewhat worse off than he had been before the war started when hed been making two dollars a day inflation made a bitter joke of everything hed thought he knew about money he supposed that was one reason people voted for the freedom party and other outfits like it they loudly proclaimed they had the answers to all the problems bedeviling the confederate states proclaiming they had the answers was the easy part really having them and making them workthat looked harder that looked a hell of a lot harder to him but some people would buy castles in the air because they were short of beans on the ground when six oclock rolled around he said see you tomorrow mr harmon the druggist looked up in vague surprise oh yes that will be fine he made no move to leave himself reggie was just hired help and could come and go as he pleasedso long as he pleased to be on time most of the time the drugstore belonged to harmon he worked as long as he thought he had to reggie put on his overcoat and went out into the cold it wasnt too badno snow lay on the groundbut it wasnt anything he enjoyed either he walked quickly his feet clicking along the sidewalk as long as he kept moving he didnt feel the chill too badly and bill fosters flat where he had a supper invitation lay only a few blocks away sally foster opened the door hello reggie she said come in get warm make yourself at home how are you today ive been worse he answered and heaven only knew that was true bill hon sally called reggies here she was a short slightly pudgy blonde in her midtwenties for reasons bartlett couldnt quite fathom she thought well of him hed wondered if he would keep bill foster as a friend after bill and sally got married a lot of men gave up their bachelor friends after they stopped being bachelors themselves but sally had gone out of her way to be cordial and so the friendship stayed warm hello reggie bill foster said married life plainly agreed with him hed put on ten pounds easy since sally started cooking for him can i get you a little something to light a fire inside thanks i wouldnt mind reggie answered foster took down a whiskey bottle and a couple of glasses do you want water with that he asked sometimes reggie did sometimes he didnt tonight he didnt pipes are rusty enough already he said sally laughed maybe she hadnt heard it before it was an old joke in the trenches though as fosters resigned chuckle showed when reggie had the glass in his hand he raised it and said heres to a long walk off a short pier for jake featherston lord knows ill drink to that bill said and he did so did bartlett sure enough the whiskey warmed him nicely foster said ill drink to that any day and twice on sunday as a matter of fact but what made you come out with it just then reggie told him about the fat man with the cough whod called out the freedom partys oneword slogan and finished when he walked out i was standing there wishing id given him rat poison instead of his cough elixir ive heard it too bill foster said it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck same as the noise of a shell coming in youd reckon people had better sense but a lot of em dont the other thing i wondered was whether he was just somebody who voted for the freedom party or if he was one of the tough guys who put on white and butternut and go out looking for heads to break bartlett said he didnt look like the type but you never can tell they dont need very many ruffians foster said as long as folks think the fellows with the clubs are doing the right thing they wont try and stop em and that worries me more than anything it gave reggie something new to worry about too we cant even write our congressman and complain hed likely send goons right to our door what you can do sally said is come and sit down and have supper once you get some food in your bellies to go along with the whiskey youre pouring down the world wont seem like such a rotten place ham and applesauce and canned corn and string beans cooked with a little salt pork might not have changed the world but sally was right they did improve reggies opinion of it peach pie improved it even more he patted his stomach he had no trouble understanding how bill had put on weight you dont happen to have a sister do you he asked sally knowing she didnt hed pleased her though he saw it in her eyes you should have got married a long time ago she told him he shrugged my mother says the same thing she wants grandchildren i never met a girl i felt like marrying he shook his head no thats not so before the war i was sweet on a girl but she wasnt sweet on me she wasnt sweet on anybody not back then she wasnt i heard she finally married some navy man after the war now what was his name i heard it its going to bother me if i cant remember he paused thinking hard brantley buckley no but something like that brearley thats what it was brearley i knew id come up with it now if you could just come up with a girl sally said if i wanted to listen to my mother id have gone to visit my mother reggie said everybody laughed he held out his glass to bill foster you want to get me another drink i know good and well my mother wouldnt everyone laughed again sylvia enos smoked in short savage puffs that man she said neither sarah wyckoff nor may cavendish needed to ask about whom she was talking what did frank do now sarah asked felt me up sylvia snarled he hadnt bothered me for weeks but this morning all of a sudden he grew more arms than an octopus he came back to where i was working and he felt me up like i was a squash he was buying off a pushcart i almost hauled off and belted him you should have sarah said i would id have knocked him into the middle of next week too with her formidable build she could have done it may said hes been sniffing around lillian for a while hes probably been doing more than sniffing too shes a little chippy if i ever saw one she sniffed herself then went on but i havent seen lillian for the past couple days and she quit sylvia said i heard one of the bookkeepers talking about it shes moving out to california its good for your lungs out there well if she quit then frank is going to be on the prowl for somebody new may said weve watched it happen often enough now often enough to be good and sick of it sylvia said and i wish to heaven he wouldnt come sniffing around me if he doesnt know by now that i dont feel like playing games hes an even bigger fool than i think he is he couldnt be a bigger fool than i think he is sarah wyckoffsaid sylvia took a big bite of her eggsalad sandwich she wished she were a gigantic carnival geek biting the head off of frank best instead of a chicken then she shook her head in bemusement he really had to be on her nerves or she would never have come up with such a bizarre mental image she said i wish i could find another job but how am i even supposed to look for one when im here five and a half days a week and jobs arent easy to come by not like they were during the war its a nasty bind to be in dearie may said i hope it turns out all right for you the worst he can do is fire me sylvia said then i will have time to look for a new job when he gets to be like this i almost wish he would fire me you girls are dears but i wouldnt mind getting out of this place what makes you think it would be different anywhere else may asked youd still have a man for a boss and you know what men are like careful sarah said in a low voice frank best strolled past and waved to the women at their dinner break he doubtless thought his smile was charming as far as sylvia was concerned it was so greasy it might have been carved from a block of lard she lit a new cigarette the foreman favored her with another oleaginous smile when he returned from wherever hed gone almost time to get back to the line he said yes mr best sylvia looked forward to returning to work about as much as she looked forward to going to the doctor to have a carbuncle lanced sometimes though she had to go to the doctor and when the whistle blew she had to go back and paint red rings on galoshes frank best left her alone for twenty minutes after that which was about fifteen minutes longer than shed expected then he came back toward her with a pair of rubber overshoes in his hand the rings on them were perfect sylvia had made a point of painting perfect rings since hed started bothering her again to give him as little excuse as she could but being the foreman he didnt necessarily need an excuse sylvia dipped her brush in the can of red paint by the line and painted two more perfect rings on the galoshes in front of her tried to slip these by on me did you sylvia best asked he thrust the overshoes in his hand at her i dont see anything wrong with them sylvia said that turned out to be a mistakenot that she had any right course here take a closer look best said and stepped up right alongside her he brushed her breast with his arm as he brought the galoshes up and held them under her nose that might have been an accidenthad he not been bothering her all morning she took half a step backand knocked over the can of red paint so that most of it spilled on his shoes that might have been an accidenthad he not been bothering her all morning oh mr best she exclaimed im so very sorry im so very sorry ididn t think of that a long time ago he jumped and hopped and used language no gentleman would have employed in the presence of a lady hed already proved he was no gentleman by treating sylvia as if she were no lady youd better watch yourself he said when something vaguely resembling coherence returned to his speech youd better clean this mess up and youd better make sure nothing like it ever happens again or youll be out on the sidewalk so fast itll make your head spin yes mr best im terribly sorry mr best sylvia said the foreman stomped off leaving a trail of red footprints sylvia soaked up as much of the red paint in rags as she could she got some on her hands but none on her dress or shirtwaist she was careful about them where she hadnt cared at all about bests shoes she opened another can of paint and went right on giving galoshes red rings too if she hadnt done that best would have got another reason to come back and have a word with her as things worked out he didnt speak to her for the rest of the day that suited her fine women from all along the production line found excuses to come by and say hello though under their breath they found considerably more than hello to say too she got more congratulations than shed had on any one day since mary jane was born if any of the women had a good word to say about frank best nobody said it where she could hear sarah wyckoff said that was even better than knocking his teeth down his throat on account of it made him look like the fool he is may cavendish added now all the girls will be bringing paint to work sylvia and its your fault nobody elses good sylvia said may giggled when the closing whistle blew sylvia left the galoshes factory with a spring in her step that hadnt been there at quitting time for quite a while she got her children off the school playground and was far from the only mother doing so the school didnt take care of children in the classrooms after teaching was done for the day as it had during the war but it did let kids play in the yard till their parents could pick them up that was something if not much im frozen ma george jr said me too mary jane added half the time she agreed with whatever her big brother said the other half she disagreed violently sylvia never knew in advance which tack she would take well be home soon sylvia said weve got the steam radiator and ill be cooking on the stove too so things will be nice and toasty the more time you spend complaining here the longer itll be before youre back for a wonder the kids got the message in fact they ran to the trolley stop ahead of her she might have had a spring in her step but they were children they didnt need to spill paint on anybody to feel energetic after they all got back to the apartment sylvia boiled a lot of cabbage and potatoes and a little corned beef for supper the vegetables were cheap the corned beef wasnt the children loved potatoes and ate cabbage only under protest sylvia had been the same way when she was small as long as she was boiling water for supper she also heated some for the bathroom down at the end of the hall the children were old enough now that she couldnt bathe them together any more that meant going down the hall first with mary jane then with george jr and last by herself by the time she got to use the tub she could hardly tell any hot water had ever gone into it that meant she bathed as fast as she could then she got out threw on a robe wrapped her wet hair in a towel and hurried back to her flat it was just as well that she did she found the children doing their best to kill each other size favored george jr ferocity and long fingernails mary jane cant i leave the two of you alone for five minutes sylvia demanded despite the answer obviously being no she did her best to get to the bottom of what had started the brawl the children told diametrically opposite stories she might have known they would she had known they would this time she couldnt sort out who was lying or whether they both thought they were telling the truth with fine impartiality she whacked both their bottoms i hate you mary jane screamed i hate you even worse than i hate him she pointed to george jr ignoring his sister he told sylvia im never going to speak to you again as long as i live hed made that threat before and once made good on it for a solid half hour long enough to unnerve her she went into the bedroom and looked at her alarm clock its after eight she said you both need to get ready for bed that produced more impassioned protests from the children george jr abandoned silence so he could squawk his head off it did him no good in fifteen minutes he and mary jane were both in bed and asleep very shortly after that sylvia sat down on the couch with a weary sigh she would have to go to bed pretty soon herself when she got up all she had to look forward to was another day at the galoshes factory life was supposed to be better than that wasnt it life would have been bettershe was sure of ithad george lived then he would have been going out to sea true and complaining about the drudgery when he was back on land but no matter how hard the work was hed liked it sylvia wouldnt have liked making galoshes even had frank best not bothered her whenever he wasnt bothering someone else it was only a job something she did to keep food on the table she wished she could quit she sighed again she was trapped the only difference between her and a mouse in a trap was that her back wasnt broken yet if i had that limey submersible skipper here she said id shoot him right between the eyes what the hell was he doing in that part of the atlantic she didnt own a pistol george hadnt kept one in the flat she would gladly have learned to shoot one though if she could have avenged herself on that englishman she shook her head for all she knew the king of england had pinned a medal on him if there was any justice in the world she had a devil of a time seeing where a nasty wind blew snow into lucien galtiers face he pulled down his hat and yanked up the collar of his coat as he made his slow way from the farmhouse to the barn his way had to be slow because of the snow he could hardly tell where the barn lay but his feet knew he accepted quebec winter with the resignation of a man who had never known and scarcely imagined anything different moving to a warmer climate had never crossed his mind quebec boasted no warmer climates besides moving would have taken him off the land his family had farmed since the seventeenth century he was less likely to leave his patrimony than he was to leave his wife and never once in all the years since the priest joined them together had he had any thought of leaving marie when he got to the barn he let out a sigh of relief the horse snorted hearing him come in it was not a snort of friendly greeting in spite of all the hours of conversation that had passed between the two of them as they traveled the roads around the farm no the only thing that snort meant was wheres my breakfast and what kept you so long compose yourself in patience greedy beast galtier said the horse snorted again it was not about to compose itself in patience or any other way it wanted hay and it wanted oats and it wanted them right this second he fed all the livestock and cleaned up the muck by the time he was done with that the muscles in the small of his back were complaining why didn tyou send out georges or charles was what they were complaining he did do that a lot of the time but they were busy elsewhere this morning and he said speaking to his muscles as if they were the horse and therefore incapable of talking back i am not in my dotage if i cannot do this work what good am i but it was not that he couldnt do the work it was that doing the work exacted its price these days and the price went up with the years he went back out into the cold back to the farmhouse once he got close to it he whistled in surprise dr leonard odoulls ford was parked by the house even though his soninlaw worked at the hospital on galtier land he didnt come to visit all that often lucien picked up his pace to see why odoull had come today bonjour mon beaupere odoull said rising to shake his hand marie had already given the young doctor a cup of coffee and a sweet roll bonjour lucien said my daughter and my grandson i trust they are well yes odoull said and marie nodded she must have asked the same question the american went on i have come as i was beginning to tell your wife before you got here to ask a favor of you vraiment lucien said in some surprise odoull was an independent fellow and the favors he asked few and far between galtier waved his arms well if you came here to do that youd better get on with it dont you think yes certainly but odoull hesitated again before finally continuing my mother and father have decided they would like to come up to quebec to see their first grandson you know our house and know that it is not of the largest is itwould it be possible that you might put them up here for a few days visit if it cannot be done you must know i will understand but it would be good if it could before answering galtier glanced toward marie the farmhouse was her province he knew there would be disruption but she was the one to gauge how much only after she gave him a tiny nod did he answer in effusive tones but of course they would be most welcome when would they be traveling up to see you in a couple of weeks if thats all right odoull answered theyre so looking forward to meeting nicole and seeing little lucien and to meeting all of you for your doings have filled the pages of our letters i hope we are not so bad as you will have made us out to be galtier said while leonard odoull was still figuring out how to take that marie asked is it that your mother and father speak french my father does some odoull replied he is a doctor himself and studied french in college my mother has been trying to learn since i decided to live here but i do not know how much she has picked up we will get along galtier said in his rusty english then he had to translate for his wife marie nodded though she had almost no english of her own i thank you very much odoull said with a nod of his own that was almost a bow i will wire them and tell them it is arranged truly they do want to meet you i will also naturally let you know when i hear just when they will arrive in riviereduloup with one more nod he went back to his motorcar and then back to the hospital after the door closed behind him lucien and marie looked at each other they both raised eyebrows and then both started to laugh galtier said well this will be something out of the ordinary at the very least out of the ordinary yes marie agreed and the work we will have to do to be ready in time will be out of the ordinary too she drew herself up straight with pride but we will do it we will not shame ourselves before leonards rich american parents doctors werent necessarily rich but lucien didnt bother contradicting his wife contradicting marie rarely did any good besides she was in essence right galtier too wanted to put on the best show he could for his soninlaws parents over the next couple of weeks a tornado might have passed through the house doing spring cleaning and the laundry that went with spring cleaning while snow lay on the ground wasnt easy but marie and her daughters managed with help from lucien and the two boys whenever they could be roped into it denise whod had the room shed once shared with nicole to herself since her sisters wedding was bundled off to sleep with susanne and jeanne to give the guests a room of their own why have we no electricity marie moaned why have we no piped water why does not matter for these things galtier said with a shrug we do not have them and we cannot have them before the odoulls arrive save your worries for things we can help they will think we are backwards marie said they will think we live on a farm galtier looked around as best i can see they will be right she wrinkled her nose at him shrugging again he added i have heard from our soninlaw that it is the same on farms in the united states as it is here that quieted marie for the time being she got nervous a dozen more times before leonard odoull having met his parents at the train station in riviereduloup brought them and nicole and little lucien down to the farmhouse by then the suits lucien and charles and georges wore had been aired long enough that they no longer smelled of mothballs harvey odoull looked like a shorter older more weathered version of his son rose his wife resembled nothing so much as a suet pudding but her eyes green like leonards were kind i was pleased to meet your lovely daughter at last and i am pleased to meet all of you harvey said his accent about twothirds american onethird parisian i am glad to have you in our family and to be in yours moi aussi his wife said her accent was considerably worse than his but she made the effort to speak at least a little french because she did lucien answered in his own creaky english and i am glad also to meet you please to come inside where it is more hot harvey odoulls eyes had been flicking back and forth around the farm as if they were a camera taking snapshots his face showed a good deal of knowledge how many farms had he seen in the course of his practice a lot probably when he said this is a good place he spoke with authority this is precious rose said in english when they did go inside it wasnt quite the word galtier would have used to describe the house where he lived but it was meant as praise and he accepted it in the spirit offered leonard odoull carried in suitcases his father opened one and rummaged through it i have here for the baby many toys he said in his rather strange french and one also for you m galtier with the air of a man performing a conjuring trick he held up a large bottle of whiskey since i cannot drink all that by myselfat least not right awayi will share it with anyone who would like some galtier said denise run into the kitchen and fetch glasses would you there was plenty of whiskey to go around there would be enough to go around several times to lucien odoull harvey odoull said loudly everyone drank it was lucien galtier discovered not only abundant whiskey but excellent whiskey as well lucien odoull without whom the gathering would not have taken place drank no whiskey he kept pulling himself up to a stand letting go and falling on his bottom his cries were much more of indignation than of hurt he knew he was supposed to get up there on his hind legs but he didnt quite know how dinner featured roast chicken and sausage and mashed potatoes and buttered turnips and maries freshbaked bread nothing was wrong with either senior odoulls appetite and they both praised the food in two languages the first awkward moment came when rose asked in careful french oil est le wc ii n y a pas de wc galtier answered and then in english no toilet with resigned regret he pointed outside one small advantage of cold weather was that the outhouse was less ripe than it would have been in summer rose odoull blinked but wrapped herself in her thick wool coat and sallied forth when she came back she was to luciens surprise smiling i havent been on a twoholer since hector was a pup she said in english lucien didnt know exactly what that meant but he had a pretty fair notion rose also insisted on going back and helping the galtier women with the dishes harvey proved to have brought a box of cigars to go with the fine whiskey after the menfolk were puffing happy clouds he said i hope m galtier we do not put you to too much trouble not at all lucien said it is our pleasure all except denises the incorrigible georges murmured fortunately harvey odoull either did not hear or did not understand he went on with his own train of thought i know how much work a farm is i was a child on a farm to have guests is not easy for a man with much work to do when the guests are the other grandparents of my grandson they are in a way of my own flesh and blood galtier replied harvey odoull nodded you are very much as my son has written of you in his letters he says you are the finest gentleman he ever met the key word was in english but galtier understood it he glared at leonard odoull and spoke fiercely see what lies you have been spreading about me harvey odoull started to explain himself thinking lucien had misunderstood and really was insulted leonard odoull who knew his fatherinlaw better wagged a forefinger at him a thoroughly french gesture for an irishman to use if i had not heard the words come from your lips i would have thought georges had spoken them tabernac galtier exploded now i am insulted so am i georges said they all laughed lucien had not thought his meeting with these americans would begin so well but then he reflected he had not thought his meetings with any americans would go so well as they had occasionallybut only occasionally the stubborn peasant part of him insisted surprises were good ones scipio stood in line outside the augusta georgia city hall with more worry in his heart than he let his face show the queue of black people stretched for blocks every so often a white passing by would offer a jeer or a curse grayclad policemen kept the whites from doing anything worse if theyd intended to bathsheba squeezed his hand hope none o them freedom party buckra come to raise a ruction he nodded me too that was indeed one of the worries he was doing his best to conceal as those worries went though it was only a small one bathsheba cheerfully went on passbooks wont be so bad did well enough with em before an i reckon we can again just a nuisance is all i hopes yous right scipio said he had his doubts the freedom party men in congress were the ones whod introduced the law tightening up the passbook system in the csa which had fallen to pieces during the great war he distrusted anything that had anything to do with the freedom party but that worry wasnt at the top of his list either the line slowly snaked forward not toward the front entrance to the city hallwhites wouldnt have stood for blacks impeding their progress that waybut toward a side door negroes newly issued passbooks went out the back way some of them came around to talk with friends still in line look like a police station in there one of them said they got wanted posters up for every nigger ever spit on the sidewalk a couple of blacks hearing that suddenly found other things to do than stand in line just then scipio felt like finding something else to do too but from what he read in the papers he was more likely to get in trouble without a passbook later than he was to be recognized now maybe a poster with his namehis real nameon it would be hanging there with all the rest nobody in georgia wanted him except bathsheba and he was glad she had him everything hed done for the congaree socialist republic had been over in south carolina he was perfectly happy to have people beating the bushes for him there he never intended to set foot in the state again up the worn stone steps leading to the side door he and bathsheba went glad we aint doin this in the summertime he said we melt jus as fas as the ice under the fish over at erasmusplace for true bathsheba agreed when they got inside she looked along the hallway that fellow werent lyin who would have thought there was so many bad niggers in this here town scipio scanned the wanted posters sure as hell there was a faded one with his name on it the poster though bore no picture hed been photographed only a couple of times in his life and those images had gone up in smoke when marshlands burned hed never had any brushes with the police as had the men and women whose photos adorned most of the fliers on the other hand if caught for his political crimes hed face the gallows or a firing squad at last he came before a sourfaced white clerk name the fellow asked xerxes scipio answered and then had to spell it for the clerk whod started it with a z instead of anx being corrected by a black man made the clerks face even more sour but he made the change residence address he said and scipio gave him the address of the roominghouse over in the terry the clerk didnt have any trouble getting that down on paper then he asked birthplace i were borned on a plantation over in south carolina scipio hoped his sudden tension didnt show he hadnt expected that question but the clerk only nodded you talk like it he said and wrote south carolina on the passbook and on the form that would record its new owner he asked about scipios age on general principles scipio lied five years off it his employer and his employers address after taking all that down he said state the time and reason your previous passbook was lost suh it were reckons scipio said an i were gettin the hell out o where i was at on account of i didnt want to git kilt didnt take nothin but de clothes on my back the clerk grunted another patriotic nigger running away from the reds he said if i had a dimea real silver dime i meanfor every time ive heard that one the past couple days id be a hell of a rich man but he was just blowing off steam in general he didnt seem to disbelieve scipio in particular when scipio didnt flinch the clerk grunted again raise your right hand scipio obeyed do you solemnly swear that the information you have given me in regard to this book is true and complete so help you god the white man droned yes suh scipio said still droning the clerk went on the penalty for perjury in regard to this book may be fine or imprisonment or both as a court of law may determine do you understand scipio nodded the clerk looked miffed perhaps at finding a black man who didnt need the word perjury explained to him thrusting the new passbook at scipio he said keep this book in your possession at all times it must be shown or surrendered on demand of any competent official if you move or change jobs in augusta you must notify city hall or a police station within five days you must have the proper stamp in the book before you travel outside richmond county penalty for violating those provisions is also fine or imprisonment or both do you understand all that yes suh scipio repeated all right then the clerk said as if washing his hands of him go down that hall and into one of the rooms on the left get yourself photographed a copy of the photograph will be sent to you it must go into your passbook on the blank page opposite your personal information if you do not receive it within two weeks come back here to be photographed again next bathsheba whod gone to the clerk next to the one whod dealt with scipio was waiting when he finished together they went to get their pictures taken the photography room was full of flashpowder smoke as if soldiers with oldfashioned weapons had fought a battle in there foomp a photographer set off more flash powder scipios eyes watered at the blast of light do jesus he exclaimed a blowing greenpurple spot danced at the center of his vision before slowly fading that was just like lookin into the sun bathsheba said as the two of them made their blinking way to the back door and out of the augusta city hall sure enough was scipio said he put the passbook in the pocket of his dungarees if he couldnt leave the county without getting the book stamped confederate authorities were tightening up with a vengeance and yet oddly that bothered him only a little now he had an official document to prove he was xerxes of augusta georgia that made it much harder for anne colletonor anyone else but he worried most about miss anneto accuse him of ever having been scipio the bloodthirsty red he spotted aurelius in the line of men and women waiting to get passbooks and waved to the waiter with whom hed worked at john oglethorpes restaurant before the white man let him go aurelius waved back how you is scipio called aurelius waggled his hand back and forth same as always he looked from scipio to bathsheba and back again you look like yous doin pretty good for yourself he said with a smile this here my intended scipio answered proudly he introduced bathsheba and aurelius then asked how mistuh oglethorpe doin he dont change aurelius said tough as rocks on the outside sof as butter underneath scipio nodded that described his former boss very well he was about to say so when a shout from farther up greene street made him whip his head around the shout was one hed heard before freedom it seemed to come from a great many throats all up and down the queue negroes looked at one another and up the street in alarm no one with a dark skin thought of the freedom party with anything but dread freedom that great shout was closer now scipio glanced at the policemen whod been keeping the line orderly hed always seen the white police as a tool for keeping negroes in their place now he hoped they could protect him and his people past the line of negroes came the freedom party marchers scipio stared at them in dismay hundreds of men tramped along in disciplined ranks they all wore white shirts and butternut pants many of them had steel helmets on their heads the men in the first rank carried the stars and bars and confederate battle flags the men in the second rank bore white banners with freedom printed on them in angry red letters and others that might have been confederate battle flags save that they featured a red st andrews cross on blue not blue on red freedom the marchers roared again had they turned on the negroes in line outside the city hall the handful of policemen could not have hoped to stop them but they just kept marching and shouting their oneword slogan that showed discipline too and frightened scipio almost as much as an attack would have done he looked from the marchers back to the police not only were the policemen outnumbered they also seemed cowed by the freedom partys show of force it was almost as if the marchers represented the confederate government and the police were civilian spectators them bastards is bad trouble aurelius said speaking in a low voice to make sure he gave the white men no excuse to do anything but march every time the freedom party do something mo poor buckra join they than the time befo scipio said that go on they gwine end up runnin this here country one fine day what they do then whatever they please bathsheba said they do whatever they please aint nothin we can do about it anyways aurelius said scipio suddenly felt the weight of the passbook in his pocket it might have been the weight of a ball and chain for the very first time he truly sympathized with the red uprising in which hed played an unwilling part this march was what cassius and cherry and the other reds had feared the most but their uprising had helped spawn the freedom party scipio understood the dialectic and how it worked even if he didnt think of it as revealed truth and the black uprising had failed as any black uprising was bound to do too few blacks too few weapons what did that leave for negroes in the csa nothing he could see wes trapped he said hoping bathsheba or aurelius would argue with him neither of them did which worried him more than anything sam carsten slammed a shell into the breech of the fiveinch gun he served aboard the uss remembrance fire willie moore shouted carsten jerked the lanyard the cannon roared the shell casing fell to the deck with a clang of brass on steel one of the shelljerkers behind sam handed him a fresh round coughing a little from the cordite fumes he reloaded the gun moore peered out through the sponsons vision slit i think weve got to bring it down a couple hundred yards to drop it just where we want it he said and fiddled with the elevation screw to achieve the result he wanted when he was satisfied he nodded to sam give em another one right chief sam yanked the lanyard again the gun bellowed carsten said christ by the time were through with belfast there wont be anything left of it damn stubborn crazy micks moore said the ones who want to stay part of england i mean not the ones who aim to put all of ireland into one country theyre damn stubborn crazy micks too but theyre on our side overhead two aeroplanes roared off the deck of the remembrance one on the others heels theyll give the belfasters something to think about sam said that they will the commander of the gun crew agreed no doubt about it he peered through the slit again sons of bitches he burst out the bastards are shooting back one just splashed into the water a few hundred yards short of us one of the shelljerkers joe gilbertlike most in his slot a big muscular fellowsaid goddamn limeys must have smuggled in some more guns yeah carsten said and if we call em on it theyll say they never did any such thingtheir pet micks mustve come up with the guns and the shells under a flat rock somewhere or else made em themselves officially britain recognized irelands independence shed had to the united states and the german empire had forced the concession from her the royal navy never ventured into the irish sea to challenge the remembrance or any other us german or irish warship but hordes of small freighters and fishing boats smuggled arms and ammunition and sometimes fighting men into the loyalist northeastern part of ireland the british foreign office blandly denied knowing anything about that however many ships stood between ireland on the one hand and england and scotland on the other the gun runners always found gaps through which they could slip willie moore said the damn micksour damn micks i meanhad better start doing a better job of patrolling thats all ive got to tell you its their goddamn country if they cant hang on to it all by their lonesome i can tell you we aint gonna hang around forever to pull their chestnuts out of the fire he adjusted the elevation screw again let em have the next one now aye aye sam fired the fiveinch gun again he had to step smartly to keep the casing from landing on his toes joe gilbert passed him another shell he was bending to load it into the breech when a shell from the shore slammed into the sponson that he was bending saved his life most of the shells force was spent in penetrating the armor that protected the sponson but a fragment gutted willie moore as if he were a muskie pulled from a minnesota lake another one hissed over sams head and into gilberts neck the shelljerker fell without a sound his head almost severed from his body moore screamed and screamed and screamed sam could look out through the hole the shell had torn and see the ocean and beyond it burning belfast he wasted only a tiny fraction of a second on that what to do when the sponson got hit had been drilled into him during more than ten years in the navy no firehe checked that first inside the sponson it was just bare metal with no paint to burn that didnt always help but it had this time the ammunition wouldnt go up next check the gun crew joe gilbert was beyond help blood dripped from sams shoes when he picked up his feet calvin wesley the other shellhauler hadnt been scratched he gaped at gilberts twitching corpse as if hed never seen one before he was a veteraneverybody aboard the remembrance was a veteranso that was hard to imagine but maybe it was so willie moore kept shrieking one glance at what the shell had done told sam all he needed to know he opened the aid kit on the wall of the sponson a shell fragment had scarred the thick metal right beside it from the kit he drew two syringes of morphine one might have been enough but he wanted to make sure he stooped beside moore here chief ill take care of you he gave the gunners mate all the morphine in both syringes after a very little while moore fell silent thats too much wesley said itll kill him thats the idea sam said he watched moores chest it stopped moving like a man waking up from a bad dream carsten shook himself come on god damn it weve got this gun to fight you know how to load right i better wesley answered i seen you guys do it often enough all right then you load and fire and ill aim the damn gun sam had seen that done often enough too and practiced it himself when he got the chance during drills the hit had torn the left side of the sponson too badly for the gun to track all the way in that direction otherwise though he was still in business fire calvin wesley sent on its way the shell sam had been loading when they were struck he was setting the next round into the breech when someone out in the passage pounded on the dogged hatch a shout came through the thick steel anybody alive in there fire sam said and the gun roared that should have answered the question but the pounding went on he nodded to wesley undog it aye aye the shelljerker obeyed half a dozen men spilled into the sponson commander grady among them two dead sir carsten said crisply but we can still use the gun so i gather grady looked at the bodies his rabbity features stayed expressionless hed seen his share of bodies before after a moments thought he nodded briskly all right carsten this is your gun for the time being ill get you shellheavers well clean up this mess and get on with the job another shell from the shore splashed into the irish sea close enough to the remembrance to send some water through the hole the hit had made in the sponsons armor sam said sir if we can use a couple of aeroplanes to shoot up that gun and its crew our life will get easier even as he spoke one of the wright fighting scouts buzzed off the deck of the aeroplane carrier followed a moment later by another and then another commander grady said you arent the only one with that idea you see never figured i would be sam answered not altogether truthfully all his time in the navy had taught him that officers often had trouble seeing things that should have been obvious grady pointed to two of the ratings with him drinkwater you and jorgenson stay here and jerk shells carsten can wesley cut the mustard as a loader sir if we fired with a twoman crew well sure as hell do a lot better with four sam answered calvin wesley shot him a grateful glance loader would be a step up for wesley as crew chief was a step up for sam sam wished he hadnt earned it like this but as was the navy way nobody paid any attention to what he wished grady pointed to the dead meat that had been willie moore and joe gilbert get these bodies out of here he ordered the men he hadnt appointed to the gun crew weve already spent too much time here as the sailors dragged the corpses out of the sponson sam took what had been willie moores spot the chief of a gun crew had an advantage denied the rest of the menhe could see out whenever he chose through the vision slit through the rangefinder and now through the hole that would when time allowed no doubt have a steel plate welded over it sam peered southwest toward the shore half a dozen miles away the fighting scouts the remembrance had launched were buzzing around something a flash told carsten it was the gun that had fired on his ship the shell fell astern of the aeroplane carrier he twisted the calibration screw on the rangefinder and read out the exact distance to the target yards willie moore had known without having to think how far to elevate the gun for a hit at that distance sam didnt he glanced at a yellowing sheet of paper above the vision slit a range table checking the elevation he saw the gun was a little low and adjusted it then he traversed it ever so slightly to the left firer he shouted hed given the order before with only calvin wesley in the sponson with him but it seemed more official now if he fought the gun well it might be his to keep wesley let out a yelp as the shell casing just missed mashing his instep but when one of the new shellheavers handed him the next round he slammed it home in good style you want to mind your feet sam said traversing the gun a little farther on its track you can spend some time on crutches if you dont he turned the screw another quarter of a revolution fire he spied another flash in the same instant as his own gun spoke the shell the probritish rebels launched was a near miss at the range at which he was fighting he could not tell whether hed hit or missed but the gun on the shore did not fire again either his shell had silenced it one from a different fiveincher had done the trick or the aeroplanes from the remembrance had exterminated the crew he didnt waste time worrying over which was so as long as the irish rebels couldnt hurt the remembrance any more he was free to go back to what his gun had been doing before the ship came under fire pounding belfast to bits sooner or later the rebels would figure out they couldnt win the war against their more numerous opponentsand against the might of germany and the united states if they needed help figuring that out he would gladly lend a hand the shellheavers were just hired muscle big men with strong backs calvin wesley did his new job well enough though sam knew hed done it better himself he shrugged willie moore would have handled the gun better than he was doing it experience counted only one way to get it he muttered and set about the business of acquiring as much as he could roger kimballs heart thumped with anticipation as he knocked on the hotelroom door hed met anne colleton this way whenever shed let him once shed opened the door and greeted him naked as the day she was born her imagination knew no bounds neither did his own appetites with a slight squeak the door opened the figure in the doorway was not naked it was not anne colleton either kimballs heart kept pounding just the same vengeance was an appetite too as anne would have agreed in a flash welcome to charleston mr featherston kimball said thank you kindly commander kimball jake featherston answered the words were polite enough but he didnt sound kindly not even a little bit and he bore down on kimballs title in a way that was anything but admiring but after he stood aside to let kimball come in his tone warmed a little i hear tell ive got you to thank for whispering my name into miss colletons ear its done the party good and i wont say anything different that was probably why hed agreed to see kimball did he recall the dismissive telegram hed sent down to charleston he must have he had the look of a man who remembered everything kimball didnt intend to bring it up if featherston didnt as for whispering featherstons name into anne colletons ear well mentioning it on the telephone was one thing but when anne let him get close enough to whisper in her ear he had other things to say want a drink featherston asked when kimball nodded the leader of the freedom party pulled a bottle out of a cabinet and poured two mediumsized belts after handing kimball one glass he raised the other high to revenge to revenge kimball echoed that was a toast to which hed always drink he took a long pull at the whiskey warmth spread from his middle ahh thanks thats fine stuff not bad not bad jake featherston pointed to a chair set yourself down kimball and tell me whats on your mind ill do that kimball sat crossed his legs and balanced the whiskey glass on his higher knee featherston seemed as direct in his private dealings as he was on the stump kimball approved nobody diffident ever commanded a submersible i want to know how serious you are about going after the high muckymucks in the war department ive never been more serious about anything in my life if featherston was lying he was damn good at it they made a hash of the war and they dont want to own up to it something else joined the anger that filled his narrow features something kimball needed a moment to recognize calculation besides if the freedom party congressmen keep asking for hearings and the whigs and the radical liberals keep turning us down who looks good and who looks bad slowly kimball nodded isnt that pretty he said it keeps the partys name in the papers too same as the passbook bill did thats right the calculation left featherstons face the anger stayed kimball got the idea that the anger never left niggers havent gotten half of what they deserve not yet they havent and even the niggerloving congressmen up in richmond now wont stop us from giving it to em bully roger kimballs voice was savage when the uprising started they kept my boat the bonefish from going out on patrol against the damnyankees instead i had to sail up the pee dee and pretend i was a river gunboat so i could fight the stinking reds i knew they were going to rise up featherston said i knew they were going to try and kick the white race right in the balls and when i tried to warn people what did i get what did the goddamn war department give me a pat on the head thats what a pat on the head and a set of stripes on my sleeve they might as well have tattooed on my arm on account of i wouldnt get em off till judgment day thats what i got for being right his eyes blazed roger kimball was impressed in spite of himself more impressed than hed thought he would be hed known how featherston could sway crowds hed been swayed in a crowd himself hed expected the force of the freedom party leaders personality to be less in a personal meeting like this if anything though it was greater with all his heart he wanted to believe everything jake featherston said kimball had to gather himself before he could say you dont want to throw the baby out with the bathwater though the war department could do the country some good once the dead wood got cleared out yeah likely tell featherston jeered best thing that could happen to the war department would be blowing it to hell and gone and anybody who says anything different is just as big a traitor as the lying dogs in there thats shit kimball said without raising his voice featherstons eyes opened very wide kimball grinned he got the idea nobody had spoken that way to featherston in quite a while grinning still he went on without the war department for instance how are we going to get decent barrels built youd best believe the damnyankees are working to make theirs tougher same as they are with aeroplanes dont you reckon we ought to do the same barrels stinking barrels featherston muttered under his breath hed stopped jeering now he watched kimball as a man might watch a rattlesnake in the shocked instant after its tail began to buzz no he hadnt had a supporter talk back to him for a while it threw him off stride left him startled and confused but he rallied quickly well yes christ knows well need new barrels when we fight the usa again but where the hell are they are we working on them not that ive ever heard and ive got ears in all sorts of funny places weve got people mercenariesusing some old ones down south of the border but new ones forget it proves what i told you doesnt it pack of damn traitors in the war department when we fight the usa again featherstons calm acceptance of the next war took kimballs breath away or rather made it come fast and hard as if anne colleton had greeted him in the doorway naked he wanted that next war too he hadnt wanted to give up on the last one but hed had no choice seeing how much featherston longed for it made him forget their disagreement of a moment before when he didnt answer back right away the sparkle returned to featherstons eye the freedom party leader said reckon you were just sticking up for the officers in richmond seeing as you were one yourself screw the officers in richmond kimball said evenly yes i was an officer i fucking earned being an officer when i won an appointment at the naval academy in mobile off a lousy little arkansas farm i earned my way through the academy too and i earned every promotion i got once the war started and if you dont like that sargehe laced featherstons chosen title with scornyou can go to hell he thought hed have a fight on his hands then and there he wasnt sure he could win it either jake featherston had the hard rangy look of a man whod cause more than his share of trouble in a brawl but featherston surprised him by throwing back his head and laughing all right you were an officer but you aint one of those blueblooded little goddamn pukes like jeb stuart iii that worthless sack of horse manure blueblooded me not likely kimball laughed too after my pa died i walked behind the ass end of a mule till i figured out i didnt want to do that for a living any more ill tell you something else too it didnt take me real long to figure that out either dont reckon it would have featherston said all right kimball you were an officer but you were my kind of officer when im president reckon i can find you a place up in richmond if you want it when im president he said that as calmly as hed said when we fight the usa again he said it as surely too his confidence made kimball gasp again a little hoarsely the exsubmersible skipper said so you are going to run next year hell yes ill run featherston answered i wont win the people here arent ready yet to do the hard things that need doing but when i run when i tell em what well have to do thatll help make em ready you know what im saying kimball the road needs building before i can run my motorcar down it yeah i know what youre saying kimball knew he sounded abstracted he couldnt help it hed thought about guiding jake featherston the way a rider guided a horse after half an hours conversation with featherston that seemed laughable absurd preposteroushe couldnt find a word strong enough the leader of the freedom party knew where he wanted to go knew with a certainty that made the hair stand up on the back of kimballs neck whether he would get there was another question but he knew where the road went far more cautiously than hed spoken before kimball said im not the only officer you could use you know you shouldnt be down on all of us take clarence potter for instance he featherston cut him off with a sharp chopping gesture you and him are pals i remember that but i havent got any real use for him theres no fire in the man he thinks too damn much its not the fellow who thinks like a professor who gets a pile of ordinary working folks all het up its somebody who thinks like them its somebody who talks like them hed just piss and moan about that on account of he cant do it himself recalling potters yaleflavored yankeesounding accent and his relentless precision kimball found himself nodding he said i bet you would have had more use for him though if hed come over to the party right away hell and blazes of course i would featherston said but i can see him now lookin down his nose peerin over the tops of his spectacleshe gave a viciously excellent impression of a man doing just thatand reckoning i was nothing but a damn fool maybe he knows better nowadays but maybe its too late kimball didnt say anything at all featherstons judgment of clarence potter was close to his own clarence was a fine fellowkimball wouldnt have gone so far in denigrating him as featherston hadbut he did think too much for his own good were on the way up featherston said were on the way up and nobodys going to stop us now that im here im damn glad i came down to charleston i can use you kimball youre a hungry bastard just like me there arent enough of us you know what im saying i sure do kimball stuck out his hand featherston clasped it they clung to each other for a moment locked in the alliance of the mutually useful the president of the confederate states kimball reflected was eligible for only one sixyear term if jake featherston did win the job who would take it after him roger kimball hadnt known any such ambition before but he did now x excitement built in chester martin as winter gave way to spring before long spring would give way to summer when summer came to toledo so would the socialist party national convention not debs again he said to albert bauer hes run twice and hes lost twice weve got to pick somebody new this time a fresh face its not like it was in or in either weve got a real chance to win this year in and you were a damn democrat bauer returned stuffing an envelope what gives you the right to tell the party what to do now martins wave took in the local headquarters that i am here now and wouldnt have been caught dead here then proves my point doesnt it his friend grunted maybe youve got something bauer said grudgingly after a moment though he brightened this must be how the real oldtime socialists felt when lincoln brought so many republicans into the party after the second mexican war it was nice having more than half a dozen people come to meetings and vote for you but a lot of the new folks didnt know a hell of a lot about what socialism was supposed to mean are you saying i dont know much martin asked amusement in his voice tell me about the means of production albert bauer said explain why they dont belong in the hands of the capitalist class i dont have to sit still for examinations im not in school any more thank god martin said i dont know much about the means of production and i dont give a damn either what i do know is the democrats have jumped into bed with the fat cats i want a party to jump into bed with me youre voting your class interest bauer said well thats a start at least you know you have a class interest which is a devil of a lot more than too many people do you wouldnt believe how much trouble weve had educating the proletariat to fulfill its proper social role yeah and one of the reasons why is that you keep talking so fancy nobody wants to pay any attention to you martin said you keep on doing that the socialists are going to lose this election same as theyve lost all the others and god only knows when well ever have a better chance by the way bauer winced and grimaced he knew hed struck a nerve maybe even struck it harder than hed intended what do you think bauer asked shifting the subject a little will tr run for a third term nobody ever has before martin answered but that wasnt the question bauer had asked at length he said yeah i think he will whats he going to do dust off his hands and walk away go hunt lions and elephants in africa you ask me he likes doing what hes doing hell try and keep doing it he held up a forefinger heres one for you al if teddy does run again will that make things easier or harder for us im damned if i know bauer replied his voice troubled nobody knows maybe people will remember he fought the war and won it if they do theyll vote for him or maybe theyll remember how many men died and all the trouble weve had since if they do that they wont touch him with a tenfoot pole the war will have been over for almost three and a half years by the time the election rolls around martin said thats a fact albert bauer sounded glad it was a fact too people dont remember things very long of coursehe didnt seem to want to be glad about anythingthe great war is a big thing to forget losing two elections in a row is a big thing to forget too and thats what debs has done martin said if we do run him again whatll our slogan be third times the charm i dont think thatll work he walks in and he knows all the answers bauer might have been talking to the ceiling since he spoke of martin in the third person he wasntquitetalking to him but then he was once more all right all right maybe not debs but if we dont run him who do we run hes the one fellow weve got who has a following across the whole damn country you pick somebody chester martin said youre always going on about how youre the oldtime red so you have to know all these people im nothing but a damn recruit thats what you keep telling me anyway go peddle your papers bauer said a little less gruffly he continued go on take the rest of the day off its sunday for christs sake dont you have anything better to do with your time probably martin got up from the table where he and his friend had been preparing fliers for mailing but if too many people find better things to do with their time than work for the party the work wont get done where will we be then up the same old creek bauer admitted but the rebs wont capture philadelphia if you have yourself a couple of beers or something twist my arm martin said and bauer did not very hard martin groaned anyway aii thereyou made me do it see you later when he stepped outside spring was in the air while hed fought in the roanoke valley it had arrived sooner and more emphatically than it did here by the shore of lake erie that was the one good thing he could say about virginia against it he set filth and stench and horror and fear and pain and mud and lice they sent the scales crashing down against the place how many veterans would weigh what theyd been through in the same fashion was what theyd done worth it could anything have been worth three years of hell on earth he didnt think so especially not when he reckoned in the trouble hed had after the war was over would the rest of the millions whod worn greengraythose of them left alive anyhowfeel as he did if so teddy roosevelt faced more trouble than he guessed red flags flew above the socialists building toledo cops still prowled past martin no longer carried a pistol in his pocket something like peace had returned to the labor scene he wondered how long it would last the answer supplied itself till the day after the election one of the policemen in brassbuttoned dark blue flashed martin a thumbsup martin was so surprised to get it he tripped on a crack in the sidewalk and almost fell during the great wave of strikes that cop had undoubtedly broken workers heads along with his goonish chums did he think he could turn into a good socialist with one simple gesture if he did he was an even bigger fool than the usual run of cop or maybe he was a straw blowing in the wind of change if a cop found it a good idea to show somebody coming out of the socialist hall that he wasnt hostile who held the power who was liable to hold it after march maybe the policeman was hedging his bets wont do you any good martin muttered under his breath well still remember you bastards hell yes we will he listened to himself that was when he began to think the party that had wandered so long in the wilderness might have a chance to come home at last the democrats had ruled the roost for a long time they wouldnt be happy about clearing out not after all these years they wouldnt too damn bad martin said red socialist posters were plastered on every wall and fence and telegraph pole they shouted for freedom and justice in big black letters for once more of them were up than their redwhiteandblue democratic counterparts those showed the us eagle flying high over a burning confederate flag and bore a oneword message victory as poster art went the democrats handbills were pretty good the only drawback chester martin found in them was that they bragged about old news as bauer had said people forgot things in a hurry martin walked over to the trolley stop and rode back to the apartment building where he and his parents and sister lived they were playing hearts threehanded about time you got home his father said this is a better game when the cards come out even when you deal em see what you get for starting without me martin said drawing up a chair dad wants to throw in this game because hes losing his sister said but sues grin said she didnt mind throwing it in either my own flesh and blood insult me stephen douglas martin said if id told my father anything like that gramps would have laughed his head off and you know it martin said he gathered the cards and fanned them in his hand draw for first deal he ended up dealing himself after generously donating the ace of spades and a couple of hearts to his mother who sat on his left and receiving a similar load of trash from his sister who sat on his right he called all right wheres the deuce out came the two of clubs as the hand was played his father asked did you get the whole world settled there at the socialist meeting hall sure as heck did martin said cheerfully the revolution of the proletariat starts next wednesday seven oclock in the morning sharp youd better step lively popyou dont want to be late he took a trick with the ace of diamonds then led the ten of spades lets see where the queens hiding ask a stupid question get a stupid answer his father said as chesters mother had done he ducked the spade so did sue stephen douglas martin went on do people want it to be that rabblerousing fool of a debs again some people do martin answered i think wed have a better chance with somebody else since the ten of spades had failed to flush out the queen he led the nine maybe thisll make her show up his mother pained and set out the ace of spades his father grinned and tucked the king under it his sister grinned even wider and dropped the queen sticking his mother with thirteen points she didnt want there you go ma sue said sweetly thank you so much louisa martin said she turned to her son when the revolution comes will the queen only be worth one point to make her equal with all the hearts in the deck dont know about that one ma chester said i dont think theres a plank that talks about it in the socialist party platform is there a plank that explains why they think we need anybody but bully old teddy stephen douglas martin inquired i can think of two his son replied first one is nobodys ever had three terms if tr decides to run again he shouldnt either and even if the democrats run somebody else they have to explain what we got for all the men who got killed and maimed during the war and why theyve been in the trusts pocket ever since when he was around albert bauer he sounded like a reactionary when he was around his parentswho were in his view of things reactionarieslie sounded as radical as bauer did the more he thought about that the funnier it seemed the quitting whistles scream cut through the din on the floor of the sloss works like a wedge splitting a stump jefferson pinkard leaned on his crowbar another day done he said another million dollars he wasnt making a million dollars a day but he was making better than a million a week next month probably hed be up over a million a day it didnt matter what the csa called money was only a joke one that kept getting funnier as the banknotes sprouted more and more zeros the bottom line was hed lived better before the war than he did now that was so for almost everybody in the confederate states see you in the mornin mistuh pinkard vespasian said yeah jeff answered see you he didnt make his voice cold on purpose it just came out that way the more he went to freedom party meetings the less he cared to work alongside a black man vespasian turned away and headed for the time clock to punch out without another word pinkard wasnt in the habit of bragging about going out on freedom party assault squadrons but he wouldnt have been surprised had vespasian known about it blacks had funny ways of finding out things like that too damn bad jeff thought tired and sweaty he headed toward the time clock himself going into and out of the sloss foundry whites had always hung with whites and negroes with negroes that hadnt changed what had changed lately was how men from one group eyed those from the other blacks seemed warier than they had been during the war whites seemed less happy about having so many colored men around doing jobs they wouldnt have been allowed to do before the war started pinkard understood that down to the ground it was how he felt himself he didnt stop sweating just because hed stopped working for the day spring had come to birmingham full of promises about what the summer would be like if those promises werent so many lies summer would be hotter than hell and twice as muggy summer in birmingham was usually like that so the promises probably held truth when he got close to home bedford cunningham waved to him bedford was sitting on his own front porch with a glass of something unlikely to be water on the rail in front of him come on over after supper jeff he called well hoist a few he hoisted the one sitting on the rail cant tonight pinkard answered got a meeting man alive cunningham shook his head back and forth back and forth by the way he did it that one on the rail wasnt the first hed hoisted never reckoned youd dive into the freedom party like a turtle diving off a rock into a creek it was when you got down to it a pretty fair figure of speech jeff felt a lot happier swimming in the river of the party than he did out on a rock by his lonesome he said maybe you ought to come along give yourself somethin to do besides gettin lit up i like getting lit up cunningham said what the hell better have i got to do anyhow cant hardly work not shy an arm ill vote freedom sure as hell i will but i dont fancy sitting around and listening to people making speeches its not like that jeff protested but bedford cunningham was hoisting his glass again with a shrug pinkard went up the walk and into his own house hello dear emily said she tilted up her face for a kiss he gave her one rather a perfunctory job she didnt try to improve it i know you got your meeting tonight she went on when he let her go so supperll be on the table for you in two shakes of a lambs tail she went back into the kitchen to dish it out she didnt shake her own tail as she would have not so long before jeff paid no attention to the change good thing you remembered he told her barney stevens is back in town from richmond and hes going to let us know what those bastards in congress are up to i dont want to be late not for that you wont be emily promised her voice floating out through the hall come on and set yourself down he did then shoveled chicken and dumplings into his face with the singleminded dedication a stoker might have shown in shoveling coal into a steam engines firebox then after bestowing another absentminded kiss on his wife he headed over to the closest trolley stop for the ride to the livery stable where the freedom party still met he felt at home there more even than he did in the cottage hed shared with emily since the days before the war almost all the men whod joined the party were veterans as he was theyd fought the damnyankees in virginia in kentucky in arkansas in sequoyah in texas in sonora and most of them had put on white shirts and butternut pants these past few months and gone charging forth to break up rival parties rallies and to remind the blacks of birmingham where in the scheme of things they belonged freedom he said every time he shook somebodys hand or slapped somebody else on the back and men also reached out to clasp his hand and slap his back and hailed him with the oneword greeting that was also a battle cry he might have been a freemason or an odd fellow everyone in the livery stable with him was his brother along with everyone else he stamped and whistled and clapped when barney stevens massive and impressive in a black suit strode to the front of the open area freedom stevensnow congressman stevenscalled freedom his audience roared back jefferson pinkard felt different when he used the slogan along with his comrades it took on a power then that it lacked when it was simply a greeting it became a promise and at the same time a warning anyone who didnt care for the freedom partys ideas needed to get out of the way and in a hurry too boys weve got a power of work to do and thats a fact barney stevens said nobodys mucked out that big barn they call the capitol in a hell of a long time most of the folks theyve been there since dirt or else their pappies were there since dirt and theyre taking over after the old man finally upped and dropped dead damn fancypants bluebloods stevens fluttered his hand on a limp wrist the freedom party men howled laughter he went on but were starting to get things moving to hell with me if were not this business with passbooks was just the first shell in the bombardment let me tell you some of what i mean after a while jeff found himself yawning stevens wasnt a bad speakerfar from it but jeff hadnt joined the freedom party to pay close attention to the nuts and bolts of policy hed joined because hed felt down in his bones that something had gone dreadfully wrong with his country and he thought jake featherston could fix it exactly how it got fixed didnt matter so much to him as getting together every week with other people who followed featherston and going out with them every so often to bust the heads of people who didnt that brought back the sense of camaraderie hed known in the trenches about the only good thing hed known in the war and so when barney stevens went on and on about hearings and taxes and tariffs and labor legislation jeff slipped from the middle of the open area in the livery stable toward the back sorry grady he whispered after stepping on another mans toes he noticed he wasnt the only fellow moving toward the back of the stable either everybody was glad to have stevens in congress but hed lost part of his audience tonight hed been elected to take care of the details not to bore everybody with them pinkard wasnt the first one to slide out the door my wifes a bit poorly he whispered to the two burly guards as he left they nodded odds were they knew he was lying he shrugged hed been politeand hed thrown half a million dollars into the big bowl by the door as long as he was both polite and paid up the guards didnt care if he left early since he was leaving early emily would probably still be awake maybe theyd make the mattress creak when he got home for some reason shed acted kind of standoffish toward him lately hed take care of that by god horning it out of her was the best way he knewhed enjoy it too he took the trolley to the edge of sloss company housing then walked to his cottage a few people still sat on their front porches enjoying the fine night air he wondered if hed see bedford cunningham on his drunk or passed out but bedford must have gone inside to bed because he wasnt there pinkards own house was also dark so he figured emily had gone to bed too well if she had hed damn well wake her up he turned his key in the lock the door didnt squeak as it swung on its hinges hed oiled them after he came home from the war and quietly kept them oiled ever since hed caught emily cheating on him once and wanted a fair chance to do it again if she stepped out of line she hadnt not that he knew of but the hinges didnt squeak but something in the house was squeaking squeaking rhythmically he knew what that noise was it came from the bedroom rage filled him the same rage he knew when he put on white and butternut and went off to break heads but focused now as if with a burning glass god damn you emily you little whore he bellowed and stomped down the hall toward the bedroom twin cries of horror greeted him one emilys the other a mans they were closely followed by scrabbling noises a thump and the sound of running feet whoeverd been in there with emily hadnt wanted to face jeff as jeff stormed in his feet caught on something then kicked something else a mans tangled trousers and his shoe whoever the fellow was hed departed too quickly to bother retrieving his clothes jeff honey listen to me emily spoke in a quick high desperate voice shut up he said and she did she hugged the blanket to herself the moonlight sliding in through the windowthe window through which her lover had fledshowed her arms pale and bare against the dark blue wool he yanked the blanket off her she was naked under it hed known she would be breathing hard he lashed out and slapped her twice forehand and backhand fast as a striking snake she gasped but made no other sound if he killed her on the spot no jury would convict him she had to know as much when hed caught her the first time shed used all her bodily charms to mollify him it had worked too even if hed felt filthy and used as he traveled back to the front in west texas now he aimed to use his body to take revenge he undid his trousers let them fall to the floor and flung himself upon her she endured everything he did without a whimper without a protest in other circumstances he might have admired that now he just wanted to break her as if she were a wild horse when his imagination and stamina ran out at last he got up from the bed and lit the gas lamp above it having spent himself again and again he was prepared to go easyand too worn to do anything else or so he thought till he saw that the shirt on the floor had the left sleeve pinned up bedford he whispered in a deadly voice emilys face went pale as skimmed milk which only made the bruises hed given her look darker he pulled up his pants then yanked her out of the bed and slung her over his shoulder she squealed then squealed and kicked ignoring everything she did he carried her out of the cottage and dumped her still naked on the walk then he went back inside and locked the door behind him when she came up crying and wailing he shouted go to hell you made your choice now you pay for it hed made his choice too ill live with it he thought he went back to the bedroom lay down and fell asleep right away arthur mcgregor worried every time he left the room hed taken in the cheap winnipeg boardinghouse he worried while he was in the room too that wasnt because inside his trunk sat a wooden box containing the largest finest bomb hed ever made he worried about the bomb when he left the room he worried that someone would discover it and that he wouldnt be able to use it when he was in the sparsely furnished room he worried about the farm he worried about whether maude and julia and mary could do everything that needed doing without his being there he also occasionally worried about whether the story he and his family had put aboutthat hed gone to visit cousins back in ontariowould hold up under close scrutiny if some bright yank added two and two and happened to come up with four but the yank likeliest to do that major hannebrink was dead mcgregor had made sure of that and hed got away with it now he was going to make sure of general custers demise too and he thought he could get away with that and if he couldnt he was willing if not eager to pay the price strike a blow for freedom he muttered under his breath as he went downstairs for breakfast he wasnt used to eating anyones cooking but maudes the eggs here were fried too hard while the bacon felt rubbery between his teeth morning chatter flowed around him apart from a good day or two and a couple of polite nods he added nothing to it off he went for all the world as if he had a job to which he didnt want to be late his landlady thought he did have a regular job hed made certain she thought that if she thought anything different the yanks were liable to hear about it that was the last thing he wanted almost three years after the end of the great war winnipeg presented an odd mixture of rubble and shiny new buildings as if a phoenix had risen halfway from the ashes in another few years mcgregor thought it might turn into a handsome city again the rubble would be forgotten so would the buildings and the hopes from which that rubble had been made the new winnipeg would be an american city not a canadian one hornes house paints said a sign on donald street colors available if horne had been in business before if he wasnt a johnnycomelately yank his sign would have advertised colours then even spelling changed under us rule mcgregor scowled to him colors looked clipped unnatural american he stepped off the curband almost got clipped himself by an american motorcar an angry blast from the fords horn sent him leaping back onto the sidewalk watch out you goddamn hayseed the driver screamed in an accent unmistakably from the usa aint you never seen an automobile before he stepped on the gas and whizzed away before mcgregor could say a single word christ mcgregor wiped his forehead on his sleeve thatd be all i need stepping out in front of one of those damn things when im carrying he let his voice trail away he did not intend to mention out loud what he might be carrying he wouldnt have come so close had he not just come close to getting killed had so many motorcars scurried through the streets of winnipeg before the great war mcgregor had come up to the city only a couple of times in those days so he couldnt be sure but he didnt think so it might end up prosperous as well as handsome he didnt care he would sooner have been poor under king george than rich under the stars and stripes the yanks had taken his country away from him if they expected him to be happy about it they were in for a disappointment as a matter of fact if they expected him to be happy about it they were in for a big disappointment he chuckled grimlyso grimly that a fellow in a business suit edged away from him he didnt notice he wanted to make sure their disappointment was as big as possible he crossed the donald street bridge over the assiniboine and strolled past a threestory building that had somehow come through the war intact soldiers in greengray with potshaped helmets stood guard around the building in sandbagged machinegun nests that gave it a formidable defensive perimeter he didnt linger the us guards asked pointedor sometimes blunt questions of people naive enough to linger around general custers headquarters they would without a doubt ask even more pointedor perhaps bluntquestions of anyone foolhardy enough to try to leave a wooden box anywhere in the neighborhood mcgregor had seen as much on his last trip to winnipeg there was a park not far away it didnt even boast childrens swings all it had were grass and a few benches mcgregor sat down on the grass and waited for noon hed done that a good many times by now and come to know the park well the earth here was not smooth but full of round depressions of different sizes and depths a narrow zigzag strip of low ground partly obliterated by the depressions ran across the park from east to west the troops defending winnipeg had made a stand here mcgregor grunted theyd failed damn them he wasnt the only one out on this fine mild day boys and girls frolicked where shells had burst and men had bled an unshaven man in a filthy canadian army greatcoat and tattered khaki trousers lifted a bottle to his lips he set it down slowly and reluctantly as if its opening were the mouth of his beloved in a drunken way that was bound to be so mcgregor killed time till the bells of the st boniface cathedral across the red river chimed twelve he got up and ambled back by custers headquarters hed timed it perfectly hed just gone past the building when a chauffeurdriven packardthe motorcar that had almost run him down in rosenfeld when custer was on his way up to winnipegpulled away from the front of the place he kept on walking hardly looking at the automobile and turned west away from the red river after a little while he went up kennedy sure as the devil there in front of a chophouse called hys sat the packard the chauffeur remained on the front seat eating a sandwich general custer and his aide a tubby officer who seemed to accompany him everywhere had gone inside mcgregor smiled to himself custer dined at hys every monday wednesday and friday he was reliable as clockwork he ate his dinner somewhere elsemcgregor hadnt been able to find out whereon tuesdays and thursdays so far as mcgregor could tell no swarm of guards surrounded him here luck had had very little to do with mcgregors discovering his weekday routine or at least threefifths of it the embittered farmer had taken to tramping the streets of winnipeg during the dinner hour looking for that packard patience paid as patience has a way of doing mcgregor walked past the motorcar on the other side of the street the driver paid him no attention whatever had he suddenly turned around and gone back the way hed come that might have drawn the fellows notice to him he couldnt have that not when he was so close he made his way back to the park though he didnt go past custers headquarters this time now they shouldnt see me at all he said as he sat down on the grass once more no one heard him the children were gone the exsoldier had passed out his bottle lay empty beside him a little past five mcgregor returned to the boardinghouse he ate the landladys frugal supper without complaint afterwards he went up to his room and read quentin durward till he grew sleepy then he turned off the electric lamp and so far as he knew didnt stir till morning since the next day was thursday custer wouldnt be dining at hys mcgregor walked in went over to the bar and ordered himself a moosehead as he drank the beer he studied the place he couldnt very well plant the bomb among the seats he had nowhere to conceal it there but a lot of tables were close to the bar and hed packed a lot of dynamite and a lot of tenpenny nails for shrapnel into the wooden case hed brought up from the farm if he could hide it under the bar somewhere that stood a good chance of doing the trick the blast might even bring down the whole building if the detonation worked as it should he worried about that too hed known from his earlier trip to winnipeg that hed have to set this bomb and leave it to make it go off when he wanted it to hed brought up an alarm clock which he would set while he was planting the bomb when it rang the vibrating hammer and bells would set off the blasting caps hed pack around them which would in turn set off the dynamite so he hoped at any rate but he knew the method was less reliable than a tripwire or a fuse it will work he whispered fiercely it has to work he got out of bed at two the next morning and sneaked out of the boardinghouse he carried the bomb on his back with straps as if it were a soldiers pack in one pocket of his coat were caps in the other a small electric torch and a pry bar winnipeg remained under curfew if a patrolling us soldier spotted him he was liable to be shot then and there if he got shot he was liable to go straight to the moon then and there in fragments of various sizes he was taking any number of mad chances with this venture and knew it he didnt care not any more like a soldier about to go over the top he was irrevocably committed an alley ran behind hys motion there made his heart spring into his mouth but it was only a cat leaping out of a garbage can he wondered if the restaurant had a burglar alarm he would find out by experiment he let out a long happy sigh when the back door yielded to the pry bar almost at once tiptoeing through the kitchen he came out in back of the bar as if he were the greasyhaired gent who tended it only when he crouched behind it did he turn on the torch he felt like cheering on seeing not only plenty of room under the bar to stash the bomb but also a burlap bag with which to hide it he wound the alarm clock and set it for one then pried up the lid to the bomb set the clock in place and handling them very carefully packed the blasting caps by the bells then he replaced the lid covered the box with the burlap sack and left by the route hed used to come he closed the door behind him risking the torch once more to see if the pry marks were too visible he grinned he could hardly see them at all odds were no one else would even notice hed come and gone he reentered the boardinghouse as stealthily as hed left going back to sleep was hard getting up to appear to go to work was even harder when he departed after breakfast he didnt pass by custers headquarters but used the next street over to head for the park he settled himself on the grass to wait st bonifaces bells chimed the hours after they rang twelve times he began to fidget time seemed to crawl on hands and knees how long till one oclock forever no before the bells chimed one a far greater and more discordant blast of sound echoed through winnipeg arthur mcgregor sprang to his feet shouting in delight he frightened a few pigeons near him other than the pigeons no one paid him the least attention lieutenant colonel abner dowling eyed general custer with a sort of sad certainty the old boy was having altogether too much fun for his own good when his wife noticed how much fun hed been havingand libbie would oh yes she would she would have some sharp things to say about it for the moment though custer was doing the talking he liked nothing better all in the line of duty he boomed like a courting prairie chicken all in the line of duty my dear the reporters pencil scratched across the notebook page filling it with shorthand pothooks and squiggles tell me more ophelia clemens said tell me how you happened to decide the war department was using barrels the wrong way and how you came up with one that proved more effective id be glad to custer said with a smile broad enough to show off all the coffeestained splendor of his storebought teeth ill bet you would dowling thought he wouldnt have minded having ophelia clemens interview him either she was a finelooking womansomewhere between forty and fortyfive dowling guessedwith redgold hair very lightly streaked with gray and with an hourglass figure that had yielded nothing well next to nothing to time instead of answering her question as hed said he would custer asked one of his own howd a pretty lady like you get into the newspaper business anyhow most reporters i know have mustaches and smoke cigars miss clemensshe wore no wedding bandshrugged my father was in the business for fifty years till he died ten years ago he taught me everything i know for whatever it may be worth to you he wore a mustache and smoked cigars now then she repeated the question about barrels she s sharp as a tack behind that pretty smile abner dowling judged custer hadnt figured that out yet the pretty smile was all he noticed his answer proved as much he didnt quite say god and a choir of angels had delivered the new doctrine for barrels to him from on high but he certainly implied it ophelia clemens tapped the unsharpened end of her pencil against the spiral wire that held her notebook together isnt another reason the fact that youve been known for headlong attacks straight at the foe ever since the days of the war of secession and that barrels offered you the chance to do that again except in a new way dowling wanted to kiss her for reasons that had nothing to do with the way she looked she was sharp as a tack by god custer had done nothing but go straight at the enemy all through the great war first army had suffered gruesomely too sending attack after attack straight into the teeth of the rebs defensive positions if not for barrels custer would probably still be banging heads with his confederate opposite numbers down in tennessee now he said what was that miss clemens my ears arent quite what they used to be im afraid dowling had seen him use that selective deafness before he wasnt too hard of hearing not considering how old he was but he was and always had been ever so hard of listening patiently ophelia clemens repeated the question changing not a single word as she did so the bells of st bonifaces cathedral over on the east side of the red river announced the noon hour custer had no trouble hearing the bells even if he managed to miss the question again he said perhaps youll take luncheon with my adjutant and me miss ophelia theres a very fine chophouse not ten minutes away that i visit regularly in fact i have a motorcar laid on that should be pulling up in front of this building right about now id be delighted the reporter said provided we can keep working through it that way my editors wont mind picking up the tab forme oh very well custer said with poor grace hed no doubt wanted to use the luncheon as a breather from her astute questions but ophelia clemens wasnt half bad at getting her own way either when they boarded the chauffeured packard custer got his way placing himself between dowling and miss clemens the seat was crowded for three both he and his adjutant took up a good deal of space had custer been so tightly squeezed against another officer he would have had something rude to say about dowlings girth as things were he didnt complain a bit hys gallwitz dowling said realizing the general was otherwise occupied yes sir the chauffeur put the packard in gear at the chophouse custer got himself a double whiskey and tried to press the same on ophelia clemens she contented herself with a glass of red wine dowling ordered a moosehead say whatever else you would about them the canucks brewed better beer than they did down in the states custer ordered a mutton chop and then his glass having somehow emptied itself another double whiskey dowling chose the mutton too hys did it splendidly miss clemens ordered a small sirloinlikely dowling thought to keep from having to match custer in any way the second double vanished as fast as the first had done custer began talking a blue streak he wasnt always perfectly clear but he wasnt always perfectly clear sober either even after the food arrived ophelia clemens kept taking notes tell me she said from the viewpoint of the commanding general what is the hardest thing about occupying canada theres too much of it and i havent got a quarter of the troops i need custer answered drunk or sober that was his constant complaint and one with a good deal of truth to it too he cut a big bite off his chop and continued with his mouth full not a chance in blazes of getting the men i need either not with the blasted socialists holding the purse strings in their stingy fists you would favor a third term for tr then miss clemens asked a shrewd jab if she knew of the rivalry between roosevelt and custer as she evidently did im a soldier and shouldn t discuss politics would have been the discreet answer but custer had already started discussing politics and was discreet only by accident hed just put another forkful of mutton into his mouth when he got the question and bit down hard on it the meat and the fork all at the same time he bit down hard literally as well as metaphorically too hard in fact dowling heard a snapping noise custer exclaimed in dismay oh fow jeshush chwishtsh shake ive bwoken my uppuh pwate he raised his napkin to his mouth and removed the pieces im terribly sorry general ophelia clemens said her green eyes might have sparkled they definitely didnt twinkle dowling admired her selfcontrol he went over to the bartender and got the name and address of a nearby dentist hell have you fixed up in jig time sir dowling said and then im sorry miss clemens but it looks like were going to break up early today thatsh wight custer said nodding im showwy too mish ophewia but ive got to get thish fikshed i understand ophelia clemens kept on taking notes and asking questions dowling wondered if custers embarrassment would become news from coast to coast if so too bad dowling thought custer had always courted publicity that usually paid handsome dividends every once in a while it took a bite out of him when they got out to the automobile dowling told gallwitz where to take custer ophelia clemens got in too no matter how mushy custer sounded she wanted to finish the interview yes sir the chauffeur said stolid as always he started the engine the packard rolled smoothly down kennedy street hed just turned right onto broadway where the dentist had his office when the world blew up behind the motorcar the roar sounded like the end of the world that was for sure windows shattered on both sides of the street showering passersby with glass the packards windshield shattered too most of the glass it held luckily blew away from the chauffeur gallwitz shouted anyway in surprise and maybe fright as well dowling could hardly blame him and custer shouted shtop the automobiwe tun awound go back weve got to shee what happened and what we can do to hep he should have sounded ridiculousan old man with no teeth real or false in his upper jaw bellowing like a maniac somehow he didnt yes sir gallwitz said and spun the motorcar through a uturn that would have earned him a ticket from any traffic cop in the world my god dowling said when he saw the devastation on kennedy my god he repeated when he saw where the devastation centered thats hys i mean that was hys only rubble remained of the chophouse rubble from which smoke and flames were beginning to rise a bomb ophelia clemens said crisply a bomb undoubtedly meant for you general custer what do you make of that she poised pencil above notebook to record his answer cowadsh way to fight he said as if hed almost forgotten she was theremost unusual for custer with a journalist especially a goodlooking female journalist in range canucksh have awwaysh been cowadsh even now custer got in a dig at the country from which the men whod killed his brother had come he pounded gallwitz on the shoulder shtop gallwitz did as close as he could get to the shattered hys custer sprang out of the packard come on dowwing letsh shee if we can weshcue anybody dowling came men and women were spilling out of the shops and houses and offices around hys some bleeding and screaming others looking around for someone to lead them into action custer did just that and people hastened to obey his orders even if his voice did sound mushy or maybe drunk with a plain problem set right in front of his face he was a worldbeater buwwy he cried when dowling and a fellow in a barbers white shirt and apron dragged a groaning smokeblackened man from the ruins of hys nowhave we got a docto we need a bucket bwigade to keep the fwamesh down unti a fiwe engine getsh heah you you and you find wunning watuh weve got to do what we can hes in his element isnt he ophelia clemens said to dowling yes maam custers adjutant answered loyally he went on you see what a fine commander he is oh poppycock she said these are the talents of a captain or a major not the talents of a fourstar general the evidence that he has the talents of a fourstar general is moderately thin on the ground wouldnt you say no maam dowling replied loyal still though he thought miss clemens had hit the nail right on the head with someone pointing his battalion at an enemy strongpoint and saying take it custer would go right at it ahead of all his men and take the position or die trying during the great war an awful lot of his men had died trying because smashing through was all hed ever known here for one brief shining moment fateand the luck of a broken dental platehad put him back in his element was he enjoying himself looking at him listening to his insistent commands dowling could not doubt he was a woman stuck a box of arrowroot cough lozenges into her handbag thank you kindly she told reggie bartlett freedom reggie grimaced as he did whenever he heard that salutation those people are crazy and theres more of them every day he said to his boss jeremiah harmon shrugged their money spends as good as anybody elses he said and then gave a thumbsdown which is to say not very he laughed so did reggie hed charged the woman a quarter of a million dollars for her lozenges and wasnt sure whether the drugstore had made or lost money on the transaction a tall rather pale man about his own age came up to the counter and set down ajar of shaving soap he looked vaguely familiar though bartlett couldnt recall where hed seen him before good to hear somebody who cant stand the freedom party lunatics and isnt afraid to come out and say so he remarked when he spoke reggie knew him youre tom uh brearley you married maggie simpkins after she showed me the door so i did and happy i did it too brearley answered he looked at reggie out of the corner of his eye as if wondering whether the druggists assistant were about to grab a stove lifter and try to brain him with it reggie harbored no such intentions he wanted to talk about the freedom party was what he wanted to do instead of a stove lifter he brandished a newspaper at brearley ten thousand people for a rally down in charleston the other day if you can believe it ten thousand people he opened up the paper and went hunting for the quotation he wanted tarty district manager roger kimball told the cheering crowd this is only the beginning jesus christ brearley started violently then checked himself doesnt surprise me one damn bit that he ended up in the freedom party he said he would as a matter of fact as bloodthirsty a son of a bitch as ever hatched out of his egg you know him reggie asked as he was surely supposed to i was his executive officer aboard the bonefish for most of the last two years of the wartill the very end brearley looked as if hed started to add something to that but ended up holding his peace thats a real kick in the head bartlett shuffled through the newspaper again other thing it says here is that a gal named anne colletons been pumping money into the party down in south carolina we have to put our country back on its feet again she says hed surprised brearley again you know anne colleton the former navy man asked if i knew a rich lady would i be working here bartlett asked from the back of the drugstore his boss snorted brearley chuckled reggie went on on the roanoke front though i had a co name of colleton tom colleton he was from south carolina too her husband i bet or maybe her brother brother brearleys voice held certainty shes not married roger knows her any way you want to take the word every time hed come back to the boat after a leave hed brag like a fifteenyearold who just laid his first nigger whore small world reggie said you know him i know her brother they know each other he blinked he hadnt intended to burst into rhyme i wonder how well they know each other brearley said in musing tones he caught the gleam in reggies eye and shook his head no not like that but rogers done some things that dont bear bragging about youd best believe he has oh yeah reggie set his elbows on the countertop and leaned across it what kind of things but brearley shook his head in a different way the less i say the better off ill be and the better off youre liable to be too but if i could tell my story to anne colleton that might drive a wedge between em and that couldnt help hurting the party anything that hurts the freedom party sounds good to me reggie leaned forward even more how about this suppose i write a letter to tom colleton ill tell him you want to talk to his sister because you know something important hes liable to be in the freedom party up to his eyebrows too brearley said if he is im only out a stamp bartlett answered whats ten grand not worth worrying about but his name isnt in the paper so maybe hes not all right go ahead and do it brearley said but be mysterious about it you hear dont mention my name just say you know somebody this really could be my neck if these people decide to come after me and they might ill be careful bartlett promised he wondered if brearley was in as much danger as he thought he was or if he was letting his imagination run away with him had reggie cared more about losing maggie simpkins he might have thought about avenging himself on the exnavy man as a matter of fact he did think about it but only idly brearley took out his wallet what do i owe you for this he asked pointing to the almost forgotten shaving soap four and a quarter reggie said good thing you got it now if you came in here next week you can bet itd cost more yeah thats not as bad as i thought brearley handed reggie a crisp new banknote reggie gave him a banknote two notes and one valued at a minuscule as he made change he laughed remembering whennot so very long beforethe idea of a banknote let alone one worth half a million dollars would have been too absurd for words i will write that letter reggie said i saw this jake featherston on a stump not long after the war endedso long ago you could still buy things for a dollar i thought he was crazy then and i havent seen anything since to make me want to change my mind roger kimballs not crazy but he can be as mean as a badger with a tin can tied to its tail brearley said not the sort of fellow youd want for an enemy and not the sort of fellow whos got a lot of savory friends maybe well be able to bring both of em down or help anyway reggie said heres hoping he paused if you care to give my best to maggie if you dont care to ill understand believe me maybe i will and maybe i wont brearley picked up the shaving soap and walked out of the drugstore bartlett nodded at his back he hadnt expected anything much different then he nodded again anything he could do to sidetrack the freedom party struck him as worthwhile jeremiah harmon came up and set a bottle full of murky brown liquid on the shelf below the counter heres mr madisons purgative the druggist said if this one doesnt shift him by god nothing ever will i reckon hell be by after he gets off at the bank all right boss bartlett said ill remember its there thats fine harmon hesitated then went on you want to be careful what you get yourself into reggie i heard some of what you and that fellow were talking about all ive got to say is when a little man gets in the prize ring with a big tough man theyre going to carry him out kicking no matter how game he is you understand what im telling you i sure do reggie took a deep breath other side of the coin is this though if nobody gets in the ring with a big tough man hell go and pick fights on his own that didnt come out exactly the way hed wanted it to he hoped harmon followed what hed meant evidently the druggist did all right son he said its a free countrymore or less anyway you can do as you please i wanted to make sure you didnt do anything before you thought it through oh ive done that reggie assured him my own government sent me out into the trenches the damnyankees shot me twice and caught me twice what can the freedom party do to me thats any worse nothing maybe if you put it like that harmon allowed all right then go aheadnot that you need my permission and good luck to you ive got the feeling youre liable to need it he went back to his station at the rear of the store and began compounding another mixture in due course mr madison did appear reggies opinion was that his bowels would perform better if he lost weight and got some exercise like most people madison cared nothing for reggies opinion studying the bottle he said youre sure this one is going to work oh yes sir reggie said mr harmon says its a regular whatdoyoucallita depth charge thats it whatevers troubling you it wont be christ i hope not as mrs dinwiddie had done before as people had a habit of doing the bank clerk proceeded to tell bartlett much more about the state of his intestinal tract than reggie had ever wanted to know after far too long madison laid down his money picked up the precious purgative and departed reggie paid less attention to his work the rest of that day than he should have he knew as much but couldnt help it his boss overlooked lapses that would have earned a dressingdown most of the time harmon had no great love for the freedom party even if he declined to get very excited about it at last reggie got to go home the bare little flat where he lived wasnt anything much tonight it didnt need to be he found a clean sheet of paper and wrote the letter thenanother triumphhe found an envelope he frowned how to address it after some thought he settled on major tom colleton marshlands plantation south carolina he had no idea whether the plantation was still a going concern hed been in a yankee prisonerofwar camp when the black rebellion broke out in the csa with that address though the letter ought to get to the right tom colleton he was just glad hed managed to recall the name of the plantation he couldnt have heard it more than a couple of times he licked a stamp and set it on the envelope the stamp didnt have a picture of davis or lee or longstreet or jackson or a scene of confederate soldiers triumphing over the damnyankees as most issues up through the war had done it said cs postage at the top the design if it deserved such a name was of many concentric circles printed over it in black were the words ten thousand dollars his important work done reggie read the richmond examiner and then a couple of chapters of a war novel written by someone who didnt seem to have come close to the front reggie liked that sort better than the realistic ones it gave him something to laugh at the way things were he took laughter wherever he could find it the next morning he woke up before the alarm clock did its best to imitate a shell whistling down on his trench he hadnt done that in a while after frying himself some eggs he carried the letter to the mailbox on the corner and dropped it in he nodded well pleased as he headed toward harmons drugstore if hed dawdled for a week the cost of a stamp would probably have gone up to he looked back over his shoulder at the mailbox well he said lets see what that does jonathan moss turned the key in his mailbox since he was sober he had no trouble choosing the proper key or getting it to fit whether the mail would be worth having once he took it out of the box was another question the bulk of what he got went straight into the trash there ought to be a law against wasting peoples time with so much nonsense he said he knew perfectly well that such a law would violate the first amendment faced with a blizzard of advertising circulars he had trouble caring about freespeech issues then he saw the envelope franked with a twocent stamp with an ontario overprint his heart neither fluttered nor leaped he let out a resigned sigh he wouldnt throw that envelope into the wastebasket unopened as he would a lot of others but hed learned better than to get too excited about such things when he got up to his apartment he slit the envelope open it held just what hed expected a postal money order and a note the money order was for the note read dear mr moss with this latest payment i now owe you hope to get it all to you by the end of the year the crops look pretty good so i should have the money god bless you again for helping me laura secord shed been sending him such money orders now for this amount now for that since the middle of winter hed written her that it wasnt necessary shed ignored him the only thing hed managed to doand it hadnt been easywas persuade her she didnt owe him any interest lord what a stiffnecked woman he muttered hed realized that when he was up in canada during the war she hadnt bent an inch in her animosity toward the americans hed made her bend to the extent of being polite to him he hadnt made her bend to the extent of wanting to stay obligated to him one instant longer than she had to as soon as shed paid off the last of what she owed she could go back to pretending he didnt exist he couldnt even refuse to redeem the money orders oh he could have but it wouldnt have made things any easier for laura secord shed already laid out the cash to buy the orders not redeeming them would have been cutting off his nose to spite his face havent you done enough of that already he asked himself since he had no good answer he didnt try to give himself one he cooked a little beefsteak on the stove then put some lard in with the drippings and fried a couple of potatoes to go with it that didnt make a fancy supper but it got rid of the empty feeling in his belly he washed the plate and silverware and scrubbed the frying pan with steel wool his housekeeping was on the same order as his cooking functional efficient uninspired once hed taken care of it he hit the books bar examinations would be coming up in the summer much as hed enjoyed most of his time at the northwestern law school he didnt care to wait around another semester to retake the exams after failing a tome he studied with particular diligence was titled occupation law administration and judicial proceedings in the new american colonial empire the field naturally had swollen in importance since the end of the great war before the war it had hardly been part of us jurisprudence at all as the united states unlike england france and japan had owned no colonial empire how things had changed in the few years since occupation law was said to form a large part of the examination nowadays moss told himself that was the only reason he worked so hard with the text still if he decided to hang out his shingle somewhere up in canada it behooved him to know what he was doing didnt it he didnt think about hanging out his shingle anywhere near arthur ontario not more than a couple of times anyway he realized he couldnt study all the time not if he wanted to stay within gibbering distance of sane the next morning he met his friend fred sandburg at the coffeehouse where theyd whiled awaywasted if one felt uncharitable about itso much time since coming to law school youve got that look in your eye again sandburg said moss knew he was a better legal scholar than his friend but he wouldnt have wanted to go up against fred in a courtroom sandburg was ever so much better at reading people than he was at reading books he went on how much did she send you this time twelvefifty moss answered he paused to order coffee then asked how the devil do you do that all in the wrist johnny my boy all in the wrist sandburg cocked his as if about to loose one of those newfangled forward passes on the gridiron moss snorted his friend said no seriouslyi dont think its something you can explain sort of like card sense if you know what i mean only by hearing people talk about it jonathan moss confessed sheepishly when i played cards during the war i lost all the damn time finally i quit playing thats about as close to card sense as i ever got closer than a lot of people come believe me fred sandburg said some of the guys i played with in the trenches itd take inflation like the damn rebs are having to get them out of the holes they dug for themselves up came the waitress she set coffee in front of moss and sandburg sandburg patted her on the hipnot quite on the backside but closeas she turned away she kept walking but smiled at him over her shoulder moss was gloomily certain that had he tried the same thing hed have ended up with hot coffee in his lap and a slap planted on his kisser but fred had people sense no two ways about it moss decided to put his pals people sense to some use and to change the subject both at the same time you think teddy roosevelt can win a third term hes sure running for one isnt he sandburg said i think he may very well especially if the socialists throw debs into the ring again youd figure theyd have better sense but you never can tell can you as a matter of fact i hope teddy loses winning would set a bad precedent why moss asked dont you think hes done enough to deserve to get elected again if anybody ever did hes the one i wont argue with you there sandburg said what bothers me is that if he wins a third term somewhere down the line somebody who doesnt deserve it will run and hell win too all right i see what youre saying moss told him nodding how many other people will worry about that though i dont know sandburg admitted i dont see how anybody could know but ill bet the answer is more than youd think if it werent wed have elected someone to a third term long before this i suppose so moss sipped his coffee he watched people stroll past the coffeehouse when a man with only one leg stumped by on a pair of crutches he sighed and said i wonder how the fellows who didnt come through the war would vote now if they had a chance probably not a whole lot different than the way our generation will end up voting sandburg said moss nodded that was likely to be true his friend continued but were in the half generation johnny my boy every vote we cast will count double because so many of us havent even got graves to call our own the half generation moss repeated slowly thats not a bad name for it he waved for the waitress and ordered a shot of brandy to go with the coffee only after hed knocked back the shot did he ask the question that had come into his mind did you ever feel like you didnt deserve to come back in one piece like fellows who were better than you died but you just kept going better fighters i dont know about that fred sandburg said harder to tell on the ground than it was in the air i expect but i figured out a long time ago that its just fool luck im still breathing and the fellow next to me caught a bullet in the neck i dont guess thats too far from what youre saying its not moss said for that matter sandburg had caught two bullets and was still breathing no doubt luck had a great deal to do with that moss wished there were something more to it i feel i ought to be living my own life better than i am to make up for all the lives that got cut short does that make any sense to you some yeah sandburg cocked an eyebrow thats why youre still mooning over this canuck gal who sends you rolls of pennies every couple of weeks is it makes sense to me god damn you but moss couldnt even work up the energy to sound properly indignant his buddy had got him fair and square he defended himself as best he could you dont really have much say about who you fall in love with maybe not sandburg said but youre not quite ready to be a plaster saint yet either and dont forget it i dont want to be a plaster saint moss said all i want is to be a better person than i am this time he caught the gleam in freds eye you tell me that wouldnt be hard and ill give you a kick in the teeth i wasnt going to say anything of the sort sandburg answered primly and ill be damned if you can prove anything different youre not in court now counselor moss said and they both laughed but what the devil are we going to dothe half generation i mean not you and mefor the rest of our lives well always be looking over our shoulders waiting for the other half to come up and give us a hand and they wont they cant theyre dead and you were the one who just got through saying teddy roosevelt deserved a third term sandburg pointed out and i was the one who said i couldnt argue with you god help us both god help us both jonathan moss agreed god help the world because theres hardly a country in it that doesnt have a half generation with the canucks its more like a quarter generation italy came through all right sandburg said the japs didnt get hurt bad either damn them yeah well have to have a hearttoheart talk with the japs one day sure enough moss said theyre like england only more so they dont really know they were on the losing side he thought for a moment the only thing worse than going through the great war i guess would have been going through the great war and losing roosevelt saved us from that anyway so he did sandburgs whistle was low and doleful can you imagine what this country would be like if the rebs had licked us again wed have had ourselves another revolution so help me god we would i dont mean reds either i just mean people whod have wanted to hang every politician and every general from the nearest lamppost they could find like this freedom party down in the csa moss said and sandburg nodded moss went on you know maybe tr really does deserve a third term even if he didnt do anything else he spared us that his friend nodded again moss discovered he still had a couple of drops of brandy in the bottom of the shot glass he raised it again to tr he said and drained them xi down with tr down with tr down with tr along with everyone else in the great hall in toledo flora hamburger howled out the chant the air was thick with tobacco smoke it was also thick with an even headier scent one never caught before at a socialist party national convention the smell of victory we can do it this time flora didnt know how often shed heard that since coming to toledo whether it was true or not remained to be seen true or not though people believed it scarred and grizzled organizers whod been coming to conventions since long before the turn of the century were saying it and saying it with wonder in their voices and on their faces theyd never said it before mr chairman mr chairman haifa dozen people here on the floor clamored for the attention of the august personage on the rostrum bangthe gavel came down the chair recognizes the leader of the delegation from the great state of indiana thank you mr chairman that worthy bellowed the chairman rapped loudly once more and kept rapping till something a little quieter than chaos prevailed the leader of the indiana delegation spoke into it mr chairman in the interest of victory and unity the state of indiana shifts twentyseven votes from its own great patriot and statesman senator debs to the next president of the united states of america mr sinclair we so act at the specific request of senator debs who understands that the interests of the party should indeed must come ahead of all personal concerns flora had never been on the battlefield if the roar that went up at that announcement didnt match that of a great cannonading though she would have been astonished more men including the chairman of the delegation from new york waved hands or hats or banners to attract the chairmans attention after five indecisive ballots the socialists had their presidential nominee someone moved that the nomination be made unanimous the motion passed by overwhelming voice vote that done the proud and happy delegates voted to adjourn till the next day but they did not want to leave the floor as if they had already won the election they milled about in celebration meeting old friends making new ones and having themselves a terrific time being taller than most of the men at the convention hosea blackford was easy for flora to spot as he made his way from the small dakota delegation to the large one from new york its done he said the first part of its done anyhow and done well when he grinned he shed years aint it bully flora yes i think so she answered and the second partwho knows what the second part may be she wanted to take him in her arms she couldnt not in public she couldnt even in private not while the convention was going on no privacy in toledo was private enough when you find out the second part please let me know whenever it is you happen to hear whether it goes one way or the other i will do that blackford promised solemnly shall we have supper now why not flora said they left the hall and went back to the hotel where they were both staying neither of them minded being seen in public with the other their friendship was common knowledge in philadelphia that they were anything more than friends they kept to themselves they were working their way through indifferent beef stew when an excitedlooking young man in a brightly checked jacket approached the table and said congressman blackford thats right blackford answered the young man in the gaudy jacket glanced toward flora understanding that glance blackford said do i understand that you come from mr sinclair the newcomer nodded speak freely blackford urged him you may rely on congresswoman hamburgers discretion no less than my own very well the eager youngster tipped his bowler to flora pleased to meet you maam he gave his attention back to blackford mr sinclair says i am to tell you that you are his first choice its yours if you want it flora clapped her hands together oh hosea how wonderful she exclaimed is it blackford said more to himself than to anyone else i wonder if i take it and lose i go home if i take it and win i go into the shadows for four years maybe for eight its not a choice to be made lightly you cant turn it down flora said you cant not this year cant i blackford murmured she looked alarmed the young man in the loud jacket didnt pointing to him blackford smiled and said you see he knows there are plenty of other fish in the lake flora sputtered angrily smiling still blackford went on but no i dont suppose i can not this year yes sir if it pleases mr sinclair to have my name placed in nomination for the vice presidency i shall be honored to run with him and see if we cant tie a tin can to teddy roosevelts tail and send him yapping down the street swell the youngster stuck out his hand blackford shook it my principal will be delighted and i already am this time by thunder were going to lick em he waved and departed were going to lick them blackford repeated his smile was wide and amused well by thunder maybe we are what im afraid of is that tomorrow youre going to have to listen to nominating speeches telling the convention what a saint i am and youll laugh so loud youll get yourself thrown out of the hall i would never do such a thing with a mischievous twinkle in her eye flora added not right out loud i wouldnt and indeed she sat beaming with pride as speaker after speaker stood up to praise hosea blackford the next day a couple of other names were also placed in nomination but blackford won on the first ballot flora clapped till her hands were red and sore and she was far from the only one who did but even in the nominating convention the wouldbe vice president yielded pride of place to the man heading the ticket a runner went to summon hosea blackford custom had forbidden him from being in the hall while the nomination proceedings went on the chairman of the convention said and now my friendsno ladies and gentlemen not in the socialist campi have the privilege of presenting to you the next president of the united states mr upton sinclair of new jersey more applause followed louder and more prolonged than that which had announced hosea blackfords nomination sinclair bounded up to the platform both his stride and the white summerweight suit he wore proclaimed his youthful energy flora couldnt remember whether he was fortyone or fortytwo set against the sixtyish roosevelt he seemed boyish bouncy full of spit and vinegar he knew it too my friends its time for a change he shouted in a great voice and cheers went up like thunder sinclair held up his hands asking for quiet eventually he got it its time for a change he repeated its time for a change in ideas and its time for a change in the people who give us our ideas too flora to whom even sinclair was not all that young clapped hard again what this convention has done here in toledo marks the first step in that great and necessary change sinclair said this convention has passed the torch to a new generation a generation born since the war of secession tempered by our troubles disciplined by the harsh peace our neighbors forced upon us and eager for the freedom and justice and equality of which we have heard so much and seen so little tell me my friends are you willing to witness or permit the slowing of those freedoms to which this nation has always been committed no flora shouted along with everyone else in the hall neither am i neither is the socialist party upton sinclair cried and i also tell you this my friends if our free country cannot help the men who are poor it surely cannotand should notsave the few who are rich every time flora thought the next round of applause could be no louder than the last she found herself mistaken when silence returned sinclair went on now that we have suffered so much in the struggle against our nations foes let us struggle instead against the common enemies of mankind against oppression against poverty and against bloodyhanded war itself he went on in that vein for some time it seemed more an inaugural address than an acceptance speech no socialist presidential candidate had ever spoken not only to the party but also to the country with such easy confidence before upton sinclair sounded as if he took it for granted that he might win because he took it for granted or sounded as if he did would not the rest of the country do the same and then at last he said and now my friends i have the pleasure and the honor of introducing to you the next vice president of the united states congressman hosea blackford of the great state of dakota blackford got more than polite applause floras contribution was as raucous as she could make it as the tumult died away blackford said i too am of the generation born after the war of secession if only just and i am of the generation that learned of socialism from its founders in my case literally for abraham lincoln pointed out to me the need for class justice and economic justice on a train trip through montanathe montana territory it was thenand dakota lincolns name drew a nervous round of applause as it always did half pride in the role hed played in making the socialist party strong half fear of the contempt that still clung to him because hed foughtand lostthe war of secession flora hoped that with victory in the great war the country would not dwell on the war of secession so much as it had in earlier days i stand foursquare behind mr sinclair in his call for freedom and in his call for justice blackford said the socialist party unlike every other party in the usa is committed to economic freedom and economic justice for every citizen of the united states others may speak of a square deal but how my friends how can there be a square deal for the millions of workers who cannot earn enough to buy a square meal that won him solid cheers in which flora joined possessive pride filled her that was her man up there perhapsno probably she thought defying a generation and a half of democratic tenure in the white housethe next vice president as upton sinclair had said hard on the heels of pride came loneliness if blackford was to become the next vice president hed be crisscrossing the country between now and november they wouldnt have many chances to see each other till the election more solid applause followed blackfords speech the sort flora thought a vicepresidential candidate should get blackford had spoken ably but hadnt upstaged sinclair on to victory the chairman shouted dismissing the delegates and formally bringing the convention to a close on the street outside the hall a sandyhaired fellow in the overalls and cloth cap of a steelworker called floras name yes what is it she asked i wanted to ask how your brothers getting along maam the man said i was his sergeant the day he got hurt names chester martin he took off the cap and dipped his head oh flora exclaimed he spoke well of you in his letters always you know he lost the leg i thought he wouldi saw the wound martin answered please say hello for me next time you see him i will flora answered hes doing as well as he could hope on the artificial leg with it and a cane he gets around fairly well hes working back in new york city thats all good news or as good as it can be martin said hes a democrat flora added as if to say all the news wasnt good i used to be but im a socialist now martin said it evens out and i think with sinclair running we may win the election this time maam i really do so do i flora whisperedshe didnt want to say it too loudly for fear something might hear and put a jinx on it so do i anne colleton gave her brother an annoyed look i still dont see exactly why you think i ought to meet this person because i remember very well the soldier who wrote to me about him tom colleton replied if bartlett says something is important you can take it to the bank he looked sheepish these days as a matter of fact bartletts word is a damn sight better than taking something to the bank i think you want me to meet this brearley because youre still trying to get me out of the freedom party anne said if the big wheels in the party arent just the way you think they are isnt that something you ought to know her brother returned if roger kimball isn tjust the way you think he is isn t that a reason to stop your affair with him that was what tom meant kimball could have been a baptist preacher and tom would have disapproved of the affair that kimball was anything but a baptist preacher made the disapproval stick out all over like the quills on a porcupine her brother did have a point though anne was not so blindly devoted to either the freedom party or to roger kimball as to be blind to that hes coming i cant stop him from coming ill hear him out she said so glad youre pleased tom grinned impudently seeing as his train gets into st matthews in twenty minutes im going to head over toward the station want to come along no thank you anne answered this is your soldier and your soldiers pal if you want to deal with him go right ahead you invited him down without bothering to ask me about it so you can bring him here on your own too all right sis i will tom said see you soonor maybe not quite so soon depending on how late the train is today he grabbed a hat off the rack and went out the door whistling anne glared at his back if he knew she was doing it he didnt let on anne resolved to be as poor a hostess as rigid notions of confederate hospitality allowed but when her brother returned with the stranger her resolution faltered she hadnt expected the fellow to look like such a puppy out came a peach pie whose existence she hadnt intended to admit she put on a fresh pot of coffee your name is brearley isnt that right she said knowing perfectly well it was yes maam he answered tom brearley excs navy through most of the war i was roger kimballs executive officer aboard the bonefishr of course anne said i knew the name sounded familiar it hadnt not really kimball had mentioned his exec only a couple of times and in less than flattering terms anne had an excellent memory for names but brearleys had slid clean out of her head he hadnt wanted to give it before coming down either only her and toms flat refusal to meet with a mystery man had pried it out of him brearley said up in richmond i saw in the papers that you were working for the freedom party and that he is too tom colleton raised an eyebrow anne ignored it saying yes thats right the wars been over for three years now thats far past time for us to get back on our feet again but the only people who want this country to do things and not just sit there with its head in the sand are in the party seems to me i dont think thats so but never mind brearley said i didnt come down here to argue politics with you getting somebody to change politics may be easier than getting him to change his church but it isnt a whole lot easier why did you come down here then anne asked in your last letter you said you knew something important about roger kimball but you didnt say what im not sure why you thought it would matter to me at all except that both our names happened to end up in the same newspaper story kimball hadnt talked much about brearley to her how much had kimball talked about her to brearley men bragged that was one of their more odious characteristics as far as she was concerned shed thought kimball relatively immune to the disease maybe shed been wrong she couldnt tell not from reading brearleys face he still looked like a puppy but he didnt sound like a puppy as he answered because if what he did ever came out it would embarrass the freedom party for that matter if what he did ever came out it would embarrass the confederate states you dont talk small do you tom colleton remarked my granddad would have called it a sockdologer sure enough brearley said and hed have been right too let me tell you what happened aboard the bonefish right at the end of the war he detailed how kimball fully aware the war was over and lost had nonetheless stalked and sunk the uss ericsson sending her to the bottom without so far as brearley knew a single survivor thats it anne said when her visitor fell silent tom brearley nodded what do you expect me to do about it she asked him she was asking herself the same question kimball had certainly kept this secret from her she wasnt surprised the more people who knew about the ericsson the more dangerous the knowledge got she made a point of not looking over at her brother she knew how he was likely to use it not in any way that would make her comfortable tom brearley said what i do with it doesnt matter im nobody in particular but youre involved in the freedom party same as roger kimball is how do you feel about working side by side with a coldblooded murderer anne gnawed the inside of her lower lip no brearley didnt talk like a puppy he minced no words at all as a matter of fact she decided to match his bluntness if you really want to know mr brearley it doesnt bother me one bit if id been in position to hit the yankees one last lick id have done it and id have done it regardless of whether the war was supposed to be over or not what do you think of that sir now brearley looked like a horrified puppy he coughed a couple of times before blurting no wonder you back the freedom party the united states worked for fifty years to get their revenge on us anne said i dont know how long ill have to wait for my turn i hope it isnt that long however long it takes i think itll come sooner from the freedom party than from anybody else out there right now tom colleton said mr brearleys right about one thing though if the united states ever get word of what the bonefish did they can put us in hot water on account of it if roosevelt wins a third term hell do it too then we have to see that the united states dont find out about it anne said doing her best to put brearley in fear with her expression it didnt work she should have realized it wouldnt work not if hed gone through the war in a submersible he said if you want to make sure the story gets to the united states arranging an accident for me is the best way to go about it i didnt come here without taking the precautions a sensible man would take before he stuck his head in the lions mouth i didnt threaten you mr brearley anne said a technical truth that was in fact a great thumping lie of course not brearley saidanother lie anne wondered if she ought to offer to pay him to keep the secret of the bonefish from reaching the united states after some thought she decided not to if he wanted money in exchange for silence let him bring it up if he wanted confederate paper money in exchange for silence he was a bigger fool than hed shown himself to be her brother said mr brearley you do understand that whatever score you may want to settle with mr kimball youre liable to hurt the whole country if this story gets told too widely anne looked at him now in nothing but admiration she hadnt been able to come up with anything nearly so smooth brearley nodded of course i do thats why ive kept quiet for so long you may call me a great many things but i love my country if youll forgive me i love my country too well to want to see it fall into the hands of the freedom party ill forgive you for that tom colleton said whether my sister will is liable to be a different question brearley glanced at anne she looked back bland as newchurned butter i dont agree but mr brearley didnt come down here forme to change his politics either she said brearley looked relieved anne almost laughed in his face one thing he plainly didnt understand about the freedom party was that so many people joined it because they wanted revenge revenge against the united states revenge against the negroes in the confederate states and revenge against the government and army that had failed to live up to the csas long tradition of victory hunger for revenge had led anne into the party now she had one more piece of revenge to attend to as opportunity arose revenge against tom brearley he said ill leave it at that then i do thank you kindly for hearing me out next train north doesnt come in till tomorrow does it no tom colleton said st matthews isnt the big city youll have seen that for yourself i reckon if you want to come along with me well see whether the hotel has an empty room he snorted lets see if the hotel has any rooms that arent empty besides the one youll be in come on as soon as her brother took tom brearley out of the flat anne tried to get a telephone connection through to richmond she didnt want to put anything down in writing which eliminated both the telegraph and a letter telegraphers werent supposed to pay any attention to what they sent but they did or they could letters could go astray too and so could telephone connections sorry maam the operator reported dont look like you can get there from here today she laughed at her own wit anne didnt anne was notwas emphatically notamused she snarled something wordless but potent and hung up the telephone with a crash she hoped it rattled the operators teeth who could guess where the trouble lay storms knocking down wires squirrels gnawing through insulation and shorting out the line anything was possibleanything except getting through to richmond her brother came in a couple of minutes later well what do you think of kimball now he asked the same as before anne answered to toms evident disappointment like i told that fellow if id been in the bonefish id have torpedoed that destroyer too my fireeating sister tom said more admiringly than not thats right anne said thats exactly right and anybody who forgets it for even a minute will be sorry the rest of his livelong days cincinnatus driver looked back at the house in which hed lived his whole married life he looked around at the covington kentucky neighborhood in which hed lived his whole life there was a last time for everything and this was it he cranked the engine the shabby old duryea truck thundered into life it didnt give half the trouble it usually did as if it too were glad to shake the dust of kentucky from its tires cincinnatus hurried back to the cab there sat elizabeth achilles on her lap we ready cincinnatus asked as he slid in behind the wheel in one way it was a foolish question everything they owned and aimed to take along was behind them in the bed of the truck in another way though it was the question and cincinnatus knew it he still didnt know whether he and his family were ready to abandon everything theyd ever known in the hope for a better life ready or not they were going to do it elizabeth nodded achilles yelled ready at the top of his lungs cincinnatus put the truck in gear he waited for the engine to die or for something else dreadful to happen nothing did smooth as if it were ten years newer the duryea began to roll as cincinnatus turned out of covingtons colored district and onto greenup elizabeth said i do wish your ma and pa decided to come along with us i do too he answered but theyre set in their ways like folks can get i aint gonna worry about it much once we find a place you wait and see if they dont come after us maybe they will his wife said i hope they do wont be so lonesome if they do thats for sure yeah if cincinnatus had let his hands drive the truck for him he would have gone on to the waterfront hed been heading there walking or taking the trolley or driving the truck since the early days of the war but he wasnt going to head there any more instead he took the suspension bridge north across the ohio river and over into cincinnati the united states elizabeth said softly cincinnatus nodded oh kentucky was one of the united states these days but in many ways kentucky still seemed as it had when it belonged to the confederacy that was the biggest reason cincinnatus had decided to better his luck and his familys elsewhere he wasnt going to wait around holding his breath till he got the vote and other privileges whites in kentucky took for granted back in the days before the war hed spent a lot of time looking across the ohio negroes didnt have it easy in the usa he knew that had he not known it he would have got his nose rubbed in it during the war a lot of men down from the united states thought they had to act like slave drivers to get any kind of work out of negroes but not all of them did and laws restricting what blacks could do were milder in the usa than in the csa he didnt have to worry about a passbook any more for instance one reason for such mildness of course was that blacks were far thinner on the ground in the united states than in the confederate states that did worry cincinnatus hed always spent most of his time among his own kind that would be much harder now covington hadnt had a huge colored community but what would he do in a town with only a handful of blacks down off the bridge down into cincinnati went the truck the waterfront on the northern bank of the ohio didnt look much different from the one with which cincinnatus was so familiar but elizabeth noted one difference right away look at all the white folks doin roustabouts work wouldnt never seen nothin like that in covington wouldnt never see nothin like that nowhere in the csa white folks doin nigger work she shook her head this heres what i been tellin you honey cincinnatus said aint no such thing as nigger work in the usa or not hardly aint enough niggers to do all the dirty work that needs doin so the white folks have to lend a hand a lot of em is foreigners i hear tell but not all ofem i dont reckon whats a foreigner pa achilles asked somebody whos in a country he wasnt born in cincinnatus replied his son thought about that then asked how do you tell a foreigner from somebody who aint a lot of times on account of hell talk funnythey dont talk english in a lot of them foreign places cincinnatus said by that standard though a foreigners son somebody who went to school in the usa would turn into an american indistinguishable from any other if achilles ended up as educated and eloquent as teddy roosevelt he still wouldnt be an american indistinguishable from any other that struck cincinnatus as unfair he shrugged it was unfair no two ways about it his hope was that achilles would find things less unfair elsewhere in the usa than in kentucky people were looking at him people on the sidewalk people in motorcars even a couple of men who stopped painting a sign to stare they were all white cincinnati had some negroes cincinnatus knew as much but he saw none on the streets that was a change a jolting change from the way things were back in covington over on the other side of the river a fat redfaced policeman held up his hand cincinnatus stopped in front of him as he should have done he was very pleased at how well the spavined old duryea was behaving hed spent a lot of time getting the truck into the best shape he could but the only thing that would really have cured its multifarious ills was a new truck and he knew it the expression of distaste on the cops face was broad enough for him and the truck both the fellow jerked a thumb toward the curb pull over that wagon he said in gutturally accented english i will with you speak is he a foreigner pa achilles asked excitedly he talks funny like you said reckon he might be cincinnatus answered they do say cincinnatis chock full of germans real live germans achilles eyes were enormous the usas european allies were folk to conjure with just as frenchmen had been in the csa until the war came and france lost when cincinnatus stopped the truck by the curb the policeman strutted over you are from where he demanded covington kentucky suhjust the other side of the river cincinnatus answered he wouldnt have got uppity with a covington cop and he wasnt so rash as to think the police would be much friendlier on the north side of the ohio what do you do here the policeman asked why dont you stay on the other side of the river where you belong i aint plannin on settling down in cincinnati suh cincinnatus said hastily my family and me were just passin through where are you going to the policeman inquired headin for iowa cincinnatus told him des moines iowa this is a good long way from cincinnati the cop said as much to himself as to cincinnatus you will the worry of the people in iowa be not the worry of the people here very well you may go on he even condescended to stop traffic and let cincinnatus pull out once more cincinnatus would have been more grateful had it been less obvious that the policeman was getting rid of him welcome to the united states elizabeth remarked welcomebut not very welcome i was thinking that myself not very long ago cincinnatus said better here than if wed headed down to tennessee his wife didnt argue about that he went back to concentrating on his driving he knew where he was going but he wasnt completely sure how to get there road maps left a lot to be desired hed studied as many as he could at the covington library so he knew how far from perfect they were he also mistrusted road signs oh roads in towns had names and numbers he could rely on that but hed seen during the war that roads between towns might change names without warning or might never have had names in the first place that made traveling more interesting for strangers he managed to get out of cincinnati and congratulated himself on that only after hed been out of town for a while did he realize he was going due north not northwest toward indianapolis dont fret yourself about it none elizabeth said when he cursed himself for fourteen different kinds of a fool sooner or later youll come across a road that runs into the one you should have used then everythingll be fine again sure ill come across that blame road cincinnatus snarled but how the devil will i know its the right one it wont look no different than any other road and it wont have no sign on it neither he felt harassed he felt even more harassed a couple of minutes later when one of the trucks inner tubes blew out with a bang that would have put him in mind of a gunshot had he not heard more gunshots than hed ever wanted to hear the past few years he guided the limping machine to the side of the road and began the slow dirty business of repairing the puncture motorcars and trucks kept rolling past him as if he werent there every one of themevery one he noticed anyhowhad a white face behind the wheel most no doubt wouldnt have stopped to help a white man either but would all of them have sped past a strange white without more than a single hasty glance maybe on the other hand maybe not too at last when he was wrestling the wheel back onto the axle a ford did pull up behind the truck give you a hand asked the driver a plump blond fellow in a straw hat and overalls just about done it now cincinnatus said wish youd come by a half hour ago i dont mind tellin you that believe it the white man said where you bound for des moines cincinnatus answered and held up a filthy hand yeah i know im on the wrong road i missed the right one down in cincinnati you know how i can get back to it from here go up lemme see four crossings and then turn left thatll put you heading toward the highway to indiana the white man said he cocked his head to one side you got family in des moines no suh cincinnatus said just lookin for a better place to live than kentucky he waited to see how the white man would take that oh good luck the fellow climbed into his automobile and drove away thanks for the directions cincinnatus called after him he couldnt tell whether the white man heard he shrugged the man had stopped and had given him some help he couldnt complain about thateven if worn as he was he felt sorely tempted des moines he said hed be on the road again soon come on sylvia enos said impatiently to george jr and mary jane as they made their way across the boston common toward the new state house and hold on to my hands for heavens sake if you get lost how will i find you again in this crowd us flags fluttered from the platform that had gone up in front of the new state house redwhiteandblue bunting wreathed it although president roosevelt wasnt scheduled to start speaking for another hour the crowd was already growing rapidly most of the people gathering around the platform were men why not they enjoyed the right to vote even though sylvia didnt she wanted to hear what roosevelt had to say for himself she wanted to see him too and to have the children see him theyd remember that for the rest of their lives mary jane at the moment had her mind on other things the dome sure is shiny ma she said pointing its as shiny as the sun i bet thats because its gilded silly george jr said importantly whats gilded mean ma mary jane asked it means painted with gold paint her big brother told her i didnt ask you mr knowitall mary jane said besides i bet youre making it up anyway i am not george jr howled i ought to pop you a good one is what i ought to do ill pop both of you if you dont behave yourselves sylvia said what ran through her mind was that shed remember this day for the rest of her life but not because shed seen the president you tell mary jane that i do so know what gilded means george jr said i learned it in school and theres a wooden codfish inside there somewhere and its gilded too they call it the sacred cod he frowned i dont know what sacred means it means holy sylvia said and your brothers right mary jane gilded does mean painted with gold paint and ill thank you not to call him names youre supposed to know better than that all right ma mary jane said in tones of such angelic sweetness sylvia didnt believe a word of it the face mary jane made at george jr a moment later said her skepticism had been well founded sylvia worked her way as close to the platform as she could it wasnt close enough to satisfy her children who set up a chorus of we cant see at the moment there wasnt anything to see sylvia pointed that out but it did nothing to stem the chorus she finally said when the president starts to speak ill pick both of you up so you can see him all right will you pick both of us up at the same time mary jane sounded as if she liked the idea no sylvia exclaimed if i do that you and your brother can pick me up afterwards and carry me home she thought that might calm them down instead it got them jumping around with excitement george jr did try to pick her up and kept trying till she had to smack him to get him to quit after what seemed like forever people started coming out of the new state house and going up onto the platform they had the same look to them plump men middleaged and elderly many with big drooping mustaches all of them in somber black suits with waistcoats most wore top hats a few of the younger ones contented themselves with homburgs they might have been rich undertakers in fact they were democratic politicians they buried more men in the great war than undertakers could in a hundred years sylvia thought bitterly one of them stepped forward hurrah for governor coolidge somebody shouted which told her who the fellow was you didnt come here to listen to me today coolidge said im going to step aside for president roosevelt with a bow he did just that mr president thank you governor coolidge theodore roosevelt matched the rest of the men up there in age and build and dress but he had enough energy for four of them maybe six he bounded to the front of the platform almost running over the governor of massachusetts in his eagerness to put himself in the public eye ladies and gentlemen he cried in a huge voice this is the greatest nation in the history of the world and i am the luckiest man in the history of the world to have had the privilege of leading her for the past eight years no third term no third term the cry broke out in several places around sylvia at the same time she suspected that was not an accident she also suspected roosevelt would be hearing the same cry everywhere he went up till election day he must have suspected the same thing he bared his mouthful of large square teeth and growled ah the socialists are barking already if theyd had their way we would have sat on the sidelines while the greatest struggle the world has ever known was decided without us i submit to you ladies and gentlemen that a great nation does not let others choose its destiny for it a great nation makes its own fate that is the mark of greatness he got a round of applause but the hecklers sent up another chant how many dead how many dead that one hit sylvia hard had roosevelt sat on the sidelines her husband would have been alive today maybe the usa wouldnt have been so strong sylvia would have made that trade in a heartbeat if only she could have if only someone would have asked her how many would have died had we waited roosevelt returned how many would have died if wed let england and france and russia and the confederate states gang up on our allies after the entente powers beat down our friend kaiser bill how long do you think it would have been before our turn came around again they piled onto us in the war of secession didnt they they piled onto us in the second mexican war didnt they dont you think they would have piled onto us in the great war too by jingo i do were young and virile and upandcoming just like the german empire the countries that had the power didnt care to share it with the countries that wanted it the countries that deserved it well if they wouldnt yield us a place in the sun we had to go and take one and we did and im proud that we did and if youre proud too youll vote the democratic ticket in november that earned him more applause with only a thin scattering of boos mixed in how many dead still echoed inside sylvia enos as she lifted first her son and then her daughter to see theodore roosevelt the president was a master of the big picture he made her see the whole world turning in her hands but that still counted for less with her than a husband who had not come home and the hecklers hadnt given up either no third term they called again no third term roosevelt stuck out his chin the sun flashed from the lenses of his spectacles making him look as much like a mechanism as a man because george washington decided he would not seek a third term is it holy writ that every succeeding president must follow suit he thundered we are speaking of the united states of america here ladies and gentlemen not a hand of auction bridge he pounded fist into palm i refuse to reckon my actions bound by those of a slaveholding virginian a hundred and twenty years dead vote for me or against me according to whether you think well or ill of me and what i have done in office this other pernicious nonsense has no place in the campaign four more years four more years roosevelt had friends in the crowd too many more friends than foes by the number of voices urging a third term for the president with so much support sylvia didnt see how he could fail to be reelected maybe it wouldnt be so bad he probably wouldnt find any excuse to start a new war between now and capitalist tool capitalist tool the socialists started a new jeer roosevelt had been talking about the vote for women which rather to sylvias surprise he professed to favor i am the tool of no man he shouted meeting the hecklers as combatively as he had throughout the speech i am the tool of no man and i am the tool of no class let me hear mr sinclair say the same thing and i will have learned something a dictatorship of the proletariat is no less a dictatorship than any other sort george jr tugged at sylvias skirt whats the proprole prolewatchamacallit ma proletariat it means the people who do all the work in factories and on farms sylvia answered not the rich people who own the factories oh her son thought about that people like us you mean thats right people like us sylvia smiled painting red rings on galoshes was about as proletarian a job as you could get if she didnt come in tomorrow the foreman could replace her with just about anyone off the street and the day after that frank best would no doubt be trying to get the new ringpainter into bed with him up on the platform concerned with bigger things theodore roosevelt was winding up his speech i love this country i have served this country all my adult life and with every fiber of my being if it please you the citizens that i continue to serve the united states that will be the greatest honor and privilege you have in your power to grant me i hope it will i pray it will let us go forward together and make the twentieth century be remembered forevermore as the american century i thank you is he finished mary jane asked as the crowd applauded sylvia nodded her daughter found another question can we go home now all right dear sylvia didnt quite know how to take the question she wondered whether mary jane really would remember the day as long as shed hoped as they were heading toward the trolley stop she asked what did you think of the president he talked for a long time by the way mary jane said it she didnt mean it as a compliment he had a lot of things to talk about sylvia gave credit where it was due even if she didnt care for all the things roosevelt had said running the country is a big complicated job huh mary jane said i bet more people would vote for him if he didnt talk so much sylvia tried to figure out how to answer that in the end she didnt answer at all her best guess was that mary jane had a point jake featherston had never imagined hed end up working out of an office he had one now though paid for with freedom party dues he had a secretary too whose pay came from the same source without lulu endlessly tapping away on the typewriter he wouldnt have got done a quarter of what needed doing as things were he got done half of what needed doing sometimes even more lulu couldnt handle everything by her lonesome featherston studied the snapshot on his desk it showed a british or confederatestyle rhomboidal barrel in the middle of some dry roughlooking country the letter that had come with the photo was from a party member fighting for the emperor of mexico against rebels who had yankee backing were not really here at all the letter read neither is our friend the friend in question was the barrel only a couple of us ever used these critters in the war against the usa now we all know how to handle them some of us are going to try and see if we cant get some stronger engines too so they go better you bet we bring home what we re learning freedom slowly featherston nodded to himself the confederate states werent allowed to have barrels of their own so the united states said and the united states were strong enough to make their word stick but confederate mercenaries in mexico in peru and in argentina were getting practice fighting in barrels and in aeroplanes and on the sea and were figuring out improvements for the machines they used a lot of those mercenaries belonged to the freedom party jake figured he knew as much about clandestine confederate military affairs as the war department didand the war department didnt know how much he knew lulu stopped typing she came into his private office a thin grayhaired woman competent rather than decorative mr kimball is here to see you mr featherston bring him right on in jake said weve got some things to talk about sure enough his secretary nodded left and returned a moment later with kimball jake rose and shook his hand good to see you glad you could get up to richmond i hadnt planned to roger kimball answered but things have a way of coming up when you dont expect them eh featherston nodded after lulu went out and started typing again he said just when you thought you had everything sunk down out of sight for good you find out you were wrong that fellow who went and saw anne colleton isnt by any chance lying is he kimball looked as if he wanted to say yes but in the end he shook his head i sank the yankee bastard all right so the war was over too damn bad he glared at jake defying him to make something of it good jake said kimball stared featherston went on i fought the damnyankees up to the very last second i could you think i care if you waited till the ceasefire went into effect before you gave em one last lick in a pigs ass i do what matters to me is whether itll make trouble for the party and trouble for the country if i decide it will im going to have to cut you loose he waited to see how kimball would take that the exsubmersible skipper said ill kill that son of a bitch of a brearley if its the last thing i ever do i knew he was a weak reed right from the start you will not jake featherston said you will not do you hear me he waited to see how kimball would take the flat order kimball took it just the way hed expected him to he blew his stack the hell i wont he snarled going brick red i told that bastard id murder him if he ever started running his big mouth he damn well has and i damn well will then i damn well will cut you loose right this minute featherston said forget what i told you down in charleston i dont want a man who cant do what hes told in the freedom party i dont want somebody whos liable to blow up behind my back in the party if you want to kill brearley after i told you not to you can kindly wait till you dont have any connection to me do whatever you please on your own hook dont embarrass the party he waited again what would kimball do hed been an officer would he get shirty about taking orders from an exsergeant a lot of fellows whod worn fancy uniforms couldnt stomach anything like that or would he remember that in the freedom party he was still a midranking officer and jake was commanderinchief kimball started to blow his stack once more featherston could see it begin and a moment later could see kimball ease off again jake eyed the former navy man with respect he hoped he concealed not everybody could go into a rage and then clamp down on it the people who could were apt to be very useful indeed slowly roger kimball said all right sarge suppose i let the son of a bitch live for a while that means youve got a line on giving him what he deserves some other way right not yet it doesnt featherston answered yes kimball was worth keeping around all righthed got one step ahead of jake which didnt happen every day im not saying i will yet either have to cipher out how i want to do it if i decide to do it do i want it to look like the party didnt have anything to do with it or do i want the job to say you screw around with the freedom party and you end up good and dead all at once instead of taking it personally kimball started looking at it as a tactical problem jake saw the change in his eyes he smiled to himself but only to himselfhe didnt want kimball to know he could read him thats a nice question isnt it kimball said i guess the one to ask right afterwards is if we let the world know the freedom party got rid of brearley can we do it without having anybody go to jail there are places we could jake answered south carolinas one ofem i reckon anne colleton has big chunks of that state sewed up tight for us i havent done too bad my own self you dont mind my saying so kimball replied was that touchiness in his voice it was jake decided was kimball jealous of anne colleton damned if he wasnt that was a useful thing to know featherston filed it away he couldnt use it now but that didnt mean he wouldnt be able to somewhere down the line for the moment he needed to stick to the business at hand im not so sure about richmond weve got a lot of cops in the party here same as most places but theyve got city hall and the state government and the confederate government all sitting over em they might have to go after us whether they really want to or not i can see that kimball raised an eyebrow he was cool and collected again yes he would have made a formidable submarine skipper nothing fazed him for long jake could easily picture him stalking and sinking that us destroyer after the war ended and banking on success to keep him out of hot water he went on the whigs and the radical liberals dont fancy the freedom party much these days do they if they did id reckon i was doing something wrong featherston said pack of damn fools want to keep on doing things the same old way thats real sly aint it thats how we got into the mess were in thats how well get into more messes too sure as the devil i dont reckon youre wrong there kimball leaned forward brearley almost forgotten what the hell are you going to do about the niggers if we ever get the chance smack em down and make sure they dont have the chance to get back up on their feet and stab us in the back again jake answered the reply he usually gave he had more in mind but he still didnt know if he could do if anybody could do everything he really wanted what hed told kimball would suffice for the time being lets get back to this business here theres no paper nothing in your log or anything that says you sank this yankee ship too late right to his relief kimball nodded i made sure there wouldnt be brearley cant prove anything like that but i didnt sink the ericsson all by myself either if the rest of the crew start blabbing they could give me a hell of a hard time would they do that jake asked most ofem wouldnt im sure of it kimball said again the reply featherston wanted to hear they were howling like a pack of wolves when we sent that damn destroyer to the bottom but even on a little boat like the bonefish theres a couple dozen sailors i cant tell you nobody would chime in with my exec because i dont know that for a fact all right jake scratched his head and thought for a while heres what were going to do for now sit tight and see what happens if brearley goes to the papers he damn well does thats all i dont reckon it hurts the party you werent in the party during the war on account of there wasnt any party to be in during the war fair enough kimball said yes he was ready to take orders what do we do if he does go to the papers you dont do anything featherston said not to him anyhow you go back down to south carolina and stay there if reporters start asking questions tell em tell em you cant talk about it thats what you say he grinned you got to remember roger our only big worry is getting the usa riled at us when were not strong enough to hit back most of the people in the csahell in your shoes theydve done the same thing by jesus they wouldve youre right about that youre dead right about that sarge kimball said hi do just like you say ill tell the snoops i cant talk about it and if they ask why i cant ill tell em i cant talk about that either there you go jake said nodding make it sound mysterious as all getout thatll drive the whole raft of reporters crazy same as a girl who plays hard to get drives the guys crazy reporters are used to people who put out most folks love to talkno thin they love better you keep your mouth shut and youre a long ways ahead of the game he studied kimball you reckon you can do that i can do it the exnavy man said and jake thought he could kimball went on be kind of fun matter of fact leading em around by the nose as far as jake was concerned very little was more fun than leading reporters around by the nose much more often than not reporters wrote the stories he wanted them to write about the freedom party they usually thought they were slamming the partybut they were slamming it the way he wanted them to a way that let them feel clever about themselves but at the same time made the party look appealing to a lot of their readers he didnt tell kimball that maybe kimball was smart enough to figure it out for himself if he was he also needed to be smart enough to keep it to himself anything else on your mind jake asked him i dont reckon there is kimball said after a little thought weve got things squared away here dont we yeah we do featherston said im right glad you came upglad we had the chance to talk about a few things he was even gladder kimball had proved sensible but the other man didnt need to know that either having used the stick before jake threw him a carrot now looks to me like youre going places in the freedom party ive said that before havent i still looks like its so i aim to kimball said yes sir i aim to jake studied him again how high did he aim the trouble with ambitious men was their nasty habit of aiming straight for the top but jake was aiming for the top too for a different top one high above anything to which he thought roger kimball could aspire if everything went perfectly hed get there next year he hadnt imagined he could win even a couple of months before now he thought he just might and if things went wrong hed take longer that was all either way he aimed to do it im glad weve got you settled he said on account of i dont want anything getting in the way of that run for president when rolls around no sir kimball said and his eyes glowed colonel irving morrell and agnes hill hurried across wallman park toward yet another statue of john brownthey seemed to be everywhere in leavenworth decked with bunting as this one was it looked far more festive than the dour old warrior for freedom had ever been in truth everyone in town will be here today agnes hill pointed to the throngs of people crossing the foot bridges over threemile creek everyone in town should be here today morrell said upton sinclair drew a good crowd when he spoke a couple of weeks ago only right the president should draw a bigger one agnes nodded they shared a common faith in the democratic party they shared a lot of things including a great deal of pleasure in each others company morrell laughed at himself hed gone to that dance not intending to fall in love with the first woman he set eyes on and here hed gone and done it and by all appearances shed fallen in love with him too not only was president roosevelt a potent magnet for the crowd but the day itself seemed to be summoning people outdoors with september running hard toward october the summers muggy heat had broken the sun still shone brightly and the oaks and elms and chestnuts in the park still carried their full canopies of leaves to give shade to those who wanted it the blight spreading among the chestnuts back east hadnt got to kansas yet morrell hoped it never would the air felt neither warm nor crisp in fact he could hardly feel the air at all perfect he said and agnes hill nodded again a lot of the men in the crowd wore greengray like morrells fort leavenworth lying just north of the town whose name it shared that helped agnes and him advance through the crowd soldiers who spotted his eagles made way for his companion and him this is swell she exclaimed when they ended up only three or four rows from the rostrum at which roosevelt would speak it is isnt it morrell said and squeezed her hand they grinned at each other as happy as if alone together rather than in the middle of the biggest crowd leavenworth had seen for years morrell did hope the crowd was bigger than the one sinclair had drawn anyhow people whooped like red indians when president roosevelt ascended to the rostrum off to one side a brass band blared away at the stars and stripes forever morrell wished the band had picked a different tune that one rattled around in his head for days whenever he heard it and it made noisy company roosevelt said by jingo its always a pleasure for me to come to kansas this state was founded by men and women who knew a southern viper when they saw one even before the war of secession he glanced back at the statue of john brown there is a man who knew who the enemy was and a man who hit our countrys enemies hard even when they still pretended to be friends for that i am proud to salute him he doffed his homburg and half bowed toward the statue morrell clapped till his hands ached beside him agnes hill blew roosevelt a kiss should i be jealous morrell asked her she stuck out her tongue at him they both laughed people saynewspapers sayim in the fight of my political life roosevelt went on i say bully he reveled in the new round of applause washing over him from the friendly crowd maybe theyll drag this old democratic donkey down he shouted but if they do i tell you this theyll know theyve been in a fight too you won the war teddy somebody called you can win this fight roosevelt morrell happened to know did not care to be called teddy on the campaign trail though he endured it his grin looked friendly not forced and then somebody else yelled the country needs you teddy i dont know whether the country needs me personally or not roosevelt said but i do know for a fact that i take enormous pride in having served the country and i also know for a fact that the country needs a democrat in powel house or the white house and i seem to be the one the democratic party is putting forward this year here is something i want you to think about ladies and gentlemen in the years since the democratic party has won every presidential election save two every schoolchild knows that but i am going to take a moment of your time to remind you of it once again in the voters sent abraham lincoln to washington and he saddled us with a war and a losing war to boot twenty years later having forgotten their lesson the people elected james g blaine who gave us another warand another loss when war came around yet again the united states were ready for it democratic presidents had made this country strong democratic presidents had found us allies and thanks to the people we had a democratic president at the helm of the ship of state he preened to remind his audience who that democratic president was we won the great war with gods help we paid back half a century and more of humiliation of the sort no great nation should ever have had to endure and now the editorial writers say now the people are grown tired of the democratic party they say we were good enough to win the war but arent good enough to govern in time of peace they say the socialists deserve a turn a chance roosevelt looked out over the crowd well let them say whatever they please its a free country thanks to the democratic party its stayed a free countryand i might add a victorious country as well and now i am going to tell you what i say ladies and gentlemen i say that if you elect a socialist president in the mischief he will do the united states will make lincoln and blaines mischief look like what a couple of skylarking boys might do thats right morrell shouted at the top of his lungs the whole enormous crowd was shouting but roosevelt caught morrells voice and then caught his eye theyd met several times in philadelphia and had always got on well two aggressive men who both believed in taking the fight to the enemy here in leavenworth youve already seen how the socialists have gone after the war department budget with a meat axe roosevelt said theyve done the same thing to the navy department too if they control the presidency as well as congress well be lucky to have a war department and a navy department by the time we can vote them out of office here in front of me i see one of our nations most distinguished soldiers colonel irving morrell the leading exponent of barrel warfare in this country i know the pittance on which colonel morrell has had to operate since the election of like a good patriot he soldiers on as best he can with what he is allotted but i know as you must know he could do far more if only he had more with which to do it isnt that the truth colonel yes sir that is the truth morrell said loudly agnes stared at him with sparkling eyes she might have imagined a great many things when coming to hear roosevelt but surely she hadnt imagined the president would praise morrell for everyone to hear morrell hadnt looked for any such thing himself roosevelt said there you have it ladies and gentlemen straight from the horses mouth if you want to keep the united states strong vote for me if you dont care vote for sinclair i thank you he got another ovation as he stepped down from the platform then to morrells further surprise roosevelt beckoned to him hows that test model doing colonel the president asked sir its a great improvement over the barrels we used to fight the war morrell answered it would have been better still if wed been able to build a real barrel to that design not a lightweight machine armored in thin mild steel you will have such a machine colonel roosevelt boomed if i have anything to say after this november about how the war department spends its money you will have it that would be wonderful mr president morrell said and then sir id like to introduce to you my fiancee agnes hill im very pleased to meet you miss hill roosevelt bowed over her hand i want you to take good care of this man the country will need him for a long time to come ill do my best your excellency she said its a great honor to meet you fine fine the president smiled at her then turned away to talk to someone else agnes had stars in her eyes how about that morrell said grinning he hadnt really expected to get a chance to talk with roosevelt nor to be able to introduce agnes to him because of his previous acquaintance with the president hed hoped something along those lines might happen but hed spent enough time playing poker to understand the difference between hope and likelihood every so often though you got lucky how about that agnes echoed i didnt know you were such an important fellow she studied morrell but even the most important fellows from everything ive heard ask a woman if shed like to be their fiancee before they introduce her that way oops morrell said which made agnes burst into laughter gulping a little he went on i guess the only way i can make amends is by asking later instead of sooner would you like to be my fiancee agnes of course i would she answered youve taken your own sweet time getting around to finding out but i didnt worry about it too much because i always figured you would always morrell asked still nervous but happy too how long is always ever since we met at that first dance agnes hill said i thought you were a catch and i figured i ought to be the one who caught you she raised an eyebrow now what are you snickering about only that ive had my eye on you since that dance where we met too he said that comes out fair and square doesnt it it sure does agnes said i think everything will work out fine you know what morrell said and she shook her head i do too he told her he meant every word of it she knew what being a soldiers wife was like and knew it the best possible way shed been one shed been through the worst that could happen to a soldiers wifeshed been through it shed come out the other side and she was willing to try it again what more could he ask for only after all that went through his mind did he stop to wonder what sort of husband he was liable to make agnes might know what she was doing heading into this marriage but he didnt he had no clue marriage wasnt part of the curriculum at west point maybe it should be he thought it might not produce better officers but was very likely to produce happier ones xii lucien galtier looked up into the heavens he got a glimpse of the sun which he rarely did these days it scurried along low in the south and soon ducked behind the thick gray clouds that were the dominant feature of the sky as october gave way to november drizzle started spattering down soon he judged it would be turning to sleet and then to snow do your worst he said do your worst or even a little worse than that you did not do it during the harvest and you cannot hurt me now go ahead i could not care in the least do you always talk to the clouds papa asked georges who must have come out of the barn while lucien was mocking the weather for missing its chance always lucien replied solemnly it is i am convinced my best hope of getting an intelligent answer around these parts truly georges glanced toward the farmhouse could it be that i should tell my chere maman of your view in this matter i am sure she would be most interested to learn i am sure that if you breathe even a word of it to her i will break open your head to see if it is altogether empty or just almost lucien said if i had to guess i would say you have nothing at all in there but i could be wrong you might have some rocks no sense certainly mais non certainementpas georges said and do i take after you or after my mother in my senselessness i will take after you in a momentwith a hatchet by choice galtier said have you done everything with the livestock that wants doing oh no not at all his son answered i am always in the habit of quitting work when it is but half done what you are in the habit of is driving me mad lucien said georges bowed as if at a considerable compliment just then a motorcar came to a halt beside the farmhouse lucien laughed lookhere is your brotherinlaw see if you can drive him mad you have not done it yet and not from lack of trying dr leonard odoull seemed to unfold like a carpenters rule as he got out of the ford seeing lucien and georges he waved to them and came sauntering over if the cold nasty drizzle bothered him he gave not a sign how does it go he called around the cigar in his mouth it goes well lucien answered and with you how does it go well enough his soninlaw said today is saturday so i have only a half day to put in at the hospital i thought i would stop by and say good day before i drove up to town to nicole and little lucien and i am glad to give you good day as well lucien said he glanced toward georges they both nodded ever so slightly no day on the farm was a half day leonard odoull was a firstrate fellow the longer galtier knew him the more he thought of him but one thing odoull was not and could never be a farmer he did not understandby the nature of things he could not understandhow hard the folk of his family by marriage worked georges obliquely referred to that with but a halfdays work today how can it go only well enough for you well for one thing what does the last day of october mean to you odoull asked georges scratched his head so did lucien galtier at last lucien said it is the even of all saints day all very well but not a holiday to speak of alongside easter or the festival of our lords birth the eve of all saints day odoull nodded we call it halloween in english we have a custom of celebrating it with costumes and masks and carved pumpkins and partiesand sometimes pranks too it is a jolly time a time of pretended fright we do not do this here in quebec georges said i know odoull said i miss it halloween galtier let the english word roll off his tongue i remember when i was in the army the englishspeakers had this holiday but georges is right we do not do this in quebec i would be amazed if i had thought of it three times in all the years since i came home to my farm odoull looked unhappy last year i carved a pumpkin into a jackolanternanother english wordand put it in the window with a candle inside i wont do that again all my neighbors thought i was a pagan its a good thing bishop pascal knows about the custom or there would have been a lot bigger stink than there was you did not tell me about this then lucien said nicole did not speak of it either i think we both felt foolish about it odoull said and it was my own fault i know men who go their whole lives without ever saying those words lucien remarked they arent doctors his soninlaw spoke with great assurance every doctor in the world knows he has buried patients he should have saved it could be so galtier said if it is so why would any man want to become a doctor because we also save patients who would be buried without us leonard odoull said with what sounded like considerable effort he changed the subject and tuesday is also a day different here from what it will be in the united states and why is that luciens acquaintance with american holidays had begun only with the us occupation of quebec he knew it remained incomplete because on tuesday we will vote for our president odoull replied and for the first time in longer than i have been alive i think the election will be very close he kicked at the dirt and here i am a resident alien in the republic of quebec all i can do is wait to see what my country does how can the americans not elect roosevelt again georges asked behind him they won the war without him who knows what might have happened you have reason odoull said but the war has been over almost three and a half years now for me the war was very fortunate for without it i would not have met nicolenor any of you other fine galtiers i make haste to add but many were hurt and many who now can vote lost loved ones in the fighting and there has been endless labor strife since people may vote for roosevelt certainly but then again they may not and no one has ever won a third term as president of the united states for whom would you vote if you were back in the united states galtier inquired i am not really sure odoull said slowly with roosevelt i know exactly what the country would be getting if the socialists had run debs again i would also know what we were getting but with sinclair it is harder to tell he has the energy of a young man and from what i can tell from up here in quebec a lot of people think he would lead the united states in a new direction maybe that would be good as i say it is hard to be sure it will be as it will be galtier said with a shrug however it is the united states will still be a large country and the republic of quebec a small one i hope you are not unhappy having left your country to make your home here unhappy odoull shook his head it was only a lifetime ago that my ancestors left ireland for the united states we have pulled up stakes before the odoulls i have done it again thats all galtier scratched his head his ancestors had lived not merely in quebec but on the ground on which he stood since the seventeenth century even having his daughter remove to riviereduloup seemed an uprooting he could not comprehend how odoull talked about one place as if it were good as the next for him that would have been a manifestindeed an unimaginable untruth his soninlaw took it for granted as a fact of life odoull said well i had better head back to town or nicole will wonder what has become of me i hope you get the chance to come up before too long before the weather gets too bad he touched the brim of his fedora then hurried back to his automobile it roared to life he drove away american politics georges said with a shrug i care very little for american politics had you said this in you might have shown some sense his father replied in knew very little of american politics but they were important to us even then saying it now well i chaffed you before for senselessness if american politics were different would we have had a war if american politics were different would we be living in the republic of quebec if american politics were different would you have the nephew you have if american politics were different i would still have a father who lectures me more than the schoolmasters ever did georges said lucien made an exasperated noise but then started to laugh georges was as he was the right wife might whip him into shape but on the other hand he was liable to stay as he was even married to the most somber girl in the neighborhood not that lucien and marie intended saddling georges with the most somber girl in the neighborhood for one thing beatrice rigaud would bring only a small bridal portion with her and for another lucien did not think it right to do such a thing to his funloving younger son that reason though ran in second place behind the other halloween came and went unremarked uncelebrated galtier wondered whether dr leonard odoull carved a pumpkin for his own family he would not put it in the window this year hed made that very plain two days later the american elections also came and went they produced no fanfare that reached galtiers farm had lucien not had an american soninlaw he would not have known on which day they took place eventually he would find out who won if the news hadnt got to his farm before then hed learn when he went into town marie said i have heard that not all american women can vote it is for them poor dears as it was for us in the days before the republic i do not know anything about whether american women can vote lucien replied he remained unconvinced that granting the franchise to the women of quebec had been the best idea in the history of the world but hed discovered that saying as much to his wife landed him in hotter water than anything this side of announcing hed taken a mistress he knew several men who had taken mistresses none of them rash enough to announce it i hope the americans elect the socialist marie said they will be calmer if they do i think they will return roosevelt lucien declared even if he is a protestant he is a very great man and socialists from everything i have heard do not believe in le bon dieu at all he thought that would change his wifes mind she cared far more for the trappings of piety than did he but she said perhaps le bon dieu believes in them a reply so oracular galtier had not the faintest idea how to respond to it hal jacobs said what was that song lord cornwallis band played when he had to surrender to the americans at yorktown i havent the faintest notion nellie jacobs answered her schooling had stopped early not only that clara was trying to twist out of her arms and land on her head on the bedroom floor that kept nellie from thinking as clearly as she might have done now it will bother me hal said it is something i used to know and i am not such an old man that i should be forgetting things he smiled at clara if i were such an old man i would not have a little daughter now nellie had not expected he would have a little daughter now even more to the point she hadnt expected she would have a little daughter now had she expected such a thing she would have taken precautions she admitted to herself though that she did enjoy having clara around hal snapped his fingers which made clara stop wiggling and look to see where the funny noise came from the world turned upside down he exclaimed what when we had the baby nellie said it sure did no no no he answered i mean yes it did but no that is not what i meant he paused by all appearances having confused himself after a moment he went on what i meant was the world turned upside down is the song cornwallis band played at the surrender oh nellie said well why didnt you say that if its what you meant and why are you bothering your head about cornwhatshisname in the first place i wasnt thinking about cornwallis so much hal said i was trying to remember the name of the song you must admit it fits the news of the last couple of days oh nellie said the election it hardly seemed real to her she was disenfranchised not because she was a woman but because she lived in washington dc hal hadnt voted on tuesday either and couldnt have yes the election he clicked his tongue between his teeth when the democrats lose for the first time since the world has turned upside down and when the socialists win for the first time ever it has really turned upside down i suppose it has nellie shook her head doesnt seem right turning president roosevelt out of a job after he went and won the war for the united states i cant name anybody else who could have done that dada clara said she said mama too and ehuh which was intended as the name of her half sister how about it hal nellie asked do you think you could have won the war for the united states after a moment she went on as a matter of fact you did go a long way toward winning the war for the usa at least as far as washington goes hal waved a hand he was nellie had seen as modest and selfdeprecating a man as had ever been born that had helped keep her from noticing his many good qualities for longer than she should have he said for one thing i had the very best of help of which you were no small part pooh nellie said pooh clara echoed she gurgled and laughed liking the sound shed just imitated pooh nellie repeated which made clara laugh again nellie continued i got a medal i didnt especially deserve and you deserved one and never got it hal jacobs shrugged i know what i did my country knows what i did i do not need any medals and besides if anyone should have won a medal it was bill reach i was far from the only man who reported to him he was the one who put everything together and got most of it out i know you did not much like him but it is very sad that he did not live to see our victory youve said that before nellie replied and dropped it there she was the only person in the world who knew what had happened to bill reach and she intended to take the secret to the grave with her as far as she was concerned he deserved everything shed given him but hal still thought well of him so shed kept her own remarks to the fewest she could get away with president upton sinclair hal to her relief went back to the world turning upside down he shrugged again it does not sound like a name that belongs to a president presidents are named john or thomas or andrew or theodore upton he shook his head it sounds like a name for a butler not a president well so it does nellie said weve got four years to get used to it though by the time rolls around itll seem natural enough i suppose it may hal admitted by then i hope the country will be sick of it and will vote him out of office and put in a good democrat with a nice ordinary name maybe it wont be so bad nellie slid a finger under the edge of claras diaper oh goodyoure dry she sat down at the edge of the bed and began to bounce the baby gently up and down come on sweetheart time for you to go to sleep time for you to go to sleep so your mother and father can go to sleep hal added he yawned i had forgotten how much sleep you lose when a baby is small so had i nellie said and the other thing is i need sleep more now than i did when edna was little im not as young as i used to be and boy does clara let me know it she glanced warily down at her daughter whose eyelids were fighting a losing battle against sliding shut shh i think she is going to drop off only after nellie had put the baby in the cradle that made the bedroom crowded did hal say you are still young and beautiful to me my dear nellie you always will be pooh nellie said once more she knew why men talked that way to get women to go to bed with them any woman who believed such blandishments was almost enough of a fool to deserve what she would assuredly get so a hard lifetime of experience had taught nellie but living with and listening to hal were giving her occasional second thoughts she was too tired to indulge in second thoughts now or even first ones she let herself collapse onto the bed had she lain there for even a couple of minutes she would have fallen asleep without changing into nightclothes shed done that a couple of times on days when clara was teething or sick or just ornery falling asleep in a corset was impressive proof of what exhaustion could do tonight though she decided she wanted to be free of lacing and steel rods with a weary sigh she got to her feet took off her skirt and shirtwaist and escaped from the corset a wool flannel nightgown went over her like a friendly comfortable tent hal put on not only a nightshirt only a bit shorter than her gown but also a wool nightcap with a tassel no cold breezes would take him by surprise good night he said as he and nellie crawled under the covers i hope little clara will let us sleep till morning she did she did more often than not these days a blessed relief from the first few weeks after shed come home from the hospital still the nights when she didnt were appalling enough to make up for a lot of the ones when she did but she woke the next day so smiling and cheerful nellie smiled too even before shed had breakfast or more important coffee she gave clara her breast the baby was taking cereal these days and other solid food as well but still enjoyed starting the day at the same old stand nellie changed hershe emphatically needed it nowslapped powder on her bottom with a puff and took her downstairs after getting dressed herself she let clara crawl and toddle around while she built up the fire in the stove and got the first pot of coffee going she and hal and edna would split that one customers got what came afterwards quiet night thank god edna said when she came down a few minutes later living across the hall from a baby wasnt that much different from living in the same room as one edna started toasting bread and melted butter in a frying pan to do up eggs for herself and her mother and stepfather in another pan she fried ham steaks in bacon grease left over from the day before hal jacobs came down in time to eat before anything got cold but too late to keep nellie and edna from teasing him about dawdling he was about to go across the street and open up his shoemakers establishment when a fancy motorcar pulled to a stop in front of the coffeehouse nellie ran the driver hurried to open the door for his passenger a portly gentlemen of late middle years the fellow headed for the coffeehouse door lord ma edna breathed will you look at that its the president hes coming here again nellie snatched up clara who howled in outrage at not getting the chance to eat the tastylooking piece of dust shed picked up hush you nellie whispered sternly which did no good at all in came theodore roosevelt good morning miss semphroch he said bowing to edna he turned to nellie and good morning to you mrsjacobs ha i got it right by jingo he looked pleased with himself good morning to you too mr jacobs he told hal you have a lovely daughter here congratulations thank you your excellency nellie and hal said together hal went on a great shame the election went against you sir the people have spoken roosevelt said its another case of what austria told russia after the russians saved their bacon in we shall astonish the world by our ingratitude astonish it they did by not helping the czar in the crimean war now we have a similar example on our own side of the atlantic but the country will survive iti have great faith in the united statesand i shall too what will you do nellie asked i dont precisely know roosevelt answered hunt big game perhaps or fly an aeroplanemaybe i shall hunt big game from an aeroplane that might be jolly but its not why i came here today edna gave him a cup of coffee why did you come today sir she asked today roosevelt was without bodyguards nonellie corrected herself today the guards had not come into the coffeehouse a couple of them paced outside watchdogs in homburgs and fedoras roosevelt reached into his waistcoat and pulled out a small feltcovered box i have here a token of appreciation for the signal service mr jacobs rendered his country during the late war this is a distinguished service medali pulled some strings to get the war department to issue it since mr jacobs was not formally in the army during the war but they humored me in this matter one of the few advantages of lameduckhood i have as yet discovered nellie clapped her hands together in delight so did edna hal jacobs turned red he said mr president i thought i made it perfectly clear i wanted no special recognition for any small things i may have done you did roosevelt said im ignoring you thereanother advantage of lameduckhood i dont have to listen to anyone if i dont feel like it not any more youll take your medal and youll be a hero mr jacobs and if you dont happen to care for it too bad what do you think of that he thinks its splendid nellie exclaimed hal jacobs gave her a dirty look she didnt care she didnt care a bit if a wife couldnt speak for a husband when he needed speaking for what good was she none at all as far as nellie could see arthur mcgregor shooed a hen off her nest and grabbed the egg she had laid the hens furious squawks and flutterings said she was convinced hed murdered part of her immediate family she was righthe had or would as soon as maude got around to cooking the egg mcgregor had had a member of his immediate family murdered too it gave him some sympathy for the hen but not enough to keep him from robbing her nest he slipped a china egg in there and let the hen return she kept on fussing for a moment or two then she discovered the substitute her clucks changed from outrage to contentment she settled down and began to brood an egg that would not hatch even on judgment day a scowl on his face mcgregor went on to the next nest no one had given him any kind of substitute for alexander he wished he were as stupid as a chicken so that a photograph might fool him into thinking he still had a son unfortunately he knew better all he could hope for was revenge the scowl grew deeper i couldnt even get that he growled knocking the next hen out of her nest with a backhand blow that almost broke her fool neck she had no eggs in the nest so he might as well have done her in dentures what a word to make into a curse but if custer hadnt broken his false teeth hed still have been sitting in hys when mcgregors bomb went off as things were mcgregor had killed more than a dozen innocent people without getting the man he really wanted he felt bad about that and worse because they were all canadians victims of the us occupation no less than he but alexander had been innocent and alexander had been a victim and nothing would ever bring him back to life as far as mcgregor was concerned the war against the united states went on canadian forces might have surrendered though rebellion did still simmer here and there especially in parts of the dominion the us army hadnt reached before the great war ended the mother country might have yielded arthur mcgregor kept fighting whenever he saw the chance he finished gathering the eggs and installing china pacifiers under the hens as he headed back toward the farmhouse he thought again how much easier life would have been had the us issued him a china son and had he been stupid enough to reckon it the same as the real thing winter and reality slapped him in the face as soon as he left the barn the wind cut like a knife the sky was clear and blue a blue that put him in mind of a bruise if he stayed outside very long hed start turning blue too hed never met a us soldier whod taken manitoba winters in stride the usa just didnt manufacture weather like this so why the devil did the yanks want to come up here and take this away from us he asked the snarling wind blew his words away that didnt matter the question had no good answer save that the americans were as they were when he opened the kitchen door the blast of heat from the stove was a blow hardly less than the one the freezing wind had given him where hed been shivering an instant before now sweat started out on his forehead he shed his hat and heavy coat as fast as he could maude looked up from the carrots she was peeling how many eggs have you got there seven mcgregor looked in the basket no i take it back eight not bad his wife said he shrugged he didnt want to look on the bright side of anything right now maude went on if things keep going the way they have been well come through this winter in better shape than we have since before the war we wont ever be in the kind of shape we were before the war mcgregor answered his voice colder than the weather outside maude bit her lip you know what i mean she said he did too it didnt help had alexander been there with him a year where he didnt end up broke might not have looked so bad even under us occupation as things were every year showed a loss to him even if he made money if only he began but he let that hang in the air he still hadnt exactly told his wife about his bombs she knew hed gone to winnipeg of course and she knew what had happened while he was there but they both still pretended that was nothing but coincidence you know the culligans are putting on a dance next week if we dont get a blizzard between now and then and maybe even if we do maude said no i didnt know mcgregor looked at her in some surprise you want to go dancing she hadnt shown any interest in that sort of thing since before the great war he shrugged if you do ill take you ill be switched if i think i remember the steps though maude shook her head i dont care one way or the other but julia and ted culligan have known each other since they were little you know and i think shed enjoy dancing with him more than a bit do you mcgregor made automatic protest but shes just a he stopped feeling foolish julia wasnt just a baby any more shed be eighteen in a few weeks hed been engaged to maude when she was eighteen he coughed a couple of times i never paid any attention to ted culligan one way or the other does he matter that much to julia he might maude said i dont know if shes serious and i really dont know if hes seriousyou men mcgregor only blinked at that blanket condemnation of his half of the human race when he did nothing more maude shrugged and went on they could be serious i think we have to decide if we want them to be serious the culligans arent bad folks no theyre not they mind their own businesstheyre not like any of the people who got alexander into trouble mcgregor made up his mind all right well go to this dance go they did it was snowing but not hard julia chattered excitedly as mcgregor drove the wagon toward the culligans mary chattered even more excitedly it was her very first dance actually it wasnt quite but shed been too little to remember going to any of the others people had come from miles around including the families of a couple of the boys whod named alexander as their fellow plotter mcgregor held his face still when he saw the mckiernans and the klimenkos hed been holding his face still for years doing it now wasnt that much harder than any other time ted culligans ears stuck out other than that he seemed a nice enough kid he wasnt good enough for julia that was obvious but it was also obvious no one else could be good enough for julia either a handful of american families had come up and taken over deserted farms around rosenfeld mcgregor had wondered if the culligans would invite them to the dance keeping his face still would have been harder then but he didnt see them and didnt hear any american accents either a pair of fiddlers a fellow with a concertina and a man who pounded a drum with more enthusiasm than rhythm provided the music the tunes were all old ones and all safe ones the little band stuck to love songs mcgregor would have loved to hear some of the regimental ballads hed learned in the army but understood why the musicians fought shy of them word would surely have got back to the us authorities in town which would have brought trouble on its heels mcgregor danced a couple of dances with maude she did recall the steps better than he he was content to let her lead he noticed he wasnt the only farmer whose wife did the steering either that made him laugh something he rarely did these days after those first few dances mcgregor was content to stand on the sidelines and drink punch his eyebrows rose at the first taste of it the culligans hadnt stinted on the whiskey a cup or two and a man would think he could stay warm outside without coat and hat he might even prove right he was more likely to freeze to death julia danced with other boys besides ted culligan that helped ease mcgregors mind his daughter was having a good time which made him feel good he danced a dance with mary whose head he realized in surprise came almost to the top of his shoulder when had she grown so big there stood julia talking with ted over a cup of the potent punch suddenly mcgregor didnt mind the weather at all in the summertime courting couples might slip out to a barn for a while doing that now invited frostbite not romance mcgregor shook hands with ted culligans father when it was time to go home he pretended not to see ted kiss julia on the cheek that wasnt easy not when she turned the color of a redhot stove i had a wonderful time she said over and over on the drive back to the farm simply wonderful she was young enough to forget for a while what had happened to her family and her country and to enjoy the moment mcgregor wished he could do the same back at the farmhouse he lit a lamp in the kitchen his wife and daughters went yawning upstairs to bed he brought the lamp outside and set it on the wagon while he unhitched the horse then he picked up the lamp again and carried it in his left hand while leading the horse to the barn he put the beast in its stall and started out of the barn again but he stopped after a couple of steps stopped and held the lantern high peering around in all directions no he wasnt wrong someone had been in the barn while the mcgregors were at the dance fear and ftiry warred inside him at first fear was uppermost whoever had pawed through his things hadnt bothered trying to conceal his presence tools werent where they should have been a couple of drawers under mcgregors work table were open he knew hed left them closed for he always did heart hammering in his throat he went over to the old wagon wheel beneath which he hid his bombmaking paraphernalia holding the lamp close he tried to see if the snooper had tampered with it as far as he could tell it was undisturbed his secret remained safe when he realized that fury overtook fear god damn those sons of bitches he said softly they do still figure i might be a bomber he was if anything more indignant than if hed been innocent the yanks had paidno the yanks had seemed to payno attention to him the past couple of years hed thought theyd forgotten about him hed been wrong but they hadnt found anything theyd have been waiting here for him if they had theyre trying to rattle me he murmured thats got to be it they couldnt prove hed planted bombs so they were showing their cards trying to force him into a mistake he shook his head he didnt intend to oblige them by the time he went back to the farmhouse and upstairs to his bedroom maude was sound asleep he shrugged even if shed been awake he wouldnt have said a word he got ready for bed himself before the presidential election a lot of firms had put printed messages in their workers pay envelopes the one chester martin got had read if upton sinclair is elected on tuesday dont bother showing up for work wednesday morning the capitalists had tried to the very end to keep the proletariat from voting its conscience and its class interest theyd tried those games before too though not so aggressively up till this election they hadnt been so worried about losing well theyd lost anyhow martin laughed every time he thought about it come march it would be out with the old and in with the new and the united states would have their first socialist president he could hardly wait here it was late december too and he hadnt been fired he didnt expect to be fired any time soon either not unless he hauled off and punched his foreman or something of that sort his foreman was an idiot everyone on the foundry floor knew as much the foremans boss didnt though and his was the only opinion that mattered but work went on as usual in spite of there being a socialist presidentelect did you really expect anything different albert bauer asked when martin remarked on that one day at the socialist hall near the steelworks i dont know that i expected anything different martin answered i will say i wondered mystification bauer said scornfully thats all it is nothing but mystification the capitalists tried to intimidate us and tried to make us believe they had the power to get away with intimidating us it didnt work and now theyll have to learn how to walk a lot smaller yeah martin said and then how much do you think sinclair will be able to do once he gets in dont know bauer answered weve got a majority in the house and i think the socialists and republicans and progressive democrats make a majority in the senate the courts are full of reactionaries theyll give us trouble if they give too much trouble well stop listening to them martin said lets see them get their way if everybody ignores them or lets see them get their way if the worst reactionaries start having accidents bauer laughed at him this from the man who used to be a democrat ive heard people whove been revolutionaries since before you were born who didnt sound half as fierce as you do in for a penny in for a pound chester martin said shrugging besides nobody whos been through the trenches is going to fuss about killing a judge or two once youve had practice killing looks pretty easy something to that i shouldnt wonder bauer looked thoughtful the capitalists might not have realized what they were doing when they started the war but they helped create opponents who wouldnt back away from meeting force with force when they had to martin nodded after artillery and poison gas and machine guns cops are nothing special he said a thought hed had before he paused then asked what do you think of this freedom party down in the csa al theyre another bunch that doesnt seem like its afraid of mixing things up with anybody they dont like reactionary maniacs bauer said with a toss of the head they want to turn back the clock to the way things were before the great war you cant turn back the clock and you have to be a fool to think you can thats about what i thought martin said you believe the papers though a lot of people like what theyre saying stupid damn rebs stupid damn rebs bauer agreed but if wed lost the war imagine how fouled up our politics would be thered be a bounty on socialists now youd better believe there would theyd be hunting us in the streets and theyd go on electing democrats president for the next fifty years so maybe we shouldnt blame the rebstoo muchfor being stupid hmp was all chester martin said to that hed spent three years with the confederates shooting at him hell they hadnt just shot at himtheyd shot him he had the purple heart to prove it and the note of sympathy signed by theodore roosevelt too even with the war almost three and a half years behind him he wasnt inclined to feel charitable toward the former enemy bauer slapped him on the back go on get out of here go home go christmas shopping go somewhere i keep having to tell you that youve got a case of the mopes looks like to me you wont do yourself any good till you get over em you wont do the party any good either so go on scram martin didnt argue with him he buttoned his overcoat and headed out of the socialist hall the trolley stop was a couple of blocks away his breath smoked around him the one thing he envied the confederate states was their mild winter weather summer in virginia on the other hand was a pretty fair approximation of hell of course summer in toledo wasnt all that far removed from hell either shops shiny with tinsel and bright with electric lights beckoned to people walking past them on the street big sale signs in the window shouted some of them might even have meant it but martin had gone into more than a few shops and had yet to see much in the way of price cutting the signs were just a comeon like the tinsel and the bright lights he would have to get presents for his father and his mother and his sister he wanted to get something for albert bauer too though bauer was the least sentimental man hed ever known off the battlefield maybe some shaving soap he thought that would be thoughtful and useful at the same time shaving soap he said several times a woman walking past gave him an odd look he didnt care or not too much saying something out loud helped him remember it coins jingled in his trouser pocket only a faint noise through the thick wool of his coat he wasnt broke as he had been through the labor strife after the war with a socialist administration maybe there wouldnt be any more labor strife that had been his hope as hed made an x in the square beside the names of upton sinclair and hosea blackford the capitalists had had everything their way for a long time now he thought its labors turn he unbuttoned his coat long enough to grab a nickel a bum came up to him while he waited for the trolley the fellow whined for change he stank of unwashed hide and stale beer martin knew hed just buy another mug with a nickel but tossed him the coin anyway merry christmas pal he dug another five cents out of his pocket god bless you mister the bum said martin waved impatiently wanting him to get out of there before he regretted his own generosity the bum had had practice at what he did he faded away up rattled the trolley almost fifteen minutes late martin grumbled as he threw his nickel in the fare box he grumbled some more when he saw hed have to stand for a while the car was full with a lot of passengers festooned with packages he did the best he could positioning himself next to a pretty girl who also had no place to sit she glanced over toward him once a look colder than the weather outside when she left a few blocks later he was more relieved than anything else he eventually did land a seat for himself more people got off than on as the trolley rolled up to ottawa hills not for the first time he thought about renting a place of his own as he walked to the apartment he shared with his parents and sister he could afford itas long as the work stayed steady he could afford it but his paycheck helped his folks pay the rent here and theyd carried him when he was out on strike carried him even though theyd disagreed with his stand he didnt have to do anything in a hurry when he walked in the front door his father was draping the christmas tree with tinsel a fresh piney scent fought the usual odors of tobacco smoke and cooking thats a good one dad martin said you havent found such a nice round plump one in a long time havent gone looking for nice round plump ones not since i married your mother stephen douglas martin answered ignoring his sons halfscandalized snort he went on i am pretty happy with it though found it at a little lot round the corner i jewed em down to four bits for it thats a good price martin agreed you recall where you hid the star and the other ornaments after last christmas i didnt hide them his father said with dignity i put them away safe about every other year he had to turn the apartment upside down because hed put the decorations away so securely he hadnt the faintest idea where they were this time though he came up with them and gave his son a superior look that chester did his best to ignore they hung the ornaments together are we going to have candles on the tree this year chester asked unless you really want em id say no stephen douglas martin answered every year you read in the paper about some damn foolhis eyes went toward the kitchen as he made sure louisa martin hadnt heard him swearwho burns down his house and burns up his family on account of those things i dont aim to be that kind of fool thank you very much all right martin said after bombs and barrels and shell fragments in the trenches after cops and goons with pistols and clubs candles struck him as a silly thing to worry about but his father wasnt wrong people and houses did go up in flames every christmas martin supposed that absent big fears small ones pushed their way to the fore sue came in while they were still decorating she scaled her broadbrimmed flowered hat across the room as if it were an aeroplane and said i get to put the star on top after the day i had today ive earned it what happened today chester asked everyone wanted everything typed at the same time and it was all stupid his sister answered and everyone yelled at me because i couldnt do sixteen different things at the same time if half the people in the office would have thought for even a couple of seconds before they started piling stuff onto me everything would have been fine but throwing things at me and then yelling their heads off was easier so they did that instead she took the gilded glass star and impaled it on top of the christmas tree then she glared at her brother and her father defying them to tell her she had no business getting angry chester was not about to take his life in his hands he said why dont you go get a bottle of schmidts out of the icebox sue didnt usually drink beer tonight she nodded briskly ill do that thank you chester off toward the kitchen she went chester martin grinned at stephen douglas martin he might have been trained as a soldier but hed just served the cause of peace scipio seldom saw snow because he seldom saw it he enjoyed it when he did so did everyone else in augusta pickaninnies made snow angels and threw snowballs so did their parents so did their grandparents some of whom had hair as white as that snow because of the clogged slippery streets he got to erasmus later than he should have and with his hat askew on his head more and more boys played football yankeestyle these days which meant more of them threw the ball which meant they had practice they used to good effect with snowballs erasmus eyes glinted with amusement but all he said was mornin xerxes how you be today cold scipio answered this here nothin but damnyankee weather far as i is concerned it kin stay up there wid they fish keep longer erasmus said dont got to buy so much ice from that thief of an ice man for a couple days outside o dat i aint gwine argue with you scipio had just started his morning sweeping when the first breakfast customer came in erasmus had found he made money serving breakfast so hed started the customer shouted for hot coffee scipio didnt blame him he had to pry himself away from the nice warm stove to bring the fellow the steaming cup and then the fried eggs and grits that followed after pouring down several steaming cups and shoveling in his food the black man got to his feet stuck a hand in the pocket of his dungarees and looked a question toward scipio even if it was wordless scipio understood it a million and a half he said was only a million last week the customer said with a sigh he gave scipio two crisp new banknotes with robert e lees portrait on one side and a picture of jefferson davis taking the oath of office as provisional president in montgomery on the other scipio handed him five banknotes older and more worn because theyd been in circulation longer for change as hed hoped the customer left a couple of hundred thousand dollars tip when he went on his way when was the last time you seen silver or gold money erasmus asked his voice wistful i aint even seen no pennies in a hell of a long time me neither scipio said not since the war jus over somebody put down a dime or a quater reckon i fall over somebody put down a stonewall i knows i fall over how much paper you reckon a stonewall buy these days erasmus lips moved silently as he made his own calculation somewheres around twenty twentyfive million i reckon what you think sound about right scipio agreed erasmus had no formal education but he was shrewd with figures scipio added aint bad fofidollars in gold sure aint erasmus said and said no more scipio wouldnt have been the least bit surprised to find out his boss had a nice pile of stonewalls hidden away somewhere if he needed them theyd come out if times ever got better so that money stopped stretching like india rubber theyd come out then too scipio wished he had his own pile he wondered how many goldpieces anne colleton had these days he was willing to bet she had a good many shed always been one to land on her feet and if the papers didnt lie shed been pumping money into the freedom party that worried scipio his former boss didnt back losers hed seen as much time and again but if the freedom party was a winner every black man and woman in the csa lost what the men in the white shirts and butternut trousers had already done in augusta made that crystal clear if it hadnt been for bathsheba he wouldnt have worried so much hed always been able to take care of himself even after the congaree socialist republic collapsed in blood and fire hed taken care of himself taking care of somebody else though somebody he lovedthat was different it was harder too he didnt dare take risks for bathsheba that he would have cheerfully taken for himself another negro came in asking for flapjacks and eggs he wore a ribbon on his jacket after a moment scipio recognized what it was the ribbon for a purple heart pointing to it he asked where you git that up in virginia the man answered some damnyankee shot me in the leg i was damn lucky let me tell you all he did was blow off a chunk o meat bullet didnt hit no bone or nothin or i reckon id be walkin around with a peg leg listening to somebody talk about how lucky hed been to get shot struck scipio as strange but hed heard white veterans go on the same way he said so you fit the war and done everything the gummint want the customer nodded scipio hurried back to get his breakfast and bring it to him then asked and now you is a citizen now you kin vote an do like the buckra all kinds oways cant marry no white woman the veteran shrugged dont want to marry no white womanlike the colored gal i got but yeah he went on with quiet pride is a citizen he reached into his pocket and displayed an elaborately printed form attesting to his service in the war i carry this here stead of a passbook scipio hadnt thought about the aspect of citizenship he was deeply and sincerely jealous of the veteran who enjoyed a liberty he was unlikely ever to know freedom party give you trouble he inquired he didnt know why he asked the question was he trying to ease his own mind about what the freedom party could do or was he hoping to make the veteran feel bad in spite of the privilege hed earned the mans mouth tightened his eyes narrowed a vertical groove appeared between them and other lines by the edges of his lips them bastards he said quietly you know any niggers dont get trouble from them sure enough dont scipio answered i was hopin you did aint none the negro veteran spoke with assurance aint nothin we can do about it neither nothin i can see yeah im a citizen i punch one o them sons o bitches for callin me names or givin me some other kind o hard time what happen then white folks jury send me to jail for about twenty years that freedom party man kick me in the balls what happen then white folksjury say he didnt do nothin wrong he didnt try to hide his bitterness but you kin vote against they scipio said most black folks cant do nothin atall i can vote the veteran nodded i went an did it last election an ill do it again come november but so what so what god damn it aint but one o me an all them freedom party white folks even if all the niggers in the country could vote wouldnt be enough of us white folks can do what they want near enough why shouldnt they let me vote they can afford it he got up laid two million dollars on the table and stamped out without waiting for change hope you didnt ride antiochus so hard he dont come back erasmus said that aint good business sorry scipio answered which was true in the business sense if in no other you hear what he say he waited for erasmus to nod then went on you still reckon we aint got nothin to fear from no freedom party erasmus nodded again i keeps tellin you an tellin you the white man aint gwine do the work hisself if he aint gwine do it hisself he aint gwine do us no harmor no worsen usual anyways you show me them freedom party fellas out in the cotton fields at pickin time then i commence to worry till then he shook his head scipio wished he could take matters in stride the way his boss did rationally everything erasmus said made sense that should have sufficed for scipio himself a man rational by inclination and education both it should have but it didnt the past few years had been hard on rationality if the negro uprising of hadnt been an exercise in romanticism he didnt know what was the reds hadnt had a chance but theyd risen anyhow he didnt think the freedom party had a chance of restoring the status quo ante bellum either that didnt stop whites from flocking to its banners most whites liked the way things had been before the war just fine and there were as the negro veteran had said a lot of whites if they got behind the freedom party jake featherston and his pals might win how far could they turn back the clock finding out would be as big a romantic folly as the red uprising but nothing had stopped cassius and the other red leaders and likely nothing would stop featherston either scipio sighed life aint easy and at the end you cant do nothin but up and die dont seem right erasmus busied himself making a fresh pot of coffee when he was through he said so tell me then you gwine kiss your lady friend goodbye you gwine lay in bed by your lonesome waitin for to drop dead course not scipio said angrily then he stopped and stared at erasmus the fry cook had pierced his gloomy pretensions as neatly as any white man with a fancy degree in philosophy might have doneand with a tenth or more likely a hundredth as many words instead of angry scipio felt foolish to say nothing of sheepish got to get on with your reglar fairs he mumbled that there make a deal more sensen what you was spoutin a minute ago dont you reckon erasmus demanded yes suh scipio said so far as he could recall hed never called a black man sir before in his life whites got the title because they had the whip hand in the csa he gave it to erasmus becausebecause he deserves it was the thought that ran through scipios mind erasmus noticed too his head whipped around sharply scipio would have bet several million dollarsmaybe even a stonewall nobodyd ever called him sir before that moment either just get back to work will you he said his voice gruff he didnt know how to respond to being treated with respect why should he scipio thought its altogether likely no one has ever shown him any with that scipio came closer to understanding why the reds had rebelled against the confederate government than he ever had before was being treated like a human being worth fighting and dying for maybe it was what do i know about being treated like a human being he thought was only a butler he didnt think in the dialect of the congaree but in the precise formal english hed had drilled into him sometimes that helped him it gave him a wider more detailed map for his world than he would have had if hed gone to the cotton fields sometimes it left him neither fish nor fowl and sometimes it made him angry at what the colletons had done to his mind to his life they hadnt done it for his sake either they hadnt cared at all about him except as a thing theyd done it for their own convenience just got to get through the day and not worry about nothin you cant change anyways erasmus said scipio nodded the fry cook was pursuing the thought hed had a little before but scipios thought had veered in a different direction how can a black man make life worth living in the confederate states he wondered the question was easy to ask finding an answer though here is the latest report sir lieutenant colonel abner dowling set the document on general custers desk well lets have a look at it the electric lights in the overhead fixture glittered off custers reading glasses as he picked up the report and started to go through it abner dowling waited for the explosion he guessed would not be long in coming he was right the commander of us forces in canada slammed the typewritten sheets on the desk poppycock he shouted twaddle harebrained idiocy who was the idiot who produced this nonsense sir captain fielding our operative in rosenfeld is one of the best we have anywhere in this country said dowling who had read the report before giving it to custer if he says theres no evidence this mcgregor planted the bomb in hys chop house you can rely on it if he says theres no bloody goddamn evidence he cant see the nose in front of his face custer snarled christ on his cross mcgregor blew up this brilliant operativescusters sarcasm stungpredecessor otherwise this imbecile wouldnt have the job in the first place look at mcgregors photograph does that shiftyeyed devil look like an honest man to you theres no evidence for that either sir dowling said patiently theyve searched mcgregors farmhouse and barn and grounds any number of times and they havent found a thing to suggest hes the bomber which only proves hes not an imbecile very much unlike our own people down there custer said with a sneer that displayed the fine white choppers in his new upper plate the chap who was there during the war ordered mcgregors son shot didnt he among a good many other executions yes dowling answered with a sigh he barely tried to hide hed been certain ahead of time custer would take this line custer was irresistibly attracted to the obvious and sure enough custer charged ahead as if he hadnt spoken other bombs around rosenfeld too all of them either had to do with families that got his brat in trouble or with people connected to that other operative down there the one who got himself blown sky high the night the war ended coincidence are you telling me its coincidence sir someones been making bombs yes dowling said but its no more likely to be mcgregor than anyone else down there major hannebrinkthe operative whos dead nowhad to hold down the countryside during the war and he didnt use a light hand no one used a light hand during the war sir again custer might not have heard him he went right on with his own thoughts such as they were and was this mcgregor down on his farm when hys was bombed he was not you know he was not i know where he was too visiting kin in ontario dowling said he didnt make a secret of where he was going his farm was checked after the bombing and then again a little before christmas in the hope he might have gotten careless i dont think he could have gotten careless sir because i dont think he had anything to get careless about ought to haul him in custer said ought to haul him in give him a blindfold and a cigarette and stand him up against a wall and give him the same his son got sir dowling exclaimed in real alarm sir the countrys been pretty quiet lately do you want to give the canucks a martyr if you execute a man when you cant prove hes done anything youre asking for trouble dont you think its better to let sleeping dogs lie that dog of a mcgregor lies all right but hes not asleep custer retorted hes wide awake and laughing at us thats what hes doing and as for asking for trouble he looked sly always a dangerous sign with the damned socialists coming into power in another five weeks id love to see the canucks turn fractious it might remind the reds in philadelphia why we have soldiers up here that was devious dowling wondered how a soldier whod gained his reputation by charging straight at the foeregardless of whether the situation called for ithad acquired such a byzantine sense of politics it might even be a clever move if you didnt stop and think about what it meant to this arthur mcgregor and what was left of his family dowling said sir this fellows already lost his son if you shoot him you leave a widow and a couple of orphaned daughters thats pretty hard sir if he were the bomber he would have conspired with somebody wouldnt he theres nothing to show hes done that i mean nothing at all sir no claims no circumstantial evidencezero he hasnt done it period lone wolf custer said but he didnt sound so cocksure as he had a moment before lonewolf mad bombers werent that easy to believe in even for custer pressing his advantage dowling went on so you see sir it really isnt that bad a report i know it would be more satisfying if they could tie up the bomber with a pretty pink ribbon but there are millions of canucks and millions of square miles in this miserable icebox of a country catching the stinking bastard isnt easy bah custer saida sign of weakening then as if it proved something he added he almost blew you up too believe me sir i know that dowling said fervently nobody cared enough about him personally to want to do him in but if custer went he was liable to go too hed make one line in the fourth paragraph of the newspaper stories the commanding generals adjutant also perished in the blastall the obituary hed ever get he sighed his name and photograph wouldnt make it into the encyclopedias or the history books if he ever wrote his memoirs the only reason they might find a publisher would be that people had an endless appetite for stories about custer dowling coughed he could tell stories about custer all right stories that would curl the hair of anybody with an ounce of sense he did not think he was boastful in reckoning himself smarter than the senior soldier in the us army custer had graduated dead last in his west point classhardly a shining example save perhaps of what not to do whenever custer had been right all through his enormously long military career hed been right for the wrong reasons the shouting match hed got into with teddy roosevelt about how and why theyd used their gatling guns in montana territory the way they had proved how far back that went and yet for all his failings custer was and deserved to be famous he might have been right for the wrong reasons but hed been right at the right times that counted for more and custer whatever else you said about him never did anything by halves that counted for a lot too flaws and alland dowling from long exposure to them knew how massive they werecuster would live in the countrys memory for generations to come and when authors got around to writing historical novels about him they would have to invent a character to play his adjutant because no one would remember that perfectly competent but uninspired lieutenant colonel abner dowling whose only measurable defect was measurable indeed in his uncommon and everincreasing girth it hardly seemed fair no doubt it wasnt fair but then life wasnt fair some people were smarter than others some were handsomer than others somecuster sprang to mindwere pushier than others you did what you could with what you had and even if no one would recall the contributions of an obscure officer named dowling custer had done more than he might have otherwise because hed had that obscure officer at his side and guarding his back testily custer said oh very well dowlinghave it your way if you think this mcgregor is pure as the driven snowa comparison that hardly required a poetic spirit in winnipeg in januarywell leave him alone on your head be it and if he sets off another bomb on your head it will be you already pointed that out sir dowling sounded on the testy side himself i would point out to you in return that this is not merely my opinion it is the opinion of the expert on the spot if we pay no attention to the opinion of the expert on the spot where are we hed meant it for a rhetorical question custer answered as if it were literal in the general staff offices in philadelphia that jerked a startled snort of laughter out of dowling custer went on but if we fall down and worship the expert on the spot where are we then with the israelites who fell down and worshiped the golden calf thats where dowling thought the second comparison farfetched what custer meant was that he wanted the liberty to do as he damn well pleased that was all custer had ever wanted since he was eightyone years old and still hadnt learned the difference between liberty and license he wasnt likely to gain that knowledge in however much time he had left i do think youre doing the right thing by letting this mcgregor alone dowling said the whole country has been noticeably calmer lately than it was when you first took over i put the fear of god in the canucks thats why and i had my own good reasons for doing it custer said there might even have been some truth in his words though dowling thought the canadians despair over a cause obviously lost had more to do with it we will make a desert if we have to and we shall call it peace yes sir his adjutant said resignedly no use expecting custer to become a decent latin scholar at his age either more hope that he might become a scholar of indecent latin when tacitus had said the romans made a desert and called it peace he was condemning them custer took it for praise i dont care if they hate us custer added as long as theyre afraid of us that was another latin tag custer probably knew as much having thought of the one coming up with the other would have been easier for him but did he remember the phrase came from caligulas lips not likely dowling judged he glanced over at custer would caligula have been like this if hed lasted to eightyone dowlings shiver had nothing to do with the subzero cold outside he couldnt recall the last time hed had such a frightening thought he said now that they are quiet sir i really do think its best not to stir them up so youve saidover and over and over custer said so everyone says well i have something to say to you too you and everyone else had better be right or the united states are going to end up with egg on their face and what do you think of that i think youre right sir dowling didnt see what good pointing out custers unfailing gift for the obvious would do xiii jefferson pinkards alarm clock went off with a sound like doom the steelworker thrashed and writhed and finally managed to turn the bloody thing off he wished he could thump himself in the head and get rid of his headache the same way alabama was a dry state but that didnt mean he and his freedom party buddies couldnt lay their hands on some whiskey after meetings when they set their minds to it ought to know better than to go into work hungover he said he did know better hed learned better the hard way he hadnt headed for the sloss works hurting in yearsnot till he threw emily out of the house after catching her whoring with bedford cunningham a second time since then since then he knew hed been drinking more than he should but knowing and stopping were two different critters he built up the fire in the stove and got a pot of coffee going then he went back to the bathroom and dryswallowed a couple of aspirins he lathered his face and shaved as he was toweling himself dry afterwards he wondered why he hadnt cut his own throat it wasnt the first time that question had occurred to him after a cup of strong black coffee after the aspirins started to work the world looked a little less gloomy he ate a big chunk of bread and ham and cut off a piece of last nights partly cremated ham steak to toss into his dinner pail since hed thrown emily out hed discovered just what a lousy cook he was aint starved yet he declared and headed out the door the place was an unholy mess but he lacked the time the energy and the skill to do anything about it he had to walk past bedford cunninghams cottage on the way to the foundry he looked straight ahead he didnt want to see bedford even if he was there he didnt want to see fanny cunningham either he blamed her too if shed kept her husband happy in bed he wouldnt have had to go sniffing around emily more steelworkers white and black crowded the path leading to the sloss works greetings filled the air hey lefty mornin jeff how you is nero whats up jack freedom pinkard heard that a couplethree times before he got to the time clock and stuck in his card to start the day as the aspirins and coffee had done the slogan made him feel better he winced only a little when he stepped out onto the foundry floor once he was out there he knew hed make it through the day if he could stand the clangor now he wouldnt even notice it by the time afternoon rolled around vespasian came onto the floor only a minute or so after he did mornin mistuh pinkard the negro steelworker said morning pinkard answered every time he thought about it these days the idea of working with a black buck graveled him more but vespasian had been out on the foundry floor since and he wasnt even slightly uppity he gave jeffs anger no place to perch that in itself was infuriating they had no time for light conversation not this morning the big crucible swung down and poured a fiery load of molten metal down onto the sand of the foundry floor steam rose in hissing stinking clouds the steel seemed as determined to get free of the mold as any house cat was to get outdoors whatever else pinkard thought of vespasian he had to allow that the big negro knew his way around steel vespasian made as good a partner as bedford cunningham ever had and he wasnt likely to try and sleep with emily or maybe he is jeff thought who the hell knows emilys liable to be taking on niggers these days he didnt know what the woman hed married the woman hed loved was doing these days not for certain hed finally let her back into the house so she could put on some clothes and gather up whatever she could carry in her arms then hed thrown her out again she hadnt come round the place since he wouldnt have let her in if she had maybe she was working in a factory somewhere downtown maybe she was standing on a streetcorner shaking her ass whenever a man walked by and hoping hed give her five or six million dollars for a fast roll in the hay i dont care what shes doing pinkard said quickly fiercely vespasian shouldnt have been able to hear that lowvoiced mumble but the negro had been on the foundry floor a long time hed got as good as anybody could get at hearing under the racket and picking up talk he knew about emily everybody at the sloss works knew about emily sure as hell just for a second he looked at pinkard with pity in his eye jeff glared back and vespasian flinched as if from a blow the last thing in the world jeff wanted was a black mans pity work god damn you he snarled vespasian did work his face as blank of expression now as a justerased blackboard before pinkard had been conscripted he wouldnt have talked to vespasian that way hed thought the negro a pretty good fellow then he might not have talked to vespasian that way before he first heard jake featherston speak he might as well have been blind before but featherston had opened his eyes all right joining the freedom party was the best thing i ever did he said if vespasian heard that he pretended he didnt it was true though the freedom party gave him a family a place to go things to do if he hadnt been active in the party he might have gone clean round the bend when emily took off her dress for bedford cunningham that second time that emily might not have done any such thing if he hadnt so immersed himself in the freedom party never once entered his mind what he did think about was that several of his party buddies had had their marriages go to hell and gone in the past few months none of the other blowups had been quite so spectacular as his but having pals who understood what he was going through because they were going through the same thing made life easier none of his friends had been able to figure out why they and their wives had broken up trying gave them something to talk about at party meetings and when they got together betweentimes the only place where he didnt think that much about the freedom party was out on the foundry floor if you thought about anything but what you were doing out there you were asking for a trip to the hospital if you were lucky and a trip to the graveyard if you werent hed learned that early on and relearned it when he came back to the sloss works after the war work came first that was a matter of life and death at last work ended for the day as the screech of the steam whistle faded pinkard turned to vespasian and said see you tomorrow freedom vespasians lips had started to shape the word see but he didnt say anything at all he showed expression now the expression was pain jeff had seen it on yankees faces as he drove home the bayonet vespasian turned away from him and stumbled off to clock out as if he too had taken a couple of feet of sharpened steel in the guts he might have had a pretty good notion of jeffs politics beforehand but now he was left in no possible doubt jeff laughed out loud the future was on his side he felt it in his bones he clocked out and hurried home to his cottage fanny cunningham sat out on the front porch of hers next door jeff leered at her wondering if this was how bedford had looked at emily it didnt draw fanny into his arms she fled back into the house he laughed again his hot burning laughter filled the street as molten steel filled its mold he took some sausages out of the icebox and burned them for supper his suppers these days were of two sorts burnt and raw he ate bread with them and gulped down a glass of homebrew that was no better than it had to be the dishes sat in the sink waiting as far as he was concerned they could go right on waiting too he had a freedom party meeting tonight that was a hell of a lot more important than a pile of goddamn dishes freedom the greeting filled the livery stable it wasnt a challenge here nor a shout of defiance it was what one friend said to another the men who filled the stablefilled it almost to overflowing before long like it or not the birmingham chapter would have to find a new place to meetwere friends colleagues comrades those whod been in the party longer got a little more respect than johnnycomelatelys but only a little jeff had joined long enough ago to deserve some of that respect himself with barney stevens up in richmond a skinny little dentist named caleb briggs led the meetings and led the party in birmingham freedom he shouted his voice thin and rasping hed been gassed up in virginia and wouldnt sound right till they laid him in his grave freedom pinkard shouted with the rest of the men whod come together to find to build something larger and grander than themselves boys im not telling you anything you dont already know when i say that jake featherstons going to be running for president this year briggs paused to suck more air into his ruined lungsand to let the party members cheer till they sounded almost as hoarse as he always did then he went on weve done a little bit of brawling every now and again but its not a patch on what were going to be doing let me tell you that more cheers erupted jeff pumped his fist in the air brambles and thorns in his throat briggs went on the whigs will be holding rallies here in town the goddamn radical liberals will be holding rallies here in town he shook his head lamplight reflected wetly from his eyes thats not right those traitor bastards will try and hold rallies here in town are we going to let em no jeff shouted along with most of the freedom party men the rest were shouting hell no and other coarser variations on the theme instead thats right caleb briggs nodded now which made his eyeballs glitter in a different way jeff could not have said how it was different but it was briggs went on thats just right boys this is a war were in same as the one we fought in the trenches we would have won that one only we got stabbed in the back this time we hit the traitors first jeff applauded till his hard horny hands were sore somebody not far away pulled out a flask of moonshine and passed it around pinkard took a swig son of a bitch he said reverently his vocal cords for the moment nearly as charred as briggs he passed the flask along half sorry to see it go half relieved it was gone someone started singing dixie jeff roared out the words a fiery fury in him that had surprisingly little to do with the whiskey hed just drunk the freedom party sang dixie at every meeting then someone else began louisville will be free that one dated from just after the second mexican war and recounted the greatest fight of that war with louisville forced back into the usa in the great war it took on a poignancy now that it hadnt had then tears ran down jefferson pinkards face they took him by surprise he wondered if he was weeping for ravaged louisville or for himself a great determination filled him like his country hed paid for doing what he remained convinced was right sooner or later everyone else would pay too freedom he cried at the top of his lungs freedom freedom reggie bartlett nodded in some surprise when tom brearley came into harmons drugstore he hadnt seen much of brearley since the exnavy man went down to south carolina to talk with anne colleton reggie had been waiting for fireworks to spring from that meeting he was still waiting evidently brearley was getting tired of waiting he said all right mr bartlett whats your next great idea for blowing the freedom party out of the water i havent got another one reggie admitted wish to heaven i did well ive got another one brearley looked very determined reggie could easily picture him peering through a periscope at a us cruiser oddly he also looked much younger than he had before sticking out his chin he said if i cant get those bastards fighting among themselves ill just have to take the story to the newspapers jesus reggie said are you sure you want to do that i wouldnt not unless i had my lifeinsurance premiums all paid up as a matter of fact i do brearley said doing a determined and pretty good best to sound unconcerned i made sure they were before i went down to talk to tom colletons sister because i wasnt sure id be coming back but by now kimball has to know ive talked he has to figure ill talk more that means hell try and kill me sooner or laterlikely sooner im kind of surprised he hasnt tried it yethim or some of the freedom party apes up here i want to make sure the word gets out before he does he didnt sound unconcerned any more just matteroffact a man tackling a job he knew was dangerous reggie understood that he wouldnt have not before the war going through the trenchescoming out of the trenches on command to attackchanged a man forever he knew he would be afraid again many times in his life but fear would never paralyze him as it might have done before he had its measure now he said if youre bound and determined to do it youd better think hard about which paper you go to you dont want to head for the sentinel because dont teach your grandpa to suck eggs brearley said with a wry grin do i look that stupid half the time i reckon jake featherston puts that rag out himself shame and a disgrace the garbage it prints why dont i just shut up reggie said to nobody in particular i dont want you to shut up brearley told him you go to political rallies for fun you really think about this stuff a lot more than i do so i want your advice you reckon i should talk to the whig or the examiner go with the whigs or the radical liberals reggie stroked his chin after a minute or so of silent thought he said thats an interesting one isnt it the freedom partys probably giving the whigs a harder timethey were the ones who ran the country during the war but i think the radical liberals are more afraid of featherston and his gang dont you for one thing theyre farther away from the stand he takes where some of the rightwing whigs might as well start yelling freedom themselves and for another the rad libs are running scared if they dont get a break the freedom partyll be number two in the country after this falls election you give them some dirt theyll run with it tom brearley looked at him as if hed never seen him before youre wasting your time shoving pills across a counter bartlett you should have been a lawyer something like that you think straight you think real straight maybe i do reggie said youre the one whos not thinking straight now ill tell you that where the devil am i going to get the money to study law where am i going to get the money to get the education id need so i could study law if id had a million dollars before the war it might have been a different story brearley shrugged if you want something bad enough you can generally find a way to get it what i want right now is to torpedo the freedom party i tried one way it didnt work all rightill try something else the examiner itll be thanks bartlett he sketched a salute and left jeremiah harmon came up from the back of the drugstore i overheard some of that he said sounding apologetic astonishing in a boss none of my business but anybody who goes up against a machine gun without a machine gun of his own is asking for a whole peck of trouble you ask me the examiners a popgun not a machine gun wish i could say different but i cant where do you find a machine gun to fight the freedom party reggie asked havent the foggiest notion the druggist replied dont know if there is any such animal but if i didnt have one i think id stay down in my dugout and hope no big shell caved it in he hadnt been to the front hed passed the war in richmond making pills and salves and syrups he never pretended otherwise but the vocabulary of the trenches had come to be part of everyones daytoday speech in the csa an awful lot of men had passed through the fire reggie wasted a moment wondering if expressions from the front line filled the sharpsounding english of the united states too harmon went back to whatever hed been doing when tom brearley came into the drugstore he didnt waste a lot of time banging a drum for what he thought if you agreed with him or decided he had a point fine if you didnt he wouldnt lose any sleep over it and it wasnt just an interesting discussion to reggie bartlett hed signed his name to the letter that had gone down to tom colleton if freedom party thugs came after tom brearley they were liable to come after him too all at once he wished hed told brearley to keep the hell away from newspapers part of him wished that anyhow the rest realized such worries came far too late the cat had been out of the bag ever since he touched pen to paper he started watching the newspapers especially the richmond examiner like a hawk day followed day with no banner headline about a us destroyer sunk after the confederate states asked for quarter maybe brearley had got cold feet and hadnt bent a reporters ear after all in a way that disappointed reggie down to the depths of his soul in another way one that left him ashamed it relieved him maybe brearley had talked and the reporter hadnt believed him reggie almost hoped that was so it would have given him the best of both worlds and then one day with march approaching and with it the first inauguration of a socialist president of the usa that banner headline did run in the examiner war criminal high in freedom party circles for a moment reggie hoped the story under the headline would be about some other war criminal he wouldnt have been surprised to learn the freedom party sheltered battalions of them under its banner but it wasnt the reporter didnt name tom brearleyciting concerns for his informants safetybut he did name roger kimball the bonefish and the uss ericsson reggie hadnt known exactly what kind of secret brearley was keeping now he did now everybody did he nodded to himself brearley hadnt been stretching thingsit was a big one the reporter made it sound as if several members of the submersibles crew had confirmed what brearley said too maybe that was camouflage to make the story seem more authoritative and to take some of the heat off brearley maybe he really had checked with other crewmen and that was why the story had waited so long to run however that worked the story made the freedom party hopping mad the very next day a blistering denunciation ran in the sentinel what it amounted to was that the damnyankees had had it coming and that anyone betraying a confederate officer whod done his duty as he saw it deserved whatever happened to him it didnt quite declare open season on tom brearley but it didnt miss by much reggie was glad he didnt figure in the piece in any way jeremiah harmon said now your friend gets to find out what sort of whirlwind he reaps hes not my reggie stopped hed been about to say that brearley was no friend of his the only reason they knew each other was that the exnavy man had married an old flame of his but they shared a common foe the freedom party that might not make them friends but it did make them allies harmon noted reggies pause nodded as if his assistant had spoken a complete sentence and went back to work a customer came into the drugstore marched up to the counter and demanded a ringworm salve reggie sold him one knowing the best the store offered were none too good doctors and researchers had got pretty good at figuring out what caused a lot of ailments doing anything worthwhile about them was something else again tom brearley came by a couple of days later he grinned a skeletal grin at reggie still here he said in sepulchral tones reggie made shooing motions well get the hell out of here he hissed you think i want to be seen with you his acting was too good brearley turned and started to leave only the laughter reggie couldnt contain stopped him damn you brearley said without heat you had me going there freedom partys still screaming about traitors seems to be the only song they know anybody give you any real trouble reggie asked brearley shook his head not yet thank god the only people in the freedom party who know what i look like live down in south carolina but they know my name they can find out where i live he patted the waistband of his trousers his coat concealed whatever he kept there but reggie had no trouble figuring out what it was brearley said they want to try and give me a hard time im ready for em good reggie hesitated then asked hows maggie doing pretty well brearley answered she doesnt take the whole business as seriously as i do she hasnt paid that much attention to politics and she doesnt really know what a pack of nasty soandsos join the party reggie wasnt sure he took the whole business as seriously as brearley did either then he recalled his relief at not getting into the newspaper maybeevidentlyhe took things seriously after all unable to stomach his own cooking he stopped in a greasy spoon for supper he regretted it shortly thereafter the colored fellow sweating at the stove knew less about what to do there than he did when he got home he gulped bicarbonate of soda that quelled the internal rebellion but left him feeling gassy and bloated he read for a while found himself yawning and went to bed bells in the night woke him he yawned again enormously put the pillow over his head and very soon went back to sleep when morning came he was halfway through breakfast before he remembered the disturbance those were fire bells he said and then good thing the fire wasnt next door i reckon or id be burnt to a crisp right about now somebody had been burnt to a crisp newsboys shouted the story as they hawked their papers liars house goes up in smoke read all about it a kid selling the sentinel yelled a cold chill ran through reggie bartlett he didnt buy the sentinel that would have been the same as putting fifty thousand dollars in the freedom partys coffer two streetcorners farther along he picked up a copy of the examiner and read it as he walked the rest of the way to harmons drugstore he shivered again as he read the paper reported that thomas and margaret brearley had died in a conflagration that swept their home so swiftly and violently that neither had the slightest chance to escape which leads firemen to suspect that arson may have been involved it talked about brearleys naval career in general terms but did not mention that hed served aboard the bonefish jeremiah harmon had a newspaper in his hand when reggie walked into the drugstore reggie didnt need to ask which story he was reading you see the druggist said in his mild quiet voice oh yes reggie answered i see god help me mr harmon i sure do sylvia enos sank into the trolley seat with a grateful sigh she didnt often get to sit on her way to the galoshes factory and better yet the seat had a copy of the boston globe there for the grabbing she snatched up the paper before anyone else could every penny she didnt spend on a newspaper could go to something else and she needed plenty of other things with not enough pennies to go around most of the front page was filled with stories about the inauguration of president sinclair which was set for day after tomorrow sylvia read all of them with greedy gloating interest she might not be able to vote herself but the prospect of a socialist president delighted her she didnt quite know what upton sinclair could do about frank best but she figured he could do something another prominent headline marked the fall of belfast to the forces of the republic of ireland no wonder that story got prominent play in boston with its large irish population now the whole of the emerald isle is free irish general collins was quoted as saying the folk of belfast might not agreesurely did not agree else they wouldnt have fought so grimlybut no one on this side of the atlantic cared about their opinion sylvia opened the paper to the inside pages she picked and chose there the factory was getting close a headline caught her eye rebel accuser perishes in suspicious fire most of the story was about the death of a man whose name was spelled half the time as brierley and the other half as brearley he had drawn the wrath of the freedom party a growing force in the csa the globes reporter wrote by claiming that a leading party official in one of the carolinas was while in the cs navy responsible for deliberately sinking the uss ericsson although fully aware that the war between the united states and confederate states had ended the freedom party has denied this charge and has also denied any role in the deaths of brierley and his wife the trolley came to sylvias stop it had already started rolling again before she realized she should have got off when it stopped again a couple of blocks later she did get off she knew she should hurry back to the factorythe implacable time card would dock her for every minute she was late to say nothing of the hard time frank best would give herbut she couldnt make herself move fast not with the way her mind was whirling not a british boat after all she thought it was the rebs they were the ones george worried about and he was right and they did it after the war was over and the fellow who did it is still running around loose down there she wanted to scream she wanted to buy a gun and go hunting for the submarine skipper why not hed gone hunting for her husband are you all right dearie may cavendish asked when sylvia came in and put her card in the time clock you look a little peaked im sylvia didnt know how she was or how to put it into words she felt as if a torpedo had gone off inside her head sinking everything she thought shed known since the end of the war and leaving nothing in its place stunned and empty she went into the factory frank best greeted her pocket watch in hand youre late mrs enos most days she would have apologized profusely hoping in that way to keep him from bothering her too much most days it would have been a forlorn hope too now she just looked at him and nodded yes i am arent i she walked past him toward her station near the molds if he hadnt quickly stepped out of the way she would have walked over him he stared after her she did not look back over her shoulder to see after a while he came up to her carrying a pair of rubber overshoes thought you could slip these by me did you he said his usual opening line she looked at the galoshes the red rings around the top looked fine to her which meant theyd look fine to a customer too theyre all right mr best she said brushing a wisp of hair back from her eyes with the sleeve of her shirtwaist i really dont have time to play games today im sorry he stared at her again in complete astonishment i could have you fired he said you could be on the street in fifteen minutes thats true she said calmly and bent to paint a couple of overshoes coming down the line at her have you gone out of your mind the foreman sputtered maybe sylvia considered it for a moment i dont think so but i rather wish i would youre kid frank best began he studied sylvia she wasnt kidding that must have been obvious even to him he started to say something else whatever it was it never passed his lips he walked away shaking his head he was still carrying the galoshes about which hed intended to give her a hard time so thats the secret she thought shed been drunk only a few times in her life but she had that same giddy headlong anythingcanhappen feeling now act a little crazy and frank will leave you alone but she hadnt been acting she didnt just feel drunk she felt crazy the world had turned sideways while she wasnt looking everything she thought shed known about whod killed george turned out to be wrong now she was going to have to grapple with what that meant as she painted red rings on the next pair of overshoes she suddenly wished upton sinclair hadnt won the election after all sinclair when he talked about dealings with other countries talked about reconciliation and improving relations with former foes that had sounded good during the campaign now now sylvia wished teddy roosevelt were going to be inaugurated again come friday with tr you always knew where he stood most of the time sylvia had thought he stood in the wrong place but he would have demanded that confederate submersible skippers head on a silver platter and if the rebs hesitated about turning him over tr would have started blowing things up he wouldnt have stopped blowing things up till the confederates did what he told them either sylvia sighed so much for socialism she thought as soon as she wanted the united states to take a strong line with their neighbors she automatically thought of the democrats thats why they ran things for so long she realized lots of people had wanted the united states to take a strong line with their neighbors as soon as people thought they didnt need to worry about the csa and canada england and france any more they threw the democrats out on their ear shed wanted to throw the democrats out on their ear too maybe shed been hasty how am i going to get revenge with upton sinclair in the powel house or the white house or wherever he decides to live she wondered he wont do it hes already said he wouldn t do things like that will i have to do it myself she laughed imagining herself invading the confederate states singlehanded what would she wear a pot helmet over her shirtwaist and skirt a greengray uniform with a flowered hat and how would she get rid of the reb whod killed her husband with a hatpin or a carving knife those were the most lethal weapons she owned she had the feeling they wouldnt be enough to do the job she kept on doing her job as automatically as if she were a machine the factory owners hadnt figured out how to make a machine to replace her the minute they did shed be out of work millions of people all over the country were in that same boat that was another reason sinclair had beaten tr when the dinner whistle blew sylvia jumped she couldnt decide whether she thought it came too soon or too late either way it shouldnt have come just then it snapped her out of a haze not the haze of work but the haze of a mind far awayin the confederate states in the south atlantic and back in her apartment with her husband still bemused she picked up her dinner pail and went out to meet her friends what in the world did you say to frank sarah wyckoff demanded hes been walking around all morning like he just saw a ghost and the way hes been looking at you may cavendish added taking a bite from a pungent sandwich of summer sausage pickles and onions not like he wants to get his hands inside your clothes the way he usually does but more like hes scared of you tell us the secret i dont know sylvia said vaguely she remembered talking with the foreman not long after the shift started but hardly anything of what had passed between them most of what had gone on since shed seen that story in the boston globe was a blur to her you all right dearie may asked i dont know sylvia said again she realized she had to do better than that and did try im having a lot of trouble keeping my mind on my workon much of anythingthis morning well i know all about that sarah said this isnt the most exciting place they ever built and thats the lords truth may nodded while lighting a cigarette sylvia lit one too the surge of wellbeing that went with the first couple of puffs penetrated the fog around her wits in thoughtful tones she asked may what would you do if you could find the soldier who killed your husband i mean the soldier the one who fired the machine gun or rifle or whatever it was i dont know may cavendish answered i never thought about that before for all i know hes already dead her eyes went flat and hard when she spoke again her voice was cold as sleet i hope hes already dead and i hope he took a long time to die too the stinking son of a bitch but then after a savage drag on her cigarette she sounded much more like her usual self saying but how could you ever tell with so many bullets flying around nobody knew who shot people and who didnt herbert always used to talk about that when he came home on leave now she sighed and looked sad remembering i suppose youre right sylvia said shed forgotten the differences between the wars the army and the navy fought she knew the name of her husbands killer roger kimball she knew he lived down in south carolina and agitated for the freedom party she had no idea whether the freedom party was good bad or indifferent what would you do sylvia sarah asked if you knew who can say sylvia sounded weary i like to think id have the gumption to try and kill him but who can say the whistle blew announcing the end of the dinner break i like to think id have the gumption to try and kill frank best too but it hasnt happened yet sylvia added chuckling she and her friends went back to work flora hamburger remembered the last presidential inauguration shed attended four years before that long she shook her head in wonder so much had changed since shed been brand new in congress then unsure of herself unsure of her place in philadelphia now she was starting her third term the war had still raged now the united states were at peace with the world and shed gone to the inauguration of a democrat then now now half the bunting that decorated philadelphia was the traditional red white and blue the other half was solid red symbol of the socialists who had come into their own at last a lot of people in philadelphia were going around with long faces being the home of the federal government since the second mexican war it had also been the home of the democratic party since the s now president sinclair would be choosing officials ranging from cabinet members down to postmasters a horde of democrats whod thought they owned lifetime positions were discovering theyd been mistaken and would have to go out and look for real work presidentelect sinclair had chosen to hold the inauguration in franklin square to let as large a crowd as possible see him hed thought about going down to washington dc but the de jure capital remained too warbattered to host the ceremony philadelphia it was we are the party of the people he had said a great many times let them know how they are governed and they will ensure they are governed well before sinclair took the presidential oath hosea blackford would take that of the vice president flora shook her head again in march shed had a mild friendship with the congressman from dakota now now i am the mistress of the vice presidentelect of the united states the title should have left her feeling sordid and ashamed and it did sometimes what after all was mistress but a fancy word for fallen woman but she also knew shed never been so happy as in the time since she and blackford became lovers did that make her depraved she didnt think somost of the time she didnt think sothough no doubt others would if they knew whatever she was it didnt show on the outside dressed in a splendid maroon wool suit herman bruck would have approved and a new hat she had one of the best seats for the ceremony why not she was a socialist member of congress then she wondered is it a matter of rank is this what we get will we become part of the ruling class the way the democrats did she hoped not the people had elected upton sinclair to prevent that kind of thing not to promote it then all her thought about anything but the immediate present blew away a rising hum from the enormous crowd behind her announced the arrival of the motorcars full of dignitaries who would go through the ceremony that marked the changing of the guard for the united states people clapped and cheered to see them in the lead behind an honor guard of soldiers and marines strode chief justice oliver wendell holmes he was a little thinner a little more stooped than he had been when flora first saw him four years before but he still moved like a much younger man behind him came vice president mckenna an amiable nonentity who was almost as fat as congressman taft in white tie and tails he looked like a penguin that had swallowed a beach ball and behind mckenna walked theodore roosevelt also in white tie and tails as he moved toward the raised platform on which president sinclair would take the oath of office senators and representatives got to their feet and began to applaud him democrats rose sooner than socialists and republicans but soon regardless of party members of both houses of congress stood and cheered the man who had led the united states to victory in the great war roosevelt did not seem to have expected such a tribute he doffed his stovepipe hat several times once he took off his spectacles for a moment and rubbed at his eyes had he got a cinder in them or was he wiping away a tear flora had trouble believing that of an old tartar like tr then spotting her among the crowd of nearly identicallooking men the outgoing president waved and blew her a kiss he could hardly have astonished her more if hed turned a cartwheel she stayed on her feet after he passed as did all the other socialists most of the midwestern corporals guard of republicans and the more courteous democratsabout half here came hosea blackford about to make the change from vice presidentelect to vice president he too wore formal attire he didnt look like a penguin not to flora he looked splendid flora called his name while she was applauding he smiled at her but he was smiling at everybody he hurried after roosevelt toward the platform and behind himin front of another honor guard this one of sailors and soldierswalked the man of the hour upton sinclair craning her neck to look back at him flora saw a sea of red flags waving in the crowd her heart slammed against her rib cage in excitement and delight as the dialectic predicted the people had at last turned to the party that stood for their class interests up on the platform theodore roosevelt shook sinclairs hand a formal gesture and then slapped him lightly on the back one much less so the president that was and the president that would be grinned at each other flora remembered how senator debs had stayed personally cordial toward tr even after losing two presidential elections to him whatever roosevelt and sinclair said to each other they were too far away from the microphone for it to pick up their words chief justice holmes stood by it a bible in his hand he beckoned to hosea blackford when blackford took the vicepresidential oath the electric marvel let the whole enormous crowd hear him doit then justice holmes summoned the presidentelect to the microphone his amplified oath filled the vast echoing silence in franklin square i upton sinclair do solemnly swear that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states congratulations mr president oliver wendell holmes said as roosevelt had done he reached out to shake sinclairs hand what had been quiet erupted into a vast roar of noise the noise of almost forty years of socialist struggle finally rewarded with victory upton sinclair lifted up his hands as if he were a magician silence returned into it he said its time for a changethe same theme hed used in toledo the theme the socialists had used through the whole campaign weve been saying that for a long time my friends but now the change is here more fervent applause followed as did scattered shouts of revolution sinclair raised his hands again this time quiet was slower in coming at last he got it he said we are at peace and i hope and expect we shall remain at peace throughout my term that drew more cheers and a jaundiced look from theodore roosevelt sinclair went on and we shall have peace here at home as well peace with honor peace with justice peace at last we shall have not the peace of the exploiter who rules his laborers by force and fear but the peace of the proletariat given its rightful place in the world the crowd roared its approval theodore roosevelt looked like a thunderstorm about to burst but all he could do was frown impotently upton sinclair had the microphone upton sinclair had the country he said if the capitalists will not give the workers their due this administration will see to it that the rights and aspirations of the laboring classes are respected if the capitalists will not heed our warnings this administration will see to it that they heed our new laws if the capitalists go on thinking that the means of production are theirs and theirs alone this administration will prove to them that those means of production belong in the hands of the people which is to say the hands of the government for too long the trusts have had friends in high places now the people have friends in high places the red flags dipped and waved the crowd in franklin square screeched itself hoarse the democratic minority in the house and senate listened to president sinclair in stony silence so did chief justice holmes flora noticed that even if sinclair did not sinclair might propose laws congress might pass them and the supreme court might strike them down but that would be later now there was only the headiness of victory flora felt it too and applauded loudly when president sinclair made an eloquent call for equity among nations if we d had equity among nations all along she thought my brother would walk on two legs but even pain and bitterness could not last not today after president sinclairs speech ended the celebrating began every saloon in philadelphia had to be packed so did every ballroom not every socialist had proletarian tastes in amusementfar from it flora went to a reception at powel house for the socialist congressional delegation she met the president and his wife a vivacious redhead named enid who was wearing an offtheshoulder green velvet gown that would have caused multiple heart attacks on the lower east side floras district was radical politically but not when it came to womens clothes sinclair was also dashing in the clawhammer coat he still wore i want you to go right on being the conscience of the house he told flora ill do my best mr president she said senator debs came up then and shook the presidents hand congratulations upton he said graciously youve done what i couldnt do and now that you have done it ive got a question for you he waited till sinclair nodded then asked what do you propose to do about the claims this confederate submarine sank one of our ships after the war was over examine them study them the new president answered not go off halfcocked the way tr would the confederates are having their own political upheavals the claims may have more to do with those than with the truth once i know whats what ill decide what i need to do debs nodded but said that freedom party down there could do with some slapping down its reaction on the marcha sentiment with which flora agreed completely once i know whats what ill decide what i need to do president sinclair repeated flora had hoped for more but had to be content with that the reception went on for a very long time flora had grown more used to late hours in philadelphia than shed ever been in new york city but she was yawning by the time it got to be half past one hosea blackfordvice president hosea blackford said im heading home flora can i give you a ride he grinned i get a housing allowance but no houseshows where the vice president fits into the scheme of things so why should i move that would be very kind your excellency flora said with a smile that made blackford snort the vice presidents nondescript ford seemed out of place among the fancy motorcars around powel house in companionable silence he drove flora back to the apartment house where they both lived no matter how tired she was she invited blackford into her flat he cocked an eyebrow are you sure of course i am flora stood on tiptoe to whisper in his ear ive never done this with a vice president before he laughed out loud and was still laughing when he stepped inside after flora closed the door behind him he said i should hope not walter mckenna would have squashed you flat flora squeaked in outrage then she started to laugh too he took her in his arms she forgot she was tired she knew shed be reminded in the morning but for nowshe forgot cincinnatus driver and his family had never lived in an apartment house before moving to iowa one thing he hadnt been able to investigate at the covington kentucky public library was how much houses cost in des moines it was a lot more than it had been down in covington either to buy or to rent the twobedroom flat hed found was much more in his price range even if none of the rooms was big enough to swing a cat but the flat had electricity which went some way toward making up for that hed never lived in a place with electricity before he liked it elizabeth liked it even better the apartment house was in the near northwestern part of town west of the des moines river and north of the raccoon it was as close as des moines came to having a colored district although only a little more than a thousand negroes were hardly enough to constitute a real district in a city of over a hundred thousand the drivers shared their floor with two other black families and one white the proprietor of a chinese laundry lived upstairs nobody was rich not in that neighborhood people got by though as far as cincinnatus could tell they got by rather better than they had in covington i want to go to school pa achilles yelled to cincinnatus when he came home worn from a days hauling one evening some of my friends go to school i want to go to school too youll go to school in the fall his father told him you turn six then well put you in this kindergarten they have here in covington white children had kindergartens black children hadnt had any formal schooling till the usa took kentucky away from the csa cincinnatus was unusual in his generation of negroes in the confederate states in being able to read and write hed always had a restless itch to know having that kind of itch was dangerous in a country where up until not long before he was born it had been not merely difficult but illegal for blacks to learn their letters what can i get for you dear elizabeth asked coming out of the kitchen how did it go today got plenty of hauling business cincinnatus answered folks was rightthe des moines runs high in the springtime even more so than the ohio does and boats get up here that cant any other time of year wont have so much to do in the summertime last summer when we got here i wondered for a while if we was goin to starve we made it elizabeths voice was warm with pride sure enough did cincinnatus agreed i want to see if we can get ourselves a little bit ahead of things while the rivers high always good to have some money socked away you dont have to spend right now amen elizabeth said as if hed been a preacher making a point in the pulpit amen achilles echoed he liked going to church of a sunday morning cincinnatus smiled at his son then he looked back to his wife what id like me right now is a bottle of beer i knew iowa was a dry state but i didnt reckon folks hered take it so serious down in kentucky folks always preached against the demon rum but that didnt stop em from drinkin whiskey didnt even hardly slow em down none people round these parts mean it most of em do uhhuh elizabeth nodded her eyes sparkledor maybe it was a trick of the sunbright electric bulb above her head she turned and went back into the kitchen her skirt swirled around her giving cincinnatus a glimpse of her trim ankles some of the white women in des moines were wearing skirts well above the anklescandalously short as far as he was concerned he would have something to say if elizabeth ever wanted to try that style she opened the icebox then came back into the living room in her hand was a tall glass of golden liquid with a creamy white head on her face a look of triumph cincinnatus stared at the beer whered you get that chinaman upstairs makes it elizabeth answered ill be he shook his head in wonder i didnt even know chinamen drank beer let alone made it he took the glass from elizabeth raised it to his mouth and cautiously sipped he smacked his lips pondering then nodded it aint great beer but its beer sure enough i know now elizabeths eyes definitely twinkled had me some before id pay the chinaman for it dont drink that all up nowwhy dont you bring it to the table with you beef stews just about ready spit jumped into cincinnatus mouth ill do that beef was cheap here and plentiful too compared to what things were like in kentucky he ate his fill without worrying about whether hed go broke on account of such lavish meals he still ate a lot of pork but now more because he liked it than because he couldnt afford anything better after supper while elizabeth washed dishes cincinnatus got out a reader and went to work with achilles the boy had known for some time the alphabet and the sounds the letters made up till just a couple of weeks before hed had troubletrouble often to the point of tearscombining the sounds of the letters into words cincinnatus who had learned to read a good many years later in life vividly remembered that himself now though achilles had the key ban he read can dan fan man pan ran tan bat cat fat hat mat pat rat sat den fen whats a fen pa dunno lets find out cincinnatus had a dictionary because of the catchascatchcan way hed become literate his vocabulary had holes he used the dictionary to fill them riffling through it now he answered a fen is like a swamp go on achilles youre doin swell hen men pen ten wen that one made the dictionary open again as dx achilles beamed i can read pa youre gettin there cincinnatus agreed well keep at it he figured achilles would have to work twice as hard at school to get half the respect he deserved that was what life handed you along with a black skin people would call achilles a damn nigger sure as the sun would come up tomorrow but nobody would call achilles a damn dumb nigger not if cincinnatus had anything to do with it i want to read stories like the ones you read to me achilles said youre gettin there cincinnatus said again now lets work on this a little while longer and then youll get to bed achilles liked learning to read any time faced with the choice between trying to read some more and going to bed he would have read till four in the morning had his father let him cincinnatus didnt let him because he wantedand neededto get some sleep himself achilles squawked but was soon breathing heavily when he did yield to sleep he yielded deeply and completely so did cincinnatus because he was very tired he slept through the alarm clock elizabeth had to shake him awake a couple of cups of coffee and some scrambled eggs got him moving he jammed a cloth cap onto his head kissed elizabeth and went downstairs to fire up the duryea he felt more affection for the truck than he ever had down in covington it had run very well since the overhaul hed given it before moving to iowa he wished hed overhauled it sooner it would have served him better in kentucky he climbed in and drove to the wharves along the des moines at the highwater season steamboats were tied up at almost all the piers some of the haulers who took their goods to merchants and warehouses were black like him most were white despite his color he had no trouble getting work the sheer volume of unloading had something to do with that but hed also established a reputation for dependability he hoped that would give him a boost when the river went down and jobs grew scarcer after hauling dry goods to several general stores a cargo of plates and bowls to a china shop and a truckful of reams of paper to the state capitol over on the east side of the des moines he came back to the wharves to eat his dinner a couple of other colored drivers joe sims and pete dunnett pulled their trucks up alongside of his within five minutes of each other they carried their dinner pails over to the bench where he was eating business is bully said sims a stocky very black man in his midforties heres hoping it lasts dunnett was thinner young and paler he might have had a quarter portion of white blood in his veins thats right he said he and sims both spoke with an accent cincinnatus found peculiar it had some of the rhythms of the black speech with which he was familiar but only some it was also heavily tinted by the sharp nasal almost braying speech of white iowans because the negroes of des moines were such a small minority the white sea around them diluted their dialect cincinnatus said sure enough would be good if it did aint nothin wrong with money nothin atall dunnett and joe sims looked at each other after a moment sims said first time we heard you talk cincinnatus we thought you were a dumb nigger you lay on that ain t stuff so thick we know better now but you still talk the way my greatgrandpa did i talk like i talk cant hardly help it cincinnatus said with a shrug in covington his accent had passed for a mild one among negroes pete dunnett added that fancy handle youve got didnt help either whats wrong with my name now cincinnatus really was peeved when i came up here and found out all the us niggers had names like white folks i reckoned that was like oatmeal without sugar or salt or butter or milk or nothin tvi rather have me a boring name than sound like i was named after a city dunnett retorted the citys named after me not the other way round cincinnatus said i mean the city and me both got named for the same fellow from back in ancient days still sounds funny joe sims said and whats your kids name achilles cincinnatus said he was a hero he paused a little while in thought then went on you niggers up here in the usa they let youall have last names they let you have plenty of stuff toodown in covington youalld be a couple of really rich niggers when it was the confederate states down there most of us hardly had nothin but our one name we had to pack everything we could into it sims and dunnett glanced at each other again weve had hard times too dunnett said he sounded a little defensive cincinnatus didnt answer dunnett had reason to sound defensive white men had patrolled the ohio to keep blacks from the confederate states out of the usa nobody had ever needed to patrol the ohio to keep blacks from the united states out of the csa blacks in the usa knew perfectly well the distance between the frying pan and the fire sam carsten would sooner not have had the new stripe on his sleeve that showed he was a petty officer second class he hadnt lost his ambitionfar from it but hed earned that stripe by doing a good job as head of his gun crew after willie moore got killed it had blood on it as far as he was concerned the uss remembrance steamed west across the atlantic toward boston harbor sam didnt have to worry about taking shellfire here he didnt have to worry about renegade confederate submersibles either what hed learned about the cs boat that had sunk the us destroyer after the war was over filled him with rage under that rage lay terror a rebel boat could have stalked his old battleship the uss dakota just as readily a deck hand jerked the prop on a wright fighting scout the twodeckers engine thundered to life the prop blurred into invisibility the remembrancers steam catapult hurled the fighting scout into the sky bully sam said softly launching aeroplanes had fascinated him even aboard the dakota the fascination had changed to urgency when landbased aeroplanes bombed his battleship off the argentine coast hed imagined air power on the sea then he lived it now and still found it aweinspiring behind him a dry voice spoke i wonder how long well be able to keep them in the air sam turned if commander grady had wanted to stick a kick me sign on him he stood close enough to do it what do you mean sir sam asked thinking he knew and hoping he was wrong how much longer will we be able to keep them in the air the gunnery officer repeated youre not stupid carsten you understand what i mean will the socialists put enough money into the navy to keep this ship operating right now your guess is as good as mine yes sir sam said dully his guess was that the socialists would shut down as much as they could except when the war dragged some into the navy socialists were thinly scattered aboard warships almost as thinly scattered as colored people in the usa he didnt know a great deal about what socialist politicians thought except that they didnt think much of the navy or the army he looked at commander grady grady had always been as proud of the remembrance as if hed designed her himself now looking from the flight deck to the conning tower his eyes were dull all but hopeless the eyes of a man who expected a loved one to die sighing he said it was a good idea anyhow it still is a good idea it sure as hell is sir carsten said hotly its a swell idea and anybody who cant see that is a damn fool lot of damn fools running around loose in the world grady said some of them wear fancy uniforms some of them wear expensive suits and get elected to congress or elected president those fools get to tell the ones in the fancy uniforms what to do and the ones in the fancy uniforms get to tell us what to do sams laugh was harsh as salt spray its the navy way he couldnt think of another officer to whom he would have said such a thing grady and he had been through a lot together damn it grady said in a low furious voice we proved what this ship can do we proved it but will we get any credit for it no way to tell about that sir carsten answered but i wouldnt bet anything i cared to lose on it neither would i grady said but i tell you this we did show what the remembrance can do congress may not be watching president upton goddamn sinclair may not be watching you can bet though the german high seas fleet was watching the royal navy was watching and if the japs werent watching too id be amazed plenty of countries are going to have squadrons of aeroplane carriers ten years from now i hope to god were one of them before sam could say anything to that grady wheeled and rapidly strode away carsten tried to figure out where hed be ten years down the line likeliest he supposed was chief petty officer in charge of a gun crew he could easily see himself turning into hiram kidde or willie moore hed just have to follow the path of least resistance if he wanted anything more hed have to work harder for it mustangs didnt grow on trees and if he aimed at becoming an officer hed have to get lucky too he wondered how much he really wanted that kind of luck what was good for him might turn out to be anything but good for other people he thought of moore again moore writhing on the floor with his belly torn open the steam catapult hissed like a million snakes hurling another fighting scout into the air the crew of the remembrance kept honing their skills they were at the moment the best in the world at what they did whether congress appreciated it or not they were also at the moment the only ones in the world who did what they did sam wondered how long that would last he remembered the german sailors in dublin harbor staring and staring at the aeroplane carrier kaiser bills boys built better aeroplanes than the usa did the wright twodeckers were albatros copies could the germans build better aeroplane carriers too one of the wright machines roared low over the flight deck had it shot up the deck sam would not have cared to be standing there on the other hand the flight deck bristled with machine guns and onepounders had that fighting scout been painted with the stars and bars instead of the us eagle in front of crossed swords it would have got a warm welcome it zoomed above the remembrance again this time even lower and upside down a couple of the sailors on deck saluted the pilot with upraised middle fingers sam didnt but he felt like it he hadnt had a whole lot to do with the pilots aboard the aeroplane carrier they were officers and pretty much kept to themselves but what he had seen made him wonder if their marbles had spilled out of their ears as they flew because they didnt seem to give two whoops in hell whether they lived or died staring after the fighting scout after it finally rolled back to right side up sam decided that made a certain amount of sense the rickety contraptions the pilots flew had a habit of falling out of the sky by themselves the pilots had to take them into harms way and had to land them on the rolling pitching deck of a warship you probably needed to be crazy to want to do any of that and if you werent crazy when you started doing it youd get that way after a while as if to prove the point the pilot of the other fighting scout dove out of the sky on the remembrance like a sparrowhawk swooping on a field mouse in an impossibly short time the aeroplane swelled from buzzing speck to roaring monster it seemed to be heading straight for sam he wanted to dig a hole in the deck dive in and then pull the planking and steel over himself an armored blanket to keep him safe and warm a couple of sailors started to run their comrades screamed curses at them he understood why but had to work to hold his own feet still at the last possible instant the wright twodecker pulled out of the dive sam couldnt help ducking he thought one wheel of the landing gear would clip him it wasnt quite so close as that but he did have to snatch at his cap to keep it from blowing off his head and perhaps into the sea had it gone into the drink the price of a new one would have come out of his pay the twodecker almost went into the drink too off to port of the remembrance carsten would have sworn its lowest point was lower than the aeroplane carriers deck the landing gear didnt quite touch the wavetops but a flying fish might have leaped into the cockpit then the wright started to gain altitude again much more slowly than it had shed it that bastards nuts somebody said shaken respect in his voice that bastards nuts almost got cut off him somebody else said which was also true and made everybody who heard it laugh to boot a fellow with brightcolored semaphore paddles strode out near the edge of the deck to guide the aeroplanes in to the controlled crash that constituted a landing aboard ship his wigwagged signals urged the pilot of the first fighting scout up a little to starboard up a little more sam had learned to read the wigwags just as hed picked up morse as a kid smoke spurted from the solid rubber tires as they slammed against the deck the hook under the fuselage caught a cable the aeroplane jerked to a halt watching it carsten understood why the fighting scouts had needed strengthening before they came aboard the remembrance as the pilot took off his goggles and climbed out of the aeroplane his face bore an enormous grin what was he thinking lived through it again probably sailors hauled the twodecker out of the way so the other fighting scout could land here he came chasing the aeroplane carrier from astern as before the semaphore man stepped out and signaled to the approaching flying machine sam wondered why he bothered that fellow had pulled out of his dive without help if he couldnt land the same way up the man with the paddles signaled and then up again more emphatically the bow of the remembrance slid down into a trough the stern rose sam kept his balance as automatically as he breathed so did the signalman he had the paddle raised urging more altitude when the aeroplane slammed into the carrier the pilot almost got it onto the ship that made things worse not better he still killed himself and debris from the aeroplane scythed along the deck cutting down the fellow with the semaphore paddles and half the crew waiting to take the aeroplane to the hydraulic lift and stow it belowdecks sam sprinted forward dodging blazing fuel and oil like a halfback dodging tacklers in the open field he skidded to a stop beside a sailor who was down and moaning and clutching his thigh blood was soaking his trouser leg and puddling on the deck under him he couldnt keep losing it that fast for long sam unhooked his belt yanked it off and doubled it around the mans leg above the wound for a tourniquet it hurts the sailor moaned christ it hurts hang on pal sam said more sailors came running across the deck some with stretchers sam waved to draw their eyes the sailor might live as for the pilot his head lay about ten feet away still wearing goggles carsten looked down at the planking yeah flyboys earned the right to be crazy xiv jake featherston liked riding the train when he rode the train he was getting somewhere he associated travel on foot with the long grinding retreat through pennsylvania and maryland and virginia then hed been going where the damnyankees made him go now he wasmostlyon his own the train rattled through the mississippi cotton country bound for new orleans featherston smiled to see negroes working in the fields their hoes rose and fell as they weeded the red and blue bandannas the women wore added splashes of color to the green green fields jake nodded to himself in his pullman car that was where negroes belonged the splendid car was where he belonged he hadnt known luxury till lately he figured he was entitled to a little after so long without he did wish he werent going to new orleans he brought a fist down on his knee even the leader of the freedom party couldnt get everything he wanted not yet amos mizell of the tin hats had strongly urged him to hold the partys national convention on the banks of the mississippi to show it was a party for all the confederate states willy knight who headed the redemption league said the same thing their arguments made sense especially since jake wanted to draw the league all the way into the freedom party he hadnt particularly wanted to hold a convention at all he knew and everybody else knew who the partys candidate would be but the notion of having him simply declare his candidacy and point a finger at a running mate had horrified everyone around him so here he was on his way to a convention on his way to new orleans he slammed his fist down again this time hard enough to make himself jump and curse well where the hell else could i go he demanded of the empty air around him if he brought the convention to the mississippi new orleans was the only logical choice little rock was the middle of nowhere going to dallas would have been asking for trouble from willy knight who wanted to run for vice president the redemption league was stronger than the party in texas chihuahua featherston laughed without humor the greasers down there would love me wouldnt they and so to prove the freedom partys national appeal hed had to bring the convention to the one confederate city least friendly to him and his message new orleans not only had rich niggers with their own high society it had a whole great raft of white men who didnt care the latter offended jake even more than the former he felt better when the train pulled into the station a company of men in white shirts and butternut trousers stood waiting for him on the platform some carried freedom party flags others the confederate battle flag with reversed colors that the party also used sarge they shouted when he left his car sarge sarge sarge good to be here jake lied now on to victory the freedom party stalwarts cheered lustily some of the other people on the platform new orleans natives by the look of them raised eyebrows and curled lips in gallic disdain at the raucous display featherston hardly noticed he was among his own again the dispossessed the rootless the angryand so back where he belonged when he got to the hotel he felt as if part of richmond had been transplanted to this alien soil he might have been back at party headquarters to judge by the deference he got that from party members was genuine that from the hotel staffboth white and blackprofessionally perfect whores he thought nothing but whores but like whores they made him feel good he spotted roger kimball across the gorgeously rococo lobby kimball spotted him too and hurried over he could have done without that good to see you sarge kimball said shaking his hand say are they going to try those fellows they arrested for burning down tom brearleys house brearley and his wife had burned too jake was wryly amused kimball hadnt mentioned that he answered reckon they are yeah lowering his voice he added dont reckon any jurys gonna convict em though thats how it looks from here anyway bully kimball said and then i wont keep you youve got to get settled in i reckon he drifted away that was a smoother performance than featherston had looked for from him thoughtfully jake rubbed his chin if kimball could be smooth as well as ferocious he might end up making himself very valuable indeed after unpacking jake walked the couple of blocks to the convention hall a huge marble wedding cake of a building that had gone up on esplanade just outside the french quarter a few years before the great war he was standing on the rostrum looking out over the great hall when amos mizell walked down the center aisle toward him willy knight came in a couple of minutes later before jake and mizell could do much more than say hello featherston was irked but only a little both men would have had spies in the hotel and maybe back at the train station too all the greetings were warier than they would have sounded to anyone who didnt know the men involved at last mizell said the tin hats will throw their weight behind you jake youre what this country needs this year no two ways about it suddenly featherston was awfully damn glad hed come to new orleans hed met mizell halfway and now the head of the veterans organization was coming through for him in a big way willy knight looked as if hed just bitten down hard on the sourest lemon ever picked hed been threatening that if jake didnt tap him for vice president hed run for the top spot himself on an independent redemption league ticket that would have hurt and hurt bad especially in the west he could still do it but if the tin hats were loudly backing the freedom party his bid would look like nothing but an exercise in spite now still sour he asked you think you have any real chance of winning featherston dont know for certain jake said easily the party would have a better shot if tr had won up in the usa everybody down here hates him just as much as he hates us those red bastards theyve got up there now are bending over backwards so far its hard to get people riled up at em the way they ought to be you ought to count your blessings jake mizell said if roosevelt had been president of the united states for longer than a couple of days after the news about your fellow down there in south carolina broke hed have had his head on a plateeither that or hed have blown richmond to hell and gone yeah i was lucky there featherston admitted knight sent him another hooded glance as if to say if i were a little luckier id be wearing your shoes now he was probably right it did him no good picked a running mate yet mizell asked casual as if wondering about what jake intended to have for supper maybe he was just idly curious the way he sounded and maybe jake would flap his arms and fly to the moon too yeah he answered and let it go at that it isnt me knights voice was flat uninflected no willy it isnt you jake looked him over and if you want to raise a stink go right ahead you can run your own little outfit do whatever you want would you sooner be a general in a little tinpot army or a colonel in a real one he waited he didnt know how hed answer that question himself knight glared at him but finally said ill stick he didnt add damn you not quite his eyes said it for him jake didnt care from that moment on he seemed to hold the world in his hands and turn it as he desired the conventionthe convention he hadnt wantedwent smooth as silk slick as petroleum jelly the platform called for ending reparations to the usa restoring a sound currency punishing the people whod botched the war putting negroes in their place and making the confederate states strong again by which jake meant rearming but he remained too leery of the united states to say so openly it passed by thunderous voice vote jake hoped it would grab lots of headlines the next day was his people made speeches praising him hed helped draft some of them his nomination went forward as smoothly as the confederate advance on philadelphia should have gone at the start of the great war no one elses name was raised he became the freedom partys choice on the first ballot he let it be known he wanted ferdinand koenig to run with him the freedom party secretary had backed him when he needed it most and deserved his reward that didnt go quite so smoothly as the first two days of the convention had willy knight let his name be placed in nomination and his followers made fervent speeches about balancing the ticket geographically having made their speeches they sat downand got steamrollered knight sent jake a note saying he hadnt known they would do it it might possibly have been true jake wouldnt have bet a postage stamp on it on the night after the convention nominated koenig featherston stood on the stage at the front of the smokefilled hall and stared out at the throng of delegates calling his name the hair at the nape of his neck tried to stand up three and a half years before hed climbed up on a streetcorner crate to take anthony dressers place because the founder of the freedom party wasnt up to speaking to even a couple of dozen people thousands waited for jakes words now millionshe hopedwould vote for him come november were on the way he shouted and the hall erupted in cheers he held up his hands silence fell instantly and completely god must have felt this way after he made the heavens and the earth were on the way jake repeated the freedom party is on the waywere on the way to richmond the confederate states are on the waytheyre on the way back and the white race is on the wayon the way to settling accounts with the coons who stabbed us in the back and kept us from winning the war and we should have won the war you all know that we should have won the war not even his upraised hands could keep the freedom party delegates from yelling their heads off he basked in the applause like a rosebush basking in the sun when he began to speak again the noise cut off the whigs say vote for them everythings fine nothings wrong nothings really changed a bit jakes guffaw was coarse as horsehair bet you a million dollars theyre wrong he pulled a banknote from his pocket crumpled it up and threw it away laughter erupted loud as the cheers had been jake went on the rad libs say everythings fine and all we need to do is cozy on up to the usa he looked out at the crowd youall want to cozy on up to the usa the roar of no almost knocked him off his feet and the socialistsour socialists not the fools in the united statessay everything will be fine and all we need to do is cozy on up to the niggers he paused then asked the question everyone waited for youall want to cozy on up to the niggers no wasnt a roar this time but a fierce and savage howl into it through it he said if wed have gassed ten or fifteen thousand of those nigger reds at the start of the war and during the war how many good clean honest white confederate soldiers would we have saved haifa million a million something like that and the ones who did die by god they wouldnt have died for nothing on account of wed have won but the dirty cowards in richmond the corrupt imbeciles in the war department didnt have the nerve to do it so the niggers rose up and they dragged us down but like i said before were on the way again this time nobody stops usnobody do you hear me not the congress not the jackasses in the war department not the niggers not the usa nobody nobody stops us now he suddenly realized he was dripping with sweat hed got the crowd all hot and sweaty too they were on their feet screaming he saw a sea of glittering eyes a sea of open mouths he had a hardon he didnt just want a woman he wanted the whole country and he thought he might have it once upon a time the town had been called berlin then when the great war broke out the canadians rechristened it empire not wanting it to keep the name of an enemys capital jonathan moss had flown over it then as the us army pounded it to pieces and eventually overran it during the long hard slog toward toronto now it was berlin again and now he was back a brandnew lawyer with a brandnew shingle specializing in occupation law he had himself a brandnew office too the canadians and british had defended empire as long as the last man who could shoot still had cartridges for his rifle by the time the americans forced their way into the town hardly one stone remained atop another the romans could only have dreamt of visiting such destruction on carthage all the buildings that stood in empire were new ones arthur ontario lay about thirty miles to the north jonathan moss told himself over and over that that wasnt why hed decided to set up his practice in berlin sometimes he even believed it after all he hadnt hopped into his bucephalus and driven up to arthur had he of course he hadnt that meant he didnt have laura secord on his mind didnt it it did at least some of the time but when days were slow he had too much time to sit in his brandnew office and think on days like that he welcomed visitors not so much for the sake of the business they might bring as for their distraction value and so now he was happy to set a cigarette in the brass ashtray on his desk and greet the skinny man in the faded shiny suit of prewar cut who came through the door and said mr moss is it thats right moss swivel chair squeaked as he rose from it he stuck out his hand very pleased to meet you mr my name is smith john smith the skinny man sighed save the question sir yes that really is my name i can prove it if i have to there are a lot of smiths and my father and his father were both johns so he sighed again its almost as much trouble as being named something like cyrus mudpuddle or i think it must be anyhow youre likely right mr smith said moss whod taken his share of ribbing about his name over the years why dont you sit down have a smoke if you care to and tell me what you think i can do for you he glanced at that shabby suit again no fee for the first consultation smith was hungrier than he thank you sir youre very kind smith sat then made a show of patting his pockets oh dear i seem to have left my cigarettes at home have one of mine moss extended the pack hed half expected something like this he lit a match for smith wondering whether hed ever see any money from the man if he undertook to represent him after the canadian had taken a couple of drags moss repeated what can i do for you for a moment he didnt know if hed get an answer john smith seemed entranced with pleasure at the tobacco smoke moss wondered how long hed gone without after a few seconds though smith seemed to recall he hadnt come into the office just to cadge a smoke he said i wish your assistance sir in helping me regain a piece of property taken from me without good reason very well a lot of moss business was of that sort he slid a pad toward himself and took a fountain pen from the middle drawer of his desk first the basics did you serve in the canadian army during the great war no sir smith said i am badly ruptured im afraid and was not fit for duty i have a doctors certificate good enough moss scribbled a note next obvious question have you taken the oath of loyalty to the occupation authorities yes i did thatdid it not long after the war ended as soon as i had the chance smith answered i am a peaceable man i would not tell you a falsehood and say i am glad your country won the waryou are an american i take it he waited for moss to nod then went on because i am a peaceable man all i can do is make the best of things as i find them thats sensible mr smith moss noted hed taken the oath all right i may be able to help you if youd answered no to either of those questions i couldnt possibly and neither could any lawyer some would take your money and tell you they could work miracles but theyd be lying i make no promises yet you understand but you do meet the minimum criteria for pursuing a claim nowwhat piece of property are we talking about smith coughed apologetically this one sir what moss stared this one sir john smith looked even more embarrassed before the war sir my house stood right abouthe pronounced it aboat as a canadian wouldhere instead of this fine big building where you have your office you want me to help you make me move out of my office moss had judged smith a man without any nerve now he revised his opinion if that wasnt gall julius caesar had never seen any with or without nerve smith remained a quiet apologetic fellow its not so much that i want to sir he said but this property wasisalmost the only thing i own ive not had an easy time of it since since the war maybe hed been on the point of saying something on the order of since you yankee robbers came up here but maybe not too maybe hed just stumbled over a word he seemed the type to do a good deal of that jonathan moss started to laugh he quickly held up a hand im not laughing at you mr smithreally im not he said but this is absurd and i dont think you can argue with me there i wouldnt think of it smith said and moss believed him the canadian got to his feet i am sorry to have troubled you dont go away moss sprang to his feet too quick as if hed been turning his fighting scout onto the tail of a sopwith pup i didnt say i wouldnt take your case let me see your documents mr smith and ill see what i can do for you really john smiths hangdog expression vanished to be replaced by astonishment but you work here its not like i own the building moss corrected himself its not like i think i own the building he wondered what he would have done in his landlords shoes probably thrown smith out so hard he bounced but the canuck could always have found another lawyer plenty of eager young hotshots had come up from the united states and some canadians were also jumping into occupation law ii dont know what to say smith told him thank you very much sir he coughed and looked embarrassed again im also afraid ill have some trouble paying you one look at his suit had warned moss that was likely the way smith had forgotten his cigarettes warned him it was as near certain as made no difference he shrugged what the hell mr smith he saidnot proper legal language but at the moment he didnt care well see what you can afford if you cant afford much ill do it for a lark i want to see the look on my landlords face when i serve him the papers oh thats good thats very good for a moment smith who had to be close to fifty looked about fifteen what they call a practical joke isnt it isnt it just moss leaned forward in his chair now lets find out exactly how practical a joke it is show me these documents i havent got everything with me im afraid smith said moss exhaled through his nose he hadnt been practicing long but hed already seen that unprepared clients were the bane of an attorneys life blushing smith went on i left most of the papers i still have back at my flat because i didnt really believe youd be interested in helping me show me what youve moss stopped the papers you still have he asked sharply what happened to the ones you used to have john smith showed a touch of temper for the first time what do you think happened to them he snapped you yanks thats what i stayed in empirein berlintill the shells started falling when i got out it was with the clothes on my back and one carpetbag you try stuffing your whole life in one carpetbag sir and see how well you do before coming to berlin moss hadnt thought much about how civilians on the losing side felt about the war he was getting an education in quiet bitterness all right he said what have you got smith reached into his breast pocket and pulled out the two documents hed already mentioned hed have needed the doctors certificate as he fled the advancing americans without it the canadians would have stuck a rifle in his hands and sent him to the trenches rupture or no rupture they might have done that anyhow but he had the paper that said they wouldnt have he also had the paper that said hed made his formal peace with the us occupiers no canadian could work without that one and he had a photograph of himselfa younger version of himselfstanding in front of a clapboard house that bore the same address as this big brick office building a plain woman in a black dress and a frumpy hat stood beside him your wife moss asked thats right smith paused then went on some yank pilot shot us up as we were leavingshot up the road i mean for the sport of it he killed my jane and left me without a scratchand ever since ive wished it had been the other way round moss didnt know what to say to that hed shot up refugee columns it was part of war it disrupted the enemy he hadnt thought much about the consequences of what he did he resolutely tried not to think about those consequences now besides this photograph he managed at last what sort of title can you show to this property have you got a deed have you got bank records havent got a deed smith said used to be bank records in the bank isnt any bank any more i hear tell yank soldiers blew the vault open and stole everything insideeverything they wanted anyway that wouldnt have surprised moss among other things armies were enormous robber bands he said you do understand lacking the proper papers will make your claim much harder to establish i should hope i understand that john smith said if id reckoned it would be easy id have tried it myself all right moss said go through your effects whatever you can bring thats evidence you own this land i want to see it no matter how unlikely you think it is i want to see it if you know people who can testify they know you owned this land i want to hear from them i wont kid you though weve got our work cut out for us ill do my best smith promised when lucien galtier saw the greengray motorcar coming down the road from riviereduloup toward his farmhouse he took it for granted at first he had seen an infinitude of greengray motorcars and trucks coming down that road and another infinitude going up it then after hed already started turning away he spun back and stared at the ford with eyes that wanted to narrow in suspicion and widen in surprise at the same time he had not seen a greengray motorcar in some time the us army painted its motorcars that color but the us army had not occupied the republic of quebec since the end of the warwell since a little after the end of the war the ford pulled off the road and parked beside the farmhouse as leonard odoulls automobile more commonly did these days lucien sighed and walked toward it i might have known he muttered under his breath a man may think he has escaped troubles but troubles never escape a man two men got out of the motorcar galtier recognized bishop pascal first more by his vestments than by his own tubby form his companion the driver was whipcord lean and sure enough wore us army uniform seeing lucien approach he waved bonjour he called in excellent parisian french it is good to see you once more m galtier bonjour as galtier drew near he saw that jedediah quigley wore eagles on his shoulders not oak leaves of either gold or silver hed been a major when galtier first made his acquaintance nowbonjour colonel quigley you have come up in the world since i saw you last he is the military liaison officer between the united states and the republic of quebec bishop pascal said hearing the bishop speak ahead of colonel quigley surprised lucien not at all pascal had always found the sound of his own voice sweeter and more intoxicating than communion wine an important man indeed galtier said and how and why does a simple farmer deserve a visit from not only the military liaison officer between the united states and the republic of quebec but also the illustrious and holy bishop of riviereduloup bishop pascal had no ear for irony colonel quigley did one of his eyebrows quirked upward it is a matter concerning the hospital he said what about the hospital galtier demanded suddenly apprehensive he saw marie peering out the kitchen window no doubt wondering what was going on hed been about to ask quigley and bishop pascal to come into the farmhouse so she could serve them teaor something strongerand some of the cinnamon buns shed baked the day before now he was not nearly so sure they were welcome in his house the hospital of course is built on land taken from your patrimony bishop pascal said the plump bishop always looked out for himself first he had embraced the americans with indecent haste galtier would not have cared to turn his back on him for an instant but he did understand the way a quebecois farmers mind worked colonel quigley despite having been in quebec since didnt and weve been paying you a good rent for it too he said gruffly it is my land galtier replied with dignity andhis own eyebrow rosefor some long stretch of time you paid not a cent of rent you simply took it because you had men with guns we suspected your loyalty quigley was blunt in a way no quebecois would have been once we didnt any more we paid what we owed you if you steal land from a mans patrimony you are liable to make him disloyal galtier said indeed you are fortunate this did not happen with me he still marveled that it hadnt hed been disloyal after the americans invaded quebec he clearly remembered that but nicole had gone to work at the hospital she and leonard odoull had fallen in love quigley had agreed to pay rent and the americans had not treated him so badly after all hed thrived since they came quebec had prospered too and he had a halfamerican grandson sure enough he was at peace with americans now bishop pascal said naturally my son you can comprehend that it is awkward for this fine hospital to rest on land where if the owner so desires he may at a whim order it to leave so he might seed the soil with lettuces lettuces galtier said certainly not that is wheat land and wheat land of the first quality i might add jedediah quigley seemed to need both hands to hold on to his patience whatever you raised on it is beside the point he said the point is the republic of quebec wants to buy that land from you so no troubles of the sort bishop pascal is talking about can arise im involved here because i am the one who took that land from you in the first place you wish me to sell part of my patrimony galtier knew he sounded as if colonel quigley had asked him to sell one of his children he didnt care that was how he felteven if at times he wouldnt have minded getting rid of georges money can be part of your patrimony too quigley said which only proved he did not completely understand the folk of quebec it would be an act of christian charity for the sake of the people of riviereduloup and the surrounding countryside bishop pascal said and unlike most acts of charity my son it would not only be good for your soul but would bring money into your pocket rather than having it flow out and not just money colonel quigley added you know the hospital makes its own electricity as part of the bargain we would have the hospital make electricity for this farm as well they were eager to make a deal they were showing how eager they were against a canny peasant like lucien galtier they were begging to be skinned he knew now he would sell the land marie would skin him if he let the chance to get electricity escape but he intended to make the bishop and the colonel sweat first it is my patrimony he growled one day my grandsons grandson will grow wheat on that land colonel quigley rolled his eyes damn stubborn frog he muttered under his breath in english galtier smiled he didnt think he was supposed to hear or to understand if he did too bad he thought he was a damn stubborn frog and they would have to make the best of it my son have you not seen in these past few years how things can change and change unexpectedly and quickly bishop pascal asked would you not like to see this change be for the better by better your grace you mean doing as you wish galtier did not want to lose the chance he had here gruffly grudgingly he said very well let us speak of this further since you insist come inside we may as well sit down when he brought them into the farmhouse marie fussed over them as hed known she would once she had them settled with tea and buns she asked how is it that we have such distinguished visitors before either visitor could speak lucien kept right on growling they seek to purchase some of our patrimony along with money they even offer electricity he curled his lip as if to show how little he cared for electricity they do not comprehend the importance of a mans patrimony mme galtier i am sure you can make your husband see reason here colonel quigley said i leave these matters to him he is the man after all marie said primly a single flashing glance toward galtier sent quite another message but neither quigley nor bishop pascal saw it after that glance marie retreated to the kitchen in tones of gentle reason bishop pascal said you have not even inquired what the republic and the united stateswe will share the expense our two countriesmight pay for your parcel of land you havent said what you want for it either quigley said i have not said i would take any amount of money for it galtier replied but if you must you may name a price quigley had invited him to set his own price when hed started getting rent for the land on which the hospital stood hed named the highest price he dared and quigley had paid without a blink lucien knew he could have gone higher but not how much this time if quigley mentioned any sum less than five hundred dollars maybe he really wouldnt sell the piece of property the united states are prepared to pay you one thousand dollars for that tract m galtier colonel quigley said and the republic of quebec will add one thousand dollars to that sum bishop pascal put in galtiers ears rang two thousand dollars and electricity you are not serious he said meaning he could not believe they would pay so much thanks to his bold front bishop pascal and quigley thought he meant they werent offering enough the american looked sour the bishop piously resigned colonel quigley said oh very well then fifteen hundred from us another fifteen hundred from the republic and not a dime more three thousand dollars lucien could buy a motorcar he could buy a tractor he would be a man to reckon with for miles around he smiled at his guests two thousand dollars from the united states another two from the republic and not a dime less colonel quigley and bishop pascal both looked alarmed galtier felt alarmedhad he pushed it too far the bishop and quigley put their heads together after a couple of minutes bishop pascal said in the interest of concord we will split the difference with youone thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars from quebec and a like amount from the united states is it agreeable to you and electricity galtier demanded and electricity colonel quigley said i told you that beforehand it is better to have everything certain than to leave anything in doubt galtier sighed with reluctance he did not feel very well let it be as you say for one thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars from each of your governmentsand electricityi will sell this land but only mind you in the interest of concord as the holy bishop says god will surely bless you my son bishop pascal said beaming do you think so lucien said interestedly that would be good too bishop pascal didnt know what to make of that he scratched his head colonel quigley knew exactly what to make of it he looked even more sour than he had while they were dickering why should he care galtier thought it isn t his money however sour quigley looked the bargain was sealed the money would be galtierssoon he hoped edna semphroch came back into the coffeehouse nellie jacobs gave her daughter an unhappy look even though midafternoon business was slow truth to tell business had never got back to what it was during the war when confederate officers from the force occupying washington had kept the place hopping morning noon and night nellie didnt miss the rebs not even a little bit but she did miss their cash took you long enough didnt it nellie said sourly i reckon i could have looked at every skirt between here and st louis in the stretch of time youve been gone and you didnt even buy anything cant you make up your mind people who joked about womens indecision had never met nellie nope didnt buy anything edna agreed she eyed her mother with an odd mix of amusement and apprehension didnt even go looking at skirts as a matter of fact nellie had no fancy education she was most ways shrewd rather than really clever but when edna said something like that her mother didnt need a road map to figure out what shed say next youve been sneaking around behind my back nellie said and could have sounded no more outraged if shed been reading a philandering husband the riot act she would have had an easier time accepting a philandering husband men got it where they could that was parttoo large a part as far as she was concernedof how they were made women though shed known for a long time that edna burned hot her daughter had seemed calmer the past couple of years so nellie had dared hope shed got it out of her system no such luck evidently ive been trying to have a life ma edna said god knows you dont make it easy for a girl but the unbearably smug look on her face said shed had her desire fulfilledand had something else filled full too more than likely you little hussy nellie hissed she wished clara who was taking a nap upstairs would pick that moment to wake up otherwise shed be locked in a fight with her older daughter of the sort theyd had during the war the sort they hadnt had since nellie married hal jacobs again no such luck edna tossed her head hussy huh takes one to know one i guess had nellie had a knife in her hand she might have used it fortunately shed been washing cups and saucers edna ignored her furious squawk edna seemed inclined to ignore just about everything she went on but none of that matters anyhow he asked me to marry him today did he think about asking you to get an abortion instead wounded nellie wanted to hit back any way she could her daughter shook her head i aint in a family way ma and i ought to know too i felt so lousy last week she laughed turned out you were the one who ended up in a family way i still think thats the funniest thing in the whole wide world if shed had to find out for sure she wasnt pregnant shed been doing things that left doubt in her mind at least i was married nellie said and im going to be edna said whether you like it or not im going to be i aint getting any younger you know im sick and tired of you watching me the way teddy roosevelt watched the damn rebs edna wasn t getting any younger nellie realized she was closer to thirty than twenty as nellie was closer to fifty than forty even better than three years of marriage to hal jacobs hadnt come close to making nellie understand why a woman would marry for the sake of bedroom pleasures for her bedroom pleasures were at most rare accidents that brought as much embarrassment as release but edna wasnt like that however much nellie wished her daughter were who is this fellow after nellie asked the question she realized it should have been the first one out of her mouth her daughter seemed surprised shed asked it at all in less snippy tones than shed been using edna answered his name is grimes ma merle grimes hes right my age and hes a clerk for the reconstruction authority if hes right your age how come he hasnt got a wife already nellie asked wondering if in fact he had one edna didnt know about but edna said he had one but she died of the spanish influenza a couplethree years ago he showed me a snapshot once i asked him to she looked a little like me i think only her hair was darker that took some of the wind out of nellies sails when she asked what did you tell him about lieutenant kincaid she didnt sound mean at all i ve told him i was engaged during the war but my fiance got killed edna said i didnt tell merle he was a reb and ill thank you not to neither all right nellie said and edna looked surprised nellie guessed merle grimes would eventually find out and there would be trouble on account of it too many people knew about the late nicholas h kincaid for the secret to keep his death at what would have been ednas wedding had even made the newspapers though a clerk for the us government wouldnt have been in washington then bill reach and me we can keep a secret nellie thought if anybody else knew but no one else did not edna not hal no one no one ever would hes a nice man ma edna said hes a good man youll like him when you meet him swear to god you will if he was such a nice man if he was such a good man what was he doing sticking it into edna before he put a ring on her finger nellie started to ask that very question but caught herself for one thing it would make edna mad for another this grimes had offered to put a ring on her finger nellie found a different question to ask how did you meet him edna giggled the first couple times were right here in the coffeehouse i dont reckon youd recall himwhich was certainly truebut he was here all right he doesnt live too far away we ran into each other at the greengrocers one time and then again a week later after that one thing sort of led to another ill bet it did nellie thought but regardless of whether she thought edna was a fool she couldnt deny edna was also a grown woman all right nellie said again if he wants to marry you if you want to marry him the only thing i can say is i hope you dont end up sorry on account of it i dont think we will ma edna said a few years before shed been unshakably certain she and confederate lieutenant kincaid would live happily ever after maybe she really was growing up as well as growneven if she did have more trouble keeping her legs together than she should have edna was thinking about such things too but in a different way for she asked wouldnt you like to have a little grandbaby with clara around it feels like ive already got one nellie said if you had a baby the biggest difference would be that i wouldnt have to keep an eye on the kid every single second of the day and night i hope youll be happy edna i wish you didnt think you had to sneak around to meet somebody and to see him edna didnt answer that which was probably just as well nellie had done everything but shove her daughter into a chastity belt to keep her from meeting and seeing anybody nellie had been surewas still sureshed done the right thing but edna cl finally managed to get around her now she had to make the best of it her husband was very little help high time she gets married if that is what she wants hal said if she is unhappy afterwards she will have no one to blame but herself but i hope and pray she will not be unhappy so do i nellie said if she is though i bet she blames me we will see what we will see when we meet the young man hal said he may turn out to be very nice nellie was inclined to doubt that on general principleshardly any young men in her estimation were very niceand on specificshad this merle grimes been very nice he wouldnt have yanked ednas drawers down till after they were married and not too often then either by that standard hal jacobs was very nice after ednas announcement nellie didnt want to let her leave the coffeehouse for any reason whatever with edna a woman grown that wasnt easy it was in fact impossible and one day about a week after ednas bombshell she did go out when she came back she came back arm in arm with a man ma she said proudly this heres my intended merle this is my mother shes nellie jacobs now like i told you my pas been dead a long time im very pleased to meet you at last mrs jacobs grimes said pleased to meet you too nellie said grudgingly shed intended to limit herself to a simple hello but grimes wasnt what shed expected for one thing he walked with a cane and wore the ribbon for the purple heart in a buttonhole for another he didnt look like a practiced seducer he seemed serious and quiet his long rather horsy face and goldframed spectacles might have belonged to a lawyer not a clerk nellie knew that didnt necessarily prove anything some of the men she recalled from her own sordid past had seemed ordinary enough on the outside but she didnt hate grimes on sight as shed thought she would he said i think im the luckiest man in the world edna may have told you maam i lost my wife to the influenza i never thought id fall in love with another woman again till i met your daughter she showed me i was wrong and im ever so glad she did edna looked as if she would have lain down on the floor for him then and there if nellie hadnt been in the coffeehouse nellie did her best to hide her disgust grimes had asked edna to marry him he hadnt got her in a family way either as ednas father had before he married nellie where are your people from mr grimes nellie asked what do they do i was born in new rumley ohio mrs jacobs grimes answered the same town that saw the birth of the great general custer my father runs the weekly newspaper there the new rumley courier his father ran it before him i reckon my brother caleb take it on when the time comes why arent you still back there yourself what nellie meant was if you were still back there you wouldn t be rumpling my daughters clothes merle grimes could hardly have missed that but it didnt faze him he said i wanted steady work the newspaper business is a lot of things but its not steady you go to work for the us government you know youve got a paycheck for the rest of your days i wont get rich but i wont go hungry either nellie didnt know what sort of answer shed thought she would get but that wasnt it you seem a steady enough young fellow she said an admission she hadnt looked to make i try to be grimes saidsteadily isnt he the bulliest thing in the whole wide world ma edna said she was thinking with her cunt a phrase that hadnt come to nellies mind since her days in the demimonde but merle grimes did look to be a much better bargain than nellie had expected he may do she said he just may do engine roaring the barrel bounded across the kansas prairie north of fort leavenworth colonel irving morrell stood head and shoulders out of the turret so he could take in as much of the battlefield as possible the test model easily outran and outmaneuvered the great war machines against which it was pitted morrell ducked down into the turret and bawled a command to the driver in the forward compartment halt and the driver halted and it was not divine intervention with the engine separated from the barrels crew by a steel bulkhead a man could hear a shouted order in a great war barrel one man could not hear another who was screaming into his ear at morrells order the gunner traversed the turret till the cannon bore on the barrel he had chosen the oldstyle machines were trying to bring their guns to bear on him too but they had to point themselves in the right direction a far slower and clumsier process than turning the turret fire morrell yelled the turretmounted cannon roared a shell casing leaped from the breech as flame spurted from the muzzle it was only a training round with no projectile but it made almost as much noise as the real thing and getting used to the hellish racket of the battlefield was not the least important part of training the loader passed a new shell to the gunner who slammed it home an umpire raised a red flag and ordered the barrel at which morrell had fired out of the exercise morrell laughed this was the fifth or sixth lumbering brute to which hed put paid this afternoon the great war barrels hadnt come close to hurting him had it been a prizefight the referee would have stopped it but in the ring or on the battlefield he who stood still asked to get tagged morrell ducked down again and shouted go go hard lets see how many of them we can wreck before they make us call it a day he laughed this was as close to real combat as he could come he might have enjoyed going up to canada with a few companies of barrels but he knew general custer didnt really need his services the canucks had been pretty quiet lately the confederate states were still licking their wounds too so he would pretend as hed pretended before the great war and have a dandy time doing it too the barrel up ahead had the name peaches painted on its armored flanks that made morrell laugh too since the earliest days of barrels men had named them for girlfriends and wives and other pretty women peaches belonged to lieutenant jenkins morrell could see him standing up in the cupola he saw morrell too and sent him a gesture no junior officer should ever have aimed at his superior morrell laughed again jenkins tried to keep him off by opening up with his rear and starboard machine guns they fired blanks too not only was that cheaper but live ammunition would have torn through the thin steel of the test models superstructure this time morrells chuckle had a predatory ring it wouldnt do jenkins any good this machine was assumed to be armored against such nuisances but an umpire raised a flag and pointed at morrell morrell started to shout a hot protestsometimes the umpires forgot they were supposed to pretend his barrel was properly armored but then he realized the officer was pointing not at the barrel but at himself he could not argue about that his own body was vulnerable to machinegun fire even if that of the barrel was supposed not to be it was in fact a nice test of his crew he bent down into the turret one last time im dead he said youre on your own ill try not to bleed on you he started to tell them to nail jenkins barrel but decided hed used up enough dying words already the men made him proud his gunner a broadshouldered sergeant named michael pound said if youre dead sir get the hell out of the way so i can see what im doing as soon as morrell moved pound peered out of the turret and then started giving orders with authority a general might have envied they were good orders too sensible orders maybe he couldnt have commanded an entire brigade of barrels but he sounded as if he could and he went straight after the barrel that had killed his commander morrell knew he couldnt have done a better job himself in short order pound shelled jenkins machine from the side fire to which its main armament could not respond an umpire soon had to raise a flag signaling the great war barrel destroyed bully morrell shouted and smacked pound on his broad back how did you learn to command so well sir ive been listening to you all along his gunner answered and keeping an eye on you too i copied what youd do and what youd say at least you didnt copy my accent morrell said pound laughed his voice had a northern twang to it that made him sound almost like a canadian morrell went on its still your barrel sergeant what are you going to do next sergeant pound went barrel hunting as ferociously as morrell could have wanted when the umpires finally whistled the exercise to a halt one of them approached the test model colonel you were supposed to have been killed he said in the fussily precise tones that failed to endear umpires to ordinary soldiers captain on my word of honor i did and said nothing at all to fight this barrel after your colleague signaled that id been hit morrell answered he climbed out onto the top of the turret then called down into it sergeant pound stand up and take a bow pound did stand up when he saw the captain with the umpires armband he came to attention and saluted as if doing him a favor he didnt deserve the captain returned the salute then he gave morrell a fishy stare i have a great deal of trouble believing what you just told me colonel he said that was the wrong tack to take captain if you are suggesting that i would lie to you on my word of honor i have a suggestion for you in return morrell said quietly if you like we can meet in some private place and discuss the matter man to man i am i assure you at your service us army officers hadnt dueled since before the war of secession morrell didnt really have pistols at sunrise in mind but he would have taken a good deal of pleasure in whaling the stuffing out of the officious captain he let that show too as hed expected the captain wilted sir i think you may have misunderstood me he said looking as if he wished he could sink into the churnedup prairie i hope i did morrell said i also hope sergeant pounds outstanding achievement will be prominently featured in your reports of the action he deserves that and i want to see him get it he shall have it the umpire said you may examine the report as closely as you like he wasnt altogether a fool not if he realized morrell would be reading that report to make sure he kept his promise he still came too close to being a perfect fool to make morrell happy pound said thank you very much sir as morrell climbed down into the turret once more dont thank me morrell said youre the one who earned it and now lets take this beast back to the barn we keep showing them and showing them that we can run rings around every other barrel in the united states if that wont make them build more like this one i dont know what will odds were nothing would make the socialists build new improved barrels the political fight back in philadelphia at the moment had to do with oldage pensions not the war department morrell was convinced hed have a better chance of living to collect an oldage pension if the army got better barrels but he had no friends in high places not in president sinclairs administration after the barrel returned to the shed that sheltered it from the elementsand at whose expense the quartermasters had grumbledmorrell climbed out and headed for the bachelor officer quarters then he stopped did a smart aboutface and went off in the other direction as he went he shook his head and laughed at himself hed been married only a little more than a month and the habits hed acquired over several years died hard the cottage toward which he did go resembled nothing so much as the company housing that went up around some factories it was small and square and looked like the ones all around it it was also the first time irving morrell had had more than a room to himself since joining the army more than half a lifetime before agnes hillno agnes morrell the habit of thinking of her by her former name died hard tooopened the door when he was still coming up the walk how did it go today she asked he kissed her before waggling his hand and answering soso we blew a bunch of great war barrels to smithereens the way we always do but i got shot in the middle of the exercise to his surprise agnes looked stricken she needed a few seconds to realize what he meant even when she did her laugh came shaky an umpire decided you got shot she said sounding as if she needed to reassure herself morrell nodded thats right see no blood he did a neat pirouette when he faced agnes again she still wasnt smiling now he had to pause to figure out why when he did he felt stupid not a feeling he was used to her first husband had died in combat was it any wonder she didnt find cracks about getting shot very funny contritely morrell said im sorry dear im fine i really am youd better be agnes voice was fierce and now come on suppers just about ready ive got a beef tongue in the pot the way you like itwith potatoes and onions and carrots you can spend the rest of the night letting out my trousers the way you feed me morrell said agnes laughed at that with real amusement however much morrell ateand he was a good trenchermanhe remained skinny as a lath after supper morrell stayed in the kitchen while his wife washed dishes he enjoyed her company they chatted while she worked and then while she read a novel and he waded through reports and then they went to bed though hed hardly been a virgin before saying i do morrells occasional couplings with easy women had not prepared him for the pleasures of the marriage bed every time he and his wife made love it was as if they were getting reacquainted and at the same time learning things about each other they hadnt known before and might have been a long time finding out any other way i love you he said afterwards taking his weight on elbows and knees while they lay still joined i love you too agnes answered raising up a little to kiss him on the cheek and i lovethis and i would love you to get off me so i can get up and go to the bathroom if thats all right i think so he said agnes laughed and poked him in the ribs when she came back to bed he was nearly asleep agnes laughed again on a different note she put on her nightgown and lay down beside him he heard her breathing slow toward the rhythms of sleep too feeling vaguely triumphant at staying awake long enough to notice that he drifted off anne colleton had always fancied that she had a bit of the artist in her back before the war shed designed and arranged the exhibition of modern art shed put on at the marshlands mansion everyone had praised the way the exhibit was laid out then the world went into the fire and people stopped caring about modern art now anne was working with different materials this freedom party rally in columbia would be one of the biggest in south carolina she was bound and determined it would also be the best shed done her best to get permission to hold the rally on the grounds of the state house but her best hadnt been good enough the governor was a staunch whig and not about to yield the seat of government even for a moment to jake featherstons upstarts shed hoped for better without really expecting it seaboard park would do well enough neither the governor nor the mayor nor the chief of police could ban the rally altogether though they would have loved to but the confederate constitution guaranteed that citizens might peaceably assemble to petition for redress of grievances the freedom party wasnt always perfectly peaceable but it came close enough to make refusal to issue a permit a political disaster tom colleton touched annes arm well sis ive got to hand it to you this is going to be one devil of a bash nice of you to decide to come up from st matthews and watch it anne replied coolly i didnt expect you to bother its my country tom said if you remember i laid my life on the line for it i want to see what you and that maniac featherston have in mind for it hes not a maniac anne did her best to hold down the anger in her voice i dont deal with maniacsexcept the ones im related to heh her brother said but then he surprised her by nodding i suppose youre rightfeatherstons not a maniac he knows what he wants and he knows how to go after it you ask me though that makes him more dangerous not less anne wondered and worried about the same thing herself even so she said when he does win whether its this year or not hell set the confederate states to rights and hell remember who helped him get to the top tom started to say something she shook her head cant talk now the shows about to start gasolinepowered generators came to life searchlights began to glow all around seaboard park their beams shot straight up into the air making the park seem as if it were surrounded by colonnades of bright pale light anne had come up with that effect herself she was proud of it churches wished they made people feel the awe those glowing shafts inspired more electric lights came on inside the park tom caught his breath they showed the whole place packed with people most of the crowd consisted of the ordinary working people of columbia in their overalls and dungarees and cloth caps and straw hats with a sprinkling of men in black jackets and cravats doctors and lawyers and businessmen come to hear what the new man in the land had to say at the front though near the stage a team of carpenters had spent the day running up stood neat militarylooking ranks of young men in white shirts and butternut trousers many of them wore tin hats if the whigs and the radical liberals tried imitating freedom party tactics and assailing the rally the protection squads would make them regret it the foremost rows of party stalwarts carried flagssome confederate banners some cs battle flags with colors reversed some white banners blazoned with the red word freedom the tall backdrop for the flagdraped stage was white too with freedom spelled out on it in crimson letters twice as tall as a man you dont need to worry about investing money tom said you could make billions designing sets for minstrel shows and vaudeville tours christ you might make millions even if confederate dollars were really worth anything thank you tom anne colleton said she wasnt altogether sure whether he offered praise or blame but took it for the former lookhere comes featherston her own vantage point was off to the right beyond the edge of the crowd so she could see farther into the left wing than any of the regular audience she tensed if those spotlight men have fallen asleep on the job god damn them theyll never work in this state again but they hadnt as soon as jake advanced far enough to be visible to the crowd twin spotlight beams speared him one of the freedom party bigwigs from columbia rushed to the microphone and cried lets hear it for the next president of the confederate states jaaake featherstonl freeatom freeatom freeatom the rhythmic cry started among the stalwarts in white and butternut at first it had to compete with the unorganized cheers and clapping and the scattered boos from the larger crowd behind them but the stalwarts kept right on as theyd been trained to do and little by little the rest of the crowd took up the chant till the very earth of seaboard park seemed to cry out freecom freeatom freecom the twosyllable beat thudded through anne shed orchestrated this entire performance thanks to her jake featherston stood behind the microphone his hands raised soaking up the adulation of the crowd knowing what she knew she should have been immune to what stirred the thousands of fools out there but to her own amazement and rather to her dismay she found she wasnt she wanted to join the chant to lose herself in it the excitement that built in her was hot and fierce almost sexual she fought it down the farmers and factory hands out there didnt try they didnt even know they might try theyd come to be stirred to be roused the ceremony had started that work jake featherston would finish it he dropped his hands instantly the freedom party faithful in white and butternut stopped chanting the cries of freedom went on for another few seconds then the people in the ordinary partmuch the bigger partof the crowd got the idea too a little raggedly the chant ended jake leaned forward toward the microphone anne discovered she too was leaning forward toward him angrily she straightened god damn him she muttered under her breath tom gave her a curious look she didnt explain she didnt want to admit even to herself let alone to anyone else that jake featherston could get her going like that columbia jake said i want you all to know im gladim proudto set foot in the capital of the first state of the confederacy he talked in commonplaces his voice was harsh his accent none too pleasing somehow none of that mattered when he spoke thousands upon thousands of people hung on his every word anne was one of them she knew she was doing it but couldnt help herself featherston was formidable in a small setting in front of a crowd he was much more than merely formidable through cheers he repeated yes sir im proud to set foot in the capital of the first state of the confederacybecause i know south carolina is going to help me going to help the freedom party give the confederate states back to the people who started this country in the first place the honest hardworking white men and women who make the csa go and dont get a dimes worth of credit for it yall remember dimes right thatd be a couple million dollars worth of credit nowadays i reckon the crowd laughed and cheered hes full of crap tom said the people who started this country were planters and lawyers just about top to bottom everybody knows that everybody whos had a good education knows that anne said how many of those folks out there do you figure went to college before tom could answer she shook her head never mind now i want to hear what hes going to say now i know the whigs are running wade hampton y and i know hes from right here in south carolina featherston went on i reckon some of you are thinking of voting for him on account of hes from here you can do that if you want to no doubt about it but ill tell you something else friends i thought this here was an election for president not for king his majesty wade hampton the fifth he stretched out the name and the number that went with it then shook his head in wellmimed disbelief good lord folks if we vote him in well be right up there with the englishmen and george v he is good tom said grudgingly as the crowd exploded into more laughter anne nodded she was leaning forward again now hampton v means well i dont doubt it for a minute jake said the whigs meant well when woodrow wilson got us into the war too and they meant well when a war department full of thirds and fourths and fifths fought it for us too and youd best believe they meant well when they stuck their heads in the sand instead of noticing the niggers were going to stab us in the back if you like the way the war turned out if you like paying ten million dollars for breakfastthis week itll be more next wednesdaygo right ahead and vote for wade hampton v youll get six more years of what weve been having or if you want a real change you can vote for mr layne the radical liberalsll give you change all right ill be switched if they wont theyll take us back into united states is what theyll do ainsworth layne went to harvard folksharvard can you believe it its true believe it or not and the rad libs want him to be president of the csa im sorry friends but ive seen enough damnyankees come down on us already i dont need any homegrown ones thank you kindly that drew more laughter and applause than his attack on wade hampton had done the radical liberals though neither very radical nor very liberal had always been weak in hardline south carolina were hampton not a native son anne would have thought jake featherston the likely winner here even with things as they were she thought he had a decent chance to take the state featherston went on the whigs and the rad libs both say we have to learn from the war to take what the yankees dish out on account of were not strong enough to do anything else what i say is we have to learn from the war all right we have to learn that when we hit the united states we have to hit em hard and we have to keep on hitting em till they fall down theyve stolen big chunks of whats ours i give you my word friendsone fine day its going to be ours again the crowd exploded anne caught herself shouting at the top of her lungs she thirsted for revenge against the usa she glanced over toward her brother tom was shouting too his fist pumping the air whatever he thought of jake featherston and the freedom party he wanted vengeance on the united states too that yen for revenge brought together people in the csa who had nothing else in common with luck it would bring them together under the freedom party banner freedow freedoml freetom the stalwarts began the chant as jake stepped back from the microphone it swelled until the whole huge crowd bellowed the word as if it came from a single throat anne looked at tom again he was shouting it too shed been shouting it till she made a deliberate effort of will and stopped all of columbia could hear that furious roar by the time november came all of the confederate states would hear it xv roger kimball whistled cheerfully as he tucked his white shirt into a pair of butternut trousers a lot of freedom party leaders didnt care to join in the brawling that had marked the partys rise kimball shrugged hed never backed away from a fight and hed gone toward a good many and ainsworth layne was speaking in charleston tonight or thought he was i need a tin hat kimball said buttoning his fly a helmet was useless aboard a submersible it was a handy thing to have with clubs and rocks flying though he picked up his own club and headed for the door he was about to open it when somebody knocked he threw it wide there stood clarence potter the former intelligence officer eyed him with distaste if you dont agree with what i have to say you could simply tell me so potter remarked i dont agree with what you have to say kimball snapped i dont have time to argue about it now though cant be late potter shook his head when we first got to know each other i thought better of you you were a man who wanted to build up his country not a ruffian tearing down the fabric of the republic we used to talk about riding jake featherston now he rides youand youre proud of it he doesnt ride me roger kimball said were both going the same way thats all toward riot and mayhem potter pointed to the stout bludgeon in kimballs hand then he added toward murder too maybe clarence i had nothing to do with tom brearley going up in smoke kimball said evenly i dont miss him but i didnt have anything to do with it far as i knowhe carefully hadnt asked featherston any questionsthe freedom party had nothing to do with it either the jury found those fellows up in richmond innocent no the jury found them not guilty which isnt close to the same thing potter answered and if the jury had found anything different how many out of those twelve do you suppose would be breathing today i dont know anything about that what i do know is maybe youd better not come around here any more kimball hefted the club potter had very little give in him kimball had seen as much when they first met in a saloon the club didnt frighten him you neednt worry about that he said slowly and deliberately he turned his back and walked away kimball pulled his watch out of his pocket goodhe wasnt late yet he frowned then set the watch on a table by the door some of the radical liberals were liable to have clubs too and that could be hard on a timepiece he passed a policeman on his way to freedom party headquarters the grayclad cop inspected him he wondered if the man would give him trouble but the cop called freedom and waved him on his way kimball raised the club in salute as he hurried along freedom party stalwarts spilled out onto the sidewalk and into the street around the headquarters theyd drawn a few policemen on account of that come on fellows you dont want to block traffic one of the policemen said the men in white and butternut took no special notice of him yes he had a sixshooter but there were more than a hundred times six of them combat veterans all and some no doubt with pistols of their own tucked into pockets or trouser waistbands form ranks boys kimball called the freedom party men did they didnt just spill into the street then they took it over in a long sinewy column that put kimball in mind of the endless closeorder drill hed gone through down at the naval academy in mobile the comparison was fitting because the stalwarts mostly exsoldiers with a handful of navy menhad surely done their fair share of closeorder drill too you cant do that a cop exclaimed you havent got a parade permit we are doing it kimball answered were out for a stroll togetherisnt that right boys the men in butternut and white howled approval kimball waited to see if the policeman would have the nerve to try arresting him the cop didnt grinning kimball said on to hampton park forwardmarch the column moved out the stalwarts raising a rhythmic cry of freedom kimball had all he could do not to break into snickers here he was leading freedom party men to attack radical liberals in a park named for the family of the whigs presidential candidate if that wasnt funny what was hampton park lay in the northwestern part of charleston across town from freedom party headquarters the column of stalwarts was ten men wide and a hundred yards long it snarled traffic to a faretheewell some automobilists frantically blew their horns at the men who presumed to march past them regardless of rules of the road more than a few though shouted freedom and waved and cheered what do you aim to do a nervous policeman asked kimball as the stalwarts strode up ashley toward hampton park by then a couple of dozen cops were tagging along with the freedom party men tagging along was all they were doing they seemed shocked to find themselves such a small shadowy presence in hampton park a couple of searchlights hurled spears of light into the sky the rad libs hadnt adopted the glowing cathedral anne colleton had come up with but they were doing their best to keep pace kimball pointed toward the searchlights we aim to have a talk with those folks yonder the cop spluttered and fumed he knew the freedom party aimed to do a hell of a lot more than that but knowing it and being able to prove it were two different critters ainsworth layne had provided himself with a microphone too his amplified voice boomed out from the park and so i say to you people of the confederate states that with goodwill we can be reconciled to those with whom we have known conflict in the past with our american brethren in the united states and with the colored men and women in our own country he sounded earnest and bland are you listening to that crap boys roger kimball asked sounds like treason to me how about you a low rumble of agreement rose from the men marching behind him he asked another question what does this country really need freedom the thunderous answer put laynes microphone to shame the freedom party men advanced into the park dark shapes rushed out of the night to meet them the radical liberals had a cry of their own layne and liberty freedom kimball shouted and swung his club it struck flesh a rad lib howled like a kicked dog kimball laughed if the other side felt like mixing it up he and his comrades were ready dozens of searchlights marked freedom party rallies these days the radical liberals used only a couple the radical liberals incompletely imitated the freedom party when it came to assembling a strongarm force too theyd recruited a few dozen bullyboys enough to blunt the first charge of the men in white and butternut but nowhere near enough to halt them or drive them back layne and liberty a radical liberal swung at roger kimballs head kimball got his left arm up in time to block the blow but let out a yip of anguish all the same he shook the arm it didnt hurt any worse when he did that so he supposed the rad lib hadnt broken any bonesnot from lack of effort though kimball swung his own club his foe blocked the blow with an ease that bespoke plenty of bayonet practice but the radical liberal couldnt take on two at once another freedom party man walloped him from behind he fell with a groan kimball kicked him hard as he could then ran on freedom he cried ainsworth layne must have caught the commotion at the back of the park and now i see the forces of unreason seek to disrupt our peaceable assembly he boomed through the microphone they pay no heed to the rights enumerated in the confederate constitution yet they feel they have the right to govern we must reject their violence their radicalism for we freedom kimball shouted again only a few of the radical liberals muscle boys remained on their feet kimball smashed one of them down blood ran dark along his club he guessed hed fractured a skull or two in the fight he hoped he had freedom the party stalwarts roared as they crashed into the rear of the crowd some people tried to fight back others tried to run they had a devil of a time doing it with laynes partisans so tightly packed together men and women started screaming freedom it was not only a war cry for kimball and his comrades it was also a password they did their best to maim anyone who wasnt yelling their slogan they had fury on their side they had discipline on their side too as theyd done in the trenches they supported one another and fought as parts of a force with a common goal the men in the crowd of radical liberals might have been their matches individually but never got the chance to fight as individuals the freedom party men mobbed them rolled over them and plunged deep into the heart of the crowd aiming straight for the platform from which ainsworth layne still sent forth unheeded calls for peace kimball stepped on someone when she cried out he realized her sex he refrained from kicking her while she was down thus far his chivalry ran thus far and no further swinging his club he pressed on toward the platform through the red heat of battle he wondered what he and the rest of the freedom party men ought to do if they actually got there pull layne off it and stomp him to death a lot of the stalwarts would want to do that even with his blood up kimball didnt think it would help the party some people would cheer more would be horrified when the shooting started it sounded like firecrackers on the fourth of july roger kimball didnt know whether a stalwart or a man in the crowd first pulled out a pistol aimed it at somebody he didnt like and squeezed the trigger no sooner did one gun come out though than a dozen or more on each side were barking and spitting furious tongues of fire what had been chaos turned to a panicked stampede all the people in the crowd tried to get away from the freedom party menand from the gunfireas fast as they could if they trampled wives husbands children then they did and theyd worry about it later the only thing they worried about now was escape let us have peace ainsworth layne cried but there was no peace kimball saw a freedom party man taking aim at layne no dammit he shouted and whacked the revolver out of the stalwarts hand with his club the fellow snarled at him he snarled back weve got to get out of here he yelled weve done what we came to do but every cop in charlestons going to be heading this way now time to go home boys he thought the stalwarts might be able to take on the whole charleston police force and have some chance of winning he didnt want to find out though if the freedom party won here the governor would have to call out the militia either the citizensoldiers would slaughter the stalwarts or theyd mutiny and go over to them in which case south carolina would have a revolution on its hands less than a month before the election jake featherston would kill him if that happened it was no figure of speech and kimball knew as much out he yelled again away weve done what we came for discipline held the freedom party men began streaming out of hampton park even they forgot about ainsworth layne november dawned chilly and drizzly in richmond reggie bartlett got out of bed half an hour earlier than he usually would have so he could vote before going to work at harmons drugstore yawning in spite of the muddy coffee hed made he went downstairs and out into the nasty weather it wasnt raining quite hard enough for an umbrella he pulled his hat down and his coat collar up and muttered curses every time a raindrop trickled along the back of his neck a big confederate flag flew in front of the house that served as his polling place a couple of policemen stood in front of the polling place too hed seen cops on election duty before theyd always looked bored not this pair each of them had a hand on his pistol after the riots that had ripped through the csa in the weeks leading up to election day bartlett couldnt blame them freedom freedom four or five men in white shirts and butternut trousers chanted the word over and over again they held placards with jake featherstons name on them and stood as close to the polling place as the hundredfoot noelectioneering limit allowed the cops watched them as if they were enemy soldiers so did reggie bartlett he carried a snubnosed revolver in his trouser pocket these days a jury might have acquitted the freedom party goons whod burned down tom brearleys house around him but reggie knewalong with the rest of the worldwhod done what and why hed signed his name on the letter that introduced brearley to tom colleton that presumably meant the freedom party knew it no one had yet tried to do anything to him on account of it if anyone did try reggie was determined hed regret it as he walked past the policemen they gave him a careful onceover he nodded to them both and went inside the voting officials waiting in the parlor all looked like veterans of the war of secession reggie nodded to them too the next young voting official he saw would be the first they satisfied themselves that he was who he said he was and could vote in that precinct then one of them a fellow with splendid white mustaches and a hook where his left hand should have been gave bartlett a ballot and said use any vacant voting booth sir reggie had to wait a couple of minutes for none of the booths was open a lot of men were doing their civic duty before heading for work at last a fellow in overalls came out of a booth he nodded to bartlett and said freedom in a friendly way the voting officials glared at him so did reggie the man didnt even notice in the voting booth bartlett stared down at the names of the candidates as if theyd lost their meaning that didnt last long though as soon as he saw featherstons name he wanted to line through it hampton or layne he wondered wade hampton surely had the better chance against the freedom party but he liked ainsworth laynes ideas better in the end he cast defiant ballots for layne and the rest of the radical liberal ticket if jake featherston took virginia by one vote hed feel bad about it otherwise hed lose no sleep he came out of the voting booth and handed his ballot to the old man with the hook the precinct official folded it and stuffed it into the ballot box mr bartlett has voted he intoned a response as ingrained and ritualistic as any in church secular communion done reggie left the polling place and hurried to the drugstore good morning jeremiah harmon said as he came in you vote he waited for reggie to nod then asked have any trouble not really reggie answered some of those freedom party soandsos were making noise outside the polling place but thats all they were doing i think the cops out front would have shot them if theyd tried anything worse and i think theyd have enjoyed doing it too how about you about the same the druggist said i wonder if featherstons boys arent shooting themselves in the foot with all these shenanigans i truly do if they make everyone but a few fanatics afraid of them they wont elect anybody let alone the president of the confederate states heres hoping youre right bartlett said and then you dont mind my asking boss whod you vote for wade hampton harmon answered evenly hes about as exciting as watching paint dryyou dont need to tell me that but if anybodys going to come out on top of featherston hes the man to do it laynes a lost cause hes never been the same since that brawl down in south carolina and his party hasnt either he raised a gray eyebrow i suppose youre going to tell me you voted for him i sure did reggie said with a wry chuckle why should i worry about lost causes i live in the confederate states dont i thats funny harmon actually laughed a little which he rarely did itd be even funnier if it werent so true well find out tonightor tomorrow or the next day i supposejust how funny it is reggie said if jake featherston gets elected the jokes on us and isnt that the sad and sorry truth his boss replied whoever wins though the work has to get done what do you say we do it after all if we dont make a few million dollars today well have to beg for our suppers that would have been funnier if it werent so true too reggie dusted the shelves with a longhandled feather duster he put out fresh bottles and boxes and tins to replace the ones customers had bought he kept track of the prescriptions harmon compounded and set them under the counter to await the arrival of the people for whom the druggist made them when customers came in he rang up their purchases and made change ringing things up wasnt so easy the cash register a sturdy and massive chunk of gilded ironmongery dated from before the great war it was a fancier machine than most of that vintage and could handle a fivedollar purchase with the push of but one key had reggie had to do all the pushing he needed to ring up something that cost and a lot of things did this week give or take a couple of millionhe would have been banging that fivedollar key from now till doomsday everyone wanted to talk politics too women couldnt vote but that didnt stop them from having opinions and being vociferous about them isnt mr featherston the handsomest man you ever saw in your life asked a lady buying a tube of cream for her piles no maam reggie answered in the back of the drugstore jeremiah harmon raised his head he didnt want to lose customers regardless of reggies own politics and opinions reggie thought fast handsomest man i ever saw was my father he told the woman pity i dont take after him she laughed bartletts boss relaxed reggie felt some small triumph even if hed sugarcoated what he said he hadnt had to take it back he tried to gauge the shape of the election from conversations with customers that wouldnt prove anything and he knew it he kept trying anyhow from what he saw and heard jake featherston had a lot of support so did wade hampton v only a few people admitted to backing ainsworth layne and the radical liberals reggie hadnt expected anything different he was disappointed just the same when six oclock rolled around he said boss i think im going to get myself some supper somewhere and then head over to the richmond examiner i reckon theyll be posting returns all night long i expect they will harmon answered while youre there do try to recall youre supposed to come in to work tomorrow the druggists voice was dry he had a pretty good idea that reggie was liable to be up late supper was greasy fried chicken and greasier fried potatoes washed down with coffee that had been perking all day reggies stomach told him in no uncertain terms what it thought of being assaulted in that fashion he ignored it shoved a few banknotes with a lot of zeros on them across the counter at the cook and hurried on down broad street to the examinees offices which were only a few blocks from capitol square like the whig and the sentinel and the other richmond paperslike papers across the csathe examiner was in the habit of setting up enormous blackboards on election night and changing returns as the telegraph brought in new ones when reggie got there the blackboards remained pristine the polls were still open throughout the country because of that only a few people stood around in front of the offices reggie got an excellent spot he knew he might have to defend it with elbows as the night wore along but that was part of the game too a man came up loudly unhappy that all the saloons were closed on election day bunch of damn foolishness he said fools weve got running this year we need to get drunk before we can stand to vote for any of em by his vehemence he might already have found liquid sustenance somewhere at half past seven a fellow in shirtsleeves and green celluloid visor came out with a sheaf of telegrams in his hand he started putting numbers from states on the eastern seaboard in their appropriate boxes earliest returns showed hampton ahead in south carolina and virginia jake featherston in north carolina and florida and the radical liberalsreggie clapped his handsin cuba the numbers meant hardly more than the blanks they replaced he was glad to have them anyhow more numbers went up as the hour got later hardly any of them made the people who awaited them very happy the examiner leaned toward the radical liberals and it soon became abundantly clear that whatever else happened ainsworth layne would not be the next president of the confederate states that would have disappointed reggie more had he thought going in that layne enjoyed any great chance of winning the radical liberals always did best on the fringes of the confederacy they were liable to win sonora and chihuahua too when results finally trickled out of the mountains and deserts of the far southwest but the real battle would be decided between texas and virginia returns also came in slowly from the confederate heartland they hadnt seemed so slow during the last congressional election nor the one before that bartlett had been in no position to evaluate how fast the returns for the last presidential election came in not in november he hadnt back in he hadnt cared he hadnt been old enough to vote then hate to say it but im pulling for wade hampton a man about his own age said not far away ive voted radical liberal ever since i turned twentyone and id get into screaming fights with whigs but you look around at what the other choice is the fellow shivered melodramatically i voted for layne reggie said im not sorry i did either im just sorry more people didnt off in the distance somebody shouted freedom but the freedom party muscle boys did not wade into the crowd outside the examiner building they would have paid for any attack they made reggie was sure he wasnt the only radical liberal packing a revolver in case of trouble from goons more and more numbers went up by midnight or so they started to blur for reggie strong coffee at supper or not he couldnt hold his eyes open any more things werent decided but he headed back toward his flat anyway he was glad the election remained up in the air only when hed got very close to home did he realize he should have been sorry jake featherston hadnt been knocked out five minutes after the polls closed jake featherston yawned so wide his jaw cracked like a knuckle he hadnt been so tired since the battles of the great war it was half past four wednesday morning and hed been up since first light tuesday hed voted early posed for photographers outside the polling place and then headed here to the spottswood hotel at the corner of eighth and main to see what he would see hed wanted the ford hotel right across the street from capitol square but the whigs had booked it first he looked down at the glass of whiskey in his hand yawning again he realized he might not have felt so battered if he hadnt kept that glass full through the night he shrugged too late to worry about it now he wasnt in the habit of looking back at things hed done anyway somebody knocked on the door to his room he opened it as hed expected there stood ferdinand koenig his backer when the freedom party was tiny and raw his vicepresidential candidate now that the party was a power in the land but not quite enough of a power koenig held the latest batch of telegrams in his left hand his face might have been a doctors coming out of a sickroom just before the end its over jake he saidlike roger kimball and only a handful of others he talked straight no matter how bad the news was our goose is cooked we wont win it this time featherston noticed he was still holding that whiskey he gulped it down then hurled the glass against the wall shards sprayed every which way like fragments from a bursting shell son of a bitch he snarled son of a bitch i really reckoned we might pull it off we scared em koenig said by god we scared em you ye still outpolling ainsworth layne we took florida we took tennessee we took texas weve got weve got nothing jake said flatly god damn it to fucking hell weve got nothing during the war we killed a million yankees didnt do us one damn bit of good we lost i didnt want to scare wade hampton the goddamn fifth i wanted to whip the whigs out of office like the cur dogs they are koenig stared then shook his head in rueful admiration you never did aim to do anything by halves did you why do you think we are where were at jake returned anybody who settles for what he reckons is good enough deserves whatever happens to him i want the whole damn shootin match now i have to wait till to try again thats a goddamn long time what the hells going to happen to the country from now till then christ we arent going to hell in a handbasket were already there you can come down off the stump for a few minutes anyway ferdinand koenig said the elections over even if the reporters are waiting downstairs to hear what youve got to say goddamn vultures featherston muttered the elections over meant nothing to him his life was a seamless whole he could not have told anyone himself included where jake featherston the man stopped and jake featherston the freedom party leader began he wished he had another glass to shatter all right ill go down maybe theyll all be passed out drunk by then and i wont have to make a speech after all koenig was still trying to look on the bright side of things we picked up four maybe five seats in congress not counting the redemption league florida gave us a senator looks like well pick up the governors spot in tennessee and maybe in mississippi too thats all fine and dandy but its not enough either even now worn and half drunk and sorely disappointed jake knew hed be happier in a few days the freedom party had done very well it just hadnt done well enough to suit him hed have to start building on what it had done and to start looking ahead to see what it could do for he made a fist and slammed it into his own thigh several times the pain was oddly welcome the reporters are waiting eh lets go by jesus lets see how they like it now his running mate looked faintlyno more than faintly alarmed if you want to get a couple hours sleep jake those bastards wont care one way or the other maybe you should grab the chance to freshen up a touch koenig said hell with it featherston replied might as well get it over with he headed for the stairway had koenig not jumped aside jake would have pushed him out of the way down in the lobby of the spottswood the victory celebration for which the freedom party had hoped was a shambles now a few young men in white shirts and butternut trousers remained on their feet and alert theyd been detailed to keep order and keep order they would the task was easier than jake had thought it would be when he assigned it six more years of waiting the thought was as bitter as yielding to the damnyankees had been more freedom party men sprawled snoring on couches and chairs and on the floor too some with whiskey bottles close at hand others simply exhausted a lot of reporters by the look of things were already gone watching the freedom party lose an election so many thought it might win had been story enough for them but half a dozen fellows in cheap but snappy suits converged on jake when he showed himself do you have a statement mr featherston they cried as if with a single voice damn straight i have a statement featherston answered jake began ferdinand koenig who had followed him downstairs dont you worry ferd ill be fine jake said over his shoulder he turned back to the reporters reckon you boys are waiting for me to say something sweet like how even though i wish i was the one whod gotten elected im sure wade hampton v will make a fine president and i wish him all the best that about right did i leave anything out a couple of the reporters grinned at him dont reckon so sarge one of them said thats what we hear from the radical liberals every six years to hell with the radical liberals featherston said and to hell with wade hampton v too the reporters scribbled jake warmed to his theme despite koenigs dark mutterings in the background to hell with wade hampton v and to hell with the whig party they led us off a cliff in they dont have the slightest scent of a notion of how to turn things around and now theyve got six more years to prove they dont know what the devil theyre doing if theyre such a pack of bums whyd you lose the election a reporter called dont you think you ought to ask howd you do so well the first time you tried to run anybody for president jake returned no matter how he felt in private in public he put the best face on things he could christ boys in there was no freedom party we didnt elect anybody to congress till two years ago and now our first time out of the gate we get more votes than the radical liberals and theyve been around forever and what do you ask whyd you lose he shook his head well be back as long as hampton and the whigs leave us any kind of country at all well be back you wait and see you really have it in for hampton dont you a man from the richmond whig asked jake bared his teeth in what was not a smile you bet i do he said hes part of the crowd thats been running the confederate states since the war of secession all the fancy planters and their sons and their sons too and hes part of the war department crowd like jeb stuart jr and the other smart folks who helped the damnyankees lick us when i look at wade hampton and the whigs i look at em over open sights hed let his journal by that name slip when the freedom party began to climb the furious energy that had gone into the writing came out in party work instead now for the first time in a while he might have some leisure to put his ideas down in paper have to look back over what i did before he thought pick up where i left off if you dont work with the other parties why should they work with you the reporter from the whig asked well work with our friends jake said i dont have any quarrel with folks who want to see this country strong and free people who want us weak or who try and sell us to the usa had better steer clear though or theyll be sorry sorry how two men asked the question at the same time the man from the richmond whig followed it up sorry the way tom brearleys sorry though half loaded himself jake knew a loaded question when he heard one i dont know any more about what happened to that brearley than i read in the papers he answered that was true hed also made a point of not trying to find out any more i do know a jury didnt convict the people the police arrested for burning down his house they were all freedom party men this time three reporters spoke together they were all acquitted jake said the reporters looked disappointed jake smiled to himself did they think he was stupid enough to carry ammunition to their guns too bad for them if they did he went on a lot of people like the freedom party these daysnot quite enough to win me the election but a lot are you saying you cant be responsible for all the crazy people who follow you the fellow from the whig wouldnt give up theres crazy people in every party look in the mirror if you dont believe me jake replied andfll say it again on account of you werent listening the jury acquitted those fellows from the freedom party i dont know who burned brearleys house and neither do the cops no way to tell if it was freedom party men or a bunch of riledup whigs not likely the reporter said privately featherston thought he was right publicly the freedom party leader shrugged anything else boys he asked none of the reporters said anything jake shrugged again all right then we didnt win but we dont surrender either and thats about all ive got to say the newspapermen stood scribbling for a bit then went off one by one to file their stories when the last one was out of earshot ferdinand koenig said you handled that real well jake said i would didnt i jake answered christ i spent three years under fire damn me to hell if im going to let some stinking newspapermen rattle me all right koenig said i was a little worried and i dont deny it hard loss to take and you are sort of lit up again he told featherston the truth as he saw it sort of jake allowed but hell you think those fellows with the notebooks are stone cold sober not likely theyve been drinking my booze all night long koenig laughed thats true but nobody cares what they say people do care what you say what do you say about where we go from here same thing ive been saying all along jake was surprised the question needed asking we go straight ahead right on down this same road till we win as she did any evening she was at her apartment by herself flora hamburger waited for a knock on the door all too often the quiet discreet knock didnt come there were times these daysand especially these nightswhen she felt lonelier than she had when shed first got to philadelphia almost five years before that it was a few days before christmas only made things worse the whole city was in a holiday mood which left her a jew on the outside looking in she sat on the sofa working her way through president sinclairs proposed budget for the post office department it was exactly as exciting as it sounded did the president really need to revise the definitions for third and fourthclass post offices at the moment she hadnt the faintest idea before long though the bill would come to a vote she owed it to her constituents she owed it to the countryto make her vote as well informed as she could someone knocked on the door the knock shed been waiting for the knock shed almost given up expecting she sprang to her feet pages of the post office budget flew every which way flora noticed but didnt care she hurried to the door and threw it open there stood hosea blackford come in flora said and the vice president of the united states did she closed the door behind him closed it and locked it blackford kissed her then said youd better have something to drink in this place dear or ill have to go across the hall and come back i do flora said sit down wait ill be right back she went into the kitchen poured him some whiskey and then poured herself some too you are a lifesaver he said and gulped it down flora sat down beside him she drank her whiskey more slowly you look tired she said to her surprise blackford burst into raucous laughter god knows why all i do is sit in a corner and gather dustexcuse me preside over the senate theres not much difference between the two believe me ive spent most of my life in the middle of the arena now now im a ayear hatrack is what i am you knew this would happen when sinclair picked you flora said of course i did but theres a difference between knowing and actually having it happen to you blackford sighed and i wanted it when he picked me the first socialist vice president in the history of the united states ill go down in historyas a footnote but ill go down his laugh was rueful flora thought hed ask for another whiskey but he didnt all he said was i feel like ive already gone down in historyvery ancient history if you have so little to do why havent you stopped by here more often floras question came out sharper then shed intended after shed said it though she was just as well pleased shed said it as she had he raised an eyebrow do you really want me here crying on your shoulder every night i cant believe that of course i do she exclaimed honestly astonished and shed astonished himshe saw as much she wondered if they really knew each other at all despite so much time talking despite lying down together in her bedroom well well he said and then again in slow wonder well well he reached out and brushed the backs of his fingers against her cheek she didnt know whether to pull away or clutch him to her deciding she was lonelier than angry took only a moment she reached for him at the same time as he reached for her later in the bedroom she moaned beneath him enclosed in the circle of his arms his mouth hot and moist and urgent on her nipple his hand helped her along as he drove deep into her her pleasure was just beginning to slide down from the very peak when he gasped and shuddered and spent himself he kissed her again then got off her and hurried into the bathroom from behind the door came a plop as he tossed the french letter hed been wearing into the toilet he was careful not to leave them in the wastebasket for the maid to find usually that wet plop made her laugh tonight it only reminded her how wary they had to be she was a mistress after all not a wife usually she managed not to think about that tonight piled onto everything else it hit her hard harder than it ever had before what had she done to her life not even realizing she was doing it while blackford loosed a long stream into the toilet she rolled over onto her belly and softly began to cry ive been thinking he said and punctuated that by flushing flora didnt answer he opened the door turned out the light and stood there for a moment while his eyes got used to dimness againor maybe his ears caught her quiet sobs first he hurried over to the bed and set a hand on her back what on earth is the matter dear nothing flora shrugged the hand away she tried to stop crying but discovered she couldnt ive been thinking blackford repeated and then this time went on ive been thinking we ought to figure out where were going where are we going flora asked bitterly are we going anywhere she didnt want to roll back over she didnt want to look at him well that doesnt just depend on me that depends on both of us blackford said he waited for flora to reply when she didnt he shrugged she felt the mattress shake he spoke again we cant very well get married for instance unless you want to marry me too floras head jerked up she swiped at her eyes with her arm she didnt want to see blackford or what she could see of him in the near darkness through a haze of tears gulping to try to steady her voice she said married hosea blackford nodded she both saw and felt him do that it seems to be the right thing to do dont you think he said heaven knows we love each other he waited for flora again she knew she had to respond this time and managed a nod that seemed to satisfy blackford who went on all over the world you know when people love each other they do get married but the objections that filled floras head proved shed been in philadelphia in congress the past five years if you marry me hosea what will that do to your career she didnt just mean if you marry me she also meant if you marry a jew he understood her one of the reasons she loved him was that he understood her with another shrug he answered when youre vice president you havent got much of a career to look forward to anyhow and i dont think the party will ever nominate me for presidentdakota doesnt carry enough electoral votes to make that worthwhile so after this term or after next term at the latest im done in that case you go back to dakota and take your old seat back flora declared or you could anyhow could you do it with a jewish wife i dont know that i particularly want my old seat back it seems in pretty good hands with torvald sveinssen and hell have had it for a while by the time im not vice president any more blackford said he reached out and put his hand on her bare shoulder this time she let it stay he went on all youve done is talk about me what about you flora how will people in new york city like it if you came home with a gentile husband i dont think it would bother them too muchthe fourteenth ward is a solidly socialist district she answered and you wouldnt be just any gentile husband you know youre a good socialist yourselfand youre the vice president it could be blackford said i can see how it could be that that would do well enough for your district but i dont have a lot of family back in dakota what will your family think if you go home and tell them youre marrying a gentile flora rejected the first couple of answers that sprang to mind her family might indeed be delighted she was marrying at all but hosea didnt have to know that and her father an immigrant tailor might indeed be so awed she was marrying the vice president that he wouldnt say a word even if her fiance were a mohammedanbut she doubted that abraham hamburger wasnt so outspoken as either flora or her brothers and sisters but he never had any trouble making his opinions known and the question blackford had asked cut close to the one she was asking herself how do i feel about marrying a gentile somehow shed hardly given that a thought while they were lovers she wondered why because being lovers was impermanent something she wouldnt have to worry about forever she didnt think that was the whole answer but it was surely part she ended up answering the question in her own mind not the one blackford had asked when we have children i want to raise them as jews children blackford started then laughed wryly im getting a little long in the tooth to worry about children but youre not of course youll want to have children much more to himself than to flora he muttered i wont be sorry not to wear a sheath any more thats for sure after a few seconds thought he spoke to her again your faith has a stronger hold on you than mine does on me ive been a pretty pallid excuse for an episcopalian for a long time now if im not shooting blanks after all these years i suppose its only fair we bring up the children your way that was as rational an approach to the irrational business of religion as flora could imagine shed seen in congress that blackford approached problems in a commonsense way shed seen he did the same in his private life too but this was an important proof she said i think my father and mother will get along with you just fine does that mean youll marry me then i think it does flora knew she shouldnt sound surprised at a moment like that but couldnt help herself bully blackford said softly he took her in his arms she felt his manhood stir a little against her flank and tried her best to revive him her best turned out not to be good enough he made a joke of it saying see this is whats liable to happen when you have an old man for a husband under that light tone though she could tell he was worried its all right she said but it plainly wasnt all right she cast about for a way to reassure him and finally found one even if it meant coming out with the most risque thing shed ever said in her life your tongue never gets tired she was glad the only light came from a single lamp in the front room he couldnt possibly see her blush yes some parts do still work better than others blackford said doing his best not to sound as if he were taking things too seriously but however hard saying that had been flora was glad shed done it she knew shed eased his mind i didnt really expectthis she said and then i didnt expect any of this not when i first came down from new york city i was green as paint i didnt know what to expect either when i met you at the broad street station blackford answered lord knows i didnt expect thisbut then i didnt expect any of the wonderful things you turned out to be in congress or out of it nobody else said things like that about flora she didnt know how to take them thank you she whispered she said it again on a slightly different note thank you the day had been long and boring the night had been even longer and lonely going to sleep was the most shed had to look forward to now in the space of an hour her whole world had changed that had happened once before when she was elected to congress she looked forward to these changes even more judge mahlon pitney slammed down the gavel he looked every inch a jurist a spare erect handsome grayhaired man in his early sixties his gray eyes clear and alert here is my verdict in the action smith v heusinger he said with a glance toward the court clerk to make sure that worthy was ready to record the verdict it is the decision of this court that title to the property at issue in the aboveentitled action does rightfully rest with the plaintiff john smith who has shown right of possession sufficient to satisfy the court letting out a whoop would have been undignified unprofessional that very nearly didnt stop jonathan moss who instead reached out and shook hands with his client john smith looked more nearly amazed than delighted on the other side of the courtroom in berlin ontario paul heusinger stared daggers at moss well he might have moss had just shown judge pitney he did not have good title to the land on which hed built his office buildingthe building in which moss had his law office youre gone heusinger mouthed moss nodded hed known he was gone whichever way the case went at least he was going out a winner john smith tugged at moss sleeve will he appeal the mousy little canadian whispered cant say for sure now moss whispered back id guess not though i think we have a solid case hereand appeals are expensive back in the spectators seats a couple of reporters scribbled furiously theyd been covering the case since it first showed up on the docket occasional manbitesdog stories appeared in the berlin bulletin and moss supposed some other papers as well he didnt mindon the contrary the stories had already brought him three or four clients much more able to pay his usual fees than john smith was but for the reporters the spectators gallery was empty as far as moss could tell heusinger had not a friend in town smith probably had had friends here but those who werent dead were scattered the war had been hard on berlin one of the reporters asked now that you have your property back mr smith what do you aim to do with it smith looked amazed all over again i dont really know i havent really thought about it because i didnt believe the yanks would play fair and give it back to me i dont suppose they would have without mr moss here no thats not true and i dont want anyone printing it moss said americans respect the law as much as canadians do it wasnt a judge who said mr smith has good title to that land it was the law and the law would have said the same thing regardless of whether mr smiths attorney came from the united states or canada the reporters took down what he said if they didnt believe him they were too businesslike to show it on their faces john smith less disciplined looked highly dubious moss felt dubious himself one of the things hed already discovered in his brief practice was that judges were not animate law books in black robes they were human sometimes alarmingly so after a little more backandforth with the reporters moss reclaimed his overcoat hat and galoshes from the cloakroom in a pocket of the overcoat were mittens and earmuffs he put them on before venturing outside even so the cold tore at him the coat that had been better than good enough for winter in chicago was just barely good enough for winter in ontario he wished for a nosemuff to go with the earmuffs he also wished for taller rubber overshoes as he kicked his way through the newfallen snow toward his apartment some of the freezing stuff got over the redringed tops of the galoshes and did its best to turn his ankles into icicles he wished he would have driven his motorcar over to the courthouse if he had though it was only about even money the bucephalus would have started after sitting so long unprotected in the snow the people of berlin took the weather in stride in a way even chicagoans didnt when it stayed this cold this long people in chicago complained complaining about the weather was as much chicagos sport as football was americas people up here simply went about their business moss didnt know whether to admire them for that or to conclude they hadnt the brains to grumble he hurled coal into the stove when he got into his flat then stood in front of the black iron monstrosity till he was evenly done on all sides he didnt have a whole lot of room to stand anywhere in the apartment ever since hed started the action against his landlord hed been moving crates of books out of his office anticipating that paul heusinger or his own client would give him the bums rush tomorrow he said having picked up the habit of talking to himself down in chicago tomorrow i get to find myself some new digs then maybe ill be able to turn around in this place again he took some pork chops out of the icebox dipped them in egg and then in flour and fried them in a pan on the hot stove he fried potatoes in another pan at the same time practice had made him a halfway decent cookor maybe he just thought so because hed got used to eating what he turned out he didnt go office hunting the next day nor the several days after that either the blizzard that roared through berlin kept even the locals off the streets it was the sort of blizzard that sent americans running back over the border moss didnt think of leavingnot more than a couple of times anyhowbut he was damn glad he had plenty of coal in the scuttle have to start burning books if i run out he said he had enough books in the flat for he looked around eight or ten years is my guess despite the dreadful weather he did get some work done hed already seen that the canadians were good at keeping telegraph and telephone lines up and functioning in the teeth of the worst winter could do the telephone in his flat rang several times a day somehow the newspapers had gone out and with them word of his victory for john smith other canadians with similar problems wanted him to give them a hand too he had just headed for the bathroom to dispose of some used coffee when the telephone jangled yet again he thought about ignoring itanyone who really wanted him would call back but duty defeated his bladder stepping over a crate he went back to the telephone jonathan moss attorney at law hello mr moss i called to congratulate you for getting mr smith what belongs to him thank you maam he wondered where the woman was calling from the line had more clicks and pops on it than he would have expected from a call placed inside berlin but the storm might have had something to do with that too he waited for the woman to say more when she didnt he asked can i do anything else for you i dont think so she answered ive already found out that you arent what i thought you were during the war noyou may be what i thought you were but youre more than that too moss almost dropped the telephone earpiece laura he whispered he didnt know if laura secord would hear him but she did yes thats right she said when i found out what you had done i knew i had to come into arthur to ring you up and say thank you he hadnt stirred out of doors since coming home from winning the case did that say she was hardier than he or just that she was out of her tree moss couldnt make up his mind whatever else it said it said shed very badly wanted to telephone him how are you he asked well enough she said as well as i can be with my country occupied id heard youd set up in empireshe would be one not to call it berlinbut i didnt know what sort of practice you had and so i didnt think it right to speak to you from the way you lent me money i thought you were a decent man and i am glad to see you proved me right when you had nothing else on your mind ah he said then he shrugged she could hardly have helped knowing what hed felt about her hed gone up to arthur in weather almost this badchrist had it been three years ago to tell her so and shed told him to get lost he noticed how he thought about that as if it were in the past tense and he realized some of it was hed been surprised hell hed been flabbergastedto have her call but some of what hed felt or thought hed felt was missing that flabbergasted him too where did it go into the place where everything that doesn t work outgoes he thought now shed been waiting for him to say something more and seemed nonplussed when he didnt when the weather gets better maybe you could come up for a picnic if you care to she said we havent seen each other in a long time moss didnt know whether to laugh or to weep had she said that in he would have driven his bucephalus through fire never mind ice to go to her side but it was hed got over some of his infatuation without quite noticing he was doing it while he was doing that had she grown interested in him so it seemed ill sec what i can do he said which was polite even friendly sounding and committed him to nothing all right laura secord said i hope to see you id better go now goodbye she hung up the line went dead slowly moss set the earpiece back on its cradle he stood staring at the telephone for a long moment before his body reminded him of what hed been about to do before the phone rang he took care of that then went into the kitchen which wasnt so overrun with books and crates as the rest of the apartment to make up for that it did contain several bottles of whiskey he picked one yanked out the cork and looked around for a glass he didnt see one hell with it he said and took a long pull straight from the bottle he coughed a couple of times drank againnot so muchand set the bottle down he started to pick it up once more but changed his mind instead he shoved in the cork and put it back in the cupboard where it would be out of sight laura secord he said my god he started to giggle which was surely the whiskey working that telephone call would shut fred sandburg up forever all by itself he didnt need fred to tell him hed been foolish to fall so hard hed figured it out all by himself and now if he wanted to he had the chance to make his dreams turn real to how many men was that given of them how many would have the sense to steer clear he laughed out of the side of his mouth he wasnt nearly sure he would have the sense to steer clear or even that it was sense as the snowstorm howling through berlin attested picnic weather was a long way away now his mind would start coming back to laura secord the way his tongue kept coming back to a chipped front tooth it hardly seemed fair just when hed thought he was over her at last hed known arthur wasnt that far from berlin when he started his practice here hed figured the john smith case would draw wide notice had he hoped laura secord would be one of the people who noticed it maybe he had he shook his head he knew damn well he had even if he hadnt admitted it to himself shed been in his mind for five years now he was in hers what the hell am i going to do he muttered what the hell am i going to do his tongue found that chipped tooth again he got very little work done the rest of the day scipio hardly thought of himself by the name hed been born with these days his passbook called him xerxes his boss called him xerxes his friends called him xerxes most important of all his wife called him xerxes bathsheba had no idea hed ever owned another name bathsheba knew very little about his life before hed come to augusta one day she asked him pointblank why dont you never come out an say where you was from and what you was doin when you was there he wondered how shed react if he answered her in the accent of an educated white the accent hed had to use while serving anne colleton at marshlands he didnt dare find out he didnt dare tell her of his days on the plantation or of the bloodsoaked time in the congaree socialist republic that had followed as long as only he knew he was safe if anyone else found out anyonehe was in trouble and so he answered as he usually did i done what i done is all never done nothin much he tried to soften her with a smile you is the best thing i ever done it workedto a degree eyes glinting bathsheba said i bet you done ran away from a wife an about six children solemnly scipio shook his head no maam done run away from three wives an foteen chilluns bathsheba stared for a moment she believed him then when he started to laugh she stuck out her tongue you are the most aggravatin man in the whole world why wont you never give me no straight answers because if i did i might end up standing against a wall with a blindfold on my face i wonder if they would waste a cigarette on a nigger before they shot him as usual he heard his thoughts in the educated dialect hed been made to learn he sighed that was a straight answer but not one he could give bathsheba he tried jollying her once more instead batting his eyes he said i gots to have some secrets his wife snorted and threw her hands in the air all right she said all right i give up maybe you done crawled out from under a cabbage leaf like folks tell the pickaninnies when theyre too little to know about screwin mebbe so scipio said with a chuckle my mama never tof me no different anyways dont matter where i comes from though where is goin is what count bathsheba snorted again and where you goin right now sweet thing i believe is goin to bed scipio yawned in bed in the darkness bathsheba grew serious again when the reds rose up what did you do then she asked the question in a tiny whisper unlike so many shed asked earlier in the evening she knew that one was dangerous but she didnt know how dangerous it was scipio answered it seriously without going into much detail same as mos folks i reckons i done my bes to hide a lot o the time when de buckra come with the guns i make like i was a good nigger for they an they don shoot me wish the whole ruction never happen do jesus i wish the whole ruction never happen there he told the complete truth he set a hand on her shoulder what you do if she was talking about herself she couldnt ask about him he felt her shrug wasnt so much to do here a couplethree days when folks done rioted and stole whatever they could git away with but then the white folks brung so many police and sojers into the terry nobody dared stick a nose out the door for a while or theyd shoot it off you damn foolishness nothin but damn foolishness scipio said shouldnt neverve riz up the buckra theys strongern we i hates it but i aint blind if we makes they hate we wes sunk bathsheba didnt say anything for a while then she spoke two words jake featherston she shivered though the february night was mild scipio took her in his arms as much to keep himself from being afraid as to make her less so jake featherston he echoed quietly all the buckra in the freedom party hates we they hates we bad an one white man out o every three near nough vote fo jake featherston las year six year down de road he be president o de confederate states pray to jesus he aint bathsheba said scipio nodded hed been able to pray when he was a child he remembered as much he wished he still could most of the ability had leached out of him during the years hed served anne colleton the marxist rhetoric of the reds with whom hed associated during the war had taken the rest marxs words werent gospel to him as they had been to cassius and cherry and island and the rest still the philosopher had some strong arguments on his side outside rain started tapping against the bedroom window that was a good sound one scipio heard several times a week he wished he hadnt been thinking about the red rebellion and the freedom party tonight he couldnt find any other reason why the raindrops sounded like distant machinegun fire the freedom party ever elect themselves a president what we do bathsheba asked maybe she was having trouble praying too dunno scipio answered maybe we gots to rise up again that was a forlorn hope and he knew it all the reasons hed spelled out for the failure of the last black revolt would hold in the next one too maybe we gots to run away instead where we run to his wife asked aint got but two choices scipio said the usa an mexico he laughed not that hed said anything funny an the mexicans dont want we an the damnyankees really dont want we you know all kinds of things bathsheba said how come you know so many different kinds of things it wasnt what hed said which was a commonplace but the way hed said it he had sometimes a manner that brooked no contradiction butlers were supposed to be infallible that he could sound infallible even using the congaree dialect a dialect of ignorance if ever there was one spoke well of his own force of character i knows whats so he said an i knows what aint he slid his hand under the hem of bathshebas nightgown which had ridden up a good deal after she got into bed his palm glided along the soft cotton of her drawers heading upwards an i knows what i likes too whats that bathsheba asked but her legs drifted apart to make it easier for his hand to reach their joining so she must have had some idea afterwards lazy and sated and drifting toward sleep scipio realized hed found the best way to keep her from asking too many questions he wished he were ten years younger so he might use it more often chuckling at the conceit he dozed off bathsheba was already snoring beside him the alarm clock gave them both a rude awakening scipio made coffee while bathsheba cooked breakfast erasmus trusted scipio with the coffeepot but not with anything more scipio occasionally resented that he could cook in a rough and ready way but both erasmus and bathsheba were better at it than he was when he got to erasmus fish market and fry joint he found the grayhaired proprietor uncharacteristically subdued erasmus was never a raucous man now he seemed to have pulled into himself almost like a turtle pulling its head back into its shell not until scipio pulled out the broom and dustpan for his usual morning sweepup did his boss speak and then only to say dont bother scipio blinked erasmus had never encouraged him to keep the place tidy but hed never told him not to do it either somethin troublin you scipio asked expecting erasmus to shake his head or come back with one of the wry gibes that proved him clever despite a lack of education but the cook and fish dealer nodded instead you might say so yeah you just might say so kin i do anything to hep scipio asked he wondered if his boss had been to a doctor and got bad news now erasmus shook his head aint nothin you can do he answered which made scipio think hed made a good guess erasmus continued you might want to start sniffin around for a new place to work i be goddamned if i know how much longer i can keep this here place open do jesus scipio exclaimed aint nothin atall the doctor kin do what you say erasmus looked puzzled then his face cleared i aint sick xerxes sick an tired oh yes sick an disgusted oh my yes but i aint sick not like you mean he hesitated then added sick o white folks is what i is all o we is sick o the buckra scipio said what they do make you sick this time after you go home las night these fourfive white men come in here erasmus said they tell me theys puttin a special tax on all the niggers what owns business in the terry here now i know the laws i got to know the laws else i find even more troublen a niggers supposed to have an i tell these fellers aint no such thing as no special tax on nigger businesses scipio had the bad feeling he knew what was coming he asked these here buckra they freedom party men i dont know yes and i dont know no not to swear erasmus answered but i bet they is one of em smile this mean chilly smile an he say there is now any nigger dont pay this tax bad things gwine happen to where he work he still dont pay bad things gwine happen to him i seen a deal o men in my day xerxes dont reckon this here feller was lyin what you do scipio said erasmus looked old and beaten cant hardly go to the police now can i nigger complain about white folks they lock him in jail an lose the key likely tell they beat him up too long as he there cant hardly pay this here tax neither i aint gettin rich here bastards want to squeeze a million dollars out of every three million i make that dont leave no money for me an it sure as hell dont leave no money to pay no help you work good lord knows but i dont reckon i can keep you maybe you kin go to the police scipio said slowly freedom party done lose the election came too close to winning erasmus said the first time hed ever said anything like that an besides you know same as i do half the police maybe bettern half spend their days off yellin freedom loud as they can it was true every word of it was true scipio wished he could deny it hed been comfortable for a while comfortable and happy as long as he had bathsheba he figured he could stay happy if he lost this job how long would he need to get comfortable again he hoped he wouldnt have to find out xvi abner dowling went into general custers office the commander of us forces in canada was scribbling changes on a report dowling had typed some of them dowling saw reversed changes hed made in an earlier report usually that would have infuriated custers adjutantnot that dowling could do anything about it today though he felt uncommon sympathy for his vain irascible superior sir he said custer didnt look up maybe he didnt hear maybe he didnt want to hear dowling could hardly have blamed him were that so but he had to make custer notice him sir eh with surprise perhaps genuine perhaps well feigned custer shoved the papers aside what is it dowling either hed entered his second childhood the night before or he knew perfectly well what it was dowling didnt think senility had overcome the old coot as suddenly as that he said sir mr thomas is here to see you hes from the war department he added that last in case custer had gone around the bend in the past twentyfour hours custer sighed his wrinkled features drooping he knew what that meant all right no reprieve eh he asked like a prisoner who would hang in the morning if the governor didnt wire dowling shook his head custer sighed again very well lieutenant colonel bring him in if you care to you may stay and listen this will affect you too thank you sir by your leave i will do that dowling tried to recall the last time custer had been so considerate he couldnt he went out to the anteroom and said mr thomas general custer will see you now good n mattoon thomas got to his feet he was a tall longfaced man in his late thirties and looked more like a preacher than upton sinclairs assistant secretary of war he walked with a slight limp dowling knew hed taken a machinegun bullet in the leg during the great war when theyd gone down the short hallway to custers sanctum dowling said mr thomas i have the honor to present to you general george custer general the assistant secretary of war being one of the civilians overseeing the army thomas took precedence over custer in the introductions pleased to meet you sir custer said a palpable lie he waved to the chair in front of his desk pleasesit down make yourself comfortable as thomas did so abner dowling also took a seat he tried to be unobtrusive which wasnt easy with his bulk n mattoon thomas blue eyes flicked his way but the assistant secretary of war only nodded accepting his presence custer would have said something more then but the words seemed stuck in his throat he sent dowling a look of appeal but it wasnt dowlings place to speak he was here only as an overweight fly on the wall before the silence could grow too awkward thomas broke it saying general i wish to convey to you at the outset president sinclairs sincere appreciation for the excellent service you have given your country in this difficult and important post thats kind of him custer said very kind of him im honored to have him send someone to deliver such a generous message in person you came a long way to do it sir and im grateful he was going to be difficult dowling would have bet hed be difficult but hadnt looked for him to be quite so gracefully difficult maybe libbie had coached him she was even better at being difficult than her husband n mattoon thomas gave him the look of a preacher whod had the collection plate come back with thirtyseven cents and a subway token on it in view of your long career in the us army general the president feels it is time for you to come home to welldeserved thanks and to rest on your laurels hereafter he said mr thomas i have no desire to rest on my laurels custer replied i am as hale and spry as a man of my years can be and i do not believe those years have adversely affected my ability to reason clearly and to issue appropriate orders i have been in the saddle a long time i should like to continue i am afraid i must remind you general that you serve at the pleasure of the president of the united states thomas was less than half custers age but he had the power in this situation and also had the ruthlessness that came naturally to many young men given power over their elders dowling saw that and pitied custer custer saw it too and grew angry he dropped his polite mask as if hed never donned it christ i despise the notion of taking orders from that socialist pipsqueak he growled which is one reason the president takes a certain pleasure in giving them to you thomas replied easily would you prefer to retire general or to be sacked those are your only choices now teddy roosevelt could sack me and not worry about what happened next custer said he was a soldier himselfnot so good a soldier as he thought he was but a soldier nonetheless president sinclair will have a harder time of it the papers will hound him for months if he dismisses me for he has not the prestige the authoritycall it what you liketo do so without reminding people of his own inexperience in such matters that all made excellent political sense to abner dowling custer the political animal had always been far more astute than custer the soldier dowling glanced toward thomas wondering how upton sinclairs assistant secretary of war would take such defiance it fazed him not at all he said general custer the president predicted you would say something to that effect he told me to assure you he was determined to seek your replacement and that he would dismiss you out of hand if you offered difficulties here is his letter to you which he instructed me to give you if it proved necessary thomas reached into his breast pocket and took out an envelope which he passed across the desk to custer the commandant of us forces in canada had taken off his reading glasses when thomas came in now he put them back on he opened the envelope which was not sealed and drew forth the letter inside it must have been what thomas said it was for his cheeks flushed with rage as he read why the arrogant puppy he burst out when he was through i saved the country from the limeys when he was still making messes in his drawers and he has the impudence to write a letter like this i ought to let him sack me by jingo i cant think of anything else likely to do the socialists more political harm general dowling began custer had a largeindeed an enormoussense of his own importance much of that was justified not all of it was a fact to which he sometimes proved blind n mattoon thomas held up a large longfingered hand let general custer decide as he will lieutenant colonel he said if he prefers being ignominiously flung out of the army he has served so well for so long to being allowed to retire and to celebrate his achievements as they deserve that is his privilege dowling sucked in a long breath president sinclair had sent the right man up to winnipeg to do this job thomas could be smooth but under that smoothness he had steel sharp steel dowling had not realized it till that moment like so many professional soldiers hed assumed any socialist had to be soft custer evidently had assumed the same thing hearing the cool contempt in thomas voice he was discovering hed made a mistake he could hardly have looked more horrified mr thomas he began yes general once again thomas was the picture of urbanity perhaps i was a mite hasty mr thomas custer said hed never willingly retreated in battle but he was backpedaling now perhaps you were the assistant secretary of war let the slightest hint of scorn show in his agreement dowling eyed him with respect verging on alarm he was a formidable piece of work was n mattoon thomas couldcould we arrange it so that i need not retire immediately custer asked now he was grasping at straws soldiers in the usa had political power only when politicians chose to acknowledge it by refusing to do that sinclair and thomas left custer nowhere to stand and thomas now that hed won was willing to let custer have a straw we could indeed he said president sinclair has instructed me that your retirement may take effect as late as the first of augustprovided you give me a letter announcing your intention to retire before i leave this room damn you custer muttered thomas pretended not to hear dowling knew he was pretending because he himself had no trouble hearing at all the general pulled a piece of paper from a desk drawer and wrote rapidlyand furiously if the way the pen scratched over the paper gave any clue when he was done he thrust the sheet at thomas there the assistant secretary of war read it carefully before nodding yes this appears to be satisfactory he said i will announce it directly on my return to philadelphia he folded it and put it into the envelope in which hed brought president sinclairs letter to custer and now that the retirement is in order you may as i said before mark it in any way you like if you want to stop at every town between here and the us border and parade through it with a brass band go right ahead when you reach philadelphia the president will lead the cheers for you of course he willitll make him look good now that the deed was done custer bounced back fast he leaned forward across the desk toward n mattoon thomas and ill tell you why he wont let me retire after august first eitherbecause he knows damn well itll raise a stink and he wants to make sure the stink dies down before the congressional elections this fall it could be thomas answered im not saying it is mind you but it could be he got to his feet whether it is or not though is neither here nor there no no need to escort me out lieutenant colonel dowling now that i have what i came for my driver will take me back to the train station and then i can return to my duties in philadelphia a very good day to you both gentlemen away he went young confident powerful george custer let out a long sigh well dowling i think it may at last be just about over i squeezed a couple of more years of active duty out of teddy roosevelt and got what i really wanted from him too but you cant win all the time there cant be many who had a longer run sir dowling answered he did his best to sound consoling while he wondered what his own career would look like once he finally got free of custer hed said the right thing custer nodded only one i can think of is wilhelm i kaiser bills grandfather he fought under napoleonimagine itand he was still german kaiser when i licked gordon in and for six or seven more years after that too he was up over ninety when he finally gave up the ghost thats quite something sir dowling could easily imagine custer up over ninety he wouldnt go till they came and dragged him awayand neither would libbie come to that and now custer was scheming again a brass band in every town that damn red told me he said ill take him up on it tooand if he thinks i aim to head straight south for the border from here he can damn well think again and so can upton goddamn sinclair i aim to have the bulliest farewell tour in the history of the world yes sir dowling said knowing full well who would have to plan that tour a good morning to you arthur wilfred rokeby said as arthur mcgregor walked into the post office in rosenfeld manitoba morning to you too wilf mcgregor answered he thrust a hand into the pocket of his overalls coins jingled need to buy a mess of stamps thats what im here for rokeby said this have to do with julia and ted culligan congratulations i expect theyll be happy together hope so mcgregor said the culligans are nice folks and julias so happy she thinks she invented ted if she still feels that way ten years from now theyll have done it up right for now though maude and me weve got invitations to write you can have some of your kinfolk come out here for a change rokeby said instead of you going back to ontario thats right mcgregor said since he hadnt been in ontario as rokeby thought that was liable to get awkward but he figured he could slide through it and he wasnt about to give the postmaster any hint that hed actually been in winnipeg he didnt think wilf rokeby told the yanks things they didnt need to know but he didnt want to find out he was wrong the hard way he bought a dollars worth of stamps about as many as hed bought at one crack in his life thank you kindly wilfred rokeby said maybe because mcgregor had been such a good customer he slid a copy of the rosenfeld register across the counter to him you can have this too if you like im done with it thanks wilf thats nice of you because an american was putting out the new register mcgregor didnt like to buy it hed read it though if he got the chance as it had in the old days the register reserved the top right part of the front page for important news from out of town the headline leaped out at mcgregor he pointed to it so custers finally going back to the usa is he good riddance he didnt mind saying that to the postmaster most canadians would likely have said worse rokeby nodded so emphatically a lock of hair flopped down on his forehead despite the spicyscented oil he used to plaster it down the smell of that hair oil was to mcgregor as to other folks for miles around rosenfeld part of the odor of the post office hes celebrating more triumphs than imperial caesar while hes doing it too rokeby said just have a look at the story there mcgregor did the more he read the longer his face got hell be parading through every town where his train stops he said shaking his head in wonder he doesnt think hes imperial caesar wilf he thinks hes god almighty hes a vain old man the postmaster said pretty soon hell meet god almighty facetoface and i guarantee youll be able to tell the difference between the two of them thats the truth mcgregor said had he had any luck at all the devil would already be roasting custer over a slow fire he wondered if custer would parade through rosenfeld on his way back to the united states and made a silent vow if the american general came into town he wouldnt go out again wilfred rokeby sighed wish to jesus i could go back to selling stamps with the portrait of the king god bless him but it doesnt look like its going to happen you have to get along the best way the big fish let you if youre only a little fish yourself i suppose youre right mcgregor said the big fishthe big yank fishhadnt let him get along but he could still bite hed show them he could still bite his features revealed none of that nodding to the postmaster he went on thanks for the stamps and thanks for the paper too any time arthur rokeby said and congratulations again for your daughter shes a nice gal ive always thought so she deserves to be happy she d have been a lot happier if the yanks hadn t come up over the border but mcgregor kept that to himself hed kept a lot of things to himself since alexander was shot with a last nod to the postmaster he headed across the street to henry gibbons general store snow crunched under his boots the calendar said it would be spring any day but the calendar didnt know much about manitoba as he walked he thought hard if custer came to rosenfeld if custer paraded through rosenfeld if he did mcgregor was going to try to kill him and that was all there was to it he could see only one way to do it toss a bomb into custers motorcar that was how the serbs had touched off the great war mcgregor couldnt see doing it and getting away with it the prospect of not getting away with it had held him back in the past he looked deep into himself no he really didnt care any more if he paid with his life he paid with his life hed never have the chance to strike another blow like this against the yanks the next commandant they appointed would probably be some faceless functionary whose own mother had never heard of him if someone like that got blown to smithereens so what but custer had been famous for more than forty years killing him would mean something the usa didnt have an archduke franz ferdinand but custer came close murder on his mind mcgregor walked right past the general store he turned around shaking his head and went back henry gibbon nodded from behind the counter morning arthur he said what can i do for you today ive got a list here somewhere mcgregor said and went through his pockets till he found it handing it to the storekeeper he went on its maudes stuff mostly canned goods and sundries and such we need kerosene too and theres a couple of bottles of cattle drench on there for me but its mostly for the missus gibbon ran his finger down the list reckon i can take care of just about all of this he looked up hear tell your daughters going to tie the knot thats a big day by heaven congratulations thank you henry mcgregor said he pointed to gibbon i bet the culligans came into town in the last couple of days mercy even wilf rokebys heard the news you know its all over creation if wilfs heard it and thats a fact henry gibbon said with a chuckle he turned to the shelves behind him thisll take a little bit why dont you grab a candy caneor a pickle if oned suit you betterand toast yourself by the stove while i rustle up what you need i dont mind if i do mcgregor reached into the pickle barrel and pulled a likely one out of the brine it crunched when he bit into it the way a proper pickle should im going to give you a crate gibbon said bring it back and i knock a dime off your next bill all right i would have brought one with me this time only i didnt think i noticed that its why i started knocking a dime off the bill the storekeeper answered plenty of people who wont think about anything else will remember money mcgregor would have been one of those people before the great war he would have been one of those people up until now the only thing he remembered was revenge what do i owe you he asked when gibbon set the last can in the crate well when you bring in the kerosene can and i fill it everything put all together comes to gibbon said you did bring the kerosene can i reckon by his tone he reckoned no such thing yeah i did mcgregor shook his head in dull embarrassment lucky i remembered to hitch the horse to the wagon ill go get the can youd have been a mite longer getting here arthur if youd forgotten about the horse mcgregor called after him as he left he didnt answer he would have walked back to the wagon for the kerosene can before going to the general store had rokeby not given him a copy of the register seeing that custer was leaving canada seeing that custer was going to celebrate while here realizing that custer might come through rosenfeld had taken everything else from his mind he wanted to go back to the farm he wanted to go back into the barn and get to work on a bomb he could throw he would have forgotten the crate of groceries had henry gibbon not reminded him of it the storekeeper laughed as he carried it out toward the wagon mcgregor was glad he didnt own an automobile he wasnt altogether sure he recalled how to get back to the farmhouse the horse thank heaven would know the way when he carried the crate indoors the rosenfeld register was stuck on top of the cans and jars naturally maude grabbed it new things to read didnt come to the farm often enough as naturally mcgregors wife noticed the story about custer right away is he going to parade through rosenfeld she asked i dont know mcgregor answered if he does parade through rosenfeld what will you do sharp fear rode maudes voice i dont know that either mcgregor answered maude set a hand on his arm his eyes widened a little the two of them seldom touched except by accident outside the marriage bed i dont want to be a widow arthur she said quietly ive already lost alexander i dont know what id do if i lost you too ive always been careful havent i he said coming as close as he ever did to talking about what he did besides farming you go on being careful do you hear me maude said youve done what you had to do if you do anything more its over and above you dont need to do it not for me not for alexander she wasnt usually so direct either i hear you mcgregor said and said no more he was the only one who could judge what he had to do he was the only one who could judge how much revenge was enough for him now he was the only one who could judge how much revenge was enough for alexander as far as he was concerned he might kill every yank north of the border without it being revenge enough for alexander maybe he wont come through rosenfeld maude said did she sound hopeful without a doubt she did maybe he wont mcgregor said but maybe he will too and even if he doesnt dont you think the newspapers will print where hes going to be and when hes going to be there if hes having parades hell want people to turn out i suppose i can go meet him somewhere else if i have to you dont have to maude said as she had done before will you please listen to me you dont have to not any more do you think mary would say the same thing mcgregor asked maudes lips shaped two silent words mcgregor thought they were damn you hed never heard her curse aloud in all the years hed known her he still hadnt but only by the thinnest of margins when she did speak aloud she said mary is a little girl she doesnt understand that dying is forever shes not so little any more and if she doesnt understand that after the yanks murdered alexander when do you suppose she will mcgregor asked maude spun away from him and covered her face with her hands her shoulders shook with sobs mcgregor stamped past her back out into the cold when he strode into the barn the horse snorted as if surprised to see him again so soon he didnt pick up the old wagon wheel and get out the bombmaking tools he hid beneath it time enough for that later when he knew exactly what sort of bomb he needed to build and where hed have to take it for now he just stood there and looked even that made him feel better slowly he nodded in a sense more important than the literal he knew where he was going again colonel irving morrell slammed his fist against the steel side of the testmodel barrel its not right god damn it he ground out he couldnt remember the last time hed been in such a temper when the doctors said his leg wound might keep him from going back to active duty in the early days of the great war maybe not even then what can we do sir lieutenant elijah jenkins said were only soldiers we havent got anything to do with deciding which way the country goes and ive always thought that was how things should be too morrell answered but when this chowderheadno this custardheadof a socialist does something like this i ask you lije doesnt it stick in your craw too of course it does sir jenkins said its not like i voted for the red son of a bitchuh beg pardon dont bother morrell said savagely thats what upton sinclair is all right a red son of a bitch he seldom swore he was not a man who let his feelings run away with his wits today though he made an exception that he should have the gall to propose canceling the rest of the reparations the rebs still owe us thats pretty low all right sir jenkins agreed especially after everything we went through to make the csa have to cough up but hed put his finger on only part of morrells fury giving up the reparations is bad enough by itself morrell said but he wants to throw them awayhowever many millions or billions of dollars that isand he wont spend the thousands here to build a proper prototype and get the newmodel barrel a step closer to production thats pretty damn stupid all right jenkins said if the rebs can start putting money in their own pockets again instead of in ours theyll be spoiling for a fight faster than you can say jack robinson thats the truth morrell said thats the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me god why cant sinclair see it you cant get along with somebody whos bound and determined not to get along with you he did his best to look on the bright side of things maybe congress will say no socialist majority in each house jenkins voice was gloomy he kicked at the dirt after the confederates licked us in the war of secession and the second mexican war they werent dumb enough to try and make friends with us they knew damn well we werent their friends why cant we figure out they arent our friends either why because workers all across the world have more in common with other workers than they do with other people in their own country morrell wasnt usually so sarcastic but he wasnt usually so irate either what happened in sure proved that didnt it none of the workers would shoot at any of the other workers would they thats why we didnt have a war isnt it if we didnt have a war sir whered you get that purple heart jenkins asked must have fallen from the sky morrell answered pity it couldnt have fallen where sinclair could see it and have some idea of what it meant why dont you send it to him sir jenkins asked eagerly if i did id have to send it in a chamber pot to show him how i felt morrell said and ill bet i could fill that chamber pot with medals from men on just this base too for a moment the idea of doing just that held a potent appeal but then reluctantly he shook his head it wouldnt do id throw my own career in the pot along with the medal and somebody has to defend the united states even if sinclair isnt up to the job yes sir i suppose so jenkins was a bright lad he could see the sense in that he was still not very far from being a lad in the literal sense of the word though for his grin had a distinct smallboy quality to it as he went on it would have been fun to see the look on his face when he opened it though well maybe it would morrell laughed he knew damn well it would he slapped jenkins on the back see you in the morning jenkins nodded and hurried away toward the officers club no doubt to have a drink or two or three before supper in his bachelor days morrell mightprobably wouldhave followed him even if he would have been sure to stop after the second drink now though he was more than content to hurry home to agnes she greeted him with a chicken stew and indignation shed heard the news about sinclairs proposal to end reparations down in leavenworth its a disgrace she said nothing but a disgrace hell throw money down the drain but he wont do anything to keep the country strong i said the same thing not an hour ago morrell said one of the reasons i love you is we think the same way we certainly do you think you love me and i think i love you agnes said morrell snorted his wife went on would you like some more dumplings i sure would he answered but ill have to run them off one day before too long he still wasnt close to fathe didnt think hed ever be fat the way say general custers adjutant was fat but now for the first time in his life he wondered if hed stay scrawny forever agnes determination to put meat on his bones was starting to have some effect he was also past thirty which meant the meat he put on had an easier time sticking you served under general custer agnes said a little later with a mouth full of dumpling morrell could only nod his wife continued what do you think about him taking a tour through canada before he finally comes home for good after swallowing morrell said i dont begrudge it to him if thats what you mean he did better up there than i thought he would and hes the one who really broke the stalemate in the great war when he saw what barrels could do and rammed it down philadelphias throat he may be a vain old man but hes earned his vanity when youre as old as he is youll have earned the right to be just as vain agnes declared morrell tried to imagine himself in the early s he couldnt do it the reach was too far he couldnt guess what that distant future time would be like he couldnt guess what hed be like either he could see forty ahead and even fifty but eighty and beyond he wondered if anybody in his family had ever lived to be eighty he couldnt think of anyone except possibly one greatuncle he said i hope i dont have the chance to get that vain because id need another war maybe another couple of wars to come close to doing all the things custers done in that case i dont want you to get old and vain either agnes said at once as long as you have the chance to get old you can stay modest for all of me i suppose that will do morrell answered agnes smiled thinking hed agreed with her and so he had to a point old men veterans of the war of secession talked about seeing the elephant hed seen the elephant and all the horror it left in its wake it was horror he recognized as much but hed never felt more intensely alive than during those three years of war the game was most worth playing when his life lay on the line nothing felt better than betting itand winning he had a scarred hollow in the flesh of his thigh to remind him how close hed come to betting it and losing agnes had a scarred hollow in her heart gregory hill her first husband had laid his life on the lifeand lost it morrell knew he ought to pray with all his heart that war never visited the borders of the united states again he did pray that war never visited again well most of him did anyhow the next morning he put on a pair of overalls and joined the rest of the crew of the test model in tearing down the barrels engine they would have done that in the field too with less leisure and fewer tools the better a crew kept a barrel going the less time the machine spent behind the lines and useless morrell liked tinkering with mechanical things unlike the fluid world of war repairs had straight answers if you found what was wrong and fixed it the machine would work every time it didnt fight back and try to impose its own willeven if it did seem that way sometimes michael pound looked at the battered engine and sadly shook his head ridden hard and put away wet was the gunners verdict thats about the size of it sergeant morrell agreed it does a reasonably good job of making a white truck go trying to move this baby though its underpowered and overstrained we ought to build something bigger and stronger then pound said have you got the threesixteenths wrench sir matter of fact i do morrell passed it to him he grinned while he did it you always make everything sound so easy sergeantas if there werent any steps between we ought to and doing something well there shouldnt be pound said matteroffactly if something needs doing you go ahead and do it what else he stared at morrell with wide blue eyes in his world no steps lay between needing and doing morrell envied him izzy applebaum the barrels driver laughed at pound things arent that simple sarge he said in purest new york his eyes were narrow and dark and constantly moving now here now there now somewhere else why ever not pound asked in honest surprise dont you think this barrel needs a stronger engine if it does we ought to build one how complicated is that he attacked the crankcase with the wrench it yielded to his straightforward assault morrell wished all problems yielded to straightforward assault some people dont want us to put any money at all in barrels he pointed out let alone into better engines for them those people are fools sir pound answered if theyre not fools theyre knaves hang a few of them and the rest will quiet down soon enough tempting aint it izzy applebaum said with another laugh only trouble is they make lists of people who ought to get hanged too and were on em the companys better on their list than on ours but none of them lists is any goddamn good my folks were on the czars list before they got the hell out of poland down south of us the freedom party is making lists of people to hang morrell added i dont care for it either michael pound was unperturbed well but theyre a pack of wildeyed fanatics sir he said go ahead and tell me you dont think there are some people whod be better off dead it is tempting morrell admitted he had his mental list starting with several leading socialist politicians but as applebaum had said he was on their list too if you ask me its just as well nobody hangs anybody till a court says its the right and proper thing to do have it your way sir pound said with a broadshouldered shrug and then a moment later another one its the law of the land i suppose but if i were king if you was king id get the hell out of here faster than my old man got out of poland izzy abblebaum broke in the gunner looked aggrieved he no doubt thought hed make a good king hed done a fine job of commanding one barrel after morrell got killed that didnt mean he could run roughshod over the world leading a brigade of them even if he thought it did checking a gasket morrell reflected that nobody could do too much roughshod running in the usa the constitution kept such things from happening if it sometimes left him frustrated hed just have to live with it this lifter is shot he said we have a spare part with this budget applebaum said are you kidding were lucky weve got the one that doesnt work morrell spent a long time pondering that and never did straighten it out nellie jacobs felt harassed once edna got merle grimes to pop the question she hadnt wasted a minute shed said i do and moved out that meant nellie had to try to run the coffeehouse and keep track of clarawho at two was into everythingall by herself either one of those would have been a fulltime job trying to do both at once left her shellshocked every once in a while when things got more impossible than usual shed take clara across the street to hals shop to let her husband keep track of the kid in between halfsoling shoes and occasionally making fancy boots on those days she ended up tired and hal exhausted instead of the other way round now i know why god fixed it up so that young people have most of the babies she groaned after one particularly wearing day folks our age dont have the gumption to keep up with em i wish i could tell you you were wrong hal answered he looked more like a tired grandfather than a father he wasnt nellies age he was better than ten years older having clara around seemed to be making both her parents older still at a faster rate than usual shall i make us some more coffee nellie asked its either that or prop my eyelids up with toothpicks i reckon go ahead and make it hal said you always make good coffee but i do not think it will keep me awake i do not think anything will keep me awake not any more he sighed and she sleeps through the night so well now too i know nellie would have groaned again but lacked the energy if she didnt i wouldnt just be tiredid be dead i do love herwith all my heart i love her hal said but you are rightshe can be a handful two handfiils even i will be very glad when she stops saying no to everything we tell her you mean they stop saying no nellie exclaimed in surprise more or less mock hard to tell if you go by edna edna is fine hal said there is nothing wrong with edna you worry about her too much i dont think so nellie said in a flat voice if you knew what ive been throughif you knew what ive put myself through for her they are not the same thing hal said huh was the only answer nellie gave to that after a while she went on merles going to find out about nicholas kincaid you wait and see that kind of thing wont stay under the rug her husband shrugged you are probably right i cannot blame edna for not wanting to talk about it though not fair to tell lies nellie said then she remembered bill reach almost five years dead now she remembered how the knife had felt going into him and she remembered hal could not must not find out how hed died the only difference between her case and her daughters was that she had a better chance of keeping her secret it is not a lie that intends to hurt hal said and nellie had to nod for that was true she let him win the argument which she didnt always do by any means the next morning the past rose up and bit her she should have expected such a thing but somehow she hadnt a ruddy handsome fellow in an expensive suit came in looked around and said well youve done the place up right nice widow semphroch likely looked like a tornado went through it at the end of the war but youve done it up right nice his confederate accent was thick enough to sliceshe guessed he hailed from alabama or maybe mississippi should i know you sir she asked her voice cool but resolutely polite business wasnt so good that she could afford to anger any customer even a rebel names alderford maamcamp hill alderford major csa retired he answered you might not recognize me out of uniform and i used to wear a little chin beard ive shaved off on account of ive gotten a lot grayer since the war but i had some of my best times in washington right here in this coffeehouse and thats a fact now that im in town again i figured id stop by and see if you and the place made it through in one piece right glad you did thank you nellie didnt remember him at all a lot of confederate officers had spent a lot of time in the coffeehouse she wondered if more of them would start paying visits if they do theyd better have us money she thought since she didnt want this one to go without spending some cash she said now that youre back in town mr alderford what can i get you cup of coffee and a ham sandwich he answered he must have been thinking along with her for he added i wont pay in scrip and i wont pay with confederate banknotes either all right she got him what hed ordered while she was serving him she asked what are you doing in washington now selling cottonseed oil maam cottonseed oil and cottonseed cake alderford said cottonseed oil brings a dollar a gallon near enougha us dollar i mean and a us dollar brings enough confederate dollars to choke a mule two mules even he bit into his sandwich thats good thats mighty good you always had good grub here even when things were lean that was to keep you rebs coming in so i could spy on you nellie almost said it aloud to see the look on his face reluctantly she kept quiet word would get around down in the csa if more exofficers stopped by she wanted them in a mood to spend money not to burn down the coffeehouse clara had been amusing herself in what had been a storeroom before nellie filled it with toys and a cot to keep the toddler either busy or resting camp hill alderford smiled to see her that your granddaughter maam he asked reckon your pretty daughter found somebody else after what happened to poor nick that was a hard day a powerful hard day mama clara said and ran to nellie she was shy of strangers especially men with their deep voices alderfords eyebrows rose nellie nodded shes my daughter too she said i got married again after the war and i got a surprise not so long after i did and yes edna finally did get married just a few months ago she started to add that merle grimes was a veteran too but didnt bother men of the proper age who werent veterans were few and far between well im happy for you alderford said he beckoned to clara with a crooked index finger come here sweetheart ive got a present for you you can go to him clara nellie said but clara didnt want to go anywhere she clung to nellies skirt with one hand the thumb of the other was in her mouth here ill give it to your mama camp hill alderford told her she watched with round eyes as he reached into his hip pocket pulled out his wallet and extracted a brown confederate banknote here yare maam it was beautifully printed more handsome than us paper money that wasnt what made nellie gape shed never seen never imagined a bill gasping a little she asked whats this worth in real money about a dime alderford shrugged five cents next week a penny the week after that he paused maybe well be able to start setting our house in order again if we get to stop sending youall reparations if we dont lord knows what well do i havent got anything to do with that nellie said she hoped congress wouldnt let president sinclair cut off confederate reparations as far as she was concerned the weaker the rebs stayed the better what was the first thing they were likely to do if they ever got strong again as far as she could see head straight for washington was the best bet i know you dont camp hill alderford answered he held out his cup if youd fill that up for me id be obliged i sure will nellie said and did after detaching clara from her skirt alderford was the only customer in the place of course shed get another nickel out of him she kept looking at all the zeros on the bill hed given her for clara a sigh escaped her if only it were us green instead of cs brown the bell above the door chimed nellie looked that way with a smile of greeting on her facesomeone else to spend money but it wasnt it was her soninlaw alarm ran through her merle she exclaimed what are you doing here this time of day why arent you at work why did you have to come in when this goddamn reb amp here edna just telephoned me from the doctors office merle grimes answered since you dont have a telephone i figured id come over and tell you the newsyoure going to be a grandmother oh nellie said and then oh again she would have been more excited about the news if she hadnt been afraid camp hill alderford would start running his mouth wont you get in trouble for leaving your job in the middle of the morning she asked hoping to get grimes out of the coffeehouse as fast as she could but he shook his head my boss said it was all right were palswe were in the same company during the war small world isnt it isnt it just nellie said tonelessly congratulations maam alderford said he turned to merle grimes and to you too sir children make everything worthwhile erthank you grimes said he couldnt help realizing alderford was a confederateand probably couldnt help wondering why a confederate spoke as if he knew nellie so well nellie decided to take that bull by the horns mr alderford was major alderford during the war and used to stop by here a good deal oh grimes said not in surprise as nellie had but more for the sake of saying something he had a way of holding his cards close to his chest nellie had trouble telling what he was thinking thats right alderford said nellie sent him a look of appeal to keep him from saying any more she hated that she hated asking any man for anything and she feared the exrebel officer wouldnt even notice or would notice and decide to pay back some damnyankees for winning the war but alderford never said an untoward word he set coins us coinson the table and went on his way nellie let out a quiet sigh of relief shed got by with it but if more confederates came to visit could she keep on getting by with it one more thing to worry about she thought as if she didnt have enough already lucien galtier reached out and pressed the starter button on the dashboard of his chevrolet hed bought the automobile in large measure because it had a frenchmans name on it a ford would have been easier to come by the engine coughed before coming to noisy life the motorcar shuddered under him then settled into a steady vibration different even from the motion of a railroad car the closest comparison he could find his feet were still clumsy on gas and clutch and brake charles and georges had taken to driving more readily than he which infuriated him i will learn to do this and to do it well he muttered he did not talk to the automobile as he had to the horse he was talking only to himself he knew it and felt the lack he stalled the motorcar the first time he tried to shift from neutral up into low gear naturally georges had taken the moment before to come out of the barn as naturally luciens younger son laughed at his fathers fumbles and did not even try to keep that laughter to himself galtier called the automobile several names he would not have used on the horse even in the worst of moods then still wishing he had not bought the machine he started it once more and succeeded in driving away as he drew near riviereduloup he came up behind a horsedrawn wagonone very much like that which he had driven himself up till a few weeks before the cursed thing crawled along at a snails pace galtier squeezed the horn bulb again and again the stupid farmer sitting up there like a cowflop might have been deaf he refused either to speed up or to pull over at last seizing an opportunity lucien shot around him mauvaise calisse he shouted and eked out the malediction with gestures the other farmer smiled a smile that to galtier proved his feeblemindedness some people have no consideration galtier fumed none whatsoever he never once thought how he had behaved when driving a wagon rather than a motorcar traffic in riviereduloup was far heavier than he recalled from the days before the war automobiles had been rare then with most people traveling by wagon or carriage or on horseback now everyone seemed to have a motorcar and to drive it with a gallic disdain for consequences that matched galtiers own he cursed he shouted he waved his arms he blew his horn and blew it and blew it he fit right in finding a parking space was another adventure one made worse because the streets of riviereduloup had not been designed with the automobile in mind a good many motorcars were parked with two wheels in the road the other two up on the sidewalkssidewalks were none too wide either at last lucien imitated that example when he got out money jingled in his pockets some of the coins were from the usa a few from the canada of before the war and some from the republic of quebec as they were all minted to the same standard merchants took one lot as readily as another a newsboy was hawking papers on a street corner galtier gave him a couple of penniesone a us coin said one cent on the reverse the other an issue of quebec featured the fleurdelys and announced its value as un souand took a newspaper france in chaos shouted the headline he read the accompanying story as he walked back to the automobile police and soldiers had turned machine guns on rioters in paris furious about the worthless currency and about the countrys forced subservience to the german empire the reporter didnt seem to know what tone to take germany was the usas ally and so was also the ally of the republic of quebec but the quebecois sprang from french stock and nothing would ever change that the ambiguity made the writer take almost no tone at all but set forth what hed learned from the cable as baldly as if it were going down in a police blotter galtier sighed he didnt know how to feel about frances troubles either he wished she were not having such troubles but if the only way for her not to have troubles was for her to have won the war galtier shook his head too high a price to pay he murmured he would not have said that during the war he shrugged hed had the same thought many times before in many different contexts the world had changed too taken all together the changes pleased him he would not have said that during the war either when he knocked on the door to the house where nicole and leonard odoull lived his daughter answered almost at once tagging along behind her was little lucien staring gravely up at galtier he asked candy no no candy today i regret galtier answered his grandson clouded up and got ready to cry you know you arent supposed to do that nicole said and for a wonder little lucien didnt nicole smiled at galtier and what brings you here today papa nothing much he said grandly i was just out for a drive in my chevrolet and i thought i would stop in was that how a gentleman of leisure should sound he didnt know hed never met a gentleman of leisure ah nicole said you have the motorcar here then here in riviereduloup yes here in my pocketgaltier peered into it as if to make surehere in my pocket no nicole wrinkled her nose it certainly isnt hard to see sometimes where georges comes by it she remarked comes by what galtier demanded he was perhaps a sixteenth part as annoyed as he pretended to be his daughter knew as much will you let me drive your new motorcar papa she asked whats this now galtiers surprise was genuine how is it that you a girl a womanhe added that last with the air of a man granting a great concessioncan drive a motorcar leonard showed me papa nicole answered very much a woman and very much a woman of the new century it isnt very hard ive driven our ford any number of times its a handy thing to know dont you think what if you have a puncture and your husband is not there lucien asked i fix it she answered calmly ive done it once its a dirty job and not an easy job but i know i can do it again do you galtier muttered nicole hadnt yet mentioned her driving to marie or to denise he knew that for a fact if she had his wife and his next eldest daughter would have been nagging him to learn to drive too with charles and georges always wanting to go courting or just gallivanting around in the machine where would he ever find time to use it himself if his womenfolk were taking it too yes i do nicole answered the question he hadnt quite aimed at her and answered it with arrogant confidence a man might have envied and so may i drive your automobile thus directly confronted lucien found no choice but to yield very well he said but i will thank you to be careful of the delicate machineand of your delicate father as well nicole laughed for all the world as if hed been joking she reached down and took little luciens hand evidently she was not afraid to trust his life to what she knew behind the steering wheel galtiers heart had not pounded so since the war crossed the st lawrence nonetheless he led her to his mechanical pride and joy she slid into the drivers seat but then stopped in consternation everything is different papa she exclaimed on the ford the spark knob is on the left side of the steering column the throttle on the right i have a lever on the floor to my left for the emergency brake and clutch release and the pedals on the floor seem different from these too on the ford they are the high and lowspeed clutch the reverse pedal and the foot brake here they are the clutch the brake and the gas pedal galtier said gravely and this lever here shifts the gears i did not know motorcars were so different one from another i do not think you had better drive the chevrolet after all i dont either nicole looked so unhappy he reached out and touched her hand she went on leonard told me fords wereeccentric was the word he used i did not know how eccentric they were she brightened you must teach me to drive this motorcar too so i will be able to use whatever sort there is i already know how to steer everything else should be easy enough should it galtier said he still found it hard himself he hadnt got used to it as he had to managing a horse but nicole seemed to have been driving longer than he had he wondered why she hadnt told him she probably hadnt wanted him to feel bad when he had no automobile of his own maybe she also hadnt wanted him to know she could do anything so unladylike they traded places in the chevrolet nicole took charge of little lucien galtier started the motorcar and bounced it down off the curb and onto the street tell me what you are doing while you do it nicole said she was trying to watch his hand on the gearshift and his feet on the pedals at the same time galtier did explain as he drove he thought he might have trouble doing that but he didnt hed learned so recently everything was still fresh in his mind and came bubbling forth like a spring from out of the ground after a while he said you will want to try for yourself eh of course nicole replied and it was indeed of course galtier would have been astonished to hear any other answer he said in that case i will drive out of town before i let you back behind the wheel better you should learn where there are fewer targets the idea papa is to miss the other automobiles and the wagons nicole said oh yes i understand and the people and the walls also lucien said but if you are learning you do not yet hold the idea firmly in your mind he almost ran down a pedestrian proving he did not yet hold the idea firmly in his mind either the man jumped back and to one side then shouted angrily at him nicole said nothing at all she would have been bound to when she was living back at the farm has marriage taught her restraint galtier wondered it hadnt done any such thing for marie or had it better not to think about that perhaps once he got out into the countryside againnot a long drive riviereduloup being anything but a metropolishe stopped the chevrolet shut off the engine and got out nicole slid slowly and carefully across the front seat to take her place behind the wheel then when he got in on the passenger side handed him little lucien who had fallen asleep in her lap the boy stirred and muttered but did not wake nowto start i have only to press this button nicole said and hit the starter sure enough the engine awoke this is easier than with the ford next i let out the clutch and put the motorcar in gear nicole stalled a couple of times before she managed to get the automobile moving and her shift from low to second was abrupt enough to wake up galtiers grandson but galtier praised her anyhow why not he too had stalled not long before and she did know how to steer once she got going she piloted the chevrolet with confidence very good galtier said after shed churned up dust along several miles of country road you were not fooling me after all you really can drive of course i can nicole said she was shifting gears a bit more smoothly now learning to ease off the gas pedal as she came down on the clutch and this car is easier in nearly every way than leonards ford i see no reason at all why mama and denise should not also learn oh you dont galtier said and nicole shook her head defying him to make something of it she wouldnt have done that when she was living at home either leonard odoull lucien thought kept too loose a rein on her now but she had shown she could drive if she could were marie and denise too ignorant they would never let him forget it if he thought so with a shrug that made little lucien giggle galtier added it could be that you have reason and then it could even be that i will tell them you have reason oh papa nicole said fondly and galtier was reduced to mumbling tabernac he thought she is a wife now and so she sees right through me sylvia enos didnt go down to t wharf nearly so often these days as she had in the past for one thing her connections with the fishermen and the folk who worked in the fish markets had slipped with the passage of time for another going down to the wharf where george had worked tore open old wounds but all her old wounds had been torn open when she found out that that confederate submersible skipper had fired the torpedo that sank the uss ericsson she knew her husbands killers name roger kimball even though hed attacked the us destroyer after the war was over he still walked free down in thecsa president sinclair had done no more than issue a tepid protest that ate at sylvia too lots of people still sang the socialists praises sylvia supposed they had done good things for the workers of the usa but they hadnt done what she most wanted had she had a vote upton sinclair would have lost it with the old wounds already bleeding again going to t wharf couldnt make them hurt any worse after sylvia got off work from her saturday half day she gathered up george jr and mary jane and took them down by the sea they enjoyed it they kept exclaiming over the raucous gulls and over all the fishing boats tied up to the wharf sure does stink ma mary jane said more admiringly than not its supposed to smell this way sylvia answered tar and salt air horse manure and old fishwithout them t wharf would have been a different a lesser place seeing the boats made sylvia want to exclaim too but for a different reason from that of her children the fishing fleet had changed while she wasnt looking so to speak before the war most of the boats had been steamers with some still relying on sail now diesel and gasolinepowered boats were driving steam from the scene they changed one element of the wharfs familiar smell and not to the better in her mind she far preferred coal smoke to the stink of diesel exhaust she walked along the wharf looking into the boats for men she knew men from whom she might buy some choice fish before they ever got to market that sort of business was highly unofficial but went on all the time fishermen needed extra cash in their pockets enough to make them anything but shy about taking it from the pockets of the boat owners sylvia was discovering to her dismay that the fishermen were almost as unfamiliar as the boats they took to sea when from behind her someone called mrs enos she turned so did her children george jr asked whos the spook ma fortunately he kept his voice down you hush your mouth she told him charlie white isnt a spook hes a very nice man he used to be the cook on the ripple when your father sailed in her she waved to white who was coming up the wharf toward her hello charlie its been a long time you stayed in the navy i see he brushed a hand across the front of his dark blue uniform tunic i surely did mrs enos works not near as hard and thats a fact in the navy all ive got to do is cook his accent was two parts boston one part something that put sylvia in mind of the csa he looked at george jr and mary jane good god but theyve grown finelooking children mrs enos thank you sylvia said her voice shaky seeing an old friend of her husbandsand charlie had been a friend even if he was coloredhere at this place where george had worked left her close to tears white solemnly nodded perhaps understanding some of what was going through her mind he said i was right sorry when i found out george didnt come home from the war maam thank you sylvia said again even more softly than before but then fury filled her and she asked did you find out george was aboard the ericsson she didnt have to explain that to the negro cook no doubt she wouldnt have had to explain it to any navy man no maam he said i didnt know that i think its a crying shame we aint going after the dirty rotten coward who sank that ship a lot harder than we are so do i sylvia said grimly the president is lilylivered mary jane declared she was just echoing her mother but sylvia didnt want her views aired in public no on second thought maybe she did werent a lot of people in the navy who voted for sinclair charlie white said must have been an awful lot of people on dry land who did though yes sylvia said then she remembered her manners hows your family charlie everyone well sure are and praise the lord for that the colored man answered got me a new little boy since i saw you last i think eddies going to turn two in a couple weeks good for you sylvia said she and george might have had more children by now if only she pulled back from that what are you doing on t wharf now same thing you are i bet white said buying fish im chief cook on the fort bentonbig armored cruiser sailors eat like pigs you know that theyre men sylvia said and charlie white laughed sylvia wasnt sure shed said anything funny men had appetites women satisfied them that was the way the world had always worked nobodyd ever bothered asking women what they thought of it men had power too well well what have we got here someone said looks like old home week or im a chinaman sylvia knew that voice hello fred she said turning its been a while fred butcher had been first mate aboard the ripple when sylvia got a good look at him she had to fight to keep her face straight he was up in his fifties now and his hair and kaiser bill mustache had gone snowy white hed put on weight too which shocked her even more hed always been skinny and quickmoving like a lizard only his eyes clever and knowing were as she remembered fixing on them let her say good to see you and sound as if she meant it anything i can do for you folks butcher asked shaking hands with charlie white hed always known the angles a first mate who didnt know them couldnt do his job you need fish talk to me im not going to sea any more im a factor with lb godspeed and company if i cant get it for you better and cheaper than anybody else on t wharf ill eat my straw boater that would be funny mary jane said and butcher took off the hat and made as if to do it she laughed so did george jr godspeeds a good outfit charlie white said seriously theyve been in business since not long after the war of secession havent they thats rightused to be called marston and company butcher said so what can i do for you charlie cod halibut five hundred pounds of each for delivery to the fort benton at the navy yard white said they haggled hard over the price white gave butcher no special deference either because of his race or from old association business was business sylvias children were fidgeting by the time fred butcher said all right charlie thats a deal jesus the way you jewed me down anybodyd reckon you were spending your own money not uncle sams things are tight these days white answered my own bossll be all over me if i dont watch every dime well youve done that by god butcher said im liable to catch the dickens for giving you such a good deal charlie white grinned proudly sylvia didnt believe butcher for a minute hed never hurt himself or his firm nodding to her butcher asked how about you mrs e you want a thousand pounds of fish too ill give you the same deal i gave charlie he winked at her give me the same price per pound for five pounds of good cod as you gave charlie for five hundred then sylvia said at once instead of winking fred butcher looked pained come on mrs e have a heart he gets a discount for quantity then he seemed to listen to what hed said a moment before all right already we wont go broke over five pounds of cod come on down to number sixteen and ill take care of you you want to come too charlie see what youre getting you bet i do the negro said and if what you deliver aint what i see now godspeedll have some talking to do with the us navy like i say its a good company but things like that can happen i want to make sure ahead of time they dont ill make sure of it butcher promised charlie nodded as if to say hed check anyway his exshipmate unfazed led him and sylvia and her children along the wharf to number sylvia got first choice and picked a couple of fine young cod when she started to open her handbag butcher waved for her not to bother now that i think about it these are on the house sylvia couldnt have been more astonished if hed burst into song you dont have to do that fred she said you were doing me a favor when you gave me a good deal this is too much no no no the quick decisive way butcher shook his head reminded sylvia of the dapper man hed been only a few years before i just recalledgeorge was on the ericsson wasnt he he waited for sylvia to nod then went on take em then and dont say another word about it times cant be easy for you they arent sylvia admitted god bless you fred she dipped her head to

theres one more thing i want to get while were out come on you two were going to abies hurray sylvia couldnt tell whether george jr or mary jane cheered louder they both loved going to the pawnshop anything in the worldanything from anywhere in the world was liable to be there sylvia remembered seeing a set of false teeth smiling at her from the front window one day next to that who could get excited about something as mundane as a stuffed owl abie finkelstein the proprietor of the pawnshop looked rather like a frog hello mrs enos he said in a thick not quite german accent vot can i do for you today if your little children a piece candy from the bowl there on the counter take i do not think i even notice at sylvias nod george jr and mary jane helped themselves finkelstein looked a question at sylvia i dont want any candy thanks but that wasnt all of what hed asked not even close she pointed to the items hanging on brackets on the wall behind him let me have that one please all right he got it down everybody needs these days to be safe yes sylvia said everybody does xvii cincinnatus driver pulled into the des moines railroad yard well before six in the morning well before sunup most of the year hed found business there was better and steadier than along the riverfront he missed going over by the river hed been doing it for a long time both down in covington and since moving to his new home here but he didnt miss an empty wallet not even a little he didnt early as he was several other trucks were already waiting for the chicago and north western railroad line train to pull into the yard three or four others came in while he drank lukewarm coffee from a flask elizabeth had given him he sat in the cab of the duryea and yawned it wasnt so much that he hadnt got enough sleep the night before more that he was always busy and always tired the train pulled into the yard at right on time then the drivers scrambled to make deals with the conductor who did the same job as a steamboat clerk and had the same cold blood in his veins for a while cincinnatus had had trouble getting any work at all from these hardeyed gentlemen that was partly because hed been new to des moines and even more because he had a dark skin he knew as much hed expected nothing more but he was still here hed got his foot in the door hed proved he was reliable and now he was dickering with a conductor over a load of rolled oats for one of the last few livery stables in town have a heart jerry he said putting a hand over his own heart you wouldnt pay that low if i was white jerry rolled his eyes youre a hebe in blackface cincinnatus thats what you are you want me to see if i can get somebody else to haul the stuff for that price go ahead cincinnatus said somebody else wants to lose money on gasoline and wear and tear on his truck thats his affair you dont pay me another dollar it aint worth my time and trouble you are a hebe the conductor said all right dammit another four bits six bits cincinnatus said six bits and i break even anyways what a damn liar you are tell me you dont sandbag when you play poker jerry puffed out his cheeks then exhaled awright six bits the hell with it deal deal cincinnatus said at once and went to get his hand truck to move the barrels of oats when he got to the livery stable the proprietor a big ruddy whitehaired man named hiram schacht said stow the barrels in that corner there he pointed will do mistuh schacht cincinnatus answered from everything hed seen schacht didnt treat him any worse because he was colored the stable owner approved of anyone who helped him care for his beloved horses the trouble was he had fewer horses to care for every month people kept buying automobiles as cincinnatus rolled barrel after barrel past the old man schacht sighed and said getting harder and harder to stay in business back before the war id have gone through an order this size in a week now itll last me two maybe three he scratched at his bushy mustache pretty soon i wont need to order any oats at all thatll cut down on my overhead now wont it his laugh held little mirth well suh you dont see me bringin you these oats in a wagon with a team pullin it now do you cincinnatus said automobiles and trucks theyre the coming thing oh i know i know schacht said unoffended theyd had this conversation before but im heading toward my threescore and ten as the good book says up till a couple years ago i was sure the stable would last out my lifetime and i was damn glad of it too im just flatout crazy about horses motorcars have no soul to em and they smell bad too anyway though i aint so sure now im lasting longer than i reckoned i would and more people are getting rid of their horses faster than i reckoned they would cant blame me for that cincinnatus said as he trundled the dolly back out to the duryea for another barrel of oats never had me a horsenever could afford onebefore i got the chance to buy my truck by then i figured a truckd do me more good do your wallet more good anyway schacht said and cincinnatus nodded that was what hed meant all right the stable owner went on a horsed do your spirit more good though you can make friends with a horseoh not with all horses some of em are stupid as fenceposts and a hell of a lot meaner and god knows i know itbut with some horses anyways what can you feel about a truck when it breaks down all you want to do is kill it but you cant even do that on account of the son of a bitch is already dead having had the urge to murder the duryea a good many times since buying it cincinnatus could only nod he did say mans got to eat oh no doubt about it schacht said i dont begrudge folks their autos and their truckswell not much i dont anyways but back when you were a pup everybody had horsesnear enough everybody i guess i ought to sayand motorcars were toys for rich men by the time you get as old as i am itll be the other way round i bet everybody have himself a motorcar but only rich folksll be able to keep horses could be so cincinnatus agreed in fact he found it very likely and likely to happen sooner than schacht had predicted too he wouldnt have been surprised to find out that the liverystable man thought the same thing you take care of yourself cincinnatus schacht said after hed brought in the last barrel of oats and take care of that rattletrap contraption you drive thank you kindly mistuh schacht cincinnatus touched the brim of his cloth cap in salute hope its me bringin your oats next time you need some i wouldnt mind schacht scratched at that walrus mustache again he didnt bother waxing it up into a stylish kaiser bill as cincinnatus fired up the duryea the stable owner added by the time you get as old as i am folks will be trading in their autos for flying machinesbut rich folks still keep horses he shouted to make himself heard over the thunderous roar of the engine flying machines cincinnatus said to himself all he knew about them was that he didnt want to go up in one the miserable things were too likely to fall out of the sky with gruesomely fatal results the newspapers liked to play up maybe theyd solve all the problems by the time achilles was an old man maybe they wouldnt too either way it would be for his son to worry about he picked up another hauling job when he went back to the railroad yard and then another one that one took him through his own neighborhoodright past the school where achilles went the kindergarten classes were just letting out as he drove by sure enough there was achilles along with his schoolmates who included blacks whites and the daughter of the chinese laundryman upstairs in kentucky cincinnatus would never have dreamt that his son would go to a school whites also used iowans seemed to take it for granted cincinnatus squeezed the bulb of the duryeas raucous horn all the little kids looked his way thats my pa achilles squealed loud enough for cincinnatus to hear him over the duryeas motor wow what a swell truck a white boy exclaimed also loudly cincinnatus laughed waved and drove on only to a sixyearold would this truck have seemed swell had the kid said funnylooking or beatup he would have been closer to the mark but cincinnatus had succeeded in impressing one of his sons pals so swinging by the school had been all to the good pals cincinnatus spoke the word hed just thought could a negro boy in des moines have real white friends hed probably have to be able to if he expected to have more than a handful of friends there wouldnt be enough other colored boys to go around but for a negro from covington it was a strange and troubling notion cincinnatus would have been willing to bet it was a strange and troubling notion for a lot of whites from des moines too when he got home that evening achilles was still bubbling over with pride louie henderson and joey nichols both said that was the swellest truck they ever saw he reported thats good cincinnatus said he paused and listened again in his mind to what his son had just told him when hed been achilles age back before the turn of the century he would surely have said they ever seen he still said things like that every now and then or maybe more often than every now and then achilles had said them too till he started going to school hed listened to his mother and father and while they were still down in covington to his grandmother as well now he listened to his teacher and to the boys and girls in class with him yeah hes learnin to talk like a yankee all right elizabeth said when cincinnatus remarked on it over supper i seen that myself she didnt notice her own slip to her it wasnt a slip it was just the way she talked it had been the same for cincinnatus too but it wasnt any more the more like a white he talked the less likely people hereeven other negroes here hed seen were to reckon him a dumb nigger not being thought of that way usually worked to his advantage after supper achilles read aloud from his primer and cincinnatus read to him from an abridgement of robinson crusoe hed picked up for a dime in a secondhand store the sentences in the primer and the story of the castaway both used white folks grammarthey used it rather better than a lot of the white folks with whom cincinnatus did business the more of those kinds of sentences achilles read and had read to him the more natural they would seem and the more he would likely end up sounding like a white man himself up here that couldnt help but be useful after achilles had gone to bed cincinnatus sat on the sofa and read ahead in robinson crusoe he was enjoying the tale himself elizabeth mended clothes on a chair under the other electric lamp shed sew a few stitches along a seam yawn and then sew a few more stitches cincinnatus set down his book you know he said weve done a lot better for ourselves up here than i figured we would fore we left covington things keep going good a little while longer maybe we can think about buyin us a house here he spoke hesitantly he wasnt used to getting even a little ahead of the game elizabeth yawned again you reckon achilles asleep yet she asked despite the yawn cincinnatus thought he knew why she asked that question hope so he answered a large male grin on his face sure do hope so his wife would usually make a face of her own in response to that grin tonight she ignored it didnt want to say nothin where he can hear it she told cincinnatus not yettoo soon but i reckon im in the family way again for true he said and elizabeth nodded he thought about that then started to laugh his wifes eyes flashed whats funny dont you want another baby dont have much choice do i cincinnatus said but that wasnt close to the right answer he tried to improve it just when you think you get up on things life goes and hands you another surprise this one though it sure enough is a nice surprise he waited anxiously then thought of something better to do he walked over and kissed elizabeth even without words that did turn out to be the right answer jefferson pinkard put on his white shirt and butternut trousers both were freshly laundered and pressed ever since throwing emily out of his cottage hed grown careless about the shirts and overalls and dungarees he wore to work when he donned the white and butternut though he wasnt just himself he was part of the freedom party if he didnt look sharp he let the party down he went into the bathroom examined himself in the streaky mirror there and frowned he rubbed some pinauds brilliantine into his hair washed the greasy stuff off his hands and combed out a nice straight part thats more like it he said he grabbed his club off the sofa in the front room and headed out the door bedford cunningham sat on his front porch enjoying the warm june sunday afternoon by the glass at his side and by the way he sprawled hed been enjoying it for quite a while pinkard raised the club as he walked by his neighbor his former friend cringed that was what hed wanted to accomplish he kept walking he wasnt the only man in party regalia whod come to the trolley stop by the sloss works company housing three or four of his comrades greeted him as he came up freedom freedom he answered and grinned a fierce grin reckon were going to teach wade hampton v a thing or two about sticking his nose in where its not welcome aint we boys thats right thats just right the other freedom party men said almost in chorus jeff was glad to have the reassurance though he didnt really need it hampton might have won the election but he had a lot of damn nerve to go barnstorming around the country making speeches and trying to pump up the whigs who did he think he was jake featherston or somebody nobody sat near the men in white and butternut as the trolley rattled through the streets of birmingham all the way out to the alabama state fairgrounds at the west edge of town where hampton would speak when negroes got on or off they edged past the freedom party men and made their way to or from the back of the trolley car as if afraid they would be set upon at any moment they had reason to fear such things had happened before state fairgrounds end of the line the trolley driver announced and loudly clanged his bell end of the line for wade hampton all right pinkard said and the other freedom party men laughed wolfishly caleb briggs the dentist who headed the freedom party in birmingham was marshaling his forces at the edge of the fairgrounds wont be easy this time boys he rasped in his gasruined voice goddamn governor got wind of what we had in mind and called out the goddamn militia anything we want were going to have to take pinkard looked west across the rolling grassy countryside to the platform from which president hampton would speak sure enough there were men in butternut and oldfashioned gray uniforms along with those in shirtsleeves or black civilian coats the sun glinted off bayonets hed seen that too many times in texas to mistake it for anything else suddenly the club in his hand didnt seem such a wonderful weapon at all he asked we move on those sons of bitches they going to open up on us i dont know briggs answered only one way to find out though and thats what were going to do he raised his voice anybody who hasnt got the balls to go forward run along home to mama the rest of us well see if those summer soldiers mean it or if theyll fold when we come at em nobodys stopped us yet my bet is nobody can lets go everybody advanced pinkards mouth was dry as it had been when he came up out of the trenches but he kept going it wasnt that he lacked fear far more that he feared letting his comrades know he was afraid if they didnt feel the same way hed have been astonished on they came through the anklehigh grass past the little groves of shade trees planted here and there on the fairgrounds the muggy heat accounted for only some of the sweat on jeffs face the militiamen deployed to meet the freedom party stalwarts they were outnumbered but they had the rifles and the bayonets and the helmets pinkard didnt like the way they moved their manner said they were not about to give way for anything or anybody to applause from the smallish crowd in front of him president hampton began to speak pinkard paid scant heed to his amplified words why bother theyd be full of lies anyhow the major moving out ahead of the militiamen was more important the fellow held up a hand you men halt right there he said this is your first last and only warning hold up boys caleb briggs said and the freedom party men obeyed him not the militia major he spoke to the officer who are you to tell us we cant protest against the socalled policies of the government in richmond you can stay right here the major answered you can shout your fool heads off i dont give a damn about that if you take one step forward from where you stand now i will assume you are attempting to riot not to protest and i will order you shot down like dogs those are my orders and i shall carry them out so will my men if you think we are bluffing sir i invite you to try us jeff didnt think the major was bluffing the soldiers behind him looked ready even eager to open fire the governor had picked with care the troops hed activated caleb briggs came to the same conclusion youll pay for this major when the day comes he hissed if you take that step sir youll pay for it now the major told him your ruffians have gotten away with too many things for too long you will not get away with anything today by god you may do what the law allows if you do even a single thing the law does not allow you will pay for it the stalwarts jeered him and hooted at him and cursed him he seemed to worry about that no more than a man with a good slicker and a broadbrimmed hat worried about going out in the rain and not one of the freedom party men took the step forward that would have made the officer issue his fatal order all right boys briggs said maybe we wont give hampton the tyrant whatfor today in person but we can let him know what we think of him right this here country still has freedom of speech freedom was the chant they raised a loud and mocking chant jefferson pinkard bellowed out the word as ferociously as he could doing everything in his power to drown out the president of the confederate states as far as he was concerned jake featherston should have been up on the platform a few hundred yards away he would have told the truth not the bland lies wade hampton v spewed forth the bland crowd ate them up too and cheered hampton almost as if they had true spirit freedom freedom freedom all the stalwarts were roaring doing their best to show hampton and show the world the militia hadnt cowed them maybe next time well bring rifles too pinkard thought it had almost come to that during the presidential campaign after fighting the damnyankees he did not shy away from fighting his own government freedom freedom freedom when the first shot rang out from the grove of hackberry trees off to the right of the freedom party men jeff didnt hear it but he saw wade hampton v stagger on the platform and clutch at his chest he did hear the second shot that second bullet must have caught hampton in the head or the heart for he stopped staggering and went down as if all his bones had turned to water a few of the stalwarts whooped when the president of the confederate states fell most though pinkard among them stared in the horrified silence that filled the crowd of hamptons backers men dashed across the platform to the presidents side jeff didnt think theyd be able to do much for him hed seen too many men go down in that boneless way during the great war hardly any of them ever got up again from the hackberry grove came a wild exultant shout freedom sergeant davenport sergeant sullivan the militia major rapped out take your troops in among those trees and bring that man to me i dont care whether hes breathing or not but bring him to me two squads of militiamen trotted toward the hackberries another shot rang out a man fell another shot from the trees this one a miss the bullet whining past not far from pinkard without conscious thought he threw himself flat a lot of freedom party men and a lot of militiamen did the same the advancing militiamen opened fire on the grove caleb briggs stayed on his feet more than gas roughened his voice as he said that man is not one of ours major my god i one of the dignitaries on the platform walked up to the microphone president hampton is dead he sounded astonished disbelieving jeff understood that he felt stunned and empty himself hed been readyhed been eagerto fight for the freedom party but this no one had murderedassassinated he supposed was the proper worda president in the history of the confederate states or in the history of the united states before the confederacy seceded drawing his pistol the militia major aimed it at briggs more shots came from the hackberries another militiaman went down with a shriek but some of the others were in among the trees the major ignored that action infinite bitterness filled his voice not one of yours you say he shouts your shout he uses your methods politics was not war till the freedom party made it so now listen here briggs began triumphant cries rang out from the hackberry grove through them the major said no sir you listen to me get your rabble out of here by the count of five or i will turn my men loose on them and we will have a massacre the likes of which this country has never seen maybe its one we should have had a couple of years agothen things wouldnt have come to this one two three go home boys caleb briggs said quickly his face was gray for the love of god go home theres been enough blood spilled today too much the militia major said far too much you disappoint me mr briggs i would have liked to shoot you down briggs stood silent letting himself be reviled as jefferson pinkard got to his feet militiamen came out of the hackberry grove they were dragging a body by the feet the corpse wore butternut trousers and a green shirt now soaked with blood the gunman must have been almost invisible in among the trees jeff stared at his long pale sharpnosed face hed seen that face at party meetings not regularly but every so often the fellow was named grady grady somethingorother jeff knew hed talked with him but couldnt remember his surname from the appalled looks on other party stalwarts faces he knew they also recognized the assassin the militia major saw that too not one of yours eh he repeated another lie get out of my sight before i forget myself briggs went jeff stumbled after him along with his comrades someone close by was moaning after a moment he realized it was himself what do wewhat do ido now he wondered sweet suffering jesus what do i do now anne colleton was frying chicken for supper when her brother came into the kitchen of the large apartment they still shared she started to greet him then got a good look at his face she hadnt seen that kind of dazed horrified expression since the war above the cheerful crackling of the chicken she asked my god tom whats gone wrong by way of answer he held up the copy of the columbia south carolinian he carried under his arm the headline was enormous and very very black president murdered in birmingham under it a halfpage subhead said freedom party assassin shot dead at alabama state fairgrounds my god anne said again oh my god mechanically she kept turning the floured chicken in the hot fat i think youd better do the same with your investments in the freedom party as you did with your confederate investments right after the war tom told her and thats get rid of em this time tomorrow jake featherstons going to be worth less than a confederate dollar and thats saying something she shook her head featherston would never order that kind of thing i didnt say he did though i wouldnt put it past him if he thought he could get away with it tom replied but that hasnt got anything to do with it you think what he ordered or didnt order matters only thing that matters is one of his people pulled the trigger whos going to vote for a party that blows the head off the president if they dont care what hes up to no one anne said dully tom was right she wasnt so naive as to pretend otherwise shed been riding the crest of the freedom party wave up and up and up shed been sure she could ride it all the way into the presidents residence in richmond and so she could have she remained certain of that but now the son of a bitch she whispered the stupid son of a bitch who the late grady calkins tom said you bet he was a stupid son of a bitch but who built a whole party out of stupid sons of bitches who aimed em at the country and fired em off first with bare knuckles and then with clubs and pistols you know who as well as i do sis is it any wonder one ofem picked up a tredegar and decided to go president hunting anne had never thought never dreamt such a thing might happen that didnt necessarily mean it was any wonder though not when you looked at it the way her brother suggested what do we do now she said she rarely asked for advice but her mind remained blank with shock tom didnt have a lot of help to offer i dont know he said you burned a lot of bridges when you went with featherston how the devil do you propose to get back across them i dont know either anne said maybe things will straighten out somehow even to herself she didnt sound as if she believed that hot lard splashed up and bit the back of her hand she swore with a fervor that wrung a couple of embarrassed chuckles from her brother the chicken was ready a few minutes later in the years since marshlands burned shed turned into a pretty fair cook before then shed have had trouble boiling water but she took no pleasure in crispy skin or moist juicy flavorsome flesh she hardly noticed what she ate as a matter of fact the chicken was bones and the baked potato that went with it reduced to its jacket without any apparent passage of time after supper tom pulled a bottle of whiskey from the shelf where it sat that anne noticed pour me a slug too will you she asked i sure will he did anne wanted to drink to the point of oblivion but refrained far more than most in the confederate states she appreciated the value of a clear head but oh the temptation as she drank the one drink she allowed herself she read the newspaper tom had brought home grady calkins was an outofwork veteran whod belonged to the freedom party past that the reporters hadnt found out much about him that was plenty that was more than plenty he shouted freedom after he shot hampton down tom said as if to rub salt in the wound yes i read that anne answered its a disaster i admit it i dont see how i can deny it its a disaster every way you look at it it sure is tom said god only knows what kind of president burton mitchel will make i dont think anybody outside of arkansas knows anything about burton mitchel maybe including god anne said tom let out a startled snort of laughter anne went on the whigs plucked him out of the senate to balance the ticket featherston would have done the same thing if hed chosen willy knight all mitchel was supposed to do was sit there for the next six years hell do more than that now her brother said christ a backwoods bumpkin running the country till just what we need look on the bright side anne told him i didnt know there was any bright side to look on tom answered of course there is there always is anne said the bright side here is how could things get any worse thats a point tom acknowledged the other side of the coin is now we get to find out how things get worse anne opened the south carolinian to the inside page on which the story of president hamptons assassination was continued she read aloud after taking the oath of office president mitchel declared a week of national mourning and lamentation the new president prayed for the aid of almighty god in the difficult times that lie ahead and said he would do his best to promote internal order establish good relations with foreign neighbors and put the currency on a sound basis once more her lip curled and while hes at it hell walk across the james river without getting his trouser cuffs wet whats he supposed to say her brother asked and she had no good answer tom continued those are the things that need doing no doubt about it i havent any idea whether he can do them but at least he knows that much and after thistom took a deep breathafter this maybe people will back off and give him room to move in for a while maybe anne said i dont know if that will help but maybe she shoved the newspaper to one side and maybe everything ive done since the end of the war to try to set the csa to rights went up in smoke with a couple of shots from that maniacs gun if the militiamen hadnt killed that calkins id be glad to do it myselfbut i think id have to stand in line behind jake featherston probably tom agreed calkins may have killed the freedom party along with a whig president featherston has to know thathe isnt stupid but hes the one who raised the devil hes got no business being surprised if it ended up turning on him that isnt fair anne said but even in her own ears her voice lacked conviction tom said nothing at all leaving her with the last word shed never been so sorry to have it when she walked to the tailors the next morning people in the streets of st matthews white and black alike fell silent and stared at her as she went by theyd been talking about the assassination they started talking about the assassination again as soon as she passed while she was close by they would not talk some of them moved away from her as if they didnt want her shadow to fall on them shed been the dominant force in this part of south carolina for more than a decade people had always granted her the deference shed earned by the way they acted now she might have just escaped from a leper colony going into aaron rosenblums shop felt like escaping clack clack clack went the treadle of his sewing machine the clacking stopped when the bell above his door rang he looked up from the piece of worsted hed been guiding through the machine good morning miss colleton he said polite but no more than polite he got to his feet i have ready the skirt you asked me to make for you good i hoped you would as was often her way anne chose to take the bull by the horns terrible about president hampton yesterday yes the little old tailor looked at her over the tops of his halfglasses a very terrible thing but what can you expect from a party that would sooner fight than think rosenblum had to know she backed the freedom party shed made no secret of iton the contrary if he thought he could rebuke her like this if that was so the party was in as much trouble as shed feared in a tight voice she said the freedom party is trying to make the confederate states strong again oh yes of course the tailor had a peculiar accent half lazy south carolina low country the other half yiddish and i i am a lucky man to live now in the confederacy in russia where i am from parties that try to make the country strong again go after the jews here you go after black people instead so i am safe yes i am a lucky man anne stared at him she knew sarcasm when she heard it and rosenblums words held an uncomfortable amount of truth that isnt all the freedom party does anne said the tailor did not answer what hung in the air was yes you also shoot the president twice now in two days she would sooner not have been left with the last word she attempted briskness let me see the skirt if you please yes maam he gave it to her then waved her to a changing room try it on i will alter it if it does not suit you try it on she did the gray wool skirt fit perfectly around the waist she might be irked at rosenblum but he did good work and the length was in the new mode as shed requested it showed off not only her ankles but also several inches of shapely calf tom would pitch a fit too bad for tom roger kimball would approve though hed sooner see her naked altogether she changed back into the black skirt shed worn then paid rosenblum for the new gray one a bargain at two billion dollars thank you very much he said tucking the banknotes into a drawer youre welcome she said and then i am sorry the president is dead i dont care whether you believe me or not if you didnt care you wouldnt say you didnt care rosenblum answered while she was still unraveling that he went on i do believe you miss colleton but now you believe me too a party that shouts and shoots for freedom is not a party that really wants it another paradox anne shook her head i havent got time for riddles today good morning the new skirt folded over her arm she stalked out of the tailors shop chester martin sat down in a folding chair at the socialist party hall near the toledo steel mill where he worked what did you call the freedom party down in the csa he asked albert bauer reaction on the march was that it you hit the nail right on the head yeah even for a reactionary party shooting a reactionary president dead because hes not reactionary enough to suit them takes a lot of doing bauer allowed theyll be sorry too you mark my words theyre sorry already ill bet martin said itll be a cold day in hell before they come so close to winning an election again theyll be sorrier too bauer predicted theyve done something i wouldnt have bet they could theyve made people in the united states feel sorry for the confederate states theyve even made me feel that way and some rebel bastard shot me martin said but shooting a president he shook his head nobodys ever done that before there or here what is the world coming to revolution bauer answered and the reactionaries in the csa just gave the progressive forces here a leg up before president sinclair couldnt have gotten ending reparations through congress if his life depended on it now though i think he may just have the votes to pull it off do you martin wasnt so sure he liked the idea as far as i can see wed be better off if the confederates stayed broke and weak sure we would in the short run bauer said but in the long run if the confederate states keep going down the drain who does that help that featherston lunatic almost won the election last year because the rebs were in such bad shape what happens if they get worse well they arent going to have a revolutionnot a red one anyway martin said he got up went over to a coffeepot that sat on top of an iron stove and poured himself a cup after he set it down on the table he lit a cigarette bauer waited patiently till hed puffed a couple of times then nodded no they wont have a red revolution not right away its a conservative country and marxism is tied to the black man there which means the white man has or thinks he has a strong extra reason to hate it but the confederates time is coming too sooner or later all the capitalist countries will have their revolutions he spoke with the certainty of a devout catholic talking about the miracle of transubstantiation chester martins faith in socialism was newer more pragmatic and neither so deep nor so abiding he said maybe so al but theres liable to be a hell of a long time hiding in that sooner or later the dialectic doesnt say how fast things will happen bauer answered calmly it just says they will happen and thats enough for me maybe for you martin said me id sort of like to know whether a revolutions coming in my time or whether its something my greatgrandchildren will be waiting forif i ever have any he wasnt so young as he had been there were times when he wished hed found a girl as soon as he came home from the war or maybe even before then but work in the foundry and work for the socialist party left little time for courting or even thinking about courting back when hed been a democrat hed thought socialist girls were loose without a moral to their name people said it so often hed been sure it was true now rather to his regret he knew better a lot of the women in the socialist party were married to socialist men a lot of the ones who werent might as well have been married to the party that left slim pickings albert bauer said even if we dont get a revolution in the csa any time soon we dont want the reactionaries in charge down there that would turn the class struggle on its head as far as im concerned keeping the freedom party down is reason enough to let reparations go well maybe martin said he wouldnt say any more than maybe no matter how his friend tried to argue him around he was sorry the confederates had had their president shot he wouldnt have wished that even on the csa but not wishing anything bad on the confederate states didnt necessarily mean he wished anything good on them either after he got home that evening the topic came up again around the supper table hed expected it would the newsboys were hawking papers by shouting about reparations what do you think chester stephen douglas martin asked you were the one who was doing the fighting hard to say pa martin answered i used to think that if i ever saw a reb drowning id toss him an anvil nowi just dont know cant we let the war be over at last louisa martin said havent both sides been through enough yet when can we be satisfied might as well ask the mormons out west ma her daughter sue said they just took some shots at a couple of army trucksdid you see that in the newspaper they dont forget we beat them you can bet the confederates havent forgotten we beat them so why should we forget it it goes both ways though chester said its not an easy question if we keep holding the rebs down theyll hate us on account of that they did it to us for years and years after the war of secession and then after the second mexican war do we want them thinking about nothing but paying us back the way we worked so hard to get even with them and with england and france you sound like a socialist all right his father said laughing pass the peas will you you lousy red chester laughed too and passed the bowl talking to you and mother i sound like a socialist when i talk to people down at the socialist hall i sound like a democrat half the time ive noticed that before im stuck in the middle you might say people who can see both sides of the question usually are his mother told him its not the worst place in the world to be sue martin looked curiously at chester with that purple heart in your bedroom id think youd be the last one to want to let the confederates up off the floor he shrugged like mother says maybe its time for the war to be over and done with besides the one thing i dont want to do is have to fight those soandsos again talking about a new war almost made him slip back into the foul language of the trenches if they can settle down because theyre not paying reparations any more that might not be too bad you make good sense son stephen douglas martin said his wife nodded after a moment so did sue martins father went on now what are the odds that anybody in congress would know common sense if it flew around philadelphia in an aeroplane theres a socialist majority martin said but that didnt prove anything and he knew it well just have to wait and see wont we out of the blue sue asked how do you think that congresswoman you met would vote you know the one i meanthe one whose brother got wounded while he was in your squad flora hamburger martin said yeah sure i know who you mean thats a good question she usually does whats right i dont really know well have to keep watching the newspapers i guess flora hamburger louisa martin snapped her fingers i know where i saw that name shes the one who got engaged to the vice president a little while ago she looked from her son to her daughter and back again as if to say getting engaged would satisfy her catching a vice president was unnecessary mother sue said in warning tones shes just giving you a rough time martin said that got his sister and his mother both glaring at him he forked up some peas freshly conscious of the dangers peacemakers faced when they stepped between warring factions when chester looked up from the peas he found his father eyeing him with more than a little amusement stephen douglas martin had the good sense to stay out of a quarrel he couldnt hope to influence over the next few days the debate about reparations stayed in the newspapers along with the reprisals the army was taking against the perennially rebellious mormons in utah the collision of two aeroplanes carrying mail elbowed both those stories out of the headlines for a little while but the excitement about the crash died quicklythough not so quickly as the two luckless pilots had when flora hamburger came out in favor of ending reprisals the papers carried the news on the front page conscience of the congress says yes newsboys shouted reparations repeal seen as likely martin was less impressed with the announcement than he would have been before congresswoman hamburger got engaged to vice president blackford in a way that made her part of the administration proposing the new policy but then again from what he knew of her she wasnt so easy to influence maybe she was speaking her mind after all i think the bill will pass now i hope it works out for the best thats all martin said when sue asked him about it that night over oxtail soup cant know till it happens when you do something you cant know ahead of time what will come of it his father said politicians will tell you they do but they dont sometimes you just go ahead and do things and see where they lead thats how the war happened martin said nobody imagined it would be so bad when it started when it started people cheered but we locked horns with the rebs and the canucks and for the longest time nobody could go forward or back i hope this doesnt go wrong the same way thats all sometimes being afraid of what could go wrong is a good reason not to do anything stephen douglas martin observed youre a democrat all right chester said well so i am his father agreed upton sinclairs been in for more than a year now and im switched if i can see how hes set the world on fire louisa martin said we already set the world on fire once not very long ago isnt that enough for you stephen well maybe it is when you put it like that her husband said if letting the confederates off the hook means we dont have to fight another war i suppose im for it but if they start spending the money they would have given us on guns and such thatll cause trouble like you wouldnt believe he raised his mug of beer heres hoping theyve learned their lesson he sipped the suds heres hoping chester martin echoed he drank too so did his mother and sister roger kimball was drunk hed been drunk a lot of the time since grady calkins shot president wade hampton v staring down into his glass of whiskey he muttered stupid bastard stupid fucking bastard calkins might as well have taken his tredegar and shot the freedom party right between the eyes the whiskey kimball decided was staring back at him he drank it down so it wouldnt do that any more any old excuse in a storm he thought he poured himself a fresh glass maybe this one would be more polite whether it was or not hed drink it he did a lot of his own pouring these days too many people recognized him on the streets and in the saloons of charleston a few weeks before a lot of those people would have greeted him with a wave and a cheery call of freedom now they glared sometimes they cursed one man had threatened to kill him if he saw him again kimball wasnt too alarmedhe knew how to take care of himselfbut he spent more time in his flat than he had that meant his bankroll shrank with every days inflation he didnt get into so many card games as he had which was too damn bad because theyd been what kept him afloat without them the millions that paid the rent one week bought a sandwich the next week a cigar the week after that and were good only as pretty paper the week after that god damn grady calkins he said and drank some of the polite whiskey it wasnt fair the more whiskey he drank the more obviously it wasnt fair the freedom party still stood for exactly the same things as it had before the madman shot the president kimball still thought those things were as important as he had then a couple of weeks before people had applauded him and applauded jake featherston now they wouldnt give the freedom party the time of day where was the justice in that tears came into his eyes a drunks easy tears one rolled down his cheekor maybe that was just a drop of sweat charleston in the summer even early in the summer taught a man everything he needed to know about sweating and then some kimball knocked back the rest of his drink at last instead of leaving him furious or maudlin it did what he wanted it to do it hit him over the head like a rock he staggered into the bedroom took off his shoes lay down diagonally across the bed and passed out before he could undress sunlight streaming in through the bedroom window woke him the next morning it seemed so hot so bright so molten he thought for a moment hed died and gone to hell he squinted his eyes down to narrow slits so he could come close to bearing the glare when he rolled away from it his head pounded like a submersibles diesel running at full throttle his mouth tasted as if too many people had stubbed out too many cigars in there greasy sweat bathed his body from aching head to stockinged feet he thought about getting up and taking a small nip to ease the worst of the pain but his stomach did a slow horrified loop at the mere idea eventually he did get up only proves im a hero he said and winced at the sound of his own voice even though he hadnt been so rash as to speak loudly he staggered into the bathroom splashed his face with cold water and used more cold water to wash down some aspirins his stomach let out another loud shout of protest when they landed as if it were a submarine under heavy attack from depth charges he wondered if theyd stay down he gulped a few times but they did he brushed his teeth which got rid of the worst of the cigar butts then he ran a tub full of cold water stripped off his sweatsoaked clothes and gingerly stepped in it felt dreadful and wonderful at the same time after hed toweled himself dry and put on a shirt and trousers that didnt smell as if hed stolen them from a drunk in the gutter he felt better before too long he might decide he wanted to live after all showing stern military discipline he walked past the whiskey bottle on the coffee table in the front room and into the kitchen black coffee was almost as painful to get down as the aspirins had been but made him feel better after some thought he cut a couple of thick slices of bread and ate them they sank to his stomach like rocks but added ballast once there he went back into the bathroom and combed his hair in front of the mirror only red tracks across the whites of his eyes and a certain general weariness betrayed his hangover to the world he would do donning a straw hat to help shield his eyes from the slings and arrows of outrageous sunbeams he left the apartment however much he might have wanted to he couldnt stay indoors all the time newsboys selling the courier and the mercury both shouted the same headline united states end reparations the boys with stacks of the mercury the whig outlet added president mitchel says confederate currency will recover ill believe that when i see it kimball sneered both newspapers cost a million dollars but if enough people believed it it might happen the prospect made him less happy than he would have thought possible the shrinkinghell the disappearing confederate dollar had helped fuel the freedom partys rise a cop strode up the street toward kimball twirling his billy club in a figureeight he recognized the exnavy man and aimed the nightstick at him like a tredegar i catch you and your pals going around making trouble like you used to ill run yall in you hear thems the orders i got from city hall oh for christs sake bob kimball answered wearily tell me you didnt vote for featherston and ill call you a liar to your face that dont have nothing to do with nothing the policeman brushed a bit of lint from the sleeve of his gray tunic word is we got to be tough on keeping public order we aint messin around with you boys no more you hear i hear you kimball said and went on his way he would have made sure the freedom party walked small for a while anywayonly sensible thing to do but getting orders from a fairweather friend rankled and when he opened the door to the freedom partys charleston offices he realized the orders had been unnecessary for a different reason the way things were right now he would have had a devil of a time raising trouble even had he wanted to the headquarters that had bustled all the way through the presidential campaign and afterwards felt more like a tomb now only a few people sat at their desks none of them doing anything much damn that calkins kimball thought again god damn it he said loudly it isnt the end of the world might as well be three people one in the front of the office one in the middle and one at the back said the same thing at the same time no jesus christ no kimball said if we were right before that miserable son of a bitch of a hampton got his head blown off were still right now people will see it so help me god they will one of the men whod said might as well be replied i had a rock chucked through my front window the other night had a note tied round it with a string just like in the dime novels the dime novels that cost millions nowadays kimball broke in as if he hadnt spoken the freedom party functionary went on said my neighbors would whale the tar out of me if i ever went out wearing white and butternut again or else burn my house down he gave kimball as hard a look as he could with his round doughy face kimball glared back the leftover pain of his hangover made his scowl even fiercer than it would have been otherwise god damn you to hell bill ambrose i didnt have a thing to do with burning down tom brearleys house i dont do things like that i might have shot the bastardlord knows i wanted toor i might have beat him to death with a twobyfour but i wouldnt have done that its a cowards way out like throwing a rock through a window i go straight after what i dont like you understand me bill ambrose muttered something kimball took two swift strides toward him feeling the way he did he was readymore than readyto brawl ambrose wasnt though hed been bold enough when the stalwarts marched hastily he said i understand you roger youd damn well better kimball growled weve got to walk small for a while thats all yeah some of our summer birds have flown south yeah the cops are going to give us a rough time for a bit but jake featherstons still the only man who can save this country hes still the only man who has a prayer of licking the united states when we tangle with em again all right getting to the top wont be as easy as we hoped it would that doesnt mean we cant do it he knew what he sounded like a fellow at a football game when his team was down by two touchdowns more than halfway through the fourth quarter if they only tried hard enough they could still pull it out if they gave up theyd get steamrollered looking around the office he thought a lot of the men still there were on the point of giving up theyd drift away go back to being whigs and try to pretend their fling with the freedom party never happened as if theyd gone out with a fast woman for a while and then given her up for the homely familiar girl next door dont quit he said earnestly thats all ive got to tell you boys dont quit we are making this country what it ought to be we never would have seen passbook laws with teeth if there hadnt been freedom party men in congress that bastard layne might have won the election if it hadnt been for us some of the men looked happier kimball knew he wasnt the only trueblue party man here but somebody behind him said maybe thingsll get better anyhow now that were not stuck with reparations any more that was kimballs greatest fear to fight it he loaded his voice with scorn ha i know about burton mitchel by god im from arkansas too remember only reason he got into the senate is that his daddy and granddad were there before him hes another one of those stinking aristocrats you ask me if he does anything but sit there like a bump on a log itll be the biggest miracle since jesus raised lazarus a few people laughed not enough kimball spun on his heel and stalked out of the freedom party offices hed never been aboard a slowly sinking ship but now he had a good notion of what it felt like and he got no relief out on king street either up the sidewalk toward him came clarence potter and jack delamotte potters face twisted into a broad unpleasant smile hello roger havent see you for a while he said his almostyankee accent grating on kimballs ears i expect youre pleased with the pack of ruffians you chose by all accounts you fit right in kimballs hands balled into fists first time i ever heard your whiny voice i wanted to lick you just so you know i havent changed my mind potter didnt back away not an inch and delamotte took a step forward saying you want him youve got us both joyously kimball waded in the tiny rational part of his mind said hed probably end up in the hospital he didnt care potters nose bent under his fist as long as he got in a few good licks of his own what happened to him didnt matter at all sam carsten was sick to death of the boston navy yard as far as he could see the uss remembrance might stay tied up here forever he expected to find cobwebs hanging from the hawsers that moored the aeroplane carrier to its pier theres nothing we can do carsten not one damn thing commander grady said when he complained about it the moneys not in the budget for us to do anything but stay in port we ought to count ourselves lucky they arent cutting the ship up for scrap theyre fools sir sam said theyre nothing but a pack of fools theres enough money in the budget for them to let the goddamn confederates off the hook but when it comes to us when it comes to one of the reasons the rebs had to pay reparations in the first place a mouse ate a hole in the socialists pockets if it makes you feel any better grady said the armys feeling the pinch as hard as we are it doesnt make me feel better sir carsten answered it makes me feel worse what kind of a navy man are you anyway the gunnery officer demanded in mock anger youre supposed to be happy when the army takes it on the chin besideshe grew serious once moremisery loves company doesnt it i dont know anything about that carsten said all i know is i want us strong and the csa weak whatever we need to do to make sure that happens im for it if it goes the other way im against it you do have the makings of an officer grady said thoughtfully you see whats essential and you dont worry about anything else long as we are tied up here sir ive been trying to hit the books a little harder as a matter of fact sam scratched his nose his fingertips came away white and sticky from zincoxide ointment a wry grin twisted up one corner of his mouth besides the more i stay belowdecks the less chance i get to sunburn nobody can say youre not a white man grady agreed gravely with that stuff smeared all over your face youre about the whitest man around i only wish it did more good sam said i put it on just like the pharmacists mate says or even thicker but i still toast hell most of the time i look more like a pink man than a white one i even burned over in ireland i remember that it wasnt easy grady said they should have given you some kind of decoration for it i guess they figured me turning red was decoration enough even if i didnt think it was real pretty carsten said which wrung a strangled snort from commander grady sam went on sir do you think wed have more to do and more to do it with if lieutenant sandes hadnt flown his aeroplane into the stern when we were coming back across the atlantic nope grady answered wed had accidents and battle damage before then this business of flying aeroplanes off ships may be important but it sure as hell isnt easy the remembrance doesnt carry as much armor as a battleship either remembering the shell that had struck his gun position sam nodded all right he said i did wonder i think we could have come through without any damage or accidents and still wound up right here grady said the problem isnt how we fought because we fought well the problem is politics he made it a swearword yes sir carsten said resignedly he raised one of his pale eyebrows can you think of any troubles that arent politics when you get down to it commander grady rocked back on his heels and laughed no by god or not many anyhow he slapped sam on the back then pulled out a pad and a fountain pen and wrote rapidly he pulled the top sheet off the pad and handed it to carsten and heres a present for you twentyfour hours liberty go on across the river into boston and have yourself a hell of a time thank you very much sir sam exclaimed he wanted to charge off the remembrance then and there but grady held up a hand just dont come back aboard sunday afternoon with a dose of the clap thats all you do and ill tear your stupid shortarm off and beat you over the head with it aye aye sir sam said i promise there were ways to make that unlikely to happen even if he didnt put on a rubber though not all the girls in any house cared to use their mouths instead of doing what they usually did if he had to pay a little extra for his fun he would that was all he usually preferred a straight screw himself but he hadnt expected to get this liberty and sure didnt want to end up in trouble on account of it and the other was a hell of a lot of fun too several houses operated on the narrow streets across the charles from the navy yard go where the customers are was a rule as old as the oldest profession sam got what he wanted got it twice in quick succession in fact from an italian woman about his own age who was as swarthy as he was fair thanks isabella he said lazy and happy after the second time he ran his hand through her hair and heres an extra dollar you dont have to tell anybody about i thank you she said as she got to her feet my little girl needs shoes it will help he hadnt thought about whores having children but supposed it was one of the hazards of the trade a lot of the businesses near the south bank of the charles that werent brothels were saloons sam had himself a couple of schooners of beer he thought about getting drunkcommander grady hadnt told him not to do that but after hed emptied that second glass he wiped his mouth on his sleeve and walked out of the dingy dive where hed been drinking hed had his ashes hauled hed drunk enough to feel it and nothing in the whole wide world seemed urgent not even getting lit up if he felt like doing it later he would if he didnt well he still had most of a day left without anyone to tell him what to do for a navy man that was a pearl of great price he sauntered through the streets of boston thumbs in the pockets of his bellbottomed trousers he wasnt used to sauntering when he went somewhere aboard the remembrance he always went with a purpose in mind and he almost always had to hurry taking it easy was liberty of a sort he rarely got half by accident half by design he came out onto the boston common acres and acres of grass intended for nothing but taking it easy if he wanted to he could lie down there put his cap over his eyes and nap in the sun no thanks he said aloud at that thought if he napped in the sun hed roast sure as pork would in the galley ovens of the remembrance but there were trees here and there on the common napping in the shade might not be so bad he headed for a goodsized oak with plenty of drooping leafy branches to hold the sun at bay also heading for it from a different direction were a girl of nine or so a boy who looked like her older brother and behind them a woman with a picnic basket seeing sam the girl started to run when she got to the shade under the oaks she said this is our tree you cant have it mary jane theres plenty of room for us all the woman said sternly and dont you dare be rude to a sailor remember your father was a sailor maam if its any trouble ill find another tree sam said the woman shook her head its no trouble at allor it wont be unless you make some but if you made a lot of trouble you wouldnt have said youd go someplace else like that im peaceable sam agreed if he hadnt paid a call on the house where isabella worked he might have felt like making some trouble she was a pretty woman even if she looked tired and shed said the girlsmary janesfather was a sailor which probably made her a widow sometimes widows missed what their husbands werent there to give them any more as things were though sam just sat down on the grass near the tree trunk in the deepest part of the shade in a rustle of wool the woman sat down too and took a blanket from the basket and spread it out on the grass she started putting bowls of food on the blanket while she was doing that her son asked sam sir did you know anybody who sailed aboard the uss ericssonl cant say that i did carsten answered then his eyes narrowed as he remembered where hed heard the name that ship was your father on her sonny yes sir the boy said and the stinking rebs sank her after the war was over thats not right it sure as the dickens isnt sam said inhibited in his choice of language by the presence of the woman and little girl im awfully sorry to hear that my ship got torpedoed once by the japs out in the pacific we didnt sink but i know we were just lucky and the confederate skipper who sank the ericsson is still walking around free as a bird down in south carolina the woman said he murdered my husband and more than a hundred other men and no one cares even the president doesnt care if teddy roosevelt had won his third term hed have done something about it carsten said if the rebs didnt hand that fellow over tr would have walloped the confederate states till they did i think so too the woman said if women had the vote in massachusetts i would have voted for sinclair when he got elected ive changed my mind since i found out about the ericsson though i bet you have sam said one thing you have to give teddyhe never took any guff from anybody no the woman pointed to the food would you like some fried chicken and ham and potato salad i made more than we can eat even if these twoshe pointed at her childrendo put it away like theres no tomorrow are you sure maam carsten asked if she was a widow things were liable to be as tough for her as for the whore whod gone down on her knees in front of himtougher maybe but she nodded so emphatically turning her down would have been rude he ate a ham sandwich and a drumstick and homemade potato salad and pickled tomatoes and washed them down with lemonade that made him pucker and smile at the same time even though her children did eat like starving armenians the woman tried to press more on him couldnt touch another bite he said which wasnt quite true and everything was terrific which was havent sat down to a spread like that since i was a kid that was true too im glad you enjoyed it she said and seemed happy for a moment she took a pack of cigarettes from her handbag he got out a box of matches and lit the smoke for her but as she drew on it she frowned hes probably walking around down there in charleston puffing a big fat cigar damn him sam had heard women swear before but never with that quiet intensity he didnt know what to say so he didnt say anything he watched the children play for a while then got to his feet obliged maammuch obliged he said good luck to you she nodded but didnt speak he went on his way only after hed crossed half the common did he realize he hadnt learned her name xviii arthur mcgregor stared down at the copy of the rosenfeld register hed just set on the kitchen table the headline stared back at him retiring general custer to visit rosenfeld next week his wife eyed the newspaper too eyed it as she might have eyed a rattlesnake coiled and ready to strike please let it go arthur she said please let him go the debts are paid and more than paid let it go ill do what i have to do mcgregor didnt feel like quarreling but he knew what that would be so did maude let it go she said again if you wont do it for my sake do it for the sake of the children you have left that hurt mcgregor had to mask his feelings against his wife now as hed had to mask them so often against the outside world when he answered his voice was steady ted culligan will take care of julia i expect shall we ask mary whether she wants to see george custer go on breathing maude bit her lip like her husband her younger daughter had never come close to reconciling herself to what the americans had done to canada or to alexander but maude replied shall we ask mary whether she wants to see you go on breathing ill be tine mcgregor answered easily his wife glared at him her hands on her hips i dont see how well i will he said he even meant it the bomb he intended for custer had been sitting under the old wagon wheel in the barn since not long after hed learned the us commander in canada would make a last gloating tour of the country hed held down with any kind of luck mcgregor thought he could make custer pay and get away clean instead of arguing any more mcgregor went out into the farmyard hed set a large empty wooden keg in the middle of the yard not far from the chopping block where hens spent their last unhappy moments on earth a few feet away from the barrel lay a gray rock he picked it up and hefted it it weighed the same as the bomb hed made within an ounce or two hed checked them both on maudes kitchen scale one night after she went to bed he paced off fifteen feet from the keg tossing the rock up and down as he walked if he stood at the back of the crowd watching general custer that was about how far away hed be hed have no trouble seeing the general in his motorcar he had several inches on most people custers automobile wouldnt be moving very fast the us commander wouldnt hold a parade if he didnt want people gaping at him mcgregor threw the rock it thudded down into the keg he strode over bent down to pick it up then paced off fifteen feet again his next throw thudded home too hed been practicing for weeks and had got to the point where he could drop it in about eight times out of ten if he could do that with a smallmouthed keg hed have no trouble landing a bomb in custers motorcar he kept practicing for about twenty minutes making sure each toss was slow and relaxed he wouldnt need to hurry he didnt want to hurry when he finally threw the bomb time would seem to stretch out as if he had forever he didnt want to do anything foolish like heaving too hard hed get only one chance do it right he told himself you ve got to do it right and then as quietly and inconspicuously as he could hed slip away when the bomb went off people wouldnt pay attention to him theyd pay attention to custers funeral pyre with a little luck nobody would notice hed flung the nailencased sticks of dynamite maude watched him from the kitchen window her face was pale and set hed never said a word about why he kept throwing a rock into a keg shed never asked him either that wasnt her way but theyd been married a long time maude knew him well shed understand he knew her well too she was no fool her lips shaped a word the kitchenwindow glass made silent he could read her lips anyhow please she was saying he pretended he didnt see her and turned away when he looked toward the farmhouse again she wasnt standing at the window any more what if he didnt slip away what if the yanks caught him theyd shoot him or hang him he could figure that out for himself but julia married to ted culligan would be all right maude had grit and to spare shed get by and mary she was his youngest his chick so of course he worried about her but she was also his firebrand shed grieve for him he wanted her to grieve for him but she would understand why he had to do this she would understand it better than maude seemed able to do alexander mcgregor said were his son at his side he might have accepted yankee rule not now never again not as long as i live he said he went to the barn and did some choreseven though hed been contemplating his own death life had to go on in the meanwhile after a bit hed done everything that needed doing he stayed out anyhow if he went back to the farmhouse hed have another row with maude he knew hed be having rows with maude till custer like imperial caesar made his triumphal procession through rosenfeld after that one way or another theyd end he looked forward to saying told you so when he finally went back inside his wife wasnt in the kitchen but the wonderful smell of baking bread filled it mcgregor smiled before he knew what he was doing life still held pleasure for him he didnt want to throw it away but he was ready if that turned out to be what he had to do in the parlor he found mary reading the copy of the register hed brought back from rosenfeld she looked up at him her eyes enormous hes coming here she said he really is mcgregor didnt have to ask who he was he nodded he sure is he answered he shouldnt mary said hes got no business doing that even if they won the war do they have to go and brag about it thats how yanks are mcgregor said they like to boast and show off so it seemed by his selfeffacing canadian standards anyhow they shouldnt mary said as if stating a law of nature and he shouldnt have a parade through the middle of our town something sharp and brittle as broken glass glinted in her pale eyes something ought to happen to him if he does she s my daughter mcgregor thought flesh of my flesh soul of my soul he almost told her something just might happen to the famous yank general george armstrong custer but no proud of her though he was he kept his plans to himself custer might be a showy american mcgregor was no american and glad not to be one he held his secrets close something ought to happen to him mary repeated looking straight at mcgregor she knew what hed done over the years she had to know even if hed said far less to her and to julia than to maude so she knew what she was saying now she wanted custer blown sky high your mother thinks theres nothing more to be done mcgregor said to see how mary would take that his daughter hissed like an angry cat she said till were free again theres always more to be done well maybe so mcgregor answered and said no more he wondered if mary knew how risky throwing a bomb at custers motorcar was he couldnt ask her he couldnt tell her either but hed been right when he told maude that mary loved custer as much as he did maybe hed get to say told you so twice thoughtfully mary asked what would alexander do now why hed mcgregor broke off he realized he didnt know what his son would do alexander had always denied to the american authorities that hed had anything to do with the kids who were sabotaging the railroad track if that was so the yanks had shot him for nothingbut he might agree with maude when she said enough is enough if on the other hand hed been lying hed be all for trying to blow up custer nowbut the americans would have had some reason for standing him against the wall the more mcgregor thought about it the more confused he got mary wasnt confused she had the clear bright certainty of youth hed want us to be free too she said and her father nodded that no doubt was true day inexorably followed day when mcgregor took care to note time passing it seemed to crawl on hands and knees when he didnt note it when he busied himself with farm chores as he had to do it sped by faster than hed looked for it came the day when custer would parade through rosenfeld at breakfast that morning maude said maybe we could all go into town and watch the show her smile pasted gaiety over stark fear mcgregor paused with a bite of homecured bacon halfway to his mouth tonelessly he said i dont think that would be a good idea why not maude said determined to force the issue it would be jolly she waited for mary to clamor to be allowed to go into town as she usually did but mary just sat toying with her breakfast she looked from her mother to her father and said not a word into the silence mcgregor repeated i dont think that would be a good idea he ate a couple more forkfuls of bacon and eggs emptying his plate then got to his feet im going out to the barn and hitch up the wagon i dont want to be late not today mary nodded at that not looking up at mcgregor still not saying a word before mcgregor could get out the door maude ran to him and took him in her arms come home she whispered fiercely i intend to mcgregor answered which was true he disentangled himself from his wife and went to the door the day was mild not too warm so the coat with big pockets he wore wouldnt particularly stand out his one worry was that the us army might have set up security checkpoints around rosenfeld as the yanks had done during the great war hed built a false bottom to his seat to leave a space in which he could conceal the bomb but he didnt want to have to rely on it and it would make life more difficult even if it worked but the americans seemed sure all their canadian subjects were cowed he had no trouble getting into rosenfeld he hitched the wagon on a side street well away from the post office and general store he didnt want wilf rokeby or henry gibbon spotting him not today then he casually took a place from which hed be able to see the parade before long people started filling the space in front of him he didnt mind he could still see well enough custers train pulled into rosenfeld right on time and started disgorging all the trappings of the us commandants triumphal procession soldiers a marching band and the packard limousine mcgregor had seen up in winnipeg and here came the band blaring out the starspangled banner some people were shameless enough to cheer mcgregors hand went into his pocket he took out the bomb and held it by his side no one noticed he pulled out a match too and palmed it here came the limousine behind the band a gaudily uniformed custer standing in it to receive the plaudits of the crowd nearer nearer custers eyes went widehe recognized mcgregor mcgregor smiled back at him he hadnt expected this but it only made things sweeter he scraped the match on the sole of his shoe and touched it to the bombs fuse smiling still mcgregor threw the bomb all that practice paid off the throw straight for custer was perfect down the track toward rosenfeld rattled the train in his fancy pullman car general george armstrong custer whipped a longbarreled colt revolver out of his holster and pointed it not quite far enough away from lieutenant colonel abner dowling sir will you please put that thing away his adjutant asked dowling commended himself for not modifying thing with a pungent adjective or perhaps even a participle the pistol he knew was loaded fortunately the retiring us commandant in canada wasnt with a grunt custer did set the revolver back in the holster only to yank it out again a moment later this time he did point it at dowling his adjutant yelped dont you turn into an old woman on me custer said peevishly you never know when an assassin may strike dowling couldnt even tell him that was nonsense not after the bomb in winnipeg the summer before and especially not after wade hampton v had been gunned down only a couple of months earlier custers adjutant did say i think youll be safe enough in a sleepy little town like rosenfeld sir oh you do do you custer sneered have you forgotten that blackguard arthur mcgregor makes his home just outside this sleepy little town as a matter of fact dowling had forgotten that till custer reminded him of it sir dowling answered taking a firm grip on his patience there really is no evidence this mcgregor is a blackguard or anything but a farmer the experts are all convinced hes an innocent man experts custer rolled his rheumy eyes the experts were all convinced we should use barrels by dribs and drabs too what the devil do experts know except how to impress other experts he holstered the revolver again then took out the report the experts had compiled on arthur mcgregor and flipped through it till he found a photograph of the man here he thrust it at dowling if this isnt the face of a villain what is it relieved that that miserable pistol wasnt aimed at his brisket any more dowling studied the photograph of mcgregor for the first time in several months he reached the same conclusion now as he had then sir he just looks like a farmer to me bah custer snatched back the report all i can say is you are no judge of the imprint character makes on physiognomy all i can say is you re an old fraud starting at shadows dowling thought and he couldnt even say that not really pretty soon custer would at last officially step down as the longestserving soldier in the history of the us army and then perhaps just perhaps abner dowling would get an assignment where he could use his talents as something other than a nursemaid iron wheels squealed against iron rails as the train began to slow outside of rosenfeld custer pulled out the revolver yet again he had the fastest draw dowling had ever seen in an eightytwoyearold man since he was the only eightytwoyearold man dowling had ever seen draw a pistol that proved less than the tubby lieutenant colonel might have liked dowling was convinced that were an assassin lurking in rosenfeld custer was unlikely to hit him with a pistol shot the retiring general had a far better chance of nailing an innocent bystander or two or himself or dowling he had a better chance still of forgetting he wore the revolver but since no assassin would be lurking dowling didnt have to worry about any of that too much libbie custer ignored them both she lay in her pullman berth gently snoring she was down with a bad cold or maybe the grippe combined with the medicine shed taken for itlike most such nostrums almost as potent as brandythe sickness had knocked her for a loop she would not be parading today and now evidently custer had done all the practicing he intended to do after putting the pistol back into the holster he clapped on a black felt cocked hat gleaming with gold braid adjusted it to a jaunty angle with the help of the mirror atop the walnut sideboard and then turned back to dowling to ask how do i look magnificent his adjutant answered custer was a spectacle no two ways about it hed always worn a uniform as splendid as regulations allowed and then a little more besides now that no one could possibly criticize him for his outfits hed stopped even pretending to pay attention to the regulations he looked something like a south american emperor something like god on a particularly tasteless afternoon dowling found another fancy word refulgent sir thank you very much custer said even though dowling hadnt meant it altogether as a compliment dowling glanced out the pullman cars window the sun was going in and out behind clouds with a little luck the medals and gold cords on custers tunic and the gold stripes down each trouser leg wouldnt blind too many of the spectators the train pulled into the rosenfeld station by this time the people who formed custers procession worked together as smoothly as circus acrobats and a good deal more smoothly than most of the forces under his command had done during the great war here comes your motorcar sir dowling said as the limousine descended from the flatcar on which it rode and about time too custer saidnothing ever satisfied him he looked around what a miserable excuse for a town this is the only reason i can think of for scheduling a parade through it is that it is on the railroad line do you want to cancel the parade and go on sir dowling asked if custer did that hed stop worrying about the bomber who his adjutant remained sure was a bomber only in the retiring generals mind custers mind was certainly full of the fellow and let mcgregor think hes frightened me away he demanded haughtily never he looked around again we stopped here once before didnt we on the way up to winnipeg i mean we drove through the streets then too and almost ran over some yahoo whod probably never seen a motorcar before in his life why so we did sir dowling had forgotten that custer was an old man but his memory hadnt slipped he still vividly recalled slights hed suffered during the war of secession and had never forgotten his quarrels with teddy roosevelt during the second mexican wareven if tr didnt remember things the way he did i thought as much now custer sounded complacent he knew his memory still worked and delighted in showing off he pulled from a trouser pocket that photograph of arthur mcgregor which hed removed from the report and if we run into this fellow ill be ready by thunder to dowlings relief he didnt demonstrate his fast draw by then the members of the marching band were forming up in front of the packard limousine they wore uniforms far more ornate and colorful than those of the platoon of ordinary soldiers who were taking their places behind the automobile but were moons beside the sun compared to custer one good thing custer said as his chauffeur got out of the packard and opened the door so he and dowling could go up into the back seat at least this will be a short procession then ill be able to get back to libbie he really did love her dowling realized with some reluctance he wasnt always faithful to heror at least he did his best to be unfaithful when he saw the chancebut she mattered to him after almost sixty years of marriage dowling supposed that was inevitable dowling sat in the motorcar custer stood erect and proud are we ready captain he called to the bandleader let me see sir the young officer checked his watch it still lacks a couple of minutes of one sir very well custer said commence precisely on the hour let the people know they can expect absolute certainty from the rule of the united states absolute certainty custer hadenough for a regiment let alone one man his adjutant thought sometimes that had led to great disasters sometimes it had led to great triumphs it always made the retiring general hard to deal with at one on the dotor so dowling assumed for he did not take his own watch out of his pocketthe bandleader raised his hands the musicians in his charge struck up the starspangled banner they began to march the chauffeur put the limousine in low gear and followed them custers honor guard in turn followed the automobile rosenfeld might not have been a big city but people lined both sides of the short narrow main street to get a good look at general custer some of them applauded the band that didnt happen in every canadian town sometimes spectators received the us national anthem in stony silence here though most of the men and women seemed to accept that they had been conquered and that the united states were here to stay dowling saw smiles he saw waves and then beside him he saw custer stiffen there custer said his eyes wide right there thats mcgregor dowlings head swung to the right he had a brief moment to recognize the canadian an even briefer moment to think that even if mcgregor was here it meant nothingand then the canuck threw something in the direction of the motorcar how embarrassinghe was sure it was his last thoughtthe old boy was right all along custer didnt whip out his pistol as hed been practicing the bombdowling saw the sizzling fuseflew straight toward him he caught it as a us footballer might have caught a forward pass then underhanded it back the way it had come very clearly dowling saw the astonishment on arthur mcgregors face he lacked the time to feel any astonishment of his own the bomb landed at mcgregors feet and blew up dowling felt a sudden sharp pain in his left arm he looked down and discovered he had a torn sleeve and was bleeding so was custer from a wound on the outside of his thigh if he noticed the injury he gave no sign of it stop the car he shouted to the chauffeur and then to the soldiers behind him see to the wounded now he drew his revolver and you and i dowling we shall see to mr arthur mcgregor i think sir you may have done that already dowling was astonished at how steady he sounded he squeezed the fingers of his left hand they worked like custer hed taken only a minor wound the men and women standing between mcgregor and the motorcar had borne the brunt of the bomb and shielded the americans from the worst some of those people were down and screaming and thrashing blood pouring from them blood poured from others too men and women who would not get up again and there flung against a wall like a bundle of rags lay arthur mcgregor his eyes were set and staring his belly and groin a shredded gory mass custer thrust the pistol back into his holster i dont need thishe did it to himself no sir abner dowling spoke more humbly than he ever had in his life you did it to him you were ready for anything custer shrugged he cut his fuse just a bit too long otherwise wed look like that now his tone was one of dispassionate criticism of another mans work he had a good run but no one man can lick the united states of america sooner or later his luck had to give out and ive paid tom back too by godin person yes sir dowling said what needed saying how does it feel to be a heroagain custer drew himself up as straight as he had stood in the limousine the dramatic pose he struck came straight out of the nineteenth century dowling it feels bully summer in ontario wouldnt last much longer jonathan moss knew that very well before long the idea of sitting out on the grass with an attractive woman would have been an absurdity better then to enjoy such times while they lasted and not to worry about the snow surely only weeks away laura secord didnt make that easy in all the time hed known her laura secord had never made anything easy now she said i wish that brave man had managed to blow your famous general custer higher than the moon i dont suppose i should be surprised moss answered if you want to know what i think though somebody who hides bombs or throws them and doesnt care if he kills innocent bystanders isnt much of a hero pass me that plate of deviled eggs will you theyre good im glad you like them but after shed passed him the eggs she returned to the argument i think anyone who keeps up the struggle against impossible odds is a hero if the odds are impossible anyone who keeps up the struggle against them is a fool moss returned canada still has a few fools left laura secord said she leaned forward and picked up a deviled egg herself one fewer now law school and his practice had sharpened moss wits and made his comebacks quicker than when hed been here as a pilot we wont just turn into pale copies of americans and of the united states laura said we wont moss nodded thats easy enough to say i dont know how easy it will be to do the fellow who threw the bomb at general custer thought the same way you do now hes dead theres no revolution up here and youre feeding a yank a picnic lunch have i told you that you make really good pickles she glared at him if you keep going on like this i wont ask you to come back im still not sure i should be coming up here at all moss answered for me coming to picnics with you is what going to an opium den is for somebody who cant shake the poppy he spoke lightly which didnt mean he wasnt telling the truth laura secord raised an eyebrow is that a compliment or an insult probably he answered which startled a laugh out of her maybe he would have done better to stay down in berlin and meet some nice girl there but he hadnt met any girls thereor women either as laura was unquestionably a womanwhod struck his fancy and so still with the fragments of what was without a doubt an obsession left over from the great war hed started driving up to arthur he didnt know what would come of this he didnt know if he wanted anything to come of it she waved her hand a wave encompassing the farm shed stubbornly kept going on her own i dont know whether i ought to be inviting you here either she said her voice troubled it feels a lot like giving aid and comfort to the enemy but you were the one who aided me after all was she trying to convince herself as moss tried to convince himself coming here was all right he said i dont know about aid but im certainly comforted he lay back on the grass a couple of cows grazing twenty or thirty yards away looked at him with their large dark eyes then went back to their own lunches he thumped his belly to show how comforted he was the waist of his trousers felt pleasantly tight im glad of that laura reached for a pewter pitcher more tea all right moss answered one thing i will say for tea it makes a better cold drink than coffee does it makes a better hot drink than coffee does too she said moss shrugged she made as if to pour the pitcher over his head before filling his tumbler you yanks have no taste i suppose not he said watching puffy white clouds drift across the blue sky the weather wouldnt stay good that much longer he thought about how bad it could get that made him smile and then laugh and whats so funny laura secord asked that you yanks have no taste as a matter of fact yes he sat up and sipped at the tea shed given him i was just thinking about the snowstorm i drove through three years ago to come up here and visit you if that doesnt prove ive got no taste i dont know what would she made a face at him the only thing it proves is that youre mad id already had a pretty fair notion of that from the way you behaved during the war mad about you he said which made her blush and look down at the grass jonathan moss knewhad known for yearsthat was metaphorically true hed also wondered a good many times if it was literally true in the alienists use of the word mad my mad yank laura secord spoke with a curious mixture of affection and bemusement till you stood up for that poor fellow done out of his propertydone out of the property where you had your officei didnt think i should ever want to see you again maybe it would have been just as well for both of us if you hadn moss thought here he was when he would have been almost anywhere else with almost anyone else all his friends from down in chicagoa lot of his friends from down in berlinwould have called him a fool he called himself a fool a lot of the time he kept coming back here would you like anything else here laura secord asked him he finished the glass of tea shed given him then shook his head all right she said and started loading things back into the picnic hamper as he always did when he came up to her farm he tried to help as she always did she refused to let him youll just make a hash of things roastbeef hash by choice moss said with a snort laura got to her feet moss stood up too as she always did she consented that he carry the hamper back to the farmhouse she rubbed that in too i really would have no trouble with it you know its not nearly as heavy as a bale of hay and i haul those all the time well up till you said that i did feel useful moss confessed but dont worry about ityouve cured me she muttered something under her breath moss thought it was mad yank again but couldnt be sure she hurried on ahead of him and opened the kitchen door he set the picnic basket on the counter next to the tin sink which was full of water she put the dirty dishes and bowls and glasses in the water saying with her back to him theyll be frightful to clean if i let them dry all right he answered that was also part of her routine when the picnic basket was empty she turned and took a step toward him he took a step toward her too which brought him close enough to put his arms around her she was reaching for him too her face tilted up her mouth waiting for his the first time that had happened hed taken her right there on the kitchen floor theyd both been mad then he was sure hed hurt her ramming home like a pile driver again and again she hadnt acted as if it hurt though shed clawed his back to ribbons and yowled like a cat on a back fence and finally screamed out his name loud enough to rattle the windows shed gone without for a long time and had done her best to make up for it all at once they werent quite so frantic now but they were hurrying when they went to her bedroom hurrying when they undressed hurrying when they lay down together his hand closed on her breast he teased her nipple with his thumb and forefinger she sighed and pulled his head down to follow his fingers her breath sighed out oh jonathan she whispered she took him in hand more roughly than any other woman hed ever known careful there he gasped both because he was afraid shed hurt him and because hed spurt his seed out onto her breasts and belly if she didnt ease up his own hand slid down to the joining of her legs she was already wet and wanton waiting for him a few picnics hadnt come close to fully sating her not when she hadnt seen her husband since early in the war he wondered what he would have been like after abstaining for so long he couldnt imagine he couldnt come close he knew women were different but even so she pulled him over onto her it wasnt the wild bucking and plunging of the first time theyd joined but it was a long way from calm and sedate and gentle she bit his shoulder hard enough to make him yelp his hands dug into her backside shoving her up as he thrust down she wrapped her legs around him and did her best to squeeze him breathless she squeezed him inside her too he groaned and gasped and spent himself at the same instant as she cried out wordlessly this time my god he said like a man waking from the delirium of the spanish influenza and he had been in a delirium though one far more pleasant than the influenza brought laura secords face was still slack with pleasure a pink flush mottled her breasts she shook her head as if she too were returning to herself which of us is going to the opium den she murmured before moss could answerif indeed hed been able to find anything to sayshe got out of bed and squatted over the chamber pot a doctor friend of moss had once told him getting rid of the stuff like that did only a little good because a woman couldnt get rid of all of it but he supposedhe hopedit was better than nothing once that was done she turned modest again and dressed quickly and with her back to him he got into his own clothes id better head back down to berlin he said empire you mean laura secord told him moss laughed they disagreed on so many things but when their bodies joined it wasnt sparks flying it was thunder and lightning hed never known nor imagined anything like it i still say its berlin and so does everybody else he answered and if you dont like that you can let me know about it and maybe ill come up here and argue about it would you like to come up here and argue about it next sunday she asked you never can tell when the weather in these parts will change but it should still be good then next sunday moss said i can do that his pulse quickened at the thought of it as a matter of fact i can hardly wait as the clock in jeremiah harmons drugstore chimed six reggie bartlett put on his coat and hat wheres the fire the druggist asked him are you going to leave before you get paid not likely boss reggie answered my wallets been whimpering at me for the last couple of days thank heaven its finally friday well ive got the prescription a whimpering wallet needs harmon said here you are reggie he counted out banknotes then added a coin one weeks pay seventeen dollars and fifty cents thank you bartlett put the notes in his wallet and the coin he saw it was dated in his pocket and do you know what boss im happier im a hell of a lot happier to get this than i was when you paid me millions and millions every week a couple of months ago of course you areyoure a sensible fellow harmon said when i paid you millions and millions three days after you got them theyd be worth even less than they were when i gave them to you seventeenfiftys not a whole lot of money lord knows but itll still be worth seventeenfifty next friday i hope it will anyhow reggie said i dont think im ready to put any of it in the bank just yet though a lot of people who put money in the banks got wiped out after the war and isnt that the sad and sorry truth his boss said i was lucky as these things go i got mine out while it was still worth something anyhow and i spent it on whatever i needed then and ever since ive been living week to week and hand to mouth like everyone else i never had enough in the bank to worry too much about what i lost reggie said if i can keep my head above water for a little while now the new money had been in circulation for six weeks and was still holding its value against the us dollar and the german mark maybe it would go on doing that what do you think of president burton mitchel these days harmon asked slyly dont you wish youd voted whig in the election last fall long as i didnt vote for jake featherston who i did vote for doesnt matter a hell of a lot bartlett answered and mitchels had nothing but good luck since he got the job i wouldnt say the way he got it was good luck harmon observed his voice dry not for wade hampton v thats for sure reggie agreed but good luck for the country i reckon it is those wild men in the freedom party even got the damnyankees to feel sorry for us when they shot hampton now that we arent sending every dime in the country up to the usa all the real money thats been hiding can come out again he reached into his pocket he hadnt had a half dollar in there for years and besides mitchels got congress eating out of the palm of his hand whatever he wants they give him even the freedom party congressmen have quit arguing with him maybe its the sign of a guilty conscience though i wouldnt have bet they were possessed of any such equipment harmon said i dont know how long the honeymoon will last but mitchels making the most of it anything that makes the freedom party shut up is good in my book reggie touched a finger to the brim of his hat with september heading into october hed traded in his flatcrowned straw for a fedora ill see you tomorrow morning for my halfday good night reggie harmon told him bartlett left the drugstore light was draining out of the sky at this season of the year nightfall came earlier perceptibly earlier every day street lamps threw little puddles of light down at the feet of the poles they surmounted with dusk people hurried wherever they were going wanting to get there before full darkness if they could a man reggie recognized passed him under one of those street lamps the fellow came into harmons drugstore every so often and was an outspoken freedom party backer reggie didnt know whether he was a freedom party goon but he looked as if he might have been to stay on the safe side reggie stuck his hand in the pocket in which he still carried a pistol the freedom party man knew he didnt have any use for jake featherston if the fellow also knew hed been the one who helped aim tom brearley at roger kimball all sorts of fireworks might go off whatever the freedom party man knew he kept walking his head was down his face somber and reggie thought a little confiised was he looking for the certainty hed known before grady calkins shot the president of the confederate states the certainty that jake featherston was on the way up and he himself would rise with his leader from whatever miserable job he held now if he was he wouldnt find it on the dark dirty sidewalks of richmond posters on a board fence shouted hang featherston higher than haman in big letters underneath in much smaller type they added radical liberal party of the confederate states theyd gone up less than a week after wade hampton v got shot and no one not even the men of the freedom party had had the nerve to deface them or tear them down even the goons in white and butternut might have known some shame at being goons back at his flat reggie took a chunk of leftover fried chicken out of the icebox and ate it cold with a couple of slices of bread and a bottle of beer to wash everything down it was he knew a lazy mans supper but he figured he had the right to be lazy once in a while if he felt like it after washing the dishes he took out the new banknotes hed got and looked at them the onedollar notes bore the image of jefferson davis the fivedollar notes that of stonewall jackson no doubt to remind people of the stonewall the fivedollar goldpiece hardly seen since the end of the war maybe now that specie wasnt flowing out of the csa as reparations the government would start minting stonewalls again reggie walked into the bedroom and got out a banknote hed kept from the last days before the currency reform a banknote it might have been the equivalent of twentyfive or thirty cents of real money it showed jeb stuart licking the yankees during the second mexican war and was every bit as well printed as the new banknotes even if all the zeros necessarily made the design look crowded a billion dollars reggie said softly if only it had been worth more than a supper at a greasy spoon or a couple of shots of whiskey at a saloon with sawdust on the floor but it hadnt it was nothing more than a symbol of a whole country busy going down the drain reggie set it on the table by the sofa if i ever have kids he said ill show this to them maybe it will help them understand how hard times were after the war he shook his head they wouldnt understand no matter what any more than they would understand what life in the trenches was like experience brought understanding nothing else came close when he got to work the next morning he glanced affectionately at the cash register all of a sudden its keys corresponded to prices once more he didnt mentally have to multiply by thousands or millions or billions any more a customer came in and bought some aspirins thatll be fifteen cents bartlett said the man pulled from his pocket a banknote like the one reggie had contemplated the night before reggie shook his head im sorry sir but i cant take this why not the man said its still worth moren fifteen cents i reckon yes sir bartlett said but all these old banknotes have beenwhats the worddemonetized thats it you cant spend em for anything suppose you took one to a bank and tried to get a billion real dollars for it i wouldnt do that the fellow said he no doubt meant it he was just a petty chiseler not a big one there couldnt be anybody in the confederate states who didnt know you couldnt use the old money any more not even for small purchases grumbling the customer put the preposterously inflated banknote back in his pocket and handed reggie a real dollar instead reggie rang up the sale and then anxiously checked the till coins were coming back into circulation more slowly than notes but he was able to make change even if he had to use ten pennies to do it here you are sir thanks the man put the little flat tin of tablets in his pocket along with the change jingling he turned away see you again sometime freedom no one had said that to reggie for quite a while he would happily have gone another fifty or a hundred years without hearing it again too he had to make himself hold still and not go after the customer to beat hell out of him freedom to butcher anybody you dont like you mean he ground out even if its the president of the csa he waited for the man to come back hotly at him whether with words or with fists that was the freedom partys style and had been since its beginnings in the black days after the war but the man only tucked his chin down against his chest as if he were walking into a cold rainy wind and hurried out of the drugstore at the back of the store jeremiah harmon coughed yeah i know boss im not supposed to do things like that bartlett said i know its bad for business but when those whiteandbutternut boys come in i see red i cant help it and this one had his nerve going freedom after what that grady calkins son of a bitch went and did i didnt say anything reggie harmon answered as a matter of fact i think im coming down with a cold he coughed again i dont like to lose business mind you but i dont seek business from imbeciles either and any man who will call out freedom with president hampton still new in his grave is either an imbecile or whatevers one step down from there a halfwitted cur doga son of a bitch like i said reggie suggested it could be so his boss said when i was in the hospital after the damnyankees shot me and caught me one of the other people in there was one of our nigger soldiers whod lost a foot reggie said you ask me he had more brains in that missing foot than the whole freedom party does in all its heads he wondered how rehoboam was doing down in mississippi even if the black man had been a red hed been a pretty good fellow too harmon chuckled something to that i shouldnt wonder but now if god is kind to us the freedom party dealt itself a blow no one else could have given it and one it wont get over amen reggie said with all his heart cincinnatus driver worked like a man possessed unloading a truckload of filing cabinets hed brought from the des moines railroad yards to the state capitol on the other side of the river it was he admitted to himself easier to work hard in iowa in november than it had been in kentucky in say july but he would have put extra effort into things today even if it had been hotter and muggier than kentucky ever got he finished faster than anyone would have imagined he could instead of racing back to the yard to see what other hauling work he could pick upwhich was what he usually did when he finished a jobhe used the time hed saved to hurry back to the near northwest to an odd fellows hall not far from his flat he parked the truck on the street and hurried inside four white men sat behind a long table in the middle of the hall let me have your name please and your street address the one at the end nearest cincinnatus said to him he gave the fellow his particulars the second man behind the table checked a list cincinnatus had a moments fear his name would not appear there but the grayhaired white man ticked it off and pointed to a register in front of him if youll just sign here mr driver he said i surely will suh cincinnatus grinned from ear to ear white men didnt call negroes mister down in kentucky they didnt always do it here either but he liked it better every time he heard it he wrote his name in a fine round hand the third man at the table handed him a folded sheet of paper choose any voting booth you please mr driver he said yes suh thank you kindly suh cincinnatus said and then because he couldnt hold it in any more you know somethin suh this here is the first time in my whole life i ever got to vote used to live in kentucky and i never reckoned id get me the chance well youve got it the polling official said im glad it means something to you and i hope you use it wisely thank you cincinnatus said he went to a voting boothit was before the dinner hour and he had plenty from which to chooseand pulled the curtain shut after himself then he unfolded the ballot inked the little xstamper in the booth with great care and began to vote he voted for democrats for congress for the state house of representatives and for the state senate that would no doubt have startled luther bliss the boss of the kentucky state police had been convinced he was a red apiciusapicius wood nowhad known better a red himself apicius could tell cincinnatus wasnt quite cincinnatus finished marking the ballot folded it again and left the voting booth he handed the folded sheet of paper to the fourth white man at the table that worthy pushed it through the slot of the locked ballot box beside him mr driver has voted he said in a loud voice mr driver has voted as far as cincinnatus was concerned the words might have been accompanied by music from a marching band they sounded in horns and drums in his ears he felt ten feet tall as he strode out to the old duryea truck and marveled that he still fit inside the cab but he did and having voted he went off to eat a quick dinner and hunt up more work he was still eating on a bench down by the train tracks when joe sims sat beside him why are you grinnin like a fool the older black man asked you look like you just tore off a piece your wife doesnt know about im happy cincinnatus said but i aint happy like that i went down and votedfirst time everis what i did sims scratched his head i was happy when i voted the first time too it meant i was twentyone it meant i could buy whiskey too back when whiskey was still legal here but i cant recollect looking like i just tripped over a steamer trunk full of double eagles because i made some xs cincinnatus studied the other negro who hadnt the faintest idea how much he took for granted you was born here cincinnatus said at last sims nodded cincinnatus went on you knew from the time you was a little fellow youd be able to vote when you got big well sure i did joe sims said and then belatedly got the point wasnt like that for you was it not hardly cincinnatus voice was dry my ma and pa was slaves up till a few years before i was born before the usa took kentucky away from the csa wasnt a legal school for niggers in the whole state i learned my letters anyways but i was lucky i wasnt a citizen of the csa i was just somebody who lived there and all the white folks told me what to do now when i vote i get to tell white folks what to do and it aint even against the law anybody reckons i aint wild about that hes crazy sims took a big bite out of his sandwich it wasnt ham but a pungent sausage cincinnatus hadnt seen much in covington salami people called it it was pretty good after chewing and swallowing sims said the stories you tell remind me of the ones i heard from my grandpa when i was growing up i always thought he was making things out to be worse than they really were only reason you reckoned that is on account of you was born here cincinnatus said nobody could make it out to be worse than it wasand it wasnt even so bad in covington because we was right across the river from ohio but it was bad there and it got worse the further south you went it aint so good here either sims said negroes in des moinesnegroes in the usa generally were fond of saying that they werent even wrong cincinnatus had seen as much nevertheless you dont know what youre talkin about cincinnatus said get down on your knees and praise the lord on account of you dont too i seen both sides now this here may not be heaven but it aint hell neither yeah you say that every chance you get sims breathed pepper and garlic into cincinnatus face i cant argue with you i never set foot inside the confederate states i do admit i never heard of any colored fellow leaving the usa to go there it would happen cincinnatus said about every other year it would happen the papers in the csa would always bang the drum about it too to make the niggers thereand the white folks heaven knowshappy about how things was happy joe sims chewed on the word as hed chewed on his salami how could you be happy when you knew you were lying to each other down there that was a better question than most of the ones about the confederate states cincinnatus heard up here he had to think before he answered well the white folks were happy cause they were on top and us niggers we were happy some of the time i dont reckon you can get through life without bein happy some of the time cincinnatus crammed the rest of his own sandwich into his mouth indistinctly he said lets see what they got for us to do with a new youngun in the house any day now i got to keep busy got to stay out of there to get some rest once the baby comes sims said with a reminiscent chuckle i know all about that damned if i dont what are you and your missus going to call the kid seneca if its a boythats my pas name cincinnatus said and elizabeths ma was called amanda so well name the baby thatifitsagirl those are good names sims shut his dinner pail and got to his feet like you say we have to keep busy we dont everybody goes hungry cincinnatus found enough work to put money in his pocket all through the afternoon he went back to his apartment well pleased with himself elizabeth greeted him at the door with a kiss did you vote she demanded did you really and truly vote she wouldnt get her chance till the election for iowa women had only presidential suffrage i really and truly voted cincinnatus said and his wifes eyes shone joe sims might not understand what the franchise meant to him but elizabeth did she waddled back toward the kitchen her legs so wide apart the baby she carried might almost have fallen out between them achilles was doing homework at the kitchen table he had a sheet of paper turned upside down in front of him his spelling words which he was supposed to be committing to memory orange he said orange orange thats good son cincinnatus made as if to clap his hands together the better you spell the smarter folksll reckon you are i dont spell near as good as i wish i did but i know you got that one right it aint its notachilles carefully corrected himself that hard once you get the hang of it you wont get any wrong on your test then will you cincinnatus said hardly ever do his son replied had that not been the truth cincinnatus would have clouted him for his uppity mouth but achilles was doing very well in school which made cincinnatus proud the boys eyes went far away month month month supper elizabeth announced i aint gwine try an spell it but i done cooked it an its ready smells good cincinnatus said it tasted good too roast beef with buttery mashed potatoes and greens on the side turnip greens aint they cincinnatus asked lifting another forkful to his mouth thats right elizabeth said cant hardly get no other kind round these parts even black folks dont hardly seem to know about collard greens an theyre bettern turnip greens any day of the week she paused looked down at her swollen belly and laughed babyjustkickme pretty soon the baby will be kicking achilles cincinnatus said he and elizabeth both laughed then at their sons expression having a new brother or sister still didnt seem real to achilles it would before long elizabeth returned to the earlier subject wish i had me a mess o collard greens youd reckon everybody in the whole worldd know about collard greens but it aint so turnip greens are fine cincinnatus said elizabeth shook her head stubbornly unconvinced he reached out and patted her hand life aint perfect sweetheart but its pretty good right now where simple praise hadnt that reached her slowly she nodded the baby must have chosen that moment to kick again because she smiled and put both hands on her belly reckon you may be right reckon i am cincinnatus said buy me a newspaper tomorrow find out who won the elections anybody win by one vote or lose by one vote made the difference never would have gotten to vote down in kentucky didnt make no never mind whether the stars and bars or the stars and stripes was flyin over the covington city hall neitherwhite folks was on top and aimin to stay there aint like that here aint quite like that here anyway this heres a better place elizabeth said quietly cincinnatus nodded it wasnt a perfect place but he didnt imagine there was any such thing and since hed come from a worse place a better one would do just fine when anne colleton opened the door to her hotel room for him roger kimball took her in his arms she let him but only for a moment and then pushed him away she was strong and shed caught him by surprise to boot he had to take a quick step back and knocked the door closed before catching himself whats going on he asked in no small annoyance i didnt invite you up here for that anne answered her own voice sharp hed seen that grimly determined look in her eye before but rarely with it aimed at him well why did you ask me up then he said a serious question seriously meant whatever else hadnt always been smooth with them their lovemaking was something special it always had been ever since hed seduced her the first night theyd met on a train rolling down to new orleans when the war was young why she echoed to say goodbye thats why i owe you that much i think goodbye he stared at her hardly believing hed heard the word jesus what did i do to deserve that now her eyes softened to sadness you still belong to the freedom party you still believe in the freedom party she said her voice sad too sad but firm like that of a judge passing sentence on a likable rogue of course i do kimball answered when i join something i dont quit when the going gets rough the damnyankees found out about that hed never thought he would be grateful to tom brearley for breaking the news of the ericsson but he was now he could talk about it and i still say jake featherstons the only man who can get this country going again we are going again anne walked over to the bed and picked up her handbag kimball was glad to watch her her gray skirt one of the new short ones displayed most of the lower half of her calfand her legs were worth displaying as she reached inside the handbag he asked what are you doing ill show you she pulled out a banknote and held it up do you see that after kimball nodded she drove the point home take a good look at it its a onedollar banknote you havent seen anything just like it since just after the war ended not till this past fall you havent and its still worth a real dollar too thats not all we need dammit not even close kimball said furiously were naked to whatever the united states want to do to us he wished anne were naked to whatever he wanted to do to her but a different urgency filled him fuller weve got no submarines weve got no battleships weve got no barrels christ they dont even want us to have machine guns in case the niggers rise up again you see the whigs fixing any of that i sure as hell dont anne put the banknote back in her bag we will have all those things again she said it may take longer than id hoped but well have them as long as the money stays good well have them andshe took a deep breathwell have them without murdering any more presidents to get them you cant make an omelet without breaking eggs kimball said ive broken plenty of eggs myselfand youve set up plenty to be broken that got home anne bit her lip and looked down at the floor kimball laughed you know what you remind me of somebody who likes bacon but wont butcher a hog you are a bastard anne said ive known it for a long time but roger kimball loosed another loud jeering laugh takes one to know one i reckon thats likely the only reason weve put up with each other as long as we havewell that and the screwing anyway hed hoped to anger her but found hed failed she also laughed and seemed to gain strength from it yes that and the screwing she said ill miss you ill be damned if i wont but i wont miss the freedom party since youre staying in i have to cut you loose grady calkins showed me once and for all theres no controlling those people i got into it thinking jake featherston needed controlling too kimball said he doesnt but the yankees want to control him and thats a fact featherstons clever anne admitted but he cant do everything himself and if he cant control his people he cant do anything at all by the way she talked controlling was the beall and endall kimball supposed it was natural she thought that way shed spent her whole life till the red uprising controlling a plantation controlling money controlling everyone around her her ancestors had done the same thing for a hundred years before her time she was in fact one of the aristocrats against whom jake featherston had campaigned with a shrug kimball said well yeah a bigger egg than jake wanted got busted but you cant blame the whole freedom party for calkins why cant i everyone else does anne said and theres a lot of truth in it with all the brawling with the stalwarts with the clubs with the riots during the campaign in where else was the freedom party going but towards shooting a president uneasily kimball remembered keeping a stalwart in white and butternut from taking a shot at ainsworth layne when the radical liberal candidate spoke in hampton park even so he said youre makingthe whole countrys makingit out to be bigger than it is sure weve lost some folks for now on account of what happened down in birmingham but theyll be back anne colleton shook her head i dont think so and thats the other reason ive gotten out of the freedom partyi never back a loser never i think the partys name will stink all across the csa for years to come and i dont want any of that stink sticking to me youre wrong kimball told her youre dead wrong now she shrugged ill take the chance nothing fazes you does it he said and she shook her head again he stepped toward her last kiss before i go he watched her consider it mischief filled her eyes why not she said and held out her arms when their lips met he wondered if shed bite him instead of kissing but her malice was subtler than that she put everything she had into the kiss reminding him of what he wouldnt be getting any more she held him tight as if no clothes separated them grinding her crotch into his jesus he said his voice hoarse when he had to take his mouth away from annes to breathe she laughed delighted with the effect shed created his hand cupped her breast last lay before i go too no anne said deliberately and knocked the hand away goodbye roger rage ripped through him why you goddamn little tease he rasped and shoved her against the bed she let out a startled squeak as she landed on her back ill give you something to remember me bysee if i dont he sprang on her years before hed realized trying to take her by force wasnt a good idea since then he never had tried hed never needed or wanted to try now if she thought hed just walk away after that kiss she could damn well think again whatever hed realized years before was dead as the ericsson dead as tom brearley it shouldnt have been for his fury overpowered not only good sense but also caution anne might have been startled when he pushed her onto the bed but she didnt stay that way longer than a heartbeat with exquisite timing her knee came up between his legs and caught him exactly where it did her the most good he howled and doubled up and clutched at himself as any wounded animal might have done anne twisted away from him he couldnt possibly have stopped her not for the first few seconds there now i think youd better go she said coolly he didnt want to take her any more he wanted to kill her but when he looked up he discovered shed had more in her handbag than a onedollar banknote she aimed a revolver straight at his head he hadnt the least doubt she would pull the trigger if he moved in any way that did not suit her get off the bed she said he had to obey though he still walked doubled over the pistol tracked him shed killed before helping to put down the negro rebellion no she wouldnt hesitate now iron in her voice she went on go to the door get out and never come back at the door he paused can i wait till i can straighten up he asked not wanting to publish his humiliation to the world he thought shed send him out in anguish but she nodded and let him have a couple of minutes then she gave a peremptory gesture with the pistol out he went he still wasnt moving wellhe felt like bloody hellbut if he walked like an old man he didnt walk like a wounded old man he made his slow painful way back to his flat without meeting anyone he knew for which he thanked god that would be just what i need he muttered as he walked spraddlelegged up the stairs to run into potter and delamotte again he grunted anne had hurt him worse than they had when he brawled with themnot in so many places but worse he poured himself a tall whiskey and then ran the bath half full of cold water he shivered when he sat down in it but the steam radiator made the apartment tolerably warm and the whiskey made him tolerably warm so he didnt think hed come down with pneumonia or the spanish influenza and the cold water helped numb his poor abused ballsor maybe that was the whiskey too at last he let the water run down the drain after cautiously drying he put on the loosest drawers and baggiest trousers he owned then he went back to the kitchen and poured out some more whiskey he didnt want food the knee anne had given him still left him faintly nauseated he drank from the second glass of whiskey stupid bitch he said as if someone in the room might disagree miserable stupid bitch he took another big sip from the glass he wished hed wrung her neck back there at the hotel but he hadnt got the chance say what you would about her anne colleton took a back seat to nobody when it came to nerve the glass was empty again he refilled it might as well get drunk he thought what else have i got to do even if he never saw anne again hed have no trouble getting laid he knew that hed never had any trouble getting laid why then did he feel like a man whose tongue kept exploring the empty spot where a wisdom tooth had been before the dentist got his forceps on it dammit we were two of a kind he muttered we are two of a kind shes just being stupid about the party thats all shell come around he nodded she gives me half a chancehell she gives me even a quarter of a chanceill horn her into coming around with better than two glasses of whiskey in him it not only sounded simple it sounded inevitable someone knocked on the door kimball hurried to open it there she is already by god he said happily of course she wouldnt stay away but the woman who stood in the hallway was darker and plainer and tireder than anne colleton you are mr roger kimball the naval officer she asked thats right he answered only after the words were out of his mouth did he realize she had a yankee accentshe sounded a little like clarence potter oh good she said im so glad i found you as anne had before she reached into her purse and as anne had before she pulled out a pistol two bullets had slammed into roger kimballs chest before she said my husband was on the ericsson she kept firing till the revolver was empty but kimball never heard the last few shots xix sylvia enos sat in a charleston south carolina jail cell wondering what would happen to her next looking back on it she decided she shouldnt have shot roger kimball now she would have to pay for what shed done try as she would though she couldnt make herself sorry shed done it she shared the small womens wing of the charleston city jail with a couple of drunks and a couple of streetwalkers they all kept sending her awestruck looks because she was locked up on a murder charge she hadnt imagined anything like that it was funny if you looked at it the right way a matron with a face like a clenched fist came down the hall and stopped in front of sylvias cell your lawyer is here she said and unlocked the door then she quickly stepped back as if afraid sylvia might overpower her and escape sylvia found that pretty funny too her lawyer was a chubby whitemustached very pink man named bishop polk magrath he insisted that she call him bish shed never called anyone bish in her life but didnt argue he sat on one side of a table in a tiny visiting room she on the other the matron stood close by to make sure they didnt pass anything back and forth i still dont understand why youre helping me she said shed said that before and hadnt got any kind of answer that made sense to her now she did after a fashion magraths blue blue eyes sparkled you dont seem to have realized what a cause celebre your case has become maam he said ill draw more notice for defending you than i would in ten years of ordinary cases i dont see how youll draw notice for defending me and losing sylvia said i did it she hadnt tried to run after shooting kimball shed given her revolver to the first man who stuck his head out the door of another apartment and waited for the police to come arrest her lets just put it like this mrs enos the lawyer said there are a good many people in this town who think mr kimball deserved what you gave him a good many people who arent the least bit sorry hes dead if we can get enough of them on a jury you might just see rhode island again massachusetts sylvia said automatically she scratched her head i dont follow you at all isntwasntroger kimball a hero down here for sinking the ericsson oh he is maam to some people he is magrath said by the expression on the matrons face she might well have been one of those people the lawyer went on but hes not a hero to everybody in the confederate states not after what happened last june hes not oh sylvia said softly at last a light went on in her head because he was a freedom party bigshot you mean what a clever lady you are mrs enos magrath beamed at her thats right thats just exactly right there are people in this countrythere are people in this townwho would be happy if the same thing that happened to roger kimball would happen to the whole freedom party one of those people whoever they might be was without a doubt paying bishop polk magraths fees sylvia certainly wasnt shed spent more than she could afford getting a passport and a oneway ticket down to charleston she hadnt expected shed be going back to boston maybe shed been wrong times up for this visit the toughlooking matron said sylvia obediently got to her feet the lawyer started to reach across the table to shake hands with her a glance from the matron stopped him he contented himself with tipping his derby instead come along the matron told sylvia and sylvia came halfway back to her cell she asked will supper be more of that cornmeal mush it didnt taste like much of anything but it filled her stomach as if she hadnt spoken the matron said you damnyankees killed my husband and my son and my brothers got a hook where his hand used to be im sorry sylvia said i havent got a brother and my sons too young to be a soldier but the man i shot snuck up on my husband and more than a hundred other sailors after the war was over and he didnt just kill themhe murdered them like hed shot them in the back the matron said nothing more till they got back to sylvias cell as she locked sylvia inside once more she remarked grits for supper again yes and went on her way whats your lawyer got to say one of the streetwalkers called to sylvia a lawyergod almighty she sounded as if she never expected to enjoy a lawyers professional services though a lawyer might enjoy hers two days later the hardfaced matron marched up to sylvias cell and announced youve got another visitor disapproval congealed on her like fat in a pan cooling on the stove is itbish sylvia still had to work to say that the matron shook her head sylvia frowned in confusion now that kimball was dead her lawyer was the only person she knew or even knew of in charleston who is it then through tight lips the matron said just come on sylvia came sitting in an iron cage staled very quickly waiting for her in the visitors room was a blond woman about her own age whose sleek good looks coiffure and clothes all shouted money mrs enos my name is anne colleton that meant nothing to sylviaand then to her dismay it did shed seen the name in a couple of the newspaper stories that talked about kimball youre one of the people who helped the freedom party she said maybe bishop polk magrath had been talking through that derby of his anne nodded i was one of those people yes mrs enos and i was a friend of roger kimballs tooi was up till his last day on earth sylvia heard or thoughthopedshe heard a slight stress on the past tense were you she asked with her own slight stress maybe that was approval in anne colletons eyes you listen dont you the woman from the confederate states said in fact im not telling you any great secret when i say that roger kimball and i were more than friends up till his last day on earth whatever hope sylvia had went up in smoke it hadnt been approval after all it must have been wellbred wellcontained fury have you come here to gloat at me in jail then she asked with gloomy nearcertainty what anne colleton stared then started to laugh you dont understand then do you my dear sylvia shook her head she only understood that she didnt understand annes voice went cold and harsh ill spell it out for you in that case not too long before you shot him roger kimball tried to take me by force when i told him i didnt care to be more than his friend any more he did not succeed i might add she spoke proudly i might also add that i came very close to shooting him myself before you got the chance oh sylvia whispered something more seemed to be called for she went on im glad you didnt it would have meant id spent all that money on my passport and train fare for nothing we wouldnt want that would we anne colleton said and sounded as if she meant it with any luck at all mrs enos the confederate government or the government of south carolina will pay your train fare north bish magrath and i will do everything we can to see that thats what happens oh sylvia repeated in a different tone of voice shed put her children on the train too to distant cousins in connecticut distant but closer than any other relatives she had close by george jr and mary jane had thought it would be a short getacquainted visit so had her cousins maybe just maybe if god and anne colleton turned out kind theyd be right times up the matron announced and even anne colleton who seemed able to outstare the lightning did not argue with her sylvia got to her feet and headed back toward her cell when she was about halfway there the matron said some rich folks reckon they can buy their way out of anything hope this ones right sylvia thought saying that out loud didnt seem to be the best idea shed ever had anne colleton did not visit her again bishop polk magrath did a couple of times he didnt ask many questions he seemed to come more to cheer her up than for any other reason she didnt know how cheerful she should be shed gathered anne colleton was a power in the land but how big a power sylvia couldnt find out till she went to court she came before a judge two weeks after anne colleton visited her bish magrath kept beaming like a grandfather with plenty of candy canes in his pockets for his grandchildren to find the lawyer at the other table in front of the judgethe district attorney sylvia supposed he wasseemed anything but happy but was that because of the case or because hed had a fight with his wife before coming here sylvia couldnt tell i understand you have a request before we proceed mr chesterfield the judge asked the district attorney yes your honor i do the lawyerchesterfieldsaid when he glanced over to sylvia he looked as if hed bitten down hard on a lemon may it please the court your honor the state must recognize the extraordinary circumstances that prompted the defendant to act as she has admitted acting in light of the fact that the decedent did cause the death of the defendants husband not during wartime but after he knew combat had ended the state is willinghe looked none too willing himselfto further the cause of international understanding and amity by not pressing charges in this case provided that the defendant leave the confederate states on the first available transportation north and solemnly swear never to return to our nation again on pain of rearrest and the charges being reinstituted how say you mr magrath the judge inquired i am in complete accord with my learned colleague your honor magrath said placidly i should also like to note for the record that the government of the united states has formally requested clemency for my client from both the government of the confederate states and the government of the sovereign state of south carolina it now rests in your hands your honor things were happening too fast for sylvia they werent just arrangedthey were nailed down tight how say you mrs enos the judge asked her if set at liberty will you quit the confederate states of america never to return bish magrath had to nod before she could stammer yyes sir bang down came the gavel so ordered the judge declared mrs enos you will be on a northbound train before the sun sets this evening numbly sylvia nodded she had her life back now she would have to figure out what to do with it lieutenant lije jenkins sorted through the mail that had come into the barrel unit at fort leavenworth he held out an envelope to irving morrell letter from philadelphia for you colonel war department morrell asked not that he had much doubt jenkins nodded morrell took the envelope well lets see what kind of birthday present they have for me today his birthday still lay a month away but he thought about it more than he had before he got married because agnes came only a week afterwards have to get into leavenworth and do some shopping for her he thought and laughed under his breath amazing the small domestic things in which he took pleasure these days because he was doing them for the woman he loved he opened the envelope and unfolded the letter it held as his eyes went back and forth across the typewritten page he stiffened colonel morrell the letter read having completed work on the test vehicle for a newmodel barrel and having also completed evaluation of optimum strategic utilization of barrels irregardless of model you are ordered to terminate the program you now head at fort leavenworth and to report to the war department personnel office here in philadelphia no later than i march for reassignment each day earlier than the aforesaid date for the closure of the project will be greatly appreciated due to reduced expenditures as a result thereof only after hed gone through the letter twice did he notice who had signed it lieutenant colonel john abell the adjutant to general hunter liggett whod replaced leonard wood as us army chief of staff a few months into president sinclairs administration well well morrell said softly a pigeon had come home to roost hed spent some time as a general staff officer during the great war and had not got on well with john abell abell was a brilliant man everything a military administrator should be and then some morrell had always made it plain he would sooner have been out in the field fighting when hed got out in the field hed smashed the enemy and now he was going to pay for it something wrong sir lieutenant jenkins asked no good deed goes unpunished morrell answered sir jenkins said morrell handed him the letter he read it then stared at his superior close down the barrel works they cant do that they can they are whether they ought to or not is a different question but not one thats mine to answer morrell said you see why theyre doing itthey need to save money he saw no point to saying anything about john abell if personal animosity had dictated where the savings would come from if that had happened it wouldnt be the first time but you havent finished your work with the test model sir jenkins protested in a way i have morrell told him ive done about everything i can do with one machine if theyd coughed up the money for more than one i could have done a lot more than i did i just wish they were passing the barrel works on to someone else instead of closing it down yes sir jenkins face was red with anger they might as well be telling us weve wasted all the time and work we put in here he didnt think about what he would do next himself in morrells book that made him a good soldier thats probably what they think morrell told him he remembered how abell had looked at him during the war when hed agreed with custer that the barrel doctrine the general staff had developed needed changing he might have been an atheist ripping into holy writ that hed been right hadnt made things better it might have made things worse what are you going to do jenkins asked obey the order morrell said with a sigh what else can i do they have the test model they have my reports they can go on from there things wont disappear theyll just stop for a while that might prove as bad but he didnt care to dwell on such gloomy possibilities he left the office to break the news to the men who had worked so hard for so long with the test model the first one he ran into was sergeant michael pound whats the matter sir the barrel gunner asked you look ready to chew bolts and spit rivets were out of business thats what morrell said and went on to explain how and whyor what he understood of whythey were out of business pound frowned with his thick body wide shoulders and broad face he could easily have looked like a lout he didnt his features were clever and expressive thatsvery shortsighted isnt it sir he said when morrell had finished the point is to stay ahead of everybody else after all how are we going to do that if we drop out of the race i dont know the answer to that question sergeant morrell replied i do know ive received a legal order to shut down the barrel works and report to philadelphia once ive done it i have to obey that order yes sir i understand pound said i hope you raise some hell when you get to philadelphia though i intend to try anyhow morrell said how much good that will do god only knows nowwhat about you sergeant do you have any new assignment in mind ill do what i can to help you get it thats very kind of you sir pound scratched his brown mustache as he thought i suppose id better go back to the regular artillery sir whether we have barrels or not well always need guns thats true its a sensible choice morrell said he got the idea that most of pounds choices were sensible ill see what i can arrange i hate to say it but its liable to be a better choice than staying in barrels the way things are if we do get in trouble again well wish wed done more now pound said with a massive shrug well all be running around trying to do what we should have done in years in a few weeks that was also likely to be true trying not to dwell on how likely it was morrell slapped sergeant pound on the shoulder and went on to find the rest of the test models crew they took the news hard too then he had to break it to the crews of the other barrels the great war machines that also tested tactics and to the mechanics who kept all the big complex machines running little by little he realized what a mountain of paperwork hed have to climb by the first of march after hed spread the word to the soldiers it affected he went to tell the other person who needed to know his wife he found agnes ironing clothes what are you doing here at this hour of the morning she said in surprise something in her smile as he kissed her told him what she hoped he was there for but he hadnt come home for that however much he would have enjoyed it he told her why he had come home the explanation came out smooth as if hed rehearsed it as a matter of fact he had rehearsed it going over it again and again with his men agnes pursed her lips she was an army wife and had taken on many of the attitudes of her officer husband shed probably had some of those attitudes already her first husband also being a soldier she said they should be giving you all the tools you need to do the job right not taking away the ones they did let you have you know i feel the same way about it honey but i cant do anything about it except close down the barrel works pack my bags and hop on the train for philadelphia that means you get to hop on the train for philadelphia too her eyes widened i hadnt thought of that she said ive never been to philadelphia even to visit now well be living there wont we unless they ever really get around to moving the war department back to washington morrell answered theyve been talking about it ever since the end of the war but ill believe it when i see it philadelphia agnes said her eyes far away whats it like living in philadelphia crowded he said expensive the air is full of soot and smoke all the time its a big city i dont much like big cities agnes smiled ive noticed i figured you had morrell smiled too but the smile slid into a grimace just have to make the best of it i suppose philadelphia agnes repeated he wondered if shed even heard him what will it be like in philadelphia as shed come to know him hed also come to know her at least half of what that question meant was will i measure up to the competition morrell smiled again he was certain of the answer and gave it sweetheart youll knock em dead one of his wifes hands flew to her hair patting it into place or maybe the outward expression of an imagined new style you say sweet things she told him only when i mean them he said of course when im talking about you i mean them all the time she stepped up hugged him and kissed him his arms tightened around her one thing might have led to anotherexcept that with regret he broke off the embrace agnes looked disappointed yes shed been ready for more but she didnt frown for long youre going to have a lot of work to do she said proving she was indeed an army wife morrell nodded i sure am i havent even told the base commandant about my orders yetthough i suppose a copy will have gone to him too he hugged agnes again briefly now youre really being a brick about this honey i think theyre making a big mistake she answered but youve got your orders and youve got to follow them youve got your orders and youve got to follow them that was the way the army worked all right morrell had trouble imagining it working any other way couldnt have put it better myself he said he gave agnes one more kiss then turned to go the work wont do itself however much i wish it would all right his wife said ill see you tonight then he smiled at the promise in her voice he started looking ahead toward philadelphia too whatever they set him to doing hed do it as well as he knew how hed do it well period he had a good notion of his own ability and performing well with important people watching did have certain advantages with a little luck hed be wearing stars on his shoulders instead of eagles before too long he wouldnt be so easy to move around like a pawn on a chess board then not with generals rank he wouldnt as a matter of fact hed be able to do some maneuvering of his own once he had generals rank maybe john abell thought hed done morrells career a bad turn morrells smile was predatory anyone who thought that about him had another think coming jefferson pinkard walked toward the livery stable freedom he called to other men heading the same way freedom the greeting came back loud and clear as it had before the stalwarts went out to the alabama state fairgrounds when president hampton came to birmingham the freedom party had raised a lot more hell than anybodyanybody except grady calkins anyhowexpected and now the price of that hell was showing jeff called freedom a couple more times before he went into the stable but only a couple more times the building had no trouble holding meetings these days a lot of people who had been in the party people whod put on white and butternut and banged heads toowerent any more a lot of people who had been in the party werent admitting it any more either fairweather friends pinkard thought scornfully he still thought most of the same things were wrong with the confederate states now as had been wrong with the country before wade hampton v got shot he had trouble understanding why more people didnt feel the same way up at the front of the stable caleb briggs paced back and forth pausing every so often to cough even by lamplight the tough little dentists color wasnt good pinkard wondered how long he could last especially burning himself at both ends as he did the damnyankees hadnt killed him all at once when they gassed him they were doing it an inch at a time giving him years full of hell before they put him in his grave to jeffs way of thinking that was worse after a while briggs didnt seem able to stand waiting any longer come on yall move up to the front he rasped talkings hard enough for me ill be goddamned if im gonna shout when i dont have to and theres room wish to christ there wasnt but there is a year before the livery stable would have been packed men would have been milling around outside now there were more folding chairs and hay bales set out than people to sit on them jeff plopped his bottom down onto a chair in the second row he could have sat in the first rowplenty of chairs to takebut memories of getting called on in school made him stay less conspicuous caleb briggs looked over the house he pursed his lips coughed again and began well were still here boys maybe he gave a dry chuckle then or maybe it was just another cough freedom jefferson pinkard called along with his comrades freedom briggs echoed it sounded like a dying echo too enough so to send a chill through jeff but the dentist picked up spirit as he went on we are still here dammit and we arent going to go away either no matter how much the niggers and the folks in striped trousers and top hats and the generals in the war department wish we would were here for the long haul and were going to win freedom the shout was louder this time stronger pinkard felt a little of the jolt of energy he always got from hearing jake featherston speak he wondered if caleb briggs would last long enough to see the freedom party win he had his doubts even if victory came soonand it wouldnt dammit but briggs was undeterred hed been a soldier and pulled his weight like a soldier what we have to do now is make it through the hard times he said they arent over yet they wont be over for a while itll be gods own miracle if we dont lose seats in congress this fall what weve got to do is try and hold on to as many as we can so we dont look like were going down the toilet in front of the whole damn country and what weve got to do right here in birmingham is make sure we send barney stevens back to richmond in november jeff clapped his hands he wanted to see stevens sent back to richmond to keep the freedom partys seat there he also wanted stevens in richmond because the congressman was a rough customer whom he didnt particularly want coming home to birmingham we hang tough briggs was saying we try not to lose too much here in and we try to build up toward and especially when we vote for president again rome wasnt built in a day the confederate states wont be rebuilt in a day either but we will build our country back up we will shove our niggers back down where they belong and wethe freedom partywill be the ones who do that so help me god we will freedom jeff yelled along with his friends the cry echoed from the roof almost as it had in the days when the party was swelling one more thing and then im through briggs said we got as far as we did by standing up and fighting for what we know is right were going to go right on fighting dont you have any doubts about that we may pick our spots a little tighter than we did before but well put on the white and butternut whenever we see the need pinkard whooped the chance to get out there and smash a few heads was one of the reasons hed joined the freedom party a good many other men cheered caleb briggs too but jeff couldnt help noticing how many others sat silent then he thought grady calkins would have cheered he shook his head rejecting the comparison and all it implied calkins had been a madman every party had some but jeff wasnt crazy caleb briggs wasnt crazy and jake featherston sure as hell wasnt crazy still the idea left him uneasy he didnt sit around and yarn and drink homemade whiskey as he usually did after the business part of a meeting wound down instead glum and oddly dissatisfied he headed for the door one of the guards there caught his eye he reached into his pocket pulled out a dollar and tossed the banknote into the bucket at the guards feet thank you kindly jeff the bruiser said party needs every penny it can get its hands on these days i know tim pinkard answered he laughed and think just last year we had more millions than you can shake a stick at it wasnt really funny not for the freedom party a sound currency had done as much to squeeze folks out of the party as had wade hamptons assassination real money gave people one less thing to be angry about and anger was the gasoline that fueled the partys engine it had started to drizzle jeff jammed his cap down low on his head and tugged up his coat collar he was angry by god angry about having to wait for the trolley in the rain the trolley got there late too which did nothing to improve his mood he threw five pennies in the fare box bronze coins were returning faster than silver and rode out to the sloss works company housing a woman was waiting at the trolley stop pinkard thought she would get on after he got off when she didnt he gave a mental shrug and started off toward his cottage the trolleyman clanged his bell the car rattled down the tracks jeff the woman called pinkard stoppedfroze in fact emily he whispered and slowly turned in the darkness and drizzle he hadnt recognized her but he would have known her voice anywhere his own roughened as he went on what the devil are you doing here waiting for you she answered her own tone was sharp i sure enough knew what youd be doing this night of the week didnt i i just got here myself thoughdidnt expect you back quite so soon things aint so lively at the party nowadays none of your businessyou made sure of that by god jeff said what do you want with me anyway you tramp he could have used a stronger word and nearly had wanted to see how you were emily answered wanted to see what you were up to she sighed and shook her head not like you cared enough about me to find out any of that after what you done why should i care he said youre lucky i dont kick you down the street had he had some whiskey in him he thought he would have done it i got lonesome she said i got lonesome when you was in the army and i got lonesome when you started caring more about the freedom party than you did about me i dont like being lonesome so i went and did something about it she didnt mean lonesome she meant horny pinkard knew that shed been fine as long as he gave her everything she needed when he stopped shed gone out and taken what she needed as a man with a frigid wife might have done it would have been all right in a man in a woman pinkard shook his head no man could put up with what shed done not if he wanted to stay a man emily said i was almost hoping i wouldnt find you here on account of thatd mean you were back at the house not at that stinking livery stable itd mean youd wised up and gotten out of the freedom party but if what happened to president hampton didnt open your eyes i reckon nothin ever will shed hoped hed given up the party did that mean she wanted him back or would have wanted him back did he want her back she was explosive between the sheets he knew that but how would he keep from thinking he wasnt the only man shed taken to bed how would he keep from thinking she wasnt taking some other man to bed along with him he shook his head again he wouldnt he couldnt to keep from thinking about that now he asked what are you doing these days working in a textile mill she answered with a shrug it aint a lot of money but i dont need a lot so i get by i get lonesome sometimes though she meant horny again bet you can find plenty of fellows if you do jeff didnt try to keep the scorn from his voice of course i can a woman always can emily sounded scornful too and weary so weary harder to find anybody who cares about more than that though too bad jeff said harshly too damn bad emily sighed i dont know why i bothered doing this just wasted my time reckon i was hoping youd changedchanged back into the fellow i knew before the war hes dead pinkard said the damnyankees killed him and the niggers killed him and you helped kill him too the country he lived in is dead along with him he aint ever coming back maybe the country we had back then will thats what the freedom party is all about to hell with the freedom party emily said furiously a distant street lamp showed tears running down her cheeks and to hell with you too jefferson davis pinkard go on get out of here go peddle your tail somewhere else or ill give you what i gave you before only more of it jeff made a fist and raised his arm i sure as hell dont need you i dont need anybody by god as long as ive got the party thats everything i need in the whole wide world emily turned away her shoulders slumping she was crying harder now crying like a little lost child jeff headed home a smile on his face now in spite of the chilly drizzle why not hed won he knew damn well hed won chester martin liked playing football he liked it in the snow and he liked it here in springtime too in that he was very little different from anybody else in the united states in new england and new york a few people still enjoyed baseball a game that had briefly flourished in the couple of decades before the war of secession even there though football was king he pulled on his leather helmet being a burly steelworker he played in the line on offense and defense in the trenches people called that these days the comparison wasnt farfetched plenty of times hed wished for a bayoneted rifle to hold off whatever charging rhinoceros the other team aimed at him and not a game went by when he didnt wish he were wearing a greengray steel pot on his head instead of mere leather albert bauer played beside him in the line bauer pointed to their opponents a team of bruisers in dark blue wool shirts here we go chester he said legal revenge for everything the police have given us since the end of the warand before that too you dont need to fire me up al im ready now martin looked down at his own shirt which was bright red we licked em in the presidential election and we licked em again in the congressional election last year and weve licked em a few times on the gridiron too i figure we can do it again thats the proletarian spirit bauer said dont take them lightly though the enemies of progress fight hard even if their cause is doomed they will lose the war they can win the battles on one sideline steelworkers friends and families gathered to cheer their gladiators sue martin waved to chester he waved back on the other sideline stood friends and relatives of the cops a stranger couldnt have guessed which side was which seeing how ordinary policemens families were never ceased to surprise martin the two referees were newspapermen theyd covered both sides and both sides trusted or rather distrusted them about evenly they waved the team captains over to them and flipped a silver dollar the cop let out a happy little grunt hed guessed right give us the ball he said yeah give it to em in the balls a steelworker said he grinned but it was a sharptoothed sort of grin martin held the ball upright with his finger as the kicker booted it down the fieldthe park actuallytoward the cops then he was on his feet and running as hard as he could a policeman ran toward him yelling in a language that didnt sound like english martin lowered a shoulder and knocked him sprawling the first hit always felt good he banged into a couple of other policemen before two of his teammates brought down the fellow with the ball when he lined up at right tackle the cop playing opposite him looked familiar have i seen you someplace before martin asked before the cop could answer the center snapped the ball back to the quarterback who stood waiting for it the cop gave martin a body block that took him out of the play though the run gained only a yard or two then he helped him up i dunno i been playing football for a while same as most guys i dont think thats it martin said whered you fight in the war another play intervened this time martin spun past the blocker in dark blue and flattened the fullback behind the line of scrimmage the fullback accused him of unsavory practices he laughed i was in kentucky with the first armycusters men the cop answered with no small pride as they took their places once more then i got sent to utah to put down the mormon uprising after that i fought in arkansas how about you bud before martin could answer the ball was snapped again the quarterback booted it away in a quick kick it rolled dead deep in the steelworkers territory now it would be martins turn to try to hold the cop away from the ball carrier me he said as he took his stance i was in virginia the whole timeon the roanoke front till i got wounded then up in the north the cop charged at him martin managed to hold his own even while he held the policeman at bay he was puzzled he was almost sure hed seen the brokennosed face in front of him twisted with fury while the policeman aimed a gun at at he laughed whats funny the cop asked ill tell you whats funny martin answered you tried to shoot me a couplethree years ago i think oh the policeman frowned then he also started to laugh you should have been wearing a goddamn red shirt then too i would have hit what i was aiming at the ball flew back to the steelworkers quarterback he retreated till he stood more than five yards behind the line then let fly with a forward pass an end caught it and ran another ten yards before being dragged down from behind one more pass a couple of plays later moved the ball deep into the cops territory from there the steelworkers pounded it into the end zone running straight at their opponents and defying them to bring down the ball carrier they were martin realized as he took the measure of the opposition a little heavier and bigger and a little younger than their opponents he smiled thinking they would have an easy game and punish the policemen who had given them so much trouble on the picket line on the try for the point after the touchdown he knocked the cop across from him over on his back the steelworkers kicker dropkicked the ball through the uprights for the extra point smash em sue yelled as the steelworkers trudged back to their side of the field for the kickoff of course well smash em chester martin yelled back one of the referees tossed him the ball he knelt down and held it for the kicker to send it down the field to the policemen he didnt think he was bragging or doing anything but telling the truth how could the cops compete against bigger younger men before long he found out one of the halfbacks on the policemens team was nothing special to look out a skinny little fellow with a blond kaiser bill mustache but when he got the ball that scrawny halfback was quick as a lizard and twisty as a snake he did most of the work on the cops drive and capped it by sprinting into the end zone on a pretty fifteenyard run martins tongue was hanging out from chasing him jesus he panted as both sides lined up for the cops try for the point after touchdown if i had a gun right now i wouldnt shoot you he nodded to the policeman whod fired during the labor unrest id shoot that miserable son of a bitch instead hes trying to give me a heart attack yeah matts dangerous the cop agreed you try taking a shot at him i figure its about even money he dodges the bullet maybe martin said have to bring along a machine gun then and see if he can dodge that the cop chuckled and nodded they both understood the weapons of war even if theyd stood on opposite sides of the barricade the policemens dropkick was also good and knotted the game it swayed back and forth all afternoon the steelworkers had size and youth and a quarterback who threw enough to keep the policemen from doing nothing but storming forward to stop the run the cops had nothing but matt all by himself he kept them in the game tackling pass receivers on defense and running like the wind whenever the policemen had the ball he never wore down martin started to wonder whether he was human or mechanical however many times he got smashed to the dirt he rose again as if nothing had happened even his mustache stayed unruffled which made chester all the more suspicious in the end the steelworkers won martin made himself a minor hero falling on a fumble in the closing moments to ensure that the cops couldnt come back after shaking hands with the policemen he limped off the field covered in glory and sweat and mud and bruises he still had all his front teeth which made him unusual on the team he took off his helmet and ran a hand through his damp matted hair whew he said this is supposed to be fun they tell me i feel like ive been slammed by a triphammer a couple dozen times his sister gave him a hug you were wonderful chester she wrinkled her nose you dont smell so wonderful though if you were out there you wouldnt smell so wonderful either martin retorted he stretched it hurt his father said its a different game nowadays with all this throwing might as well be baseball if you ask me when i was playing back around the time you were born we just ran that was a real mans game if you ask me sure it was pa chester said nobody had helmets then and nobody did stephen douglas martin broke in nobody had helmets martin repeated and the ball was solid steel and the field was a mile and a half long and half a mile wide and uphill both ways too and everybody on the other side was always ten feet tall and weighed seven hundred pounds and even dead men had to stay in the gameand run the ball too thats how they played it in the old days and you are a heartless whippersnapper and i ought to turn you over my knee and whip you black and blue his father said rolling his eyes but youre already black and blue i expect and youre wrongdead men didnt have to stay in they changed that rule in my fathers day laughing they helped sue and louisa martin spread out the picnic feast that had come along in a wicker basket steelworkers and policemen wandered back and forth talking about the game and sharing food and beer and other potables it was as if the two groups had never clashed anywhere save in a friendly game of football chester gnawed a drumstick when matt the fast halfback on the policemens team walked by martin held up a bottle of beer to get him to stop the lure worked as well as a worm would have with a trout thanks matt said and sat down beside him id sure as the devil sooner drink with you than have you jump on my kidneys like you were doing all day long like heck i was martin had finally got used to watching his language again when his mother and sister were around most of the time i was flat on my fanny watching you run by they bantered back and forth each making the other out to be a better football player than he really was then matt got up and headed off to chin with somebody else just as if hed never clubbed a striking steelworker in all his born days and martin waved when he went just as if hed never kicked a cop everything in the park was peaceful and friendly chester martin liked that fine it couldn t be plainer that no negro ever born has got what it takes to be a true citizen of the confederate states of america jake featherstons pen raced across the page one of those days over open sights would be done and everyone in the country would realize hed been telling the truth all along anyone with half an eye to see can understand the reasons for this they arebefore jake could set down what they were his secretary came back into his inner office what do you want lulu he growled like any writer he hated interruptions someone to see you mr featherston she said who is it he asked i dont want to see any reporters right now fewer reporters wanted to see him these days too that worried him but not enough to make him feel friendly right this second its not a reporter sir lulu answered its general jeb stuart jr what jake had trouble believing his ears as far as he was concerned jeb stuart jr was the author of all his troubles who else had made sure he would stay a sergeant as long as he stayed in the army jeb stuart jr blamed him for the death of jeb stuart iii jake blamed jeb stuart jr for suppressing an investigation that might have given warning of the great red uprising and now the general wanted to see him slowly jake said well i reckon you can bring him on in jeb stuart jr was in his late fifties he looked very much like an older version of his handsome son save that he wore a neat gray chin beard rather than the little strip of hair under the lower lip jeb stuart iii had affected after cautious greetings stuart said youre probably wondering why ive called on you now after pretending for so long that you and the freedom party and all the insults youve thrown at me dont exist jake did his best to sound dry id be a liar if i said it hadnt crossed my mindand im no liar you say that i wonder if even you believe it stuart looked at him nostuart looked through him hed had uppercrust confederate officers give him that look a great many times it showed without words that they relegated him to the outer darkness he wasnt quite a nigger in their eyes but he might as well have been it also made featherston want to punch those uppercrust confederates right in the face youve got anything to say say it and then get the hell out he snapped otherwise just get the hell out i intend to say it you neednt worry about that jeb stuart jr replied i came to say goodbye goodbye jake echoed why are you leaving if you are its about ten years too late but good riddance anyway im sure as the devil not going anywhere to his surprise stuart smiled i know youre not youre not going anywhere at all in the confederate states of america not in politics not any more youre not and so sergeant featherstonhe laced the title with contemptgoodbye he waved a delicate fluttering of the fingers jake laughed in his face go ahead and dream general he showed what he thought of stuarts title too you fancypants boys wont be rid of me that easy he couldnt help a nasty stab of fear though nothing had gone right for him or the freedom party since grady calkins took a tredegar out to the alabama state fairgrounds and shot down wade hampton v stuart might have picked his pocket for that very thought people know what the freedom party is now featherston a pack of murdering ruffians theyll run your henchmen out of congress in a few months and youll never ever be president of the confederate states and for that believe me i get down on my knees and thank god go ahead and laugh featherston said the fellow who laughs last laughs best or thats what they say i fought the damnyankees till i couldnt fight any more and i reckon ill keep on fighting the traitors here the same way not for the life of him would he let jeb stuart jr see how closely his words reflected jakes own nightmares there are no traitors damn you stuart said hell there arent featherston returned im sitting across the desk from one god damn you that nigger pompey your sons body servant was as red as he was black they were going to take him away and grill him but your precious brat didnt want em to and they didnt who stopped em you stopped em thats who if that doesnt make you a traitor what the hell are you a man who made a mistake stuart answered i dont suppose youve ever made a mistake featherston not one that big by jesus jake said stuart startled him again this time by nodding it couldnt have been much bigger could it it ended up costing me the life of my only son it cost a lot more than that featherston said it cost thousands dead by god if any one thing cost us the war that was it and all you do is think about yourself i reckon i ought to be surprised but i aint you dont know what i think so dont put words in my mouth jeb stuart jr said slowly sadly he shook his head i blamed you for my sons death you know i never would have guessed jake said with a fine sardonic sneer thats why i spent the next year and however long commanding a battery and staying a sergeant i could have been in the army for the next five warshell the next ten warsand i never wouldve had more than three stripes thank you very kindly general goddamn stuart sir he wanted to fight with stuart he would have loved to spring out of his chair smash the general to the floor and stomp him every muscle quivered give me an excuse he said silently come on you son of a bitch give me even apiece of an excuse but stuart only looked sad and that was the other half of my mistake yes i blocked your promotion it seemed the right thing to do at the time but it turned out wrong so wrong if youd ended the war a lieutenant or a captain would you ever have done what you did withand tothe freedom party featherston stared at him that question had never crossed his mind he tried to imagine himself without the smoldering resentment hed carried since for the life of him he couldnt that endless burning inside was as much a part of him as his fingers he said its a little fucking late to worry about that now dont you reckon i do i certainly do stuart got to his feet and its a little fucking late to worry about you featherston youre yesterdays news and you wont be tomorrows you dont need to get up for me jake hadnt been about to get up for him as he must have known i can find my own way out dont come back either jake snarled leaving the inner office jeb stuart jr got the last word i wish you the same he closed the door behind him with another snarl this one wordless jake snatched up his pen and began to write furiously he filled two pages in over open sights in something less than half an hour but even venting his anger through the growing book was not enough to satisfy him he slammed his pad shut threw it into his desk and locked the drawer that held it until he was ready for it to see the light of day it wouldnt he sprang up and paced the inner office like a caged wolf the party would lose ground when elections came and they were only four months away he saw no way around it the trick was going to be holding as much as he couldand making people think the freedom party would be a force to reckon with in elections after hed known it wouldnt be easy long before general stuart stopped by to gloat he wished he could talk with roger kimball but kimball was dead and the damnyankee woman whod murdered him had got off scotfree that was one more on the list hed already started compiling against president mitchel go ahead kiss the usas ass he muttered he wished he could talk with anne colleton too he valued her money he valued her sense of theatrics and he valued her brains but she didnt value him or the freedom party any more of all the defections hed had to endure over the past year hers might have hurt most since he couldnt talk with either of them he telephoned ferdinand koenig jeb stuart jr his former running mate exclaimed well isnt that a kick in the head stopped by to gloat you say thats just what he did jake answered said the party was as good as dead and buried god damn him to hell dont take it too much to heart koenig said if hes as right about that as he was during the war were in fine shape yeah featherston said gratefully he hadnt thought of it like that youve got a good way of looking at things ferd dont reckon youll let us down sarge koenig answered i remember where we were back in and i can see where we are now maybe we havent climbed all the way to the top of the mountain but well get there thousands of party stalwarts mightwouldhave said the same thing but jake set no special stock in what stalwarts said they werent stalwarts because they were long on brains they were stalwarts because they were long on muscle and short on temper ferdinand koenig was different he not only had good sense he wasnt embarrassed about showing it of course well get there jake said sounding more confident than he felt just have to come through this november without getting skinned figure we will koenig asked thats the question all right jake allowed he let out a long slow sigh well get hurt some well have to put the best face on it we can and then well have to start building toward we cant afford to waste a minute there i only hope to god we dont lose so much people wont take us serious any more with kimball dead and anne colleton gone ferdinand koenig was the only one to whom he would have said even so much koenig answered you never can tell sarge folks dont think we matter so much now that money doesnt burn a hole in their pockets if they leave it in there more than a minute and a half but who knows how long thatll last who knows what alls liable to go wrong between now and thats right jake said smiling for the first time since jeb stuart jr had left thats just right with the whigs running things they will go wrong sure as the sun comes up tomorrow he hung up feeling better but only for a little while would anything be left of the freedom party when a chance to rule came round at last mama clara jacobs screeched from what had been the storeroom little armstrong just tore up the picture i was drawing she was almost four more than twice the age of her little nephew but armstrong grimes even as a toddler gave every sign of being hell on wheels he takes after edna nellie thought i bet merle grimes was a nice man even when he was a little boy she had such a good opinion of almost no one else in the male half of the human race the more she got to know her soninlaw the more he impressed her fortunately the coffeehouse was almost empty she could hurry back to the old storeroom and mete out punishment armstrong hadnt just torn up claras picture hed made a snowstorm of pieces out of it he was happily sticking one of those pieces in his mouth when nellie yanked it away from him upended him over her knee and walloped his backside no no she shouted mustnt tear up things that dont belong to you her grandson howled since he was wearing a diaper that shielded his bottom nellie knew she wasnt hurting him much the spanking made an impressive amount of noise though as did her yelling now she said are you going to do that any more no little armstrong answered nellie wiped his nose which was dripping yellowish snot she didnt believe him for one thing he was heading toward the age where he said no every other time he opened his mouth for another a toddlers promise lasted only till he forgot hed made it which meant anywhere from two minutes to in extraordinary circumstances an hour or so you be good you hear me nellie said no armstrong grimes answered that was neither defiance nor ignorance only the first thing that came out of his mouth im good mama clara said so virtuously that nellie expected to be blinded by the halo about to spring into being above her head of course you arewhen you feel like it nellie told her own daughter pick up those scraps and dont let him eat any more of them dont let him eat your crayons either i wont mama clara turned to her nephew you see you cant have anything thus made forcibly aware that he was being deprived armstrong started crying again nellie had to spend more time soothing him before she could go out front again edna was supposed to come get her son at half past three shed left him with nellie so she could do some unencumbered shopping she didnt show up till a quarter after four hello maim sorry she said in a perfunctory way how crazy did he drive you crazy enough nellie replied i was thinking he reminds me of you edna laughed but nellie wasnt joking she went on please come get him when you say you will ive got enough to do keeping up with clara and the coffeehouse put armstrong in there too and i start climbing the walls edna sniffed i take care of clara for you sometimes and you dont hear me complaining about it oh i do sometimes nellie said and besides when you take care of the children thats all you do you have merle to make a living for you ive got to make my own living and this place wont run by itself before edna could answer armstrong picked up something from the floor and started chewing on it he bit edna when she stuck her finger in his mouth to get it out she finally didit was a nasty little clump of hair and dustand then whacked him a lot harder than nellie had done he wasnt crying now because he was angry or frightened he was crying because his bottom hurt youve never been fair with me edna said and here we go again nellie thought one more round in the fight that never stops for good she said you think being fair means doing whatever you want ive got news for you dearie it doesnt work that way ive got news for you mayou never do what i want edna glared you do as you please and what pleases you most is doing whatever you think will make me maddest why you little liar nellie snapped as she might have at clara but ednas charge held just enough truth to sting more than it would have had it been made up from whole cloth and you were the one who was always sneaking around behind my back you ought to be ashamed of yourself i had to sneak around behind your back you wouldnt let me live any kind of life in front of your face edna said i dont call living fast and loose any kind of a life to forestall her daughter nellie added and i ought to know too i found out the hard way yeah and youve been frozen up ever since on account of it edna said another shot with all too much truth in it i got what i was looking for in spite of you and do you know what else i like it just fine she carried her son out of the coffeehouse slamming the door behind her hard enough to rattle the windows why is my big sister angry clara asked from the door to her playroom if i slammed a door like that id get a whipping ednas too big to get a whipping under her breath nellie mumbled no matter how much she needs one that slammed door also drew hal from across the street you had another quarrel with edna he said it was not a question well what if i did nellie said i dont suppose i would have if shed come and gotten her brat when she was supposed to exercising her temper proved a mistake clara started chanting armstrong is a brat armstrong is a brat stop that hal jacobs said sharply and for a wonder clara stopped it she listened to her father more often than to her mother perhaps because hal gave her fewer orders than nellie did nellie sighed i wish edna would pay as much attention to you as clara does she sighed again i wish anyone would pay attention to me i always pay attention to you my dear hal said that was true it was so true nellie had come to take it for granted in the years since she and hal got married because she took it for granted it no longer satisfied her she said i wish edna would pay attention to me she is a grown woman hal said with a little luck she is paying attention to her own husband now its not the same nellie replied in a sulky voice no i suppose it is not hal admitted but it is good that she should pay attention to someone i think and merle grimes is a young man worth paying attention to i know he is i was thinking the same thing myself earlier today nellie said but hes not her mother and i am she shook her head discontented with the world and with edna thats probably why she doesnt pay attention to me yes it probably is hal said when i was becoming a man i paid as little attention to my mother and my father as i could get away with nellie had hardly known her own father when shed got away from her mother at an early age it was to go into the demimonde hal didnt need to know any more about that than whatever hed already found out nellie said but edna isnt becoming a woman by now she is one like you said shouldnt she have figured out that i know what im doing by now maybe hal said but maybe not too he looked at nellie with amused affection she has a stubborn streak as wide as yours i wonder where she could have gotten it not from me nellie said automatically she needed a moment to recognize the expression on her husbands face hal jacobs was doing his best not to laugh out loud again nellie spoke automatically im not stubborn hal let the words hang the most devastating thing he could have done nellies face went hot she said im not that stubborn anyway well maybe not hal said he should have been a diplomat in striped trousers not a cobbler and sometimes spy he went on you are my dear wife and i love you exactly the way you are youre sweet that was usually another automatic reply this time nellie listened to what shed just said you really are sweet hal im glad i married you i was scared to death when you asked me but its worked out pretty well hasnt it if she sounded a little surprised she could hope her husband didnt notice if he did he was too much a gentleman to show it the best five years of my life he said being here with you and being here to watch clara grow up his face softened yes the best years of my life with more than a little surprise nellie realized the years since the war had been the best of her life too shed made more money when the confederates occupied washington but shed been worried and afraid all the time worried about what edna would do afraid bill reach would tell the whole world what he knew worried and afraid the us bombardment would blow her and edna and the coffeehouse to hell and gone now edna was married bill reach was dead and the country was at peace and living with hal jacobs hadnt proved nearly so hard as shed feared i love you hal she exclaimed saying it surprised her it seemed an afternoon for surprises and discovering she meant it surprised her even more hearing it made her husbands face light up i love it when you tell me that hal said i did not know i could be more happy than i already was but now i am im happy too nellie said by the way all the stories were written she should have been in love with her husband before she married him instead of finding out she was five years later well she thought its not like ive lived a storybook life she tried to remember if shed ever told hal she loved him before once or twice maybe in a dutiful fashion as she occasionally gave him her body but the words hadnt come from her heart not till today perhaps hal sensed something of the same thing he walked up to her and gave her a kiss a good deal warmer than the pecks that usually passed between them she returned it with more warmth than usual too for once she didnt mind the gleam that came into hals eye the idea of making love while kindled suddenly struck her as delicious not disgusting but clara was still playing not far from one of the tables and a customer chose that moment to come in cant have everything nellie thought as she walked over to ask the man what he wanted she looked around no she couldnt have everything she wouldnt be rich as long as she lived for instance what she had though was pretty good xx as hosea blackford did whenever he came up to the lower east side of new york city he looked around in astonishment turning to his wife he said i cant imagine what growing up here would have been like with the buildings blocking out the sky and with swarms of people everywhere flora blackfordafter being married for a year she hardly ever signed her name flora hamburger any moreshrugged its all what youre used to she answered i couldnt imagine there was so much open space in the whole world let alone the usa till i took that train trip out to dakota with you this past summer i felt like a little tiny bug on a great big plate up till new york city was all shed ever known up till the train trip to dakota all shed known were new york city philadelphia and the ninetyodd builtup miles between them endless expanses of grass waving gently in the breeze all the way out to the horizon had not been part of her mental landscape they were now and she felt richer for it a boy in short pants ran by carrying a stack of the daily forward buy my paper he yelled in yiddish buy my paper i understood that blackford looked pleased with himself the german i took in college isnt quite fossilized after all and being around your family is an education in any number of ways ill tell my father you said so flora said she walked up the stairs of the apartment house that seemed so familiar and so strange at the same time following her blackford said go ahead hell take it the right way he has better sense than half the people in the cabinet believe you me he does considering what goes on in the cabinet thats not saying so much flora answered her husband rewarded her with a gust of laughter she laughed too but a little ruefully the scent of cooking cabbage was very strong i dont think this building is ready for the vice president of the united states dont worry about it he said laughing again compared to the farm i grew up on its paradisea crowded paradise but paradise its got running water and flush toilets and electricity the farm i grew up on sure didnt not that anybody had electricity back then this building had gas lamps up until a few years ago flora said it did not have an elevator she and blackford walked upstairs hand in hand knocking at the door to the flat where shed lived so long seemed strange too but it also seemed right she didnt live here any more and never would again when the door swung open david hamburger was the one with his hand on the latch his other hand held the cane that helped him get around flora embraced her brother carefully not wanting to make him topple over david shook hands with hosea blackford then shuffled through a turn and walked back to the kitchen table each slow rolling step on his artificial leg was a separate effort each a silent reproach against the war that though more than six years over would echo through shattered lives for most of the rest of the century blackford shed his coat the october evening might have had a nip to it but the inside of the flat was warm enough and to spare here ill take that floras younger sister esther said and she did chess david asked he pulled out the board and pieces even before blackford could nod ill take on the winner isaac said the younger of floras brothers wore in his lapel a silver soldiers circle pin inscribed the year of his conscription class she thanked heaven that he unlike david hadnt had to go to war and wished to heaven he wouldnt wear that pin soldiers circle men could be almost as goonish as the freedom partys ruffians down in the confederate states but he did as he pleased in such things he was a man now and let everyone know it on any excuse or none hello aunt flora yossel reisen said coming home so seldom flora was amazed at how much her older sisters son grew in between times hed been a baby when she went off to congress but he was in school now he added hello uncle hosea hello yossel hosea blackford answered absently most of his attention on the board in front of him he played well enough to beat david some of the time but not too often hed already gone down a pawn which meant he probably wouldnt win this game abraham hamburger came in from the bedroom puffing on his pipe he hugged flora then glanced at the chess board setting a hand on blackfords shoulder he said youre in trouble but you knew that when you decided to marry my daughter eh if you didnt you should have papa flora said indignation mostly but not altogether feigned hes not kidding dear blackford said you know hes not since flora did she subsided her husband started a series of trades that wiped the board clear like machinegun fire smashing a frontal assault by the time the dust settled though he was down two pawns not one stopping david from promoting one of them cost him his bishop his last piece other than pawns he tipped over his king and stood up you got me again david only grunted he grunted again when isaac took blackfords place before he and his brother could start playing sophie stuck her head out of the kitchen and announced supper in a couple of minutes wed better wait david said then ha isaac said youre just afraid id beat you but he scooped his pieces off the board and put them in the box he and david had been giving each other a hard time as long as theyd been alive sophie came out with plates and silverware behind her came sarah hamburger with a platter on which rested two big boiled beef tongues while sophie and esther and flora set the table their mother went back into the kitchen returning with another platter piled high with boiled potatoes and onions and carrots looks wonderful hosea blackford said enthusiastically smells wonderful too isaac gave him a quizzical look when i was in the army a lot of fellows who werent jewshed caught himself before saying goyim to his brotherinlawturned up their noses at the idea of eating tongue all what youre used to i suppose blackford said when i was growing up on a farm wed have it whenever we butchered a cowor a lamb for that matter though a lambs tongue has a skin thats tough to peel and so little meat its almost more trouble than its worth i hadnt eaten tongue for years before i first came here i knew then you liked sarah hamburger said so i make her english was the least certain of anyones there but she made a special effort for blackford over supper esther said what is it like being vice president she laughed at herself ive been asking flora what its like being in congress ever since she got elected and i still dont really understand it so i dont know why i should ask you now being in congress is complicated or it can be blackford answered being vice president is simple imagine youre in a factory and you have a machine with one very expensive part if that part breaks the whole machine shuts down till you can replace it and youre that part esther asked her eyes wide blackford laughed and shook his head im the spare for that part i sit in the warehouse and gather dust president sinclair is the part thats hooked up to the machine and i hope to heaven that he doesnt break youre joking david said he studied blackfords face no i take it back youre not no im not blackford said flora has heard me complain about this for as long as ive had the job i have the potential to be a very important manbut the only way the potential turns real is if something horrible happens the way something horrible happened to the confederate president last year otherwise i havent got much to do abraham hamburger said this mitchel down in the confederate states seems to be doing a good job he does indeed blackford said im not telling any secrets when i say president sinclair is glad too if the regular politicians in the confederate states do a good job the reactionaries dont get the chance to grab the reins a kholeriyeh on everybody in the confederate states david muttered in yiddish blackford glanced at flora but she didnt translate she didnt blame her brother for feeling that way because of what the confederates had done to him she could hardly keep from feeling that way herself her father nodded at what blackford had said these freedom party mamzrim remind me of the black hundreds in russia except they go after negroes instead of jews not enough jews in the confederate states for them to go after isaac said if there were more they would thats probably true flora said and blackford nodded floras laugh sounded a little shaky funny to think of anybody going after anyone instead of jews it is isnt it isaac said people do it here too even though there are more jews than negroes in the usa it makes life easier for us than it would be otherwise hosea blackford looked around the crowded apartment flora knew what was in his mind with so many people in so small a space jews still didnt have it easy she hadnt been able to see how crowded the flat was how crowded the whole lower east side was till she moved away before theyd been like water to a fish only going to philadelphia had given her a standard for comparison but that standard for comparison didnt mean her brother was wrong easier and easy werent the same thing she said wherever we end up no matter how hard things are for us we manage to get by that spirit is what made this country what it is today no matter who has it hosea blackford said he stopped with a bite of tongue halfway to his mouth and an astonished look on his face will you listen to me will you listen to me if you didnt know better wouldnt you swear that was teddy roosevelt talking hes set his mark on the country for a long time to come david said he rapped his own artificial leg which sounded of wood and metal hes set his mark on me for the rest of my life having the socialists running the country has turned out better for the country and better for ushe grinned at flora and at hosea blackfordthan i thought it would i admit it but i still think tr deserved a third term in flora knew her brothers opinion she had never understood it and still didnt but she refused to let him get her goat now well see how many terms president sinclair deserves she said which seemed to satisfy everyone as her husband had she heard what shed said with some surprise will you listen to me will you listen to me if you didn t know better wouldn t you swear that was a politician talking someone had plastered twoword postersvote freedom on every telegraph pole and blank wall in the terry as scipio walked from his roominghouse to erasmus fish store and restaurant he wondered if all the freedom party men had gone round the bend only a handful of negroes in augusta georgia were eligible to vote even if theyd all been eligible the freedom party wouldnt have picked up more than a handful of their votes when scipio came up to the fish store erasmus was scrubbing a freedom party poster off his door mornin xerxes he said i dont need me no extra work so early in the mornin crazy damnfool buckra scipio said aint nobody here got no use for no freedom party freedom party erasmus exclaimed that whose poster this here is he was a clever man and sharp with figures but could hardly read or write at scipios nod he scrubbed and scraped harder than ever mus be try in to make us afraid of em mebbe so scipio said that hadnt occurred to him i was feared o they befo but i aint now they shoots theyselves when they shoots de president erasmus didnt answer for a moment he was busy getting rid of the last bits of the offending poster therethats better he kicked shreds of waddedup paper across the sidewalk and into the gutter then glanced over at scipio them bastards aint even collectin taxes no more you reckon theys goin anywheres now pray to jesus they aint scipio answered with all his heart he still didnt believe prayer helped but the phrase came automatically to his lips amen erasmus said then he reached into a pocket of his dungarees and pulled out a onedollar banknote and i reckon this here hammers some nails in the coffin lid too give em one big thing less to bellyache about yeah again scipio spoke enthusiastically the freedom party hadnt been alone in bellyaching about the inflation that had squeezed the csa since the end of the great war hed done plenty of that himself been a year now near enough an the money still worth what it say almost done got to where i starts to trust it wasnt all bad erasmus chuckled still recollect the look on the whitefolks bankers face when i paid off what i owed thought he was gonna piss his pants money was still worth a little somethin then so they couldnt pretend it werent like they done later an now i got my house free an clear wish more niggers woulda did the same scipio shared that wish most of the negroes in augusta hadnt been alert enough to the opportunity that had briefly glittered for them reckon mos of the buckra don think of it till too late neither he said you right about that erasmus answered some folks is jus stupid an it dont matter none whether theys black or white before scipio could say anything about that his boss went on we done spent enough time chinnin got work to do an it dont never go away once inside the fish store and restaurant scipio fell to with a will erasmus had told a couple of important secrets there fools werent the only ones who came in all colors so did people who worked hard one way or another they got ahead the ones with black skins didnt get so far ahead and didnt get ahead so fast but they did better than their brethren who were content to take it easy after the lunch crowd thinned out scipio said you let me go downtown for a little bit boss bathsheba want some fancy buttons for a shirtwaist she makin an she cant find they nowhere in the terry dont reckon no buckra too proud to take my money erasmus waved him away yeah go on go on be back quick though you hear scipio nodded and left he could take advantage of his boss good nature every once in a while because he did work hardand because he didnt try taking advantage very often fewer negroes were on the streets of downtown augusta nowadays than had been there right after the war when scipio first came to town the factory jobs that had brought blacks into town from the fields were gone now gone or back in white hands two cops in the space of a couple of blocks demanded to see scipios passbook he passed both inspections dont want no trouble from nobody boy you hear the second policeman said handing the book back to him yes suh scipio answered he might have pointed out that the policeman wasnt stopping any whites to see if they meant trouble he might have but he didnt had he it would have meant trouble for him the cop wouldnt have needed to belong to the freedom party to come down hard on an uppity nigger the freedom party itself wasnt lying down and playing dead posters shouting vote freedom covered walls and poles and fences here as they did over in the terry here though they competed with others touting the whigs and the radical liberals the more of those scipio saw the happier he was he also grew happier when he saw exactly the kind of buttons bathsheba wanted on a white cardboard card in the front window of a store that called itself susannas notions when he went inside the salesgirlor possibly it was susanna herself ignored him till he asked about the buttons even then she made no move to get them but snapped show me your money he displayed a dollar banknote that got her moving from behind the counter she took the buttons back there rang up twenty cents on the cash register and gave him a quarter a tiny silver halfdime and a roll of pennies by the look on her face he suspected it would prove two or three cents short of the full fifty it should have held a black man risked his life if he presumed to complain about anything a white woman did the charges she could level in return reckoning his own life worth more than two or three cents he nodded brusquely and left susannas notions he wouldnt be back the woman might have profited from this sale but shed never get another one from him no sooner had he got out onto the sidewalk than he heard a cacophony of motorcar horns and a cry that still made his blood run cold freedom down the street blocking traffic came a column of freedom party marchers in white shirts and butternut trousers men in the front ranks carrying flags as arrogant as if it were all over again scipio wanted to duck back into susannas notions once more he felt as if every freedom party ruffian were shouting right at him and glaring right at him too but the woman in there had been as unfriendly in her own way as were the ruffians he stayed where he was doing his best to blend into the brickwork like a chameleon on a green leaf freedom freedom freedom the shout was as loud and in scipios ears as hateful as it had been during the presidential campaign two years before but more white men shouted back from the sidewalks and from their automobiles murderers shut up you bastards get out of the road before i run you over liars sons of bitches scipio had never heard shouts like that during jake featherstons run for the confederate presidency and as if from nowhere a phalanx of policemen some with pistols some carrying rifles came off a side street to block the marchers path disperse or face the consequences one of them growled nobody had ever spoken like that to a freedom party column during the campaign either we have the right to one of the men in white and butternut began you havent got the right to block traffic and if you dont get the hell out of the way you can see how you like the city jail the cop said he and his men looked readymore than readyto arrest any freedom party stalwart who started to give them a hard time and to shoot him if he kept it up the freedom party men saw that too by ones and twos they began melting out of the column and heading back to whatever theyd been doing before they started marching a couple of the men up front kept arguing with the police they didnt seem to notice they had fewer and fewer followers then one of them looked around he did a double take that would have drawn applause on the vaudeville stage the argument stopped so did the march scipios feet hardly seemed to touch the ground as he walked back to the terry when he told erasmus what hed seen his boss said bout time them bastards gits whats coming to em way past time anybody wants to know but better late than never like they say didnt never reckon i live to see the day when the police clamps down on the buckra marchin long the street scipio said you never lose your shirt bettin on white folks to hate niggers erasmus said you bet on white folks to be stupid all the time you one broke nigger they knows they needs usthe smart ones knows anyways an the freedom party done come close enough to winnin to scare the smart ones dont reckon they gets free rein no more heres hopin you is right scipio said do jesus heres hopin you is right when he got home bathsheba examined the buttons with a critical eye then nodded thems right nice she said yous right nice scipio said which made his wife smile he went on i gots somethin else right nice to tell you and again described the ignominious end to the freedom party march that made bathsheba jump out of her chair and kiss him them whiteandbutternut fellers used to scare me to death she said tell the truth them whiteandbutternut fellers still scare me but maybe if you is right maybe one fine day even us niggers can spit in their eye mebbe so scipio said dreamily hed already spit in the white mans eye as a not altogether willing member of the ruling council of the congaree socialist republic this would be different echoing erasmus he said even some o the buckra like to see we spit in the freedom partys eye i got somethin else we can do about the freedom party bathsheba said scipio raised a questioning eyebrow his wife condescended to explain forget there ever was such a thing as that there party now scipio kissed her amen he said best thing is they disappears like a stretch o bad weather after the bad weather gone you comes out in the sunshine an you forgets about the rain we done have more rain than we needs mebbe now though the sun come out to stay and in the hope the good weather would last he kissed bathsheba again tom colleton dumped afternoon papers from charleston and columbia down on the kitchen table in front of anne who was eating a slice of bread spread with orange marmalade and drinking coffee fortified with brandy headlines on all the newspapers proclaimed thumping whig victories in the election the day before got to give you credit sis tom said looks like you got out of the freedom party just in time if you think the bottom is going to fall out of a stock you sell it right then anne answered you dont wait for it to go any lower not unless you want to lose even more her brother had been content to look at the headlines she studied the stories line by line knowing headline writers often turned news in the direction their editors said they should that hadnt happened here the whigs would own a larger majority in both the house and senate of the thirtysecond confederate congress than they had in the thirtyfirst and the freedom party had lost enough seats to make annes lips skin back from her teeth in a savage smile they hadnt lost quite so many as shed hoped but theyd been hurt nine congressmen how did jake featherston propose doing anything with nine congressmen he couldnt possibly do anything but bellow and paw the air people werent so inclined to pay attention to bellowing and pawing the air as they had been before grady calkins killed wade hampton v yes i think he is finished anne murmured by god i hope so tom said do you know what he reminded me of he waited for anne to shake her head before continuing a wizard thats what one of the wicked ones straight out of a fairy tale i mean when he started talking you had to listen that was part of the spell hes still talking but the spell is broken now so it doesnt matter anne stared at her brother in astonishment then got up and set the palm of her hand on his forehead his oath should have left the smell of lightning in the air oh hush anne said absently i was wondering if you had a feverfancies like that arent like you but you dont and it was a very good figure indeed even if you wont come up with another one like it any time soon thanks a heap sis toms grin made him look for a moment like the irresponsible young man whod gone gaily off to war in rather than the quenched and tempered veteran whod returned he wasnt a wizard of course only a man too damn good at making everyone else angry when he was he was angry all the time he still is he always will be i think anne said shed just spoken of featherston as finished even so hearing tom use the past tense in talking about him brought a small jolt with it her brother said he sure had you going for a while past tense again and another jolt with it but anne could hardly disagree yes i reckon he did she said her accent less refined than usual looking back on it maybe he was a wizard for a while there i would have done anything he wanted had president hampton not been assassinated anne knew she would have gone on doing whatever featherston wanted too she was honest enough to admit it to herself if to no one else not even her brother perhaps especially not to tom whod always shown more resistance to featherstons spell than she had would i have gone to bed with him if he d wanted that anne wondered slowly reluctantly she nodded to herself think i would have she hadnt been in control of things not with jake she hadnt with every other man shed ever knowneven roger kimball after their first encounteryes with featherston no and again she was honest enough to admit it to herself but he hadnt wanted her so far as she knew he hadnt wanted any woman she didnt think that made him a sodomite it was more as if he poured all his energy into rage and had none left for desire all that flashed through her mind in a couple of heartbeats before her brother said if i dont see him or hear him again i wont be sorry as long as the money stays good you probably wont anne said and tom nodded she went on and as long as the niggers know their place and stick to it tom nodded again featherstons closest to sound on the niggers no doubt about that its still worth a white mans life sometimes to get any decent work out of field hands theyd sooner loll around and sleep in the sun and collect white mens wages for doing it it wont ever be the way it was before the war anne said sadly speaking in part for marshlands in part for the entire confederacy the desire to make things again as they had been before the war had won the freedom party votes by the thousands and had helped win her backing too but the war was almost six and a half years over and life did go on even if in a different way i want another chance at the united states one day tom said featherston was sound about that too but he wanted it too soon yes anne said but we will have another chance at the united states sooner or later no matter whos in charge of the csa and well have a good chance at them too as long as the socialists hold the white house they dont her brother remarked with no small pride we wrecked it during the fight for washington its almost rebuilt anne said i saw that in one of the papers the other day well have a harder time knocking it down again too with the yankees holding northern virginia well manage tom said even if our soldiers dont get that farand i think they willwell have plenty of bombing aeroplanes to flatten itand philadelphia and new york city too i hope yes was all anne said to that she would never be ready to live at peace with the united states not even when she turned old and gray turning old and gray was on her mind a good deal these days nearer forty than thirty she knew the time when her looks added to the persuasiveness of her logic would not last much longer as tom was doing more and more often since coming home from the war he thought along with her you really ought to get married one of these days before too long sis he said you dont want to end up an old maid do you that depends anne colleton answered compared to what compared to ending up with a husband who tells me what to do when he doesnt know what hes talking about compared to that being an old maid looks mighty good believe me men arent like that her brother protested weve got a way of knowing good sense when we hear it anne laughed loud and long what tom had said struck her as so ridiculous she didnt even bother getting angry when you finally get married yourself ill tell your wife you said that she remarked she wont believe mei promise she wont believe mebut ill tell her why wouldnt she believe that about me tom asked with such a tone of aggrieved innocence anne laughed harder than ever because itd be lying she suggested but that only made her brother angry changing the subject seemed like a good idea she did when are you going to get married anyhow you were bothering me about it but turnabouts fair play tom shrugged when i find a girl who suits me he replied im not in any big hurry its different for a man you know i suppose so anne said in a voice that supposed nothing of the sort people would talk if i married a twentyyearold when i was fifty if you do that all your friends will be jealous how you do go on sis tom said turning red anne had indeed managed to get him to stop thinking about marrying her off but the dismal truth was he had a point it was different for men they often got more handsome as they aged women almost never and men could go right on siring children even after they went bald and wrinkled and toothless anne knew she had only a few childbearing years left once they were gone suitors would want her only for her money not mostly for it as they did now god must be a man she said if god were a woman things would work a lot different and you can take it to the bank i dont know anything about that tom said if you really reckon its fun and jolly to go up out of a trench when the machine guns are hammering or to hope youve got your gas helmet good and snug when the chlorine shells start falling or to sit in a dugout wondering whether the next eightinch shell is going to cave it in then you can go on about what a tough row women have to hoe ive fought anne said her brother only looked at her she knew what shed been through so did he hed been through some of it with her cleaning red remnants out of the swamps by the congaree after the war against the usa was lost she had some notion of what tom had experienced on the roanoke front but only some she hadnt done that by everything she knew she wouldnt have wanted to do it never mind tom said for now its over we dont need to quarrel about it today might as well leave that for the generals all of emll spend the next twenty thirty years writing books about how they could have won the war singlehanded if only the fellows on their flanks and over em hadnt been a pack of fools he walked over to a cupboard and took out a couple of glasses then he yanked the cork from a bottle of whiskey on the counter under the cupboard and poured out two hefty belts he carried one of them back to anne and set it on the table by the newspapers she picked it up what shall we drink to she asked drinking to being here and able to drink isnt the worst toast in the world tom said he raised his glass anne thought about that nodded and raised hers in turn the whiskey was smoke in her mouth flame in her throat and a nice warm fire in her belly before long the glass was empty anne went over to the counter and refilled it while she was pouring tom came over with his glass from which the whiskey had also vanished she gave him another drink too my turn now she said as if expecting him to deny it he didnt he bowed instead as a gentleman would have done before the war not so many gentlemen were left these days machine guns and gas and artillery had put them under the ground by the thousands along with their ruder countrymen by the tens of thousands she raised her glass heres to freedom from the freedom party well you know ill drink to that one her brother suited action to word again the glasses emptied fast the whiskey hitanne understood why the simile was on her mindlike a bursting shell everything seemed simple and clear even things she knew perfectly well werent she weighed jake featherston in the balances as god had weighed belshazzar in the bible and as god had found belshazzar wanting so she found featherston and the freedom party no i dont reckon hell be back i dont reckon hell be back at all she said and that called for another drink sam carsten was using his offduty time the way he usually did now he sprawled in his bunk aboard the remembrance studying hard his head felt filled to the bursting point he had the notion that he could have built and outfitted any ship in the navy and ordered its crew about he didnt think the secretary of the navy knew as much as he did god might have he supposed he was willing to give god the benefit of the doubt george moerlein his bunkmate came by to pull something out of his duffel bag christ sam dont you ever take a break he said he had to repeat himself before carsten knew he was there at last reminded of moerleins existence sam sheepishly shook his head cant afford to take a break he said examinations are only a week away they dont make things easy on petty officers who want to kick their way up into real officer country moerlein had been a petty officer a long time a lot longer than carsten he had no desire to become anything else and saw no reason anyone else should have such a desire either ive known a few mustangs or more than a few but ill be damned if i ever knew a happy one real officers treat em like youd treat a nigger in a fancy suit the clothes may be right but the guy inside em aint if i dont pass this examination it wont matter one way or the other sam said pointedly and besides officers cant be any rougher on mustangs than they are on ordinary sailors only shows how much you know moerlein answered well dont mind me not that you was he went on about his business sam returned to his book he came across a section on engine maintenance he didnt remember quite so well as he should have from feeling he knew about as much as god he fearfully sank to thinking he knew less than a retarded ordinary seaman on his first day at sea mess call was something of a relief sam stopped worrying about keeping a warship fueled and running and started thinking about stoking his own boiler with the remembrance still tied up in the boston navy yard meals remained tasty and varied none of the beans and sausage and sauerkraut that would have marked a long cruise at sea somebody sitting not far from sam said id sooner spend my days belching and my nights farting long as that meant i was doing something worthwhile heads bobbed up and down in agreement all along the mess table we ought to be thankful they aint breaking us up for scrap another optimist said somebody else added god damn upton sinclair to hell and gone that brought more nods carsten among them but a sailor snapped god damn you to hell and gone tad you big dumb polack socialists everywhere carsten thought as tad surged to his feet a couple of people caught him and slammed him back down sam nodded again this time in approval knock it off he said we dont want any brawls here not now we dont anything that makes the remembrance look bad is liable to get her taken out of commission and land the lot of us on the beach congress isnt throwing money around like they did during the war hell congress isnt throwing money around like they did before the war neither tad said we busted a gut building a navy that could go out and win and now were flushing it right down the head rebs aint got a navy worth anything any more said the socialist sailor whod called him a polack limeys aint either no such thing as the canadian navy these days so who the hell we got to worry about goddamn japs for one three men said the same thing at the same time differing only in the adjective with which they modified japs kaiser bills high seas fleet for two sam added yeah us and the germans are pals for now but how long is that going to last best way i can think of to keep the kaiser friendly is to stay too tough to jump on that produced a thoughtful silence at last somebody down at the far end of the mess table said you know carsten when i heard you was studying for officer i figured you was crazy maybe you knew what you was doing after all sam looked around to see who was in earshot deciding the coast was clear he answered maybe you dont have to be crazy to be an officer but i never heard tell that it hurts amidst laughter people started telling stories about officers theyd known sam pitched in with some of his own inside he was smiling a book about leadership hed read had suggested that changing the subject was often the best way to defuse a nasty situation unlike some of the things hed read that really worked after supper he went back to studying and kept at it till lightsout george moerlein shook his head never reckoned you was one of those fellows with spectacles and a high forehead he said you want to get anywhere you got to work for it sam answered more than a little nettled anybody wants to stay in a rut thats his business but anybody who doesnt thats his business too or it damn well ought to be all right all right ill shut up moerlein said swear to jesus though i think youre doing this whole thing cause you want i should have to salute you oh no carsten said in a hoarse whisper my secrets out for a moment his bunkmate believed him then moerlein snorted and cursed and rolled over in his bunk and a couple of minutes later started to snore sam ran on coffee and cigarettes and very little sleep till the day of the examinations which were held in a hall not far from the rope walk the long stone building in which the navys great hemp cables were made commander grady slapped sam on the back as he left the remembrance just remember you can do it the gunnery officer said thank you sir sam said and if you please sir just remember this was your idea in the first place grady laughed sam hurried past him and down the gangplank sitting at a table in the examination hall waiting for the lieutenant commander at the front of the room to pass out the pile of test booklets on his desk sam looked around studying the competition he saw a roomful of petty officers not a whole lot different from himself only a few were younger than he several grizzled veterans had to be well past fifty he admired their persistence and hoped he would outscore them in spite of it then he stopped worrying about anything inessential for the officer started giving out the booklets men you will have four hours he said i wish you all the best of luck and i remind you that should you not pass the examination will be offered again in a years time ready begin how many times had some of those grizzled veterans walked into this hall or others like it that thought gave sam a different perspective on persistence he wondered if hed keep coming back after failing the examination half a dozen or a dozen times hoping he wouldnt have to find out he opened the booklet and plunged in the examination was as bad as hed feared it would be as bad as hed heard it would be as he worked he felt as if his brain were being sucked out of his head and down onto the paper by way of his pencil he couldnt imagine a human mind containing all the knowledge the navy department evidently expected its officers to have at their fingertips panic threatened to overwhelm him when he came upon the first question he couldnt even begin to answer well maybe these other bastards cant answer it either he thought that steadied him he couldnt do anything more than his best sweat soaked his dark uniform long before the examination ended it had nothing to do with the hall which was very little warmer than the boston december outside but he noticed he was far from the only man wiping his brow after what seemed like foreverand at the same time like only a few minutesthe lieutenant commander rapped out pencils down pass booklets to the left sam had been in the middle of a word that didnt matter nothing mattered any more he joined the weary shambling throng of sailors filing out of the hall theres always next year someone said in doleful tones carsten didnt argue with him nobody argued with him sam couldnt imagine anyone being confident hed passed that brutal examination he also couldnt imagine anyone showing confidence without getting lynched he didnt have any leave coming so he couldnt even get drunk after the miserable thing was over he had to return to the remembrance and return to duty when commander grady asked him how hed done he rolled his eyes grady laughed sam didnt see one thing funny about it day followed day gave way to coming up on ten years since the war started sam thought that seemed unbelievable but he knew it was true he wished ten years had gone by since the examination when results were slow in coming he did his best to forget hed ever taken the miserable thing theres always next year he thoughtexcept by now this was next year then one day the yeoman in charge of mail called out carsten and thrust an envelope at him he took it with some surprise he seldom got mail but sure enough the envelope had his name typed on it and department of the navy in the upper lefthand corner he stuck his thumb over that return address not wanting his buddies to know hed got news he expected to be bad he marched off down a corridor and opened the envelope where no one could watch him do it the letter inside bore his name and pay number on navy department stationery it read you are ordered to report to commissioning board at hours on wednesday february for the purpose of determining your fitness to hold a commission in the united states navy and sam had to read it twice before he realized what it meant jesus he whispered sweet suffering jesus i passed he had to remind himself that he wasnt home free yet everybody said commissioning boards did strange things in this particular case what everybody said was likely to be true standing there in the cramped corridor he refused to let what everybody said worry him in the least the worst had to be over for the simple reason that nothing could have been worse than that examination the worst was over and hed come through it he was on his way these days lucien galtier thought of himself as an accomplished driver he didnt say he was an accomplished driver though the one time hed done that georges had responded and what have you accomplished not killing anyone bravo monperer no matter how accomplished he reckoned himself georges to the contrary notwithstanding he wasnt planning on going anywhere today that he had a fine chevrolet mattered not at all he wouldnt have gone out on the fine paved road up to riviereduloup even in one of the us armys traveling fortswhy the americans called the infernal machines barrels hed never figured out the snowstorm howling down from the northwest made the trip from the farmhouse to the barn cold and hard let alone any longer journey when he got inside the livestock set up the usual infernal racket that meant where have you been were starving to death he ignored all the animals but the horse to it he said this is ingratitude would you sooner be out on the highway in such weather only another indignant snort answered him as he gave the beast oats for the day when it came to food the horse could bewaseloquent on any other subject galtier might as well have been talking to himself whenever he went traveling in the wagon he knew that hed known it all along it hadnt stopped him from having innumerable conversations with the horse over the years i cannot talk with the automobile he said truly i saw this from the moment i began to drive it it is only a machine although this i have seen does not keep marie from talking with her sewing machine from time to time the horse let drop a pile of greenbrown dung it was warmer in the barn than outside but the dung still steamed lucien wondered whether the horse was offering its opinion of driving a motorcar or of conversing with a sewing machine do you want to work old fool he asked the horse the only reply it gave was to gobble the oats he laughed no all you want to do is eat i cannot even get you a mare for your amusement oh i could but you would not be amused a gelding is not to be amused in that way n estcepas hed had the vet geld the horse when it was a yearling it had never known the joys not being gelded could bring it never would still he fancied it flicked its ear at him in a resentful way he nodded to himself had anyone done such a thing to him he would have been more than merely resentful life is hard he said even for an animal like yourself one that does little work these days life is hard believe me it is no easier for men and women most of them most of the time have very little and no hope for more than very little i get down on my knees and thank the lord for the bounty he has given me another ear flick might have said careful how you speak therelam apart of your bounty after all maybe the horse was exceptionally expressive today maybe galtiers imagination was working harder than usual truly i could have been unfortunate as easily as i have been fortunate galtier said the horse did not deny it galtier went on had i been unfortunate you would not be eating so well as you are now believe me you would not maybe the horse believed him maybe it didnt whether it did or not it knew it was eating well now that was what mattered how could a man reasonably expect a horse to care about mighthavebeens but lucien galtier cared consider he said i might have been driven to try to blow up an american general as was that anglophone farmer who blew himself up instead poor fool for i will not lie i had no love for the americans yes that could have been me had chance driven me in the other direction but i am here and i am as i am and so you have the chance to stand in your stall and get fat and lazy i wonder if that other farmer had a horse and how the unlucky animal is doing his own horse ate all he had given it and looked around for more which was not forthcoming it sent him a hopeful look rather like that of a beggar who sat in the street with a tin cup beside him galtier rarely gave beggars money as far as he was concerned men who could work should he did not insist that the horse work not any more but he knew better than to overfeed it after finishing in the barn he walked through the snow to the farmhouse the heat of the stove in the kitchen seemed a greater blessing than any bishop pascal could give as galtier stood close by it marie poured him a cup of steaming hot coffee she added a hefty dollop of cream and for good measure a slug of applejack too drink it before it gets cold she said in a tone that brooked no argument you should be warmed inside and out and before he could answer almostbut not quitebefore he could even think she added and do not say what is in your mind you dreadful brute of a man i after sipping the coffee which was delicious galtier said i declare to the world that you have wronged me so you do his wife replied you should remember though that declaring a thing does not make it true she was laughing at him he could hear it in her voice she was also laughing because of him a very different business he waggled a forefinger at her you are a very troublesome woman he said severely no doubt you have reason marie said and no doubt i have my reasons for being troublesome one of those reasons that comes straight to my mind is that i have a very troublesome husband me lucien shook his head by no means not at all he took another sip of fortified coffee how could i possibly be troublesome when i am holding here a cup of the elixir of life he put down the elixir of life so he could shrug out of his wool plaid coat it was not quite warm enough in the bitter cold outside but much too warm for standing by the stove for very long as lucien picked up the coffee cup again georges came into the kitchen lucien nodded to himself if i am troublesome it could be that i understand why how strange marie said i just now had this same thought at the same time men and women who have been married a long while do this they say how strange georges said i just now had the thought that i have been insulted and for once i do not even know why never fear son galtier said there are always reasons and they are usually good ones here theni will give you a reason georges said he left the kitchen and flicked the light switch on the way out the electric bulb in the lamp hanging from the ceiling went dark plunging the room into gloom scamp galtier called after him georges laughedhe was being troublesome all right muttering galtier went over and turned on the lamp again the kitchen shone as if hed brought the sun indoors truly electricity is a great marvel he said i wonder how we ever got along without it i cannot imagine marie said it makes everything so much easierand you were clever enough to squeeze it out of the government and the americans galtier said you must not forget the americans i am not likely to forget the americans his wifes voice was tart without the americans we would not have the soninlaw we now have nor the grandson either believe me i remember all this very well without the americans we would not be living in the republic of quebec galtier said looking at the large picture as well as the small one we would still be paying our taxes to ottawa and getting nothing for them instead of paying them to the city of quebec and getting nothing for them neither independence nor wealth reconciled him to paying taxes wealth indeed left him even less enthusiastic than he had been before for it meant he had to pay more than he had when he was not doing so well when the americans came we thought it was the end of the world marie said and we were right lucien answered it was the end of the world we had always known we have changed from a quebecois farmer that was blasphemy to rank alongside tabernac and calisse we have changed and we are better for it from a quebecois farmer that was blasphemy viler than any for which the local french dialect had words his wife started to contradict him he could tell by the way she opened her mouth by the angle at which her head turned by any number of other small things he could not have named but did see before she could speak he wagged a finger at heronly that and nothing more she hesitated at last she said peutetreit could be that was a greater concession than hed thought he could get from her hed been ready to argue instead all he had to say was we are lucky the whole family is lucky things could so easily be worse he thought again of the farmer out in manitoba whod tried to kill general custer god has been kind to us marie said yes god has been kind to us galtier agreed and we have been lucky andhe knew just how to forestall an argument almost as if hed read a book on the subjectthis is excellent truly excellent coffee could you fix me another cup exactly like this one his wife turned to take care of it galtier smiled behind her back hed had good luck and wherever he could hed made good luck and here he was in his middle years and happy he wondered how many of his neighbors could say that not many unless he missed his guess with an open smile and a word of thanks he took the cup from marie jake featherston tore open the fat package from the william byrd press dear mr featherston the letter inside read thank you for showing us the manuscript enclosed herewith we regret that we must doubt its commercial possibilities at the present time and must therefore regretfully decline to undertake its publication we hope you will have success in placing it elsewhere he cursed he couldnt place over open sights anywhere and a lot of the letters he got back from richmond publishers and even from one down in mobilewere a lot less polite than this one nobody wants to hear the truth he growled nothing you can do about it now jake ferdinand koenig said slapping him on the back in consolation come on lets get out of here stupid bastards featherston snarled and theyre proud of it damn them they want to stay stupid but he was glad to escape the freedom party offices even to him they stank of defeat when he went out onto the streets of richmond he could have pulled the brim of his hat down low on his forehead or tugged up his collar so it hid part of his face he could have grown a chin beard or bushy side whiskers to change his looks he didnt he hadnt he wouldnt as always he met the world headon the world was less fond of him than it had been before grady calkins murdered wade hampton v about every other person on the street recognized him and about every third person who did recognize him showered him with abuse he gave as good as he got very often better koenig shook his head while jake and a passerby exchanged unpleasantries after the man finally went on his way koenig said christ sometimes i think you look for trouble no such thing featherston shook his head but ill be goddamned if ill run from it either after the damnyankee artillery fools with big mouths arent enough to put me off my feed i still think you ought to lay low till it gets closer to the next election let people forget about things koenig said he was one of the very few people these days who spoke frankly to jake instead of telling him what they thought he wanted to hear that made him a valuable man all the same jake shook his head again no dammit i didnt do anything im ashamed of the party didnt do anything im ashamed of one crazy man went and fouled things up for us thats all people need to forget about calkins not about me they didnt forget last november koenig pointed out we knew that was going to happen featherston said all right it happened it could have been a lot worse a lot of people reckoned it would be a lot worse you know what you sound like koenig said you sound like the war department in the last part of the first part of when the damnyankees had started hammering us hard we hurt the enemy very badly and contained him more quickly than expected theyd say and all that meant was wed lost some more ground featherston grunted comparing him to the department he hated hit home stubbornly he said the freedom partys going to get the ground back though the war department never did figure out how to manage that one if you say so sarge ferdinand koenig replied he didnt sound like a man who believed it he sounded like a man humoring a rich lunaticand he made sure featherston knew he sounded that way we can come back jake insisted as long as he believed it he could make other people believe it if enough other people believed it it would come true he and koenig turned right from seventh onto franklin and walked on toward capitol square jakes hands folded into fists after the war was lostthrown away he thoughtdischarged soldiers had almost taken the capitol only more soldiers with machine guns had held them at bay a good bloodbath then would have been just what the csa needed and in hed come so close to storming his way into power in spite of everything the whigs and all their thirds and fourths and fifths could do to stop him sure as hell he would have been elected in he knew he would have beenif not for grady calkins if even he was thinking about what might have been instead of what would be nowif that was so the freedom party was in deep trouble a man with a limpwounded veteran jake judgedcame toward him along franklin jake nodded to himhe still had plenty of backers left especially among men whod fought like him freedom the fellow said by way of reply but he loaded the word with loathing and made an obscene gesture at jake you go to hell featherston cried if i do ill see you there before me the man with the limp answered and went on his way bastard jake muttered on his breath fucking bastard theyre all fucking bastards then he saw a crowd on the sidewalk ahead and forgot about the heckler what the hells going on here ferd damned if i know koenig answered shall we find out yeah jake elbowed his way to the front of the crowd ably assisted by his former running mate hed expected a saloon giving away free beer or something of that sort instead men and women were trying to shove their way into a furniture store he couldnt believe it till ferdinand koenig pointed to the sign taped in the window newest makes of wireless receivers from theyre all the go nowadays koenig said even at those prices everybody wants one ive heard people talking about them featherston admitted havent heard one myself i dont think ill be damned if i can see what the fuss is about ive listened to em koenig said itsinteresting not like anything else youll ever run across ill tell you that huh but having got so close to the stores doorway featherston decided not to leave without listening to a wireless receiver more judicious elbowing got him and koenig inside the receivers were all big and boxy some cabinets were made of fancier wood than others that seemed to account for the difference in price only one machine was actually operating from it came tinny noises that after a bit jake recognized as a negro band playing in the good old summertime huh he said again and turned to the fellow who was touting the receivers why would anybody want to listen to this crap for gods sake soon sir there will be offerings for every taste the salesman answered smoothly even now people all over richmond are listening to this and other broadcasts as more people buy receivers the number of broadcasts and the number of listeners will naturally increase not if they keep playing that garbage ferdinand koenig said he nodded to featherston you were rightthis is lousy yeah but jake had listened to the salesman too all over richmond you say yes sir the rabbitylooking fellow nodded enthusiastically and the price of receivers has fallen dramatically in the past few months it will probably keep right on falling too as they become more popular people all over richmond jake repeated thoughtfully could you have people all over the csa listening to the same thing at the same time to his disappointment the salesman replied not from the same broadcasting facility but the fellow went on i suppose you could send the same signal from several facilities at once why if i might ask plainly he didnt recognize featherston just curious jake answeredand indeed it was hardly more than that behind his hand he whispered to koenig might be cheaper to make a speech on the wireless than hold a bunch of rallies in a bunch of different towns if we could be sure we were reaching enough people that way one of the other customers in the shop was whispering behind his hand to the salesman oh the salesman said he is by the tone of voice jake knew exactly what the customer had whispered the salesman said sir i am going to have to ask you to leave this is a highclass establishment and i dont want any trouble here we werent giving you any trouble featherston and koenig spoke together youre from the freedom party said the customer whod recognized jake you dont have to give trouble you are trouble several other men from among those crowding the shop drifted toward the fellow a couple of others ranged themselves behind featherston freedom one of them said i am going to call for a policeman if you dont leave the salesman told jake i do not want this place broken apart if breaking the place apart would have brought the party good publicity featherston would have started a fight on the spot but he knew it wouldntjust the opposite in fact the papers would scream he was only a ruffian leading a pack of ruffians they hadnt talked about him and the party like that when he was a rising power in the land or not so much anyhow now they thought they scented blood he wouldnt give them any blood to sniff come on ferd he said if anybody starts trouble it wont be us look at the cowards cut and run jeered the man whod recognized him they talk big but they dont back it up he never knew how close he came to getting his head broken and his nuts kneed jakes instinct was always to hit back at whoever and whatever struck at him and to hit harder if he could only a harsh understanding that that would bring no advantage held him back one day he growled once he and ferdinand koenig were out on franklin again one fine day im going to pay back every son of a bitch who ever did me wrong and that loudmouthed bastard will get his so help me god he will sure sarge koenig said but he didnt sound sure he sounded like a man buttering up his boss after said boss had come out with something really stupid featherston knew flattery when he heard it because he heard it too damn often he hadnt heard it much from koenig though sourly he studied the man whod run for vice president with him he and koenig went back to the old days together to the days when the freedom party operated out of a cigar box if koenig hadnt backed him odds were the party would still be a cigarbox outfit koenig was as close to a friend as he had on the face of the earth and yet if you dont fancy the way things are going ferd you can always move on jake said dont want you to feel like youre wearing a ball and chain koenig turned red i dont want to leave jake ive come too far to back out now same as you only only what featherston snapped only moses got to the top of the mountain but god never let him into the promised land koenig said going redder still way things are these days i dont know how we can win an election any time soon we sure as hell wont if people lie down and give up jake said long as we dont quit long as we keep fighting things will turn our way sooner or later itll take longer now than i reckoned it would in id be a liar if i said anything different but the time is coming by god it is koenig grunted again the sound failed to fill featherston with confidence if even the man closest to him had doubts who was he to be sure triumph did lie ahead he shrugged hed kept firing against the damnyankees up to the very last minute he would struggle against fate the same way there ahead lay capitol square with its great statues of george washington and albert sidney johnston pointing jake said look at em ferd if washington had given up wed still belong to england and johnston died so the confederate states could be free how can we do anything else and still look at ourselves in the mirror afterwards i dont know koenig said but you dont see people building statues to whatshisnamecornwallisor to general grant the yankee who licked johnston damned if i know what happened to cornwallis grant died a drunk they were both big wheels in their day sarge and well be big wheels in ours jake understood what koenig was saying but wouldnt admit it even to himself admitting it would mean he might also have to admit he wasnt sure whether hed end up among the winners or the losers when the history books got written he couldnt bear that thought hope youre right koenig said hell yes im right jake spoke with great assurance to convince not only his follower but also himself ferdinand koenig nodded if he wasnt convinced featherston couldnt prove it not from a nod and what about you jake asked himself hed beenthe freedom party had beenthat close to seizing power with both hands now with wade hampton dead with the confederate currency sound again he kicked at the sidewalk the party should have gone forward again in instead he counted himself lucky damn lucky it hadnt gone further back could things turn around of course they couldthat was the wrong question how likely were they to turn around coldly as if in a poker game he reckoned up the odds had he been in a poker game he would have thrown in his cards but the stakes here were too high for him to quit itll work out he said goddammit it will work out he did his best to sound as if he meant it read on for an excerpt from american empire the center cannot hold by harry turtledove lieutenant colonel abner dowling strode into the offices of the us army general staff in philadelphia escaping the january snow outside he was a big beefy manunkind people of whom hed met altogether too many would have called him fatand walked with a determination that made other younger officers get out of his way even though his greengray uniform bore not a trace of the goldandblack ribbon that marked a general staff man he looked around with more than a little curiosity he hadnt been in general staff headquarters for many yearsnot since before the great war in fact hed spent the past ten years as adjutant to general george armstrong custer and custers relationship with the general staff had always been combustible was the first word that came to mind the first printable word anyhow but custer was retired nowretired at last after more than sixty years of service in the armyand dowling needed a new assignment wonder what they give me what ever it is its bound to be a walk in the park after what ive gone through with custer anything this side of standing sentry on the battlements of hell would have seemed a walk in the park after ten years with custer the man was unquestionably a hero dowling would have been the first to admit it nevertheless he tried not to think of custer which was like trying not to think of a red fish then he got lostgeneral staff headquarters had expanded a great deal since his last visit having to ask his way did take his mind off his former superior at last by turning left down a corridor where he had turned right he made his way to the office of general hunter liggett chief of the general staff liggetts adjutant was a sharplooking lieutenant colonel named john abell when dowling walked into the office the fellow was talking on the telephone the best we can with the budget the socialists are willing to let us have he looked up and put his hand over the mouthpiece yes lieutenant colonel may i help you im abner dowling i have a ten oclock appointment with general liggett by the clock on the wall it was still a couple of minutes before ten dowling had built in time for things to go wrong custer never did anything like that custer never figured anything would go wrong dowling shook his head dont think about custer lieutenant colonel abell nodded go right in hes expecting you he returned to his interrupted telephone conversation i know what we should be doing and i know what we are doing there will be trouble one day but theyre too sure of themselves to believe it however much dowling wanted to linger and eavesdrop he went on into general liggetts inner office and closed the door behind him saluting he said reporting as ordered sir hunter liggett returned the salute he was a jowly man in his midsixties with a penetrating stare and a white kaiser bill mustache waxed to pointed perfection at ease lieutenant colonel sit down make yourself comfortable thank you sir dowling eased his bulk down into a chair what are we going to do with you liggett said it had to be a rhetorical question the answer surely already lay there on his desk he went on youve seen a lot these past few years havent you by now i suspect you could handle just about anything couldnt you lieutenant colonel dowling didnt like the sound of that i hope so sir he answered cautiously maybe he wouldnt get a walk in the park after all ahh what have you got in mind everyone is very pleased with your performance in canada general liggett said the assistant secretary of war mr thomas spoke highly of you in his report to president sinclair he wrote that you did your best to make a difficult and unpleasant situation go more smoothly any time a soldier wins praise from the present administration he must have done very well indeed thank you sir dowling remembered that liggett had become chief of the general staff during the present socialist administration replacing general leonard wood that made him watch his tongue im glad mr thomas was pleased i didnt really do that much mostly i just sat there and kept my mouth shut n mattoon thomas had come up to winnipeg to force general custer into retirement custer hadnt wanted to go custer never wanted to do anything anyone told him to do and he thoroughly despised the socialists but theyd held the high cards and he hadnt well what ever you did say mr thomas liked it liggett said he wrote of your tact and your discretion and your good sensesaid if you were a diplomat instead of a soldier youd make a splendid ambassador liggett chuckled damn me to hell if youre not blushing im flattered sir dowling was also embarrassed like a lot of fat men he flushed easily and he knew it general liggett went on and it just so happens that we have a post where a man with such talents would be very usefill very useful indeed does it do you dowling said and liggett gave him a genial nod dowling had a fair notion of where such a post might be hoping he was wrong he asked what have you got in mind sir sure enough liggett said ive had to relieve colonel sorenson as military governor of salt lake city hes an able officer sorenson is dont get me wrong but he turned out to be a little too unbending for the position by president sinclairs orders we are trying to bring utah back towards being a normal state in the union once more a tactful diplomatic officer running things in salt lake could do us a lot of good there i see dowling said slowly the only trouble is sir im not sure i think utah ought to be a normal state in the union once more the mormons in utah had caused trouble during the second mexican war back at the start of the sas a result of which the us army had landed on them with both feet then in perhaps aided and abetted by the confederates and the british from canada theyd risen in open rebellion the army had had to crush them one town at a time and had made a peace only in the tacitean sense of the word leaving desert behind it between you and me and the four walls of my office lieutenant colonel im not sure i think so either liggett answered but the army doesnt make policy thats the presidents job all we do is carry it out and so would you like to be the next military governor of salt lake city maybe i should have been a nasty son of a bitch when i was working for custer dowling thought but he said what he had to say yes sir after a moment he added if im being diplomatic yes liggett asked well sir wouldnt you say the good people of salt lake city might see it as an insult to them if a full colonel were replaced by a lieutenant colonel dowling said couldnt it lead them to believe the united states army finds them less important than it once did amusement glinted in liggetts eyes and how do you propose to make sure the good people of salt lake cityif there are anydont find themselves insulted i can think of a couple of ways sir dowling replied one would be to appoint somebody whos already a bird colonel as military governor there yes that stands to reason liggett agreed and the other he leaned back in his swivel chair which squeaked he seemed to be enjoying himself waiting to hear what dowling would say dowling had hoped the chief of the general staff would come out and say it for him when liggett didnt he had to speak for himself the other way sir would be to promote me to the appropriate rank and you think you deserve such a promotion eh liggett rumbled yes sir dowling said boldly after ten years with custer i deserve to be a major general by god and if he said no he knew hed never be promoted again general liggett shuffled through papers on his desk finding the one he wanted he shoved it face down across the polished expanse of mahogany to dowppling this may be of some interest to you then thank you dowling said wondering if he ought to thank liggett he turned the paper over glanced at itand stared at his superior thank you very much sir he exclaimed youre welcome colonel dowling liggett replied congratulations thank you very much dowling repeated uh sir would you have given me this if i hadnt asked for it liggetts smile was as mysterious as the mona lisas though a good deal less benign youll never know will you his chuckle was not a pleasant sound he found another sheet of paper and passed it to dowling too here are your orders colonel your train goes out of broad street station tomorrow morning im sure youll do a fine job and i know for a fact that general pershing is looking forward to having you under his command do you all of a sudden dowlings world seemed less rosy during the war pershings second army had fought side by side with custers first in kentucky and tennessee the two armies had been rivals as neighbors often are and their two commanders had been rivals too custer was suspicious of his younger colleague as he was suspicious of any other officer who might steal his glory dowling had forgotten pershing was military governor of utah these days i think i know whats bothering you colonel liggett said if anyone knew about rivalries the chief of the general staff would be the man he went on you dont have to worry not on that score i meant what i said general pershing is eager to have you but what will he do with meto meonce hes got me dowling wondered he couldnt say that all he could say was thats good to hear sir which means you dont believe me liggett said well thats your privilege you may even be right i dont think you are but you may be dowling was by nature a pessimist if he hadnt been before ten years under general custer would have made him one ill do the best i can sir thats all he said and what ever pershing does to me by god ill have eagles on my shoulder straps that makes up for a lot general liggett nodded as long as you do that no one can ask any more of you all right sir dowling started to rise then checked himself may i ask you one more thing sir its got nothing to do with mormons go ahead and ask liggett told him i dont promise to answer not till ive heard the question i understand what i want to know is are we really cutting back on building new and better barrels ive heard that but it strikes me as foolish like most professional soldiers dowling had no use for the socialist party there as in few other places he agreed with the man under whom hed served for so long he would have expressed himself a lot more strongly had he been talking with general leonard wood a lifelong democrat and a friend of expresident theodore roosevelt but liggett nodded again and didnt sound happy as he answered we arent just cutting back as a matter of fact were gutting the program no money in the budget any more that outfit at fort leavenworth called the barrel works he slashed a thumb across his throat as our german friends would say kaputt thatsunfortunate sir dowling used the politest word he could barrels won us the last war they wont count less in the next one dont be silly colonel therell never ever be another war just ask president sinclair hes still a soldier first then dowling thought good both men laughed but for the bitter undertone in each ones voice the joke might have been funny anne colleton was studying the wall street journal when the telephone rang she muttered something under her breath put down the fivedayold newspaper and went to answer the phone back in the days when shed lived on the marshlands plantation her butler scipio or one of the other negro servants would have done that for her and spared her the interruption these days though the marshlands mansion was a burntout ruin the cotton fields around it going back to grass and bushes anne lived in town not that st matthews south carolina was much of a town this is anne colleton she said crisply she was in her midthirties with her sleek blond good looks she could have lied ten years off her age with no one the wisertill she spoke few people younger than shefew her own age for that matter but even fewer youngercould have so quickly made plain they put up with no nonsense at all and a good day to you miss colleton replied the man on the other end of the line by the hisses and pops accompanying his voice he was calling from some distance away he went on my name is edward cl wiggins maam and im in richmond long distance sure enough anne thoughthe sounded as if he were shouting down a rain barrel what is it mr wiggins she said i dont think weve met no maam i havent had the pleasure he agreed but the colleton name is famous all over the confederate states he doubtless meant that as pleasant flattery anne colleton had heard enough pleasant flattery to last the rest of her life by the time she was sixteenone consequence of her looks men seldom thought about you can come to the point mr wiggins she said pleasantly or ill hang up on you no matter where you are once upon a time president semmes sent me up to philadelphia to see if i could dicker a peace with the yankees but they wouldnt do it wiggins said that wasnt coming to the point or anne didnt think it was but it did get her attention this would have been fairly early on before we finally had to quit she asked thats right maam he said i heard rumors about that she said with all the money i gave the whigs in those days i would have thought i deserved to hear something more than rumors but evidently not so you were representing president semmes were you yes maam in an unofficial sort of way and whose representative are you now in an unofficial sort of way im sure youre somebodys edward cl wiggins chuckled i heard you were one clever lady i guess i heard right who told you so anne asked sharply well now i was just getting to that i anne did hang up then she wasted not a minute getting back to work with her finances in the state they were they needed all the time she could give them they needed more than that too they needed something close to a miracle she wasnt a pauper as so many prewar planters were these days but she wasnt rich enough not to have to worry either and she didnt know if she ever would be a few minutes later the phone rang again anne picked it up why mr wiggins what a pleasant surprise she said before whoever was on the other end of the line could speak if it wasnt wiggins she would have to apologize to someone but she thought the odds were good enough to take the chance and it was miss colleton if you would let me explain myself she cut him off though she didntquitehang up on him once more i gave you two chances to do that you didnt if you think im in the habit of wasting my time on strange men who call me out of the blue youre mistakenand whoever told you what you think you know about me hasnt got the faintest notion of what hes talking about oh i dont know wiggins voice was dry he told me you were sharp as a tack but a firstclass bitch and that doesnt seem so far out to me im sure he meant it as an insult but ill take it for a compliment anne said last chance mr wigginswho told you that jake featherston anne had expected almost any other name than that of the freedom party leader something she didnt want to call alarm shot through her she took jake featherston very seriously that didnt mean she wanted anything to do with him shed backed him for a while yes but she backed winners and he didnt look like one any more trying to gain time to recover her composure she asked if you used to work for the whigs why are you calling me for featherston now on account of what i saw when i went to philadelphia maam he replied the united states dont respect you when youre weak if youre down theyll kick you but if youre strong they have got to sit up and take notice thats a fact i agree with that i think everyone in the confederate states agrees with that anne said well there you are wiggins said cheerily if you agree with that the freedom party is really and truly the only place for you because nonsense anne didnt care about his reasons she had reasons of her own the freedom party has about as much chance of electing the next president as i do of getting elected myself i have no intention of giving jake featherston one more dime ever since that madman of a grady calkins murdered president hampton itd take a special miracle for anyone from the freedom party to get himself elected dog catcher let alone anything more i dont spend my money where it does me no good i dont think the clouds are as black as you say maam wiggins replied yes we lost a couple of seats in the election last november but not as many as people said we would well be backyou wait and see if we arent folks dont have much in the way of memoryand besides maam were right if you cant win an election whether youre right or not doesnt matter anne pointed out we will wiggins sounded confident she got the idea he sounded confident all the time he went on i want to say a couple of other things and then im through first one is mr featherston he knows whos for him and he knows whos against him and he never ever forgets the one or the other he was without question right about that featherston was as relentless as a barrel smashing through one line of trenches after another anne didnt intimidate easily but jake featherston had done the job that just gave her more reason to harden her voice and say ill take my chances edward cl wiggins chuckled he told me you were near as stubborn as he is himself and i see hes right one more thing and then im through and i wont trouble you any more go ahead anne said make it short ive already wasted more than enough time on you yes maam heres what ive got to say theres only one party in the csa thats got any notion at all about what the devil to do about the nigger problem in this country and thats the freedom party and now im done goodbye he surprised her by hanging up slowly she put the mouthpiece back on its hook and set down the telephone she said a word she was unlikely to use in public one that would have made strong men gasp and women of delicate sensibilities blush and faint wiggins had known how to get through to her after all no one was likely to forget the red negro uprising that had tied the confederacy in knots late in and early in no one knew how much it had helped the usa win the war but it couldnt have hurt the freedom party stood foursquare for vengeance and so did anne colleton and why not she thought one brother dead my plantation wrecked me almost murdered oh yes i owe those black bastards just a little the whole country owes them just a little whether the whigs and the radical liberals want to admit it or not she repeated that word louder this time behind her her surviving brother burst out laughing she whirled around confound it tom she said angrily i didnt know you were there tom colleton laughed harder than ever ill bet you didnt he answered if you had you would have said something like confound it instead he was a couple of years younger than anne and a little darker with hair light brown rather than gold hed gone into the war an irresponsible boy and come out of it a lieutenantcolonel and a man something of which anne still had to remind herself now and again she shrugged now i probably would have but i meant what i did say who was on the telephone he asked a man named edward cl wiggins anne replied he wanted money from us for the freedom party tom frowned those people dont take no for an answer do they they never have anne said its their greatest strength and their greatest weakness did you find out why he travels with a herd of initials her brother asked she shook her head tom went on what did you tell him no of course anne answered the way things are now id sooner cozy up to a cottonmouth than to jake featherston dont blame you a bit tom colleton said hes an impressive man in a lot of ways but he shook his head he puts me in mind of a time bomb wound up and waiting to go off and when he does i dont think itll be pretty there were times when i thought he had all the answers anne said and there were times when i thought he was a little bit crazy and there were times when i thought both those things at once those were the ones that scared me scared me too tom agreed and we dont scare easy no wed be dead by now if we did anne said and tom nodded she eyed him and speaking of looking pretty youre fancier than you need to be for staying around here is that a necktie she thought its gaudy stripes of crimson and gold excessive but declined to criticize her brother nodded again sure is bought it from whatshisname the jew tailor and im going to pay a call on bertha talmadge in a little while before the war anne would have discouraged such a call with a bludgeon if necessary the muncies berthas parents were grocers and their daughter no fit match for a planters son these days well grocers never starved and bertha talmadge though a widow whose husband like so many others had died in the trenches was reasonably young reasonably pretty reasonably bright anne nodded approval have a nice time you should find yourself a wife settle down have yourself some children he didnt get angry at her as he would have before the war in fact he nodded again himself youre right i should and as a matter of fact so should you thats different anne said quickly how because he was her brother she told him because my husband would want to try to run everything because thats what men do and odds are he wouldnt be as good at it as i am thats why and even if he was you wouldnt admit it tom said that was also true anne colleton however had not the slightest intention of admitting it giving her brother her most enigmatic smile she went back to the wall street journal mary mcgregor was only thirteen years old but her course in life was already set so she told herself anyhow and also told her mother and her older sister as they sat down to supper on their farm outside rosenfeld manitoba the yankees killed my brother they killed my father too but im going to get even you see if i dont fright showed on her mothers careworn face maude mcgregor touched the sleeve of her woolen blouse to show mary she still wore mourning black you be careful she said if anything happened to you after alexander and arthur i dont think i could bear it she didnt tell mary not to pursue vengeance against the americans occupying canada plainly she knew better that would have been telling the sun not to rise the snow not to fall ever since the americans arrested her older brother during the war on a charge of sabotage lined him up against a wall and shot him shed hated them with an altogether unchildlike ferocity of course ill be careful she said now as if she were the adult and her mother the worried fussy child pa was careful he just wasnt lucky at the end he should have got that blamed general custer however much she hated americans she wasnt allowed to curse at the supper table her older sister nodded who would have thought custer would be waiting for father to throw that bomb and be ready to throw it back julia said that was bad luck nothing else but she sighed she hadnt only lost her father arthur mcgregors failure had also cost her an engagement the culligans had decided it just wasnt safe to join their son ted to a bombers family part of it was their mother said mary would you please pass the butter mayhem and manners lived together under the mcgregors roof here you are ma mary said and her mother buttered her mashed potatoes mary went on what do you mean part of it was bad luck it all was her mother shook her head no only part the americans suspected your father they came sniffing around here all the time remember if they hadnt suspected custer wouldnt have been ready to to do what he did what hed done by throwing the bomb back had blown arthur mcgregor to red rags the family could have buried him in a jam tin no one still alive wanted to think about that ill be careful mary said again she brushed a wisp of auburn hair back from her face in a gesture her mother might have made maude mcgregor had reddish hair too julia was darker as her father had been maude mcgregor said i just thank god youre only thirteen and not likely to get into too much mischief for a while you know the yankees will keep an eye on us forever on account of what the menfolks in our family did alexander never did anything mary said hotly they thought he did and that was all that mattered to them her mother answered your father never would have done any of the things he did if that hadnt happenedand wed all be here together she stared down at the heavy white earthenware plate in front of her im sorry mother seeing her mother unhappy could still tear mary to pieces inside but she wasted little time amending that im sorry i made you unhappy she wasnt sorry she wanted revenge on the americans nothing could make her sorry about that weve been through too much i dont want us to have to go through any more her mother said maude mcgregor quickly brought her napkin up to her face pretending to wipe her mouth she dabbed at her eyes instead she tried not to let her children catch her crying sometimes try as she would she failed mary said canadas been through too much there isnt even a canada any more thats what the americans say anyhow if they say it loud enough and often enough lots of people will start believing it but i wont i wont either julia said i quit the schools when they started teaching american lies but youre rightplenty of people are still going and plenty of them will believe what ever they hear what can we do about it weve got to do something mary exclaimed though she didnt know what her mother got up from the table what ever we do we wont do it now what we will do now is wash the dishes and get ready for bed well have a lot of work tomorrow and its not any easier because she shook her head its not any easier thats all its not any easier because we havent got any menfolk left alive to help us that was what shed started to say that or something like it and things would only get harder when winter of turned to spring and they would have to try to put a crop in the ground by themselves like any farm daughter mary had worked since she could stand on her own two feet the idea didnt worry her having to do mens work as well as womens how could the three of them manage without wearing down to nubs she didnt know that either she only knew they had to try my father kept trying and he made the yankees pay i will too somehow julia washed dishes and silverware and scrubbed pots till her hands turned red mary dried things and put them away yesterday theyd done it the other way round tomorrow they would again after the last plate went where it belonged mary took a candle upstairs she used it to light the kerosene lamp in her room the americans had started talking about bringing electricity out from the towns to the countryside but all theyd done so far was talk more lies she thought she changed out of her shirtwaist and sweater and skirt into a long wool flannel nightgown with thick wool blankets and a down comforter on the bed she didnt fear even a manitoba winterand if that wasnt courage what was before she lay down she knelt beside the bed and prayed and keep mother safe and healthy and keep julia safe and healthy and help me pay the americans back she whispered as she did every night please god i know you can do it if you try god could do anything she believed that with all her heart getting him to do itthat was a different and harder business when marys head did hit the pillow she fell asleep as if clubbed she woke the next morning in exactly the same position as when shed gone to sleep maybe shed shifted back into it during the night maybe she hadnt had the energy to roll over once she crawled out of bed the aromas of tea and frying eggs and potatoes floating up to the bedroom from the kitchen helped get her moving she put on the same skirt and sweater with a different shirtwaist and hurried downstairs good her mother said when she made her appearance another five minutes and idve sent julia after you here you are she used a spatula to lift a couple of eggs from the skillet and set them on marys plate potatoes fried in lard went alongside them thanks ma mary put salt on the eggs and potatoes and pepper on the eggs she ate like a wolf her mother gave her a thick china mug full of tea mary poured in milk from a pitcher and added a couple of spoonsful of sugar she drank the tea as hot as she could bear it julia was already on her second cup how do the americans stand drinking coffee all the time she wondered aloud its so nasty its disgusting mary said she honestly believed she would have thought that even if the yankees hadnt done what theyd done shed tried coffee a couple of times and found it astonishingly bitter to her surprise her mother said coffees not so bad oh i like tea better but coffees not so bad itll pry your eyes open even better than tea will and thats nice of a morning hearing maude mcgregor defending something mary thought of as american and therefore automatically corrupt rocked her she didnt quarrel though she had no time to quarrel as soon as she finished breakfast she put on rubbers and an overcoat that had belonged to alexander it was much too big for her even though she nearly matched her mothers height but that didnt matter along with earmuffs and mittens it would keep her warm while she did the chores im going out to the barn she said her older sister shut the door behind her instead of heading straight to the barn mary paused at the outhouse first it didnt stink the way it did in warmer weather but she would almost rather have sat down on a pincushion than on those cold planks she got out of there as fast as she could several motorcars were coming up the road from the us border toward rosenfeld the snow that scrunched under marys rubbers sprayed up from their tires they were all painted greengray which marked them as us army machines hope something horrible happens to you mary thought but the motorcars cared nothing for her curses they just kept rolling north the railroad line ran to the west of the farm coal smoke spewing from the stack a train rumbled past the shriek of the whistle far off in the distance seemed the loneliest sound in the world the train was probably full of yankees too more and more these days the yankees were tying the canadian railroads to their own damn them mary mouthed and went into the barn it was warmer there the body heat of the horse and the cow and the sheep and the pigs and she supposed even the chickens helped keep it that way and the work she had to do certainly kept her warm she gathered eggs and fed the animals and shoveled manure that would go on the fields and the vegetable plots when warmer weather came again as she worked she looked around somewhere in here her father had made the bombs that did the americans so much harm before one of them killed him us soldiers had torn the farmhouse and the barn to pieces looking for his tools and fuses and explosives they hadnt found them of course they didnt find them mary thought my father was cleverer than a hundred yankees put together he just wasn t lucky with general custer thats all she picked up the basket of eggs which shed set on an old broken wagon wheel that had been sitting in the barn as long as she could rememberand probably a lot longer than that she sighed she didnt want to go back out into the cold even to take the eggs back to the farmhouse idly she wondered why her father had never repaired and used the wheeleither that or got a few cents for the iron on the tire and the hub he hadnt been a man to waste much if i had the tools if i knew how would i make bombs and keep fighting the americans mary nodded without a moments hesitation despite the thought that followed hard on the heels of the other if they caught you they d shoot you more than most children her age she knew and understood how very permanent death was losing alexander and her father had agonizingly driven home that lesson i dont care she said as if someone had said she did it would be worth it we have to hit back we have to one of these days ill learn how it wont take so long either i promise it wont father she picked up the basket of eggs from the old wagon wheel and however little she wanted to went back out into winter
